		<shortDescription>Guilty pleasure? No way! I like it and I don't feel guilty!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can you NOT like this film? It's very absurdity makes it an instant classic. What absurdity you ask? Well how about the fact that when the sheriff (George Douglas) and Jess the butler (Ken Terrell) enter the giant's space ship everything is scaled to our size? How about the fact that when the giant (Mike Ross) picks up the sheriff's car it's a station wagon, when he throws it to the ground it's a sedan, and when the sheriff checks the wreckage it's a station wagon again? Or maybe the fact that Alison Hayes height seems to vary from scene to scene; sometimes she's a mere 18 feet tall and in others she is much larger. Did I, or should I?, mention that you can see right through both giants in almost every scene?And when she reaches through the roof of the bar to pick up her philandering husband (William Hudson, who also went face-to-ankle with THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN a year earlier) why didn't they cut the scene before you saw the doll Alison was picking up had no legs? Should I even mention the fact that this movie is set in California and the deputy (Frank Chase) has a Boston accent ("Hi ya Mistah Ahhhhcha!")?You can spot Ken Terrell doing stunts in most of the Republic serials during the 40's. Roy Gordon (Dr. Cushing) appeared in THE WASP WOMAN in 1959, Yvette Vickers (Honey Parker) had a run-in with giant bloodsuckers in ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES. And Alison Hayes . . .ah, she was my dream girl when I was growing up.Let the sourpusses deride this film, I think it's great fun. Don't waste your time with the remake, THIS is the one to catch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Haaaarrrryyy!" The amplified, dispassionate female voice could have been Leona Helmseley in heat but, no, it belongs to Allison Hayes as Nancy Archer, the 50-Foot Woman of the title. In the most infamous role of her film career, Allison's performance literally rips off the roof. In fact, make that a couple of roofs.Jaw-droppingly tacky, "Aot50FW" is the tale of Nancy, a neurotic, boozy heiress and her loveless Lothario husband, Harry (William Hudson, who also co-starred opposite The Amazing Colossal Man). Nancy has a close encounter of the third kind, in the desert, with a bald giant from outer space who wears a mini-skirt and gladiator sandals, and who has a thing for Nancy's jewelry. What he does to her once he's carried her off is probably best left a mystery, but soon Nancy starts to grow.Treading into the center of town on tranquilizers, tightly wrapped in nothing but the bed sheets, the buxom giantess heads toward the low-rent saloon where Harry is having a few laughs with a floozy named Honey (Yvette Vickers). The confrontation turns ugly.The Poverty Row f/x make the alien giant and Nancy appear to be transparent due to incompetently transposed images. You'll understand why director Nathan Juran changed his name to Nathan Hertz on the credits. Juran was no stranger to directing giant creatures, human and non, having also directed "The Deadly Mantis," "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad," "Jack, the Giant Killer" plus several episodes of TV's "World of Giants" and "Land of the Giants." A lot of laughs for all the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Bad, It's Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This campy 1950s sci-fi film has turned into a real cult classic. The film is so bad - horrible special effects and terrible dialog - that it is a hoot to watch. It's so terrible it's fun to watch. Instead of scary you, the corny dialog just makes you laugh out loud.I forget whether this film was made to be serious but at this point, it's like an Ed Wood film: so terrible that you laugh through the entire thing, making it a good comedy. As a bonus for guys, you get to ogle Allison Hayes, who looks good at any height! I am amazed this movie is not available on DVD. If it wasn't well-known, they certainly wouldn't have bothered with a re-make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hooray for "B" Movies!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have got to love this outlandish movie. Allison Hayes is really over the top (in more ways than one) as she goes after Harry who is out cavorting with Yvette Vickers in the local bar. The special effects are the usual 1950's superimposed see through images that you've come to love in cheesy movies (see the Amazing Colossal Man). The foam rubber hand that crushes the life out of Harry is really bad...it just kind of flops around, flaccid and dead looking but it does the trick....I hope Harry isn't latex intolerant! This is a lot of fun and is one of the gems of the genre. If you hear someone calling "Harry, Harry", run for your life...the foam rubber hand is after you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie, regardless of all of the campy errors and mistakes, i can watch this over and over again. Allison Hayes delivers some of the most incredible picture stills. When she is breaking out from the roof of her house, her beauty mark just says hey. Her face as she is looking through the window at the hotel, and even when she is walking behind the electricity tower before getting shot down are just gorgeous.So it was campy, it's the 50's, technology was not as advanced as today but to re-make this movie with Darryl Hannah was a mistake.This "Cult Classic" should be put on DVD (hint, hint) and digitally enhanced, try to fix the mistakes, if possible and re-issue this movie. Trust me it has a following, also the main score gives the movie the scary touch.I heard the score in another sci-fi movie, recognized it immediately but the effect was not the same.Someone mentioned the poster, which i have and i had it matted; it looks incredible and its a conversation piece.Someone put this on DVD! Allison Hayes and this Movie Rocks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Trouble With Harry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when a wealthy woman meets a giant opaque alien and his satellite in the desert. Why she ends up becoming a 50 foot woman bent on fixing her marriage with her adulterous husband! Great 50's hokum here! Lovely Allison Hayes plays a woman who has recently been checked out of a sanitorium and has major drinking/marriage problems. Her husband Harry is the scum of the earth as he flirts(and beyond) with beautiful Honey(Vickers). Both of them want Allison's money, all 50 million of it. The story is pretty ambiguous, and we really never do know just who or what that alien was all about. The best part is seeing just how low and sleazy Harry is, so we can wait to see him get his. The acting is pretty good, nothing great. The direction by Nathan Juran is adequate(nothing like what you would see in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad!). The special effects are fairly standard as we really never see Allison Hayes as a fully-materialized giant. She always seems to be a bit transparent for some reason except when we see her giant hand. Hayes looks great as a giant though in her skimpy shorts and bikini top, giving at least two great reasons to see the film...or is that three? Great 50's sci-fi fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sexiest giant in the world!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about Allison Hayes that hasn't been said before. The way she upsets a town, fills out a bed sheet, terrorizes a philandering husband... all these things make her bigger than life... whoops, too late. "Attack" is a great if under-appreciated movie that deserves more for the way that it strengthens women for what they are and not for what they should be, and for serving as a lesson for other idiots who don't respect their wives. Allison Hayes actually opens the way for more female horror antagonists of which there are so few: Angela from the "Night of the Demons" trilogy maybe the only one other off the top off my head I can think of right now. Allison Hayes being in this movie, which is most definitely the pinnacle of giantess movie next to "The Thirty Foot Bride of Candy Rock" and "Dude, Where's My Car," creates such a powerful presence in the movie that numerous guys like myself have become proverbially addicted to giant women pictures. Because of AOT50FW, there are now whole websites dedicated to posting pictures of beautiful actresses on giantess simulations; unfortunately, the majority of these sites are actually distasteful and extremely sexually explicit. Yet, regardless of the odd lunatic out there, fans still praise this movie even with all of its flaws. The special effects are crummy and the plot is ridiculous, but yet, it captures the spirit and the fear of the Atomic Age prevalent in movies of the Fifties. It truly deserves to be remade today. I just can't count the horrible Darryl Hannah version; Fifty-Foot Woman should be remade again as an apology to that horrible farce. In the Eighties, Victoria Principal, Markie Post or Emma Samms would have been more than capable of giving the title role justice, but now, either Kate Winslet or Reese Witherspoon could possibly give a remake the justice it deserves. Till then, if you can buy this original on video or DVD, keep it; it's a collector's item of one of the best movies to have come out of the Fifties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1950's bombshell actress in a bikini made out of bed sheets!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you have a hankering to see a gigantic 1950's bombshell actress rampaging through a city? How about a "flying satellite" with a 30ft alien inside? Do you need some truly terrible acting, directing, dialog and special effects to make your day complete? Then one of the most legendary bad movies of all times, Attack of the 50ft Woman (1958), directed by Nathan Hertz (Nathan Juran) is just the movie you are looking for.Wealthy heiress Nancy Archer (Allison Hayes) has a lot of money but she also has a lot of problems. For one thing, despite being a very beautiful woman, the inheritor of a 50 million dollar financial empire and owner of one of the world's largest diamonds she just can't seem to keep a man. Her husband Harry (William Hudson) likes the money and all of the trappings that come with it, he just doesn't happen to like his wife. He prefers to keep the company of local hussy Honey Parker (Yvette Vickers) while Mrs. Archer stays at home pining for her philandering husband and hitting the bottle like there is no tomorrow. In addition to her drinking problem she also spent some time in the "booby hatch", so it comes as very little surprise when absolutely no one will believe her when she begins telling people that she was accosted out on a deserted highway by a giant alien with his own "flying satellite" (UFO). Yes, the whole town is talking about nutty Mrs. Archer, especially Mr. Archer; all that he and Honey can talk about is shoving her right back into the nuthouse so they can have all that money for themselves. But Nancy isn't ready for the asylum, not just yet anyway. First she makes her husband drive them all over the desert trying to find her alien admirer. After a full day of driving and nearly at the point of giving up Nancy finally does stumble across her strange visitor again. It seems that Nancy's boyfriend from outer space needs that extra large diamond of hers to power his ship (which coincidently happens to look like a light bulb with silver spray paint on it). Nancy is not worried about her diamond though, she is ecstatic because now there is proof that she's not crazy! Harry on the other hand has the more typical reaction when facing a giant monstrous alien from another world, he starts shooting at it and when that doesn't work he takes off running leaving his wife in the monster's clutches. Back in town Harry gets Honey packing and they get ready to get out of town, but fast. But not fast enough before the local sheriff (George Douglas) has them brought in for questioning about the now missing Mrs. Archer. Back at the Archer estate Nancy is found unconscious (with strange radioactive marks on her neck) on top of the pool house! Sedated and kept under the watchful eye of her personal physician Nancy begins growing, but when she occasionally does regain consciousness there is only one thought in her ever enlarging cranium, she wants her Harry! Meanwhile, good old Harry does what any dutiful husband would do when their wife is at home, unconscious and growing to the size of King Kong, he makes plans to kill her in her sleep! But before he can do the deed his plans are ruined and he slithers back to town (and Honey). It would seem that you need a lot of sedatives to keep a 50-foot woman down so it is not long before Mrs. Archer is back on her feet again and looking for that cheating husband of hers. She tears her way out of the house (now only wearing a bikini-like outfit made out of bed sheets) heading for town and looking for Harry and his hussy girlfriend who are at the local bar having a grand old time. She's tired of his cheating ways and wants him all to herself, and now that she is 10 times his size, maybe, just maybe he'll pay attention to what she wants.There have been volumes written about this classically bad movie so there isn't much more that I can add. I'll just say that if you enjoy bad films, laughably bad films you are going to like this one for sure. Allison Hayes as Nancy Archer is the very best part of this film. Watching her chew up the scenery makes for a very enjoyable 66 minutes of your time. To be honest it's really hard to tell if she was a bad actress or just got stuck in a really awful film. Since even the greatest actress in the world would look rather talentless in this production you can't really hold it against her. From her other work that I have seen I believe that she did indeed have some acting talent and obviously she was a beautiful woman with definite screen presence. It's a shame that Hollywood didn't give her a real chance to show her talents, unfortunately most of her other films are of a similar quality to this production. All of the other actors seem to fit their parts well, especially William Hudson as her slimy, cheating hubby and Yvette Vickers who seems perfectly cast as Harry's conniving, bohemian mistress. Director Nathan Juran seemed to be a hit or miss kind of guy, directing several very good films as well as some really bad ones. It's hard to believe that he directed the wonderful fantasy adventure The 7th Voyage of Sinbad the very same year that he made this. Attack of the 50ft woman - one of the worst (and funniest) of all times!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under appreciated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie for so many reasons,mostly for the fact that the heroine is such a breakaway from the embarrassingly weak women stereotype.Allison Hayes was the only woman who could give this film justice,but history's treatment of it is a fatal blow.How her character became a giant could have been done any other way,but thankfully they avoided the radioactive poisoning cliche.The special effects could have been better,though.She looks like an ordinary woman on a dollhouse set [in the long shots,she's transparent!].To suggest she was a giant,they could have used more underneath shots,after all,everyone would be looking up,not straight at her.Otherwise,this is a great film for any guy or girl to share and comment with to their significant other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this movie is not going to be amongst the Top Hundred listed on the American Film Institute's "greatest" list, but it's the perfect example of a so -called "bad" film that's still wildly entertaining and good fun. Of all the notorious 1950s cheese flicks, this one takes the cake and is not to be passed over, whether you love such offbeat craziness or even if you don't. A good time is guaranteed for all (whatever your cinematic tastes and values).Nancy Archer (the curvy Allison Hayes) is a wealthy alcoholic housewife considered the town weirdo, and she cements that reputation one night when she cries that she's just seen a satellite in the sky that supposedly come down to Earth and then swears she's had an encounter with a king-sized bald-headed giant living inside. Her rotten-to-the-core and cheating husband Harry (the perfectly-cast William Hudson) spends all his nights at the local bar blatantly smooching with sexy floozy Honey Parker (Yvette Vickers), and the flirtatious pair would love to take all of Nancy's money and be rid of her. When he learns of his wife's nutty alien story, Harry figures it's the perfect chance to send her off to the booby hatch once and for all, but he gets more than he bargains for.At only 65 minutes, this story moves comfortably quick and there's not an ounce of dead meat to be had. Considering the absurd storyline, director Nathan Hertz (Nathan Juran) manages to get some mileage out of it anyway. Some of the all-time very worst "special" effects are on display in this cult classic, and have to be seen to be believed (the over-sized gigantic feminine "hand" is an absolute laugh riot!). Even in this present day and age of "state of the art" CGI effects, there is something eternally entertaining and lovable about these low budgeted cardboard props and cheapo transparent blow-up renderings of the giants walking around the streets. This was a favorite on New York television in the early '70s, and no kid who grew up with it can ever forget it. Be a kid again, or be one for the first time, and give this a shot for a lark. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wife Is Hotter Than The Mistress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's true, we're all wondering how a 50 foot woman can fit in a bedroom, even a big bedroom that is 20' by 20'. But we shouldn't quibble, for obviously the tall girl had her knees bent. Let's get down to cases. I'm not worried about Nancy seeing satellites, or my favorite line in the film, beautifully delivered by the deputy when he's ordered by the sheriff to fire his gun at the towering, vengeful female, "I CAN'T SHOOT A LADY!"What I really want to know is why nobody that has commented on this film, from the experts to the fans, has wondered aloud why philandering Harry Archer prefers a slim blond in Honey Parker, to his rich, sultry, curvy, gorgeous wife, Nancy. Allison Hayes is so sexy, so leggy, and so hot in her black dresses and black high heels that Yvette Vickers looks like a pale, washed out blond in comparison. Yes, Yvette Vickers is pretty, but she's not a former Miss America contestant with the raw sex appeal that Allison Hayes has. In conclusion sci-fi fans, when I watch this movie its because I get to see Allison Hayes walk around a lot in tight dresses, and to see all that leg and cleavage she shows while walking through the countryside and when she's busy demolishing the roof of that seedy little bar and grill where Harry &amp; Honey hang out.For those who get the latest DVD for this film with the commentary by Tom Weaver and Yvette Vickers, be advised that the whole commentary is a showcase for Vickers career. They spend about two minutes total talking about Allison Hayes, which I found infuriating.Meanwhile, let me get back to looking at this movie one more time, so I can see my favorite, dark-haired bombshell, Allison Hayes, swing those hips and strut her stuff while she knocks down another drink and twirls that 'Star of India' diamond around her graceful fingers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully ridiculous 50's low-budget sci-fi camp classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rich recovering alcoholic Nancy Archer (a marvelously fierce performance by the gorgeously statuesque Allison Hayes) transforms into an angry and lethal roaring behemoth after she has a run-in with a giant bald alien (leering chromedome Michael Ross). Nancy breaks free from her chains and goes looking for both her faithless no-count dirtbag husband Harry (a perfectly slimy William Hudson) and his sexy floozy mistress Honey Parker (a deliciously naughty portrayal by the yummy Yvette Vickers). Competently directed by Nathan Hertz (who amazingly enough also helmed the magnificent "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad" around the same time!), with a blithely silly script by Mark Hanna (who also wrote Roger Corman's fantastic "Not of This Earth"), a nonstop brisk pace, stark black and white cinematography by Jacques R. Marquette, hilariously hokey (far from) special effects (the tacky back screen projection is absolutely sidesplitting; ditto the cheesy big rubbery hand), a tight 65 minute running time, a fabulously brassy overwrought orchestral score by prolific 50's B-flick composer Ronald Stein, a simply astounding last reel mondo destructo rampage (Hayes looks incredibly sexy clad in her bed sheet bikini!), and admirably sincere acting from a game cast that includes Roy Gordon as the kindly Dr. Isaac Cushing, Ken Terrell as loyal butler Jess Stout, George Douglas as the stalwart Sheriff Dubbitt, Otto Waldis as wise Dr. Heinrich Von Loeb, and Frank Chase as amiable goofball Deputy Charlie, this legendary cult item totally deserves its sterling status as a positively gut-busting kitsch gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as memorable as the poster, but still lots of campy fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" is now a legend in 50s camp, if only for its near iconic poster. The image on the poster has subtly entered pop culture lore. The film itself is pretty hilarious also. Like any good b-movie, no matter how bad it becomes on a technical scale, its never boring and certainly gives the audience what it wants.The melodramatic and preposterous screenplay (coupled with some truly over-the-top acting) is the main source for the camp appeal. Yvette Vickers gives a decent performance (shes gained a small cult following for her work in this and "Attack of the Giant Leeches"), but Allison Hayes and William Hudson are fitfully lousy. Frank Chase gives memorable support as the deputy Charlie (I'm still trying to figure out if this character is meant as comic relief or not). The direction by Nathan Juran keeps everything at a brisk pace, and the brief running time ensures this'll never really begin to lag. The special effects also make Bert Gordon look like Ray Harryhausen.By the way, those claiming this is some kind of feminist message film (there are a few out there who interpret as such) are only kidding themselves. This is hilarious and over-the-top atomic-age kitsch, nothing more, nothing less. (5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rich socialite Nancy Archer encounters an alien UFO with a giant while driving on a desolate road. Her husband Harry Archer is cheating on her with Honey Parker. None of the cops believe her but they still have to investigate because of her wealth and power. Some suggests that she should go back to the sanitarium. She drags Harry out to search for the UFO. The giant takes her while Harry gets away. He tries to run away with Honey but the sheriff is suspicious of the missing Nancy Archer. They find her and put her away into the sanitarium. There she grows to be a giant 50 foot woman.This is more notable for the poster art and the amazingly cheesy title. There isn't anything quite like it. Others come close like 'Snakes on a Plane' or 'Sharknado' or 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes', but this one has the best title of them all. As a movie, this is strictly B-movie horror material. The special effects are almost laughable from the terribly fake giant hands to the badly done optical effects of the giants. The acting is kind of interesting. These actors are trying so hard and taking it so seriously. Sometime they overact, but they never let the silliness of it all take over. It's safe to say that this is a classic bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's unfair! Unfair I say - Turner Classics starts off it's prime time line-up tonight with "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" and follows up with "Village of the Giants", "Queen of Outer Space" and "Mars Needs Women". When am I supposed to get some sleep? This just ain't right.Well this is one flick I've been waiting to come around for a long while. Not having seen it before, I've always been intrigued by the theatrical poster and the enticement of seeing a giant woman in scant attire. The film however only partially satisfies, there's just not enough of it! The rampage barely gets going with Allison Hayes on the attack in the final minutes and then it's all over in an anti-climactic showdown with the authorities. Bummer.The goofiest part of this whole thing was the dizzying sense of proportion throughout the picture relative to the size of the Fifty Foot Woman. I mean that hand, just hanging there in the Archer house took up the whole bedroom, how could the rest of her fit in there? Don't try to think about it too much, it will make your head hurt.But boy, I just love this stuff. Alien space ships, diamond powered orbs, a giant beach ball in the middle of the desert, and an heiress to millions (fifty to be exact, hey that's a million per foot!). And Yvette Vickers looking sexier than in any other flick I've seen her in. Except maybe "Attack of the Giant Leeches" in 1959. Hey, that's two 'Attack' pictures within a year - now there's a twin bill at the drive-in I'd go to see any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very enjoyable movie for those who are fans of the genre (B-movies with giant monsters) and probably would provide some laughs to those unfamiliar with these types of movies as well. There are many giant monster films and even some notable giant man films ("Amazing Collossol Man", "Dr. Cyclops") but this was the earliest I've seen with a Giantess. It has some of the deliberately campy appeal of "Village of the Giants" from a few years later. I truly doubt that this film was designed to ever really scare people except maybe small children. The point of films like "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" is to excite children and amuse adults, then as well as now.And actually the grown-up men might find more to get "excited" about in this sci-fi film than in most thanks to spunky Yvette Vickers (nice lady, I've met her a few times at conventions) as a young vamp and Allison Hayes as the titular curvaceous Giantess. Hayes was never better as far as I know than she was in this one (although I do recommend her work in the solid femme-Western "Gunfighter"). She does OK with the earlier bits where she's a boozy neurotic who saw a "satellite" (this film amusingly uses that early name for the UFOs) with a giant bald man who tried to steal her diamond necklace, and she does really well once she becomes a Giantess and hits the road in search of her errant hubby. Hubby is played by William Hudson with some measure of panache ? he really makes you loathe him for his cheating ways and his thoughtless, selfish attitude towards the wife. The other remarkable performance in this film is the comic relief offered by Frank Chase as Deputy Charlie. Yes this type of character is pretty ordinary but for some reason, a combination of the way he was written and the way the actor played him, he seemed distinctive and interesting. I like how much of a toady he was portrayed as being and that made it so much fun when he finally had to get tough with the husband towards the end. The actor played it with an air of desperation that enhanced the comic possibilities.Not much else to say about this one. The director Nathan Hertz is apparently a pseudonym for Nathan Juran, experienced Columbia director of Randolph Scott and Ronald Reagan Westerns who is best known for directing several of the most notable Harryhausen/Schneer productions in the late 50s and early 60s including the beloved "Seventh Voyage of Sinbad." To compare "Sinbad" or "Jason and the Argonauts" to this film is fruitless because Juran is not an "auteur" in the modern sense of the word and had little input in the subject matter of his films. He's good at getting competent performances out of average actors, and that ability does come in handy for a project like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has to be one of my all time favorite bad movies. I used to watch it often as kid on w York City's WPIX Channel 11's Chiller Theater. The special effects(ha!) are dreadful, the dialog laughable, the acting non-existent, but I still loved it! Sultry knockout Allison Hayes wasn't a terrific actress, but she sure looked good! As a kid I remember thinking that her husband HARRY! was a big dope. Why would he want that pinch-faced blonde, when he had gorgeous, sexy and stacked Nancy to come home to every night? What a moron. Finally available on DVD after many years (Warner Bros. has distributed it but I was hoping for a better restoration--oh well)....it's still a pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Next to Citizen Kane, this is my favorite movie. It has all the elements a film could have. It has a man doing the most stereotypical drunk, a group of hick sheriffs, a couple bimbos, and a transparent woman who ranges from 8 feet in height to about 75 feet, depending on where the camera is. When she was transformed, she also became quite single minded in her pursuit of her errant hubby. She began to speak in three or four word phrases which were directed by her monomania. As large woman films go, this has to be a classic. I first saw this film when I was in high school. Some local TV guy hosted a show where we got to see these kinds of films. Bless his heart. This was a time of great fun and just plain awful stuff, but it was so much fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Attack of the 50 Foot Woman' is unfairly burdened with many a 'worse film ever made' tag, but, despite the dodgy special effects, it manages to have a few positive aspects. It may well be the feminist message which runs throughout the film which has caused male critics to pour scorn over the whole concern.Hayes plays the title character, Nancy, a millionairess suffering from mental stress bought on by her philandering husband and full-time sleazeball, Harry. She is protected from self-destruction by her loyal butler ( a relationship similar to the one in 'Sunset Blvd' ), but her husbands influence is too strong as he tries to get her hospitalised, so he can lavish her fortune on his mistress.A strange glowing meteor in the area houses a weird giant (the plot clearly doesn't bear close scrutiny) and after coming into contact with him, Nancy starts to grow also. She increases to giant proportions and, clad in a bikini, breaks out of hospital and wanders off to town to find her husband.Despite the glaringly obvious shortcomings, there is a strong message here and the the film doesn't deserve the scorn which is heaped upon it. It also has one of the classic posters of the 1950's, with Hayes straddling a freeway picking up cars - not surprisingly this scene doesn't actually feature but it makes for a great image.</fullReview>

Now fifty feet tall, she wreaks destruction all over town looking for her unfaithful husband and his floozy (Yvette Vickers). So much fun. Busty beauty Allison Hayes' theatrics are a hoot to watch ("Why did I take you back? Why? WHY?!?"). I love a lot of her work and this is the highlight of her B career. Everybody rags on this movie but it's one of my favorite B movies. Normally I don't rate up for movies like this but some movies are just so enjoyable, even if it's for what some consider the wrong reasons, that I feel I have to. With everything else I take into account when rating a movie, entertainment value is at the top of my list. This one is undeniably entertaining. Full of unintentionally hilarious lines, cheesy effects, and campy performances. One of the all-time 'so bad it's good' classics. Oh, and one of the best movie posters from the '50s.

All of the lead roles were quite good, and there were a fair amount of intentional laughs, especially deputy Charlie, an early version of Barney.They see these humongous footprints. "Who made those?"

		<fullReview>Nancy Archer (Allison Hayes) is a wealthy woman with a cheating husband. But that's really the least of her problems. One night while out in the desert, Nancy runs into a giant from outer space. She is found the next morning unconscious on top of her pool house. While under the care of her doctor, something strange begins to happen to Nancy. She begins to grow. In no time at all, Nancy is as big as the alien she ran into. And at 50' tall, there's nothing stopping her from putting a halt to her husband's cheating ways.How in the world can you watch Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman and not have a good time? I think some people take movies like this too seriously and are so busy analyzing the poor special effects, the cheap sets, the ridiculously large plot holes, the iffy acting, and the rest of what gives this movie its charm that they don't know how to sit back, relax, and just enjoy it. Is Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman good? Well, no, not in the traditional sense. But I've seen it at least a half a dozen times and it's never failed to entertain. If you enjoy campy 50s movies at all, this is one that's not to be missed. Still not convinced? Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman also features 50s B-movie icon Allison Hayes in a bed sheet bikini. That's reason enough to tune in!</fullReview>

This film DEFINES Classic Science Fiction Schlock , in a Good Way . Schlock in the sense that it Works , without being stupid and/or insulting.Nancy Fowler Archer(Allison Hayes), Super Rich bon vivant living in the west,presumably California, possesses the "Star of India " diamond, but also has a derelict husband Harry Archer(William Hudson), whose passion for his wife's money, his womanizing, and his addiction to the hard stuff defines him to the tee . Calabassas was the city in the script .Nancy, struggling for a sane life after a stay in a sanitarium, returns to her mansion, and unfaithful husband, only to fall prey, to a satellite from Outer Space on a lonely road. After running back to town, and meeting a somewhat skeptical crowd, the authorities assume that Nancy is relapsing. This opens an opportunity for Nancy's rival, Honey Parker(Yvette Vickers) , who Exudes Sex, Sex, Sex, to entice unfaithful Harry , to plot his wife's demise. This is Great Stuff .The crazy storyline is plot/character driven and it WORKS . Harry , is pitifully flawed.

		<shortDescription>Ataje De La Mujera De 15 Metros (Aviso : los spoileros es possible !)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My title is to emphasize that my recent interest in this film was triggered by seeing it on TeleMundo 13 months ago. I got more than I bargained for : a conversion to metric units, as well as a small Spanish lesson (I know much of the dialogue in this film by heart). For me, one of the scarier moments in this film, is not only the sight of the ugly nurse screaming when she sees that Nancy Archer has become a giant, as has been commented already, but the concurrent hissing exclamation from Dr. Cushing : "ASSSSSSSSSSStounding rate of growth !!!"One of the better working sequences of this film is when Jess, the butler, and Sheriff Dubbitt, venture into the spherical spacecraft (or is it a funhouse, with its hissing, dry ice vapor jets, and distorting transparent globes ?) and peer into said globes, which distort their faces into grotesque circular images, reminiscent of the head and face of the Martian leader in another cult classic film, the original "Invaders From Mars". Sheriff Dubbitt's ugly, over-intense, scrunched-up, thin-lipped "cross face" (that's the best I can describe what I mean)in close-up can be almost as frightening as the similar thin-lipped face of Paul Birch in "Not Of This Earth", or, more recently, the grim, bloodless thin-lipped face of Rich Cooper in "American Beauty" and "October Sky". Then, of course, the butler's and sheriff's sudden reaction of horror and surprise, maintained as they back out of the spacecraft the way they came .... to what ?We're kept in suspense a little while, then we're allowed to see it's a pale, glowing, transparent, bald, ugly, thirty-foot high, hairy-handed giant, in arm bracelets and Roman soldier under garb, with a bull on his back, who smashes their car, then leaves it to return to his craft, with an expression of disgust on his face, although he's just handled wet sticky turds of dog waste, or something equally unpleasant.There's also a bit of unease and sense of menace as the equally ugly Dr. Heinrich Van Loeb discusses the blue-green color around the scratches on Mrs. Archer's throat, and utters the dread word "radiation" : the "baddie" in so many of those 50's monster B flicks with Cold War-nuclear threat subtexts.I think it's been commented already that Yvette Vickers, who plays the slatternly mistress of Harry, Honey Parker, was Playboy's "Beat" Playmate of July 1959, photographed by Russ Meyer, of "Vixen" et al fame. I had the good fortune to tape this film off TNT's "Best Of The Worst", hosted by Penn and Teller, June 19-20 1993, and Penn has this issue of Playboy, and shows its centerfold to the camera, and, if you use your pause or slow VCR remote button, you can catch a glimpse of Ms. Vickers' derriere before Penn covers it. And that's all there is to see that's not PG, as Ms. Vickers is wearing a shirt in that centerfold shot. My wife has commented to me on Allison Hayes' resemblance to the pouty, dark, buxom Jane Russell, star of "The Outlaw", and other 1950's films. One can, of course, almost never write enough about such a cinematic anti-masterpiece, so I will end by saying that "Attack" is one of maybe twenty or so 50's B horror films I "grew up" watching on WPIX Chiller Theater, 1961-65. Others are the work of the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr. (himself the subject of a feature film) or of Richard E. Cunha, described in the program of NYC Film Forum's 1989 summer sci-fi and horror festival, as "the poor man's Ed Wood". How apt !That summer 1989 festival featured a Chiller Theater / Richard E. Cunha triple bill of "Frankenstein's Daughter", "She Demons", and "Giant From The Unknown." It is perhaps going too far to suggest that "Attack Of The Fifty Foot Woman" served as the inspiration for the latter 1990's film, "In The Company Of Men", even though the unfortunate Nancy Archer is abused and victimized, not only by her gigolo, gold-digger, husband-in-name-only, but also by the pale, ugly, bald etc. thirty-foot giant from outer space. She's treated somewhat better by Deputy Charlie (comic relief in the form of a poor man's Wally Cox : "I can't shoot a lady !) and Jess, her butler, who perhaps should have been her husband in the first place, as even suggested by Harry, her husband, but it's not enough to prevent the doom she eventually suffers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ideal Portrait of 1950s Angst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allison Hayes' biggest role (and only first-billed) casts her as former mental patient/heiress Nancy Archer who witness a satellite from which a 30-foot giant emerges. No one in the California desert town believes her, including her shifty husband Harry (William Hudson), who's two-timing with the luscious Honey Parker (Yvette Vickers). Nancy and Harry later re-visit the scene, find the alien who abducts her, but later leaves her at her mansion grounds, indecently exposed. Radiation causes her to grow to mammoth proportions with big desires, including trapping her cheating husband. The musical score by Ronald Stein is superb, both creepy and exciting. Some 1950s rock music interludes at the local bar are very good. Nathan Juran is a fine director, featuring great editing and extremely capable performances by the three leads, as well as interesting supporting characters. Other reviewers criticize the inadequate special effects, but that only adds to the charm and they did the best they could on a limited budget. They also mention Nancy destroys no buildings or kills others, but she's really only out to exact revenge on her man and his mistress. As in most of the sci-fi/horror pictures of the Cold War era, it's "run, duck, and cover" at the thrilling climax. Just a fun flick.</fullReview>

Her work in these regards complete, it seems somehow tragic to see the giantess killed in the final frame.

Check out the giant rubber hands to see what I mean. "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" still is fun to watch. The film pretty much plays out like any daytime soap opera. A man is married to a rich woman(Hayes) for money, not love. He is playing around with the local floozy(Vickers) and does nothing to hide this fact. His wife confronts an alien and turns into a giant. In an act of revenge, the husband and his mistress are killed along with the 50 foot woman. The directing is average, the acting a step below and the special effects......no comment.

Or maybe it was a tax write-off.Either way, "Attack" proves best for the viewer under the following circumstances: a) extreme intoxication, b) seen on a double-bill with any of those Jacqueline Suzanne movies (maybe "Once is Not Enough"?) or c) just a night when you feel insecure and the world around you is a little too perfect. Pop in "Attack" and you'll feel great, guaranteed!It's good for a laugh at the expense of the hokey script, the rubbery special FX and that four-eyed sheriff.

		<shortDescription>It's the Idea That Counts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is every philandering husband's worst nightmare?a 50-foot wife full of angry revenge. Could that subtext be what turned this clumsy Z-grade sci-fi into a cult favorite. Certainly, it's not the special effects. The two giants look more like flimsy apparitions than flesh and blood realities, and worse, move with all the dispatch of sleepwalking turtles. Really scary if you're a garden slug.Neither can it be the lame comedy relief from the deputy (Chase), who makes Barney Fife of Mayberry look like a brain surgeon. Nor is it the boilerplate scenes from a hundred other sci- fi specials of the time.No. I figure that what grips the popular imagination is the feminist subtext. After all, think of wife Nancy (Hayes) not as 50-feet tall, but as an ordinary sized woman, except she's got 50- feet of powerful rage against a no-good husband who she's been dependent on as in the movie. Now, one thing the film does really well is make you sympathize with the vulnerable wife. Those scenes of hubby (Hudson) cuddling with the trampy Honey (Vickers) are little gems of tacky love. The slinky Vickers is perfectly cast, lending real satisfaction to that 50-feet of slow-motion revenge. So maybe a lot of wives or will-be-wives seeing the movie feel?what's the word?oh yeah, "empowered". At the same time, guys may think it's the scariest movie ever made. Either way, the giant woman idea turns this Z-grade dreck into something memorable.</fullReview>

Nope. My first movie of 2011 is also my first cinematic mistake of the year.Far too much of the movie is spent on a normal sized woman (Allison Hayes) complaining and whining about her husband's infidelity with a local floozy, instead of on a 50 Foot Woman attacking things, as I was led to expect from the title. The whole thing is horribly boring up until the last ten or so minutes, which are mildly entertaining by virtue of how stupid it all is and how truly atrocious the special effects are (even by the standards of the 1950s). Seriously, once you see the "giant hand", you'll be regretting your decision to watch this, just like I did.There are tons of other campy or bad (in a good way) older movies to be found, don't waste your time with this one.</fullReview>

The contrast of regular life as opposed to being gigantic or microscopic gets your imagination working.The old movies didn't have the technology we have today but they were good at getting your own imagination involved.

		<fullReview>Nathan Juran's "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" is a film that's hard notto enjoy on a number of levels. Unlike his other, more respectablesci-fi/fantasy offerings of the 1950s ("20 Million Miles to Earth" and"7th Voyage of Sinbad"), "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" suffers from someof the worst special effects ever committed to celluloid. But that'sjust a small part of the fun. Allison Hayes (in the title role as the emotionally tortured Nancy) andYvette Vickers (as the sleazy, jealous Honey) deliver the bestperformances of their drive-in careers. The dialogue is strictlyfirst-draft, but all involved (including William Hudson as theadulterous Harry) deliver earnest, enthusiast performances. That is notto say that they can save this low-budget offering. Instead, theytransport what could have been a forgettable bit of nonsense into theuniverse of much-loved b-movie kitsch. The unintentional laughs rivalthose found in "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and "Robot Monster."As for the "special effects," the film suffers from the same cheapoptical process that caused "The Amazing Colossal Man" to turntransparent in his long shots. It appears to consist of double exposingthe film negative in the camera, thus freeing the producers from anyin-lab optical-printing expenses. (This double-exposure technique alsomakes the 50 Foot Woman appear about 12 feet tall during her attack.)The real star of the movie is a large inflatable hand which Mr. Hudsonis forced to wrap around himself in order to facilitate capture by hisrampaging wife.For all of it's faults "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" is certainly notthe best low-budget drive-in movie of the 1950s, but it is certainly oneof the most entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ATTACK OF THE 50 FT. WOMAN (1958) * (really ****) Allison Hayes, William Hudson, Yvette Vickers. Truly one of the worst 50's sci-fi flicks ever but the best of the worst: alcoholic heiress Nancy Archer discovers a UFO, tells her philandering hubby Harry only to be dismissed as a nut and after a close encounter becomes a force to be reckoned with! Laughable dialogue, horrendous special effects (check out the finale; what a cheat!) and just plain bad, but my favorite all-time worst cult movie. Best scene: bed-sheet bikini clad five-story high Hayes shaking a rag doll Harry: hypnotically funny. Oh the possibilities that might have been! Oh to climb Mount Hayes' peaks and enter her valleys :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good for a movie so terribly bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman as rich as she is insecure has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdowns, helped no doubt by a smooth-talking gigolo husband who openly cheats on her. Naturally nobody believes her when she claims to have been accosted by a giant man who stepped out of a giant satellite. Much to the delight of her husband, this could be the incident which finally puts her away for good. From the very opening scenes, with it's ludicrous news broadcast and ridiculous satellite encounter, you'll probably be convinced that the only redeeming value of this movie is that it is so bad that it is funny. Although not too far off the mark, this is most definitely not true.Unlike most movies of this genre, this is not really a sci-fi or a horror film, but actually a serious drama which intelligently incorporates a sci-fi scenario into the plot. It's not a good or even mediocre drama, but it will exceed your expectations if you weren't expecting any legitimate drama at all. The acting is surprisingly good for such a low budget effort and, most importantly, it is well edited and excellently paced. It is never boring and manages to generate more than a little interest in seeing what will come next. Nevertheless, this is still a movie strictly for those who can't pass up the chance to see a 1950s film with a title like "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"!</fullReview>

The acting is brilliant, especially Allison Hayes as the drunk Mrs. Archer and Yvette Vickers as the conniving mistress Honey. Many think this to be an early feminist film. I don't know about that, but this is very entertaining, one of my all-time favorite films. "Harry! Harry! I know where he is! He's with that woman!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN has two things going for it: Allison Hayes (do the math); she's definitely a stand-out in her bed-sheet bikini (IF that's what it is), even if she IS a tad "transparent" throughout most of the movie (those parts that actually FEATURE her, that is: she spends far too much time OFF screen, if you ask me). Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't her hair change color when she "blossomed?" Most of the movie's as gorgeous as the star, and the music is often Great; only the not-so-special effects tend toward Low End Laughs. Storywise, ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN is a Tragedy: the Heroine gets f---ed over by her sorry-a-- husband, then ends up dead. So much for Happy Endings...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** You can see right away that the smug and sure of himself when it comes to getting his way with the weaker sex Handsome Harry Archer, William Hudson, wasn't playing with a full deck in his shoddy treatment of his long suffering wife Nancy, Allison Hayes, whom he treated worse then garbage.Nancy had it all good looks a great body as well as $50,000,000.00 worth of her family's , the mega rich Fowlers, fortune with the Star of India Diamond thrown in. Still Harry knowing that Nancy would never leave him continued to mentally abuse her to the point where she has a serious nervous breakdown that lead her to hit the bottle and become a flaming and falling down on her face alcoholic! It's when Nancy was driving through the Southern California Desert one evening, after leaving Harry all by himself back in her mansion, that she spotted this giant UFO that looked like an hard boiled egg and the giant egg headed looking alien, played by Michael Ross who also plays Tony the bartender in the film, who was operating it that she finally went over the edge.With no one at all first believing Nancy her two timing husband Harry decided to drive her to the spot where she claimed she saw the UFO and alien in order to have her convinced that she's going off the deep end and be committed for life in a mental institution. As things were soon to turn out in the film Nancy was in fact telling the the God honest truth! Not only was the UFO and alien there but the man from outer space kidnapped Nancy who later was found on her mansion's rooftop suffering from radiation poisoning. Harry who at the time was having a hot and heavy affair with local bimbo Honey Parker, Yvette Vickers, now planned to shoot up the unconscious Nancy with an overdose of sleeping medication and put her both out of her misery, by killing her, and having him finally get his hand on her money so that he and Honey can happily live off it for the rest of their lives. What Handsome Harry never figured on was that somehow the alien by radiating her had got Nancy to grow literately overnight to an enormous size, a 50 foot woman, who in knowing what her husband Harry had been doing behind her back was now out to make him pay big time! Even if it ended up killing her by doing it!***SPOILERS*** Heart pounding final sequence as Nancy with barley enough clothes to cover her gigantic body heads out for Tony's Bar &amp; Grill tearing up everything in her way in order to get her hands on Harry who at the time is dancing drinking and smooching with Honey Parker. With Harry not knowing that his, and Honey's, time on screen was about to come to a sudden and shocking end by the time the night was over he never saw it coming until Nancy showed up, by ripping the joint apart, at Tony's place. With the roof crashing down on Honey Parker's head Nancy, who caused it to happen, finally gets her hand on the fleeing and terrified, in what she'll do to him, Harry who no matter how much he tries to sweet talk her finds himself now on a one way trip to the town's electricity tower to get himself zapped, together with Nancy, for all the suffering he cased his wife over the years. As Nancy's good friend and the Archer family doctor Dr. Issac Cushing, Roy Gordon, ironically said of her at the conclusion of the film: "She finally got Harry all to herself".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monsters from the Id. This Movie came Late in the 1950's Sci-Fi Cycle but it Contains Much of the Decades Angst and Subconsciously Displays a Rich Array of the Era's Fears and Uncomfortable Social Conventions.The Poster...Wonderfully Prolific Artist Reynold Brown Designed this Classic and it Contains an Ultra-Sexy, Larger than Life, Voluptuous Woman Straddling an Iconic Freeway and that Most Descriptive of Eisenhower Prosperity and Abundance, the Automobile.Pubescent Boys...Baby Boomers who Watched Allison Hayes in this Movie in the Back Seat of a Car at the Drive-In or Seated in a Balcony at the Local Movie-Theatre, or on TV, Certainly were made all Tingly by the Sight of this Sexy Woman in Revealing Cleavage and Skin Tight Clam-Diggers. That Definitely Contributed to the Pleasurable Memories and Added to the Cult Fever for the Film.Flying Saucers...Here for some Unknown Reason were Called Satellites (the Sputnik fear), and the Term is Spoken Many Times as if to Shout it to the World. The Most Eerie Part Takes Place inside the Sphere Transposing Low-Budget Corrugated Cardboard, Goldfish Bowls, and Fog into a Surreal Scene. It Includes Diamonds as Fuel for The Flying Saucer and are there as Reminder (probably unintentionally) of the Decades Opulence.Radiation...Another Movie where that Unleashed Cancer Causer Transfigured a Benign Creature into a Monster.Female Bondage (Housewives and a Woman's place)...Although Unintentional, it Manifested an Underlying Feminine Fear of Subjugation and Restriction. The 50 Foot Woman is Literally put in Chains and Doped Up.Overall, a Movie that Reaches Things on such a Subconscious Level can't Help but be Remembered, Embraced, Nervously Laughed At, Ridiculed, Loved and Hated. But the Lasting Legacy of the Film Really says More about Ourselves than the Movie's Competence or Lack Thereof.Besides All of that Mumbo-Jumbo, the Movie is Hoot.</fullReview>

Indeed, I just recently re-watched it and once again had a truly super time with 'B' favourite Allison Hayes doing her over-the-top womanly thing. More flawed than a politician's justifications for past misdeeds, it does nevertheless possess a chilling music score coupled with some neat black and white cinematography. Indeed, Hayes is almost pre-transformation believable when not being undercut by the ridiculous dialogue.

		<fullReview>By the time future baby-boomer classic "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" (the lack of a hyphen in the title is annoying) was released in May 1958, moviegoers in theatres and drive-ins across the U.S. had already been exposed to all sorts of radiation-induced terrors. Jump-started by the prehistoric rhedosaurus unleashed by atomic testing in 1952's "The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms," the trend was soon followed by another prehistoric, radioactive nightmare, "Gojira," and then the real onslaught began: giant ants in "Them!," a giant octopus in "It Came From Beneath the Sea," a giant arachnid in "Tarantula," more giant insects in "Beginning of the End," "The Deadly Mantis" and "The Black Scorpion," giant mollusks in "The Monster That Challenged the World" and on and on. "The Incredible Shrinking Man," in April '57, told what might be the first tale of radioactivity's mutating effect on a human being, followed up, six months later, by a film that went in the opposite direction, "The Amazing Colossal Man." "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" can be seen as a distaff version of that latter film. Produced on the cheap for only $88,000, the film surprised everyone by being a tremendous hit, returning $480,000 at the box office. Both reviled as a "camp classic bomb" and beloved as a hugely entertaining boomer piece of nostalgia, the film is very much a product of its time. This viewer had not seen "Attack..." in over 40 years (it used to be shown very often on NYC TV's "Chiller Theatre" in the early to mid-'60s; indeed, several scenes from the film were part of "Chiller"'s chilling intro), and I was amazed at how much I remembered from it, and how many scenes seem to have made an indelible impression (such as that homely, screaming nurse, and a car being lifted by a giant, furry hand). This is most assuredly a film that, once seen, can never be forgotten.In it, cult actress Allison Hayes plays Nancy Archer, a millionairess who lives in a small California town with her philandering hubby, Harry (William Hudson, who had also starred in "The Amazing Colossal Man"). Distraught after seeing a globular flying saucer and its "30-foot-tall," bald-headed alien crewman in the desert one night, Nancy's lot is made even worse when no one will believe her, and when Harry and his paramour, bar floozy Honey Parker (cult actress Yvette Vickers), conspire to have her reinstitutionalized. And then things get even more dire for Nancy, when, after another run-in with the giant alien, she starts to grow at an alarming rate....It is hard to defend so silly a motion picture as this one, but darn it, "Attack..." DOES have many fine qualities going for it, and is not nearly as campy as one would expect. The acting across the board is uniformly fine, especially by the three leads; Nathan Juran's (listed here as "Nathan Hertz," for some strange reason; his other "psychotronic" credits include "20 Million Miles to Earth," "The Brain From Planet Arous," "The Deadly Mantis," "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad" and "First Men in the Moon") direction is effective and often decidedly imaginative; the photography by (executive producer) Jacques Marquette is moody and sometimes noirish; Mark Hanna's screenplay is often intelligent--it surprisingly makes mention of "filaria" and "pituitary fossa"--not to mention concise and amusing (he had also scripted "The Amazing Colossal Man"); and Ronald Stein's music is occasionally eerie and gripping. And while the lousy FX utilized in the film--that ridiculous giant-hand construct; those poorly done, see-through matte shots--could certainly have been bettered, they yet still have a certain endearing charm that the 1993 TV remake (featuring Daryl Hannah) and 1995 spoof "Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold" could not match. Though it might have been nice to have seen Nancy going on a longer rampage than the brief, somnolent walk through town that the film gives us (the original script DID feature a lengthier rampage sequence), what we DO get is still mighty fun. Sadly, the two cult actresses in the film (Hayes' other beloved films include "Zombies of Mora Tau," "The Unearthly" and "The Crawling Hand," while Vickers, of course, would go on to star in another classic "Attack" picture the following year: "Attack of the Giant Leeches") share virtually no screen time together, up until the time Nancy literally tears the roof off the dump in the film's unforgettable climactic scene. And as for poor Harry, seeing this film as an adult only reinforces the notion of what an incredible schmuck the man is. Not only is his millionaire wife a dishier babe than his mistress, but also more honest, decent and loving, too. Thus, one can truly enjoy seeing Harry get his just deserts from this woman scorned; how modern-day feminists must love seeing this empowered gal give it back in spades to the man who had wronged her!As for the Warner Bros. DVD that I just caught "Attack..." on, it features a very nice-looking print, and with a wonderful "extra": commentary by film historian Tom Weaver and Vickers herself, recorded in 2007, four years before the actress' mummified remains were found in her Benedict Canyon home, in April 2011. Weaver comes off here as supremely knowledgeable about "B movies" and Vickers, 79 here, as absolutely charming, with a ready laugh and a surprisingly good memory. She reveals that the clothes she wore as Honey Parker were her own, that the actor who played the giant alien (Michael Ross) also played the bartender Tony in the film, that she was dating actor Ralph Meeker at the time, and many other interesting tidbits. A wonderful "extra" for a truly entertaining film....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great camp classics of all time, Attack Of The 50 Foot Woman has a special place in the hearts of all those who love bad science fiction. But even bad science fiction is always made palatable by a little sex.Allison Hayes is breathtaking in the starring role, she's quite an eyeful in normal proportions. Hayes plays a dipsomaniac heiress stuck in a bad marriage with a no account rat played by William Hudson who has Yvette Vickers on the side. Hayes is fresh from the sanitarium where she's gone for a cure.Given that background her report of a large satellite and an encounter with a big giant emerging from said satellite is greeted with skepticism. But Hudson sees her ravings as a way of getting out of the marriage with a large settlement one way or another.But Allison will not be denied. When she through encounter with the giant's radioactivity grows to his size, it's look out world for a 50 foot woman scorned.I'm sure Allied Artists made a pile of drive-in money off this one. And Allison Hayes got a career role out of it as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, the 1950s. The era when sci-fi flicks depicted people either growing or shrinking. Nathan Juran's "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" is a prime example. The hilariously terrible acting creates more than its share of charm. My favorite scene is when Allison Hayes jiggles the electrical pole and makes the lights flicker.So, it's just plain fun. After all, we watch these movies to laugh at them. "Mystery Science Theater 3000" would have had a field day with this movie.

		<shortDescription>Silly movie, baffling technical misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about this film? It's pointless to say "it's bad", it's "Attac of the 50-Foot Woman", come on. So, the positives first: The film has a fairly refreshing vein of cynicism through the entire enterprise. Uh...hmm. Well, some of their jokes that I think were deliberate did make me laugh in a groaner sort of way, and really, any film about a person getting TALL is always fun, right? Of course, she doesn't GET tall until nearly the end of the film's meager 66-minute running time. Much of the film features people sitting around, talking, killing time, before the final, when the giant woman finally makes her appearance, and owes pretty much its entire climax to "King Kong", all screaming women and smashing hands through windows, to the point that I was amazed that they managed to pass up using the same final line (for the record, it's "I guess she got Harry all to herself.") Bafflingly, the film decides to forgo a more convincing and easy forced perspective for a silly looking combination of long-shot double exposure and in possibly the film's most amusing scene, a hysterically fake paper-mache hand attempting to assault her nurse. I mean, come on, I know money was tight, but just cut some trees shorter and have her walk closer to the camera. The fact that it occasionally DOES take this advice makes the exposure, which makes them look like an apparition, or someone with a projector, all the most puzzling.In the acting department, Allison Hayes is mostly just wildly gesticulating in hysterics, and actually, when she grows, she's almost unrecognizable, as her hair not only changed color but style and she looks like the niece of her smaller character rather than the same person. William Hudson is a bit of a blank slate C-level actor appropriate for the picture, and Yvette Vickers looks deliciously unwholesome, and was apparently Playboy Miss July '59, so I might have to do a bit more "research" on this one. ;) Overall, it was yet another film with an intriguingly outlandish premise that too late realize they don't have enough to pad out an entire film, so they pack it with filler and hope to make a bit of profit. Obviously, considering the random cost-cutting and short runtime, I would imagine they did. Good for them.{Grade: 6/10 (C+) / #19 (of 20) of 1958}</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great story believable acting.Special effects were not special. Wealthy, troubled and intoxicated Nancy Archer is on to her husband's infidelity. Riding home from town in the baron areas of the American southwest, Nancy slams on her breaks and see a large white glowing ball in the middle of the deserted interstate. Out comes a Giant who resembles Mr. Clean. The Giant reaches for Nancy's neck which has a necklace attached with a priceless diamond. Nancy in a panic drives away with her life and speeds home to her estate where her husband Harry (William Hudson) is calmly drinking as an insane Nancy tells her story of the Giant encounter to his pleasure. Harry's plan is to have his wife go insane and drink her self into an institution so he can frolic and enjoy his mistress Honey Parker played by Yvette Vickers. It seems that Hollywood in those days cast Mr. Hudson in stories related to Giants. i.e. The Amazing Colossal man. Reluctantly Harry agrees to go Giant shopping with the wife the next day driving the desolate,dry back roads to no avail. Finally as the sun begins to set Nancy sees a light and has Harry drive over . Sure enough the white sphere appears and out pops Mr. Giant and this time he grabs Nancy; diamond necklace and all! Whats to follow? Many mishaps in the special effects department! As I stated earlier Great story but the special effects were sub standard. I remember the encounter with the Giant as the Sheriff and butler Jess shoot at the Roman clad alien. The hairy handed Giant picks up the station wagon and the whole set at the same time. Problems with transparency were also an issue in the final cuts. It appears that the giants were transparent in the long shots. I've watched this Sci fi classic numerous times and when you come right down to it the attending Nurse is the scariest person in the film. Cast member Mike Ross worked double duty playing the Giant and Bartender. Funniest line in the picture is when the Family physician Dr. Cushing (Roy Gordon) and his staff see Nancy Archer as a giant for the first time. The Doctor's response was not "Holy @#$%" but "OUTSTANDING GROWTH!" For comic relief was our deputy played by Frank Chase who always drove his boss crazy throughout the film. I always felt that Allison Hayes was much lovelier than Yvette Vickers sort of a reference to the a Ginger Maryann, Betty or Veronica debate. Is this fictional story watchable ? Oh course but when searching for alien space craft in the desert, use your GPS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While a man and his mistress scheme as to how to commit his supposedly insane wife, the not so happy homemaker is undergoing some changes of her own, and it is not good for the cheating hubby! Allison Hayes is a temperamental, spoiled socialite, a drunkard, and perhaps in desperate need of time away in a mental institution. Her unhappy husband (William Hudson) has been spending time with a redheaded floozy (Yvette Vickers) while Hayes just gets worse, her jealousy rising to the heights. Apparently drunk driving, she claims to have an encounter with a giant alien (whom she accuses of trying to steal her necklace) and this is what it takes to convince husband and mistress to go ahead with their plans. But by putting their hands in getting her out of the way, she puts her own hand back, and this time, the hand is even bigger than the two of them! Yes, Ms. Hayes is the 50 foot woman, and if she can't have happiness with her husband (whom she accuses of being her gigolo), then certainly Hudson can't have him. She becomes grasping in more ways than one, and that involves ripping the roof off her own house to grab her husband out of it! With gaudy clothing and ostentatious jewelry, Hayes is one of those women on the verge of snapping, and when the local news reports on her "hallucination", she really flies off the handle. So indeed, while she can be a monster as a demanding member of the community and an extremely needy wife, imagine how she can be when she has the power of size and strength! Probably more famous for its special effects and film stills, its inclusion in various science fiction documentaries, this is a drive-in movie that probably packed em' in during its initial release where the audience was warned to fool around during the boring segments, of which the first part of the movie definitely is. It's actually pretty melodramatic with the female characters all over-acting and being seemingly ridiculous. Hayes isn't a great actress by any means, but she is definitely unforgettable. This is one time where I feel sorry for the cheating husband! So a camp classic, definitely, but not one that deserved to be re-made (with Darryl Hannah no less!), and one that may have some decent special effects but not much of a strong story to surround it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few films--even good ones!--have as strong a following as the deliriously tacky 1958 ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN. Badly produced, directed, and written, it nonetheless possesses a weird charm that cult-movie-fans find nigh irresistible.The story is deliciously absurd. Nancy Archer (Allison Hayes) is a rich and nagging wife fresh out of the looney bin--driven there by her taste for the bottle and her obnoxious husband Harry (William Hudson), who is having a sleazy affair with sleazy girlfriend Honey (Yvette Vickers.) One night Nancy, who is thoroughly fed up with the whole situation, goes on a wild drive through the countryside... in spite of the fact that a strange "satellite" is known to be in the area. Alas for Nancy: she has a close encounter of the truly ludicrous kind and becomes a giantess as a result, stomping through the town in a bra and half-slip made of bedsheets in search of her wayward husband.Both Allison Hayes and Yvette Vickers were attractive, competent players who had the misfortune of being stuck in ultra-B-movies for the duration of their careers; both they and William Hudson play with a fair amount of conviction. But overall, ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN is one great big whoopie cushion with a silly story, ridiculous script, and atrocious special effects--and the supporting cast runs from vague to horrendous. And yet... as is sometimes the effect of a truly bad film... the whole thing is a lot of fun.You won't find anything to shout about in terms of the DVD itself. There are no bonus features, and the film quality is mediocre to reasonable. (It is worth pointing out that it was probably nothing to write home about even in 1958.) All the same, you can't call yourself a true fan of 1950s B movies unless you have this one on your shelf! Recommended to fans of the genre.GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A poorly done and rushed movie to say the least. I perfectly understand that the visual effects of 50's sci fi movies are nowhere near to what they are like today. But however,even for the 50s, the visual effects were awful. I would put it in the same sentence with Plan 9 From Outer Space. First off, when a movie is in an hour long but it feels like three hours, there is something wrong with it. She doesn't mutate until the final 15 minutes of the movie. There are things in the movie I question such as how a 50 foot woman can fit in her own bedroom. There is also a problem with consistency. Nancy appears to be different sizes throughout the movie. She is also at times transparent and nontransparent, which the movie makers didn't care about. The alien on the ship appears to be a stitched up old man and it is comical. I understand that it is a cult movie, which is supposed to be a movie that is so bad to the extent that it is good, but there is no point in seeing the movie. There is no element in the film that awes the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible. A Movie That Lacks The Usual Qualities Of Most Bad Movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attack Of The 50 Foot Woman tells the story of a woman who grows to be 50 feet tall following a UFO encounter and a murder attempt. With revenge on her mind, she goes after her cheating husband.Normally, I have a tendency to like this kind of movies, but unlike some other bad sci-fi movies that I have seen, there was absolutely no excuse whatsoever for this mess of a movie. Attack Of The 50 Foot Woman is a terrible movie, terrible, terrible, terrible! It's cheesy, predictable, clichd, and stupid. Okay, I know I may have used that kind of vocabulary in my reviews for some of the other bad sci-fi movies that I have seen, but what makes this one different from the rest is that it is not even funny bad, it's just plain bad. As the movie went on, rather than laughing at the shoddy production values, I just ended up staring at the screen with a look on my face that went something like: "Seriously?!" This movie doesn't even have the qualities that most bad movies have, yes, it really is that terrible of a movie!The entire movie was stupid. A man is cheating on his wife, and believing that she might come after him, decides to have her killed, however, it doesn't go through, and eventually things get out of control when she grows to be 50 feet tall. In my opinion, this movie seemed more in an attempt to crank out sexual appeal rather than hokey sci-fi qualities, and that attempt failed utterly. Considering the way that I feel about most bad sci-fi movies of the 1950's, I tried to keep an open mind about this one, but ultimately, it didn't work for me, and I ended up see a movie that in my opinion, was a horrid film with no redeeming qualities, not even those associated with the movies of Ed Wood. In fact, I'm sure that Ed Wood probably could have done a better job if he had been helming the director's reins.Also, the writing is repulsive, to where we don't feel a thing in any sort of way for any of the characters in the movie. Allison Hayes' character was so unlikeable that I actually didn't care if she got revenge on her husband or not, in fact, I cared more about when she would be killed or not, which occurs right at the end. William Hudson, who plays the cheating husband seemed to be the only one who was actually trying to act. And I have to wonder, I have to wonder just how far they made it through shooting before Hudson realized what a bomb he was in. Not to mention that the titular plot point doesn't appear until the final five minutes of the movie. Sorry everyone, sorry that you had to sit through about 60 minutes before things really got going, and then to suddenly end just five minutes later.So all in all, this is definitely one of the worst of the 1950's science fiction films (and I don't mean that in a so bad it's good way, I mean it in a so bad it's terrible way). Seriously, who authorized the making of this movie, or even better, what possessed anybody to think that this was a good idea for a movie? So in short, if you want bad sci-fi, avoid this dreck and watch an Ed Wood movie instead, heck, even movies like The Giant Claw are better than this, this, whatever it is. This movie failed on all levels, it fails as a sci-fi movie, it fails as a bad sci-fi movies, and it fails as a movie as a whole. Lastly, if you are looking for a good/bad science fiction movie to watch, then Attack Of The 50 Foot Woman definitely is not the one.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allison Hayes plays the title character, a spurned woman named Nancy Archer, whose husband Harry(played by William Hudson) has been unfaithful to her, having a repeated affair with Honey Parker(played by Yvette Vickers). When she has two bizarre encounters with a UFO(manned by a giant) she finds herself growing to(you guessed it) 50Ft. tall, going on her "attack" in the last few minutes, trying to get Harry and Honey for revenge, before the police shoot her. Not a Bert I. Gordon production, though just as shoddy and inept, only more so this time. Only good for laughs, though attractive Allison Hayes became something of a "B" movie queen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN (Nathan Juran, 1958) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I&#x2019;d been interested in watching this ever since it was cited as the Worst Film Ever on an entry devoted to 1950s sci-fi cinema in a British periodical from the early 1980s entitled &#x201c;The Movie&#x201d; (incidentally, the Leonard Maltin Film Guide also awarded this the unenviable BOMB rating). When it came out on DVD last year, I became interested in purchasing the &#x201c;Cult Camp Classics&#x201d; Box Set in which it was included (along with QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE [1958] and THE GIANT BEHEMOTH [1959]); however, since recently acquiring QUEEN on DVD-R, I had put paid to the idea.Happily, I&#x2019;ve just stumbled upon the film on DivX &#x2013; however, the print wasn&#x2019;t culled from the Warners DVD (which is said to boast a surprisingly pleasant-looking transfer) but rather a muddy TV print&#x2026;though not so much that the detail is lost (in other words, it was like watching the film in sepia as opposed to black-and-white!). Anyway, to get to the matter at hand: I have to admit that, in a way, I was disappointed the film didn&#x2019;t prove to be the laugh-fest I had anticipated all this time (Maltin calls it &#x201c;hilariously awful&#x201d;); actually, I found it quite engaging &#x2013; and thankfully brief at a little over an hour in length. Some undeniably amusing bits remain though &#x2013; such as when the old nurse starts screaming her head off at the sight of the 50-foot woman, and when the Sheriff&#x2019;s deputy almost runs over his chief and the leading lady&#x2019;s butler in his enthusiasm to be of assistance in such an unusual case. Neither did the special effects hit me as being &#x201c;among the funniest&#x201d; (Maltin again) on film &#x2013; though they&#x2019;re certainly embarrassingly bad! O.K., so the idea that an alien (in giant-sized human form, clad in cave-man rags, and radioactive to boot!) coming to Earth in a big ball-shaped(!) spaceship and apparently after the heroine&#x2019;s prized necklace is utter nonsense &#x2013; and his quasi-transparent appearance does it no favors at all&#x2026;but, really, it&#x2019;s the human story that holds our attention (relatively speaking). The character of the philandering husband isn&#x2019;t very interesting, but his two women are: wealthy but nagging alcoholic wife Allison Hayes and ambitious, vixenish girlfriend Yvette Vickers. Also involved in the narrative are Hayes&#x2019; faithful servant (already mentioned), a couple of cops (one of them, as noted elsewhere, being amiably goofy) and as many doctors (one of whom is named Dr. Cushing[!] and another a specialist who&#x2019;s called in when Hayes starts growing in size after being exposed to radiation).Of course, the film could be seen as the reversed female version of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN (1957) &#x2013; though it wouldn&#x2019;t be fair to compare the two further, as the Jack Arnold/Richard Matheson classic is far more psychological/intellectual in approach; actually, Hayes doesn&#x2019;t seem to be that bothered with her &#x2018;condition&#x2019; and, in fact, takes advantage of it in order to teach her husband a lesson! However, her rampage &#x2013; exaggerated in movie posters of the era &#x2013; is rather quaint (especially when considering that it only occurs in the last ten minutes or so); when not shown the damage caused by her enormous but highly unconvincing hand (especially when lifting the puppet that&#x2019;s supposed to be her husband!), she&#x2019;s mostly seen walking in long shot and almost from behind (with her size even inconsistent in proportion to the buildings she passes by)!! Still, Hayes&#x2019; demise via electrocution (when she bumps into an electrical cable) is competently done.Finally, I followed this with its 1993 TV remake with Daryl Hannah as the titular creature &#x2013; which I rented specifically for this purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958) ** (out of 4) This thing has the reputation of being one of the worst movies ever made but I think that's way too harsh even though in the end the film still isn't very good. Nancy Archer (Allison Hayes) isn't having a very good life since she's just been released from a nut house, learns that her husband (William Hudson) has a girlfriend (Yvette Vickers) and to make matters worse she runs into a flying saucer with a big man in it. Soon, due to the contact with the UFO, she grows to fifty feet and goes out for revenge. Yes, the special effects are among some of the worst of all time but why the film has such a bad reputation is beyond me. I think the film does have some quality items and that includes Hudson and Vickers who are good in their roles. Hayes is also good in her role but I never felt sorry for her so I had a hard time with her character in the film. Another problem is that the film runs 65-minutes and the title character doesn't show up until the final six minutes. The film is fairly fun to watch but it would have been better with more of the sci-fi and less of the drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>65 minutes of absolute craziness. Allison Hayes is an "heiress" saddled with a no-good husband and a drinking problem. She meets a giant alien on a desert road and nobody believes her. When she sees it again and it touches her, she too becomes giant. She stomps around in near-slow motion while people scream and buildings fall. A camp classic populated with so many unlikeable characters, it's hard to recommend it. The direction is awful, really just showing the same scenes over and over. Hayes gives what may very well rank as the worst performance of the 1950s and she's not at all helped by the junky special effects. All of the acting is awful and special mention should go to Frank Chase as a particularly hyperactive sheriff's deputy. Directed, apparently with his eyes closed, by Nathan Juran.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie because it had a giant person and was labeled as a monster movie. I do not understand why it is called a monster movie. The movie is a drama. I was expecting a lot of destruction, but what did I get? Most of the movie was relationship problems and people thinking that a woman was a loony because she saw a spaceship crash with a giant inside for an unexplained reason. The action started a few minutes toward the end. Since the woman was killed, isn't that murder? Couldn't they have done anything else besides murder her? If you watch this because you expect it to have action because it is labeled as a monster movie, don't watch it. It is not a monster movie. It is a drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>campy and not particularly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like 50s sci-fi movies a lot. I like the really good ones (such as The Day the Earth Stood Still, When Worlds Collide, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and many others) and sometimes the really bad ones because they can be really funny and great to watch with friends (such as Plan 9 From Outer Space). However, when a sci-fi movie is bad but not bad enough to be fun, it really should be avoided. This movie is just such a film. The posters make it appear as some sort of sexy she-beast is attacking mankind, whereas the real plot is a lot less interesting. A woman is married to a womanizer. She is contaminated and begins to grow to a HUGE size and decides to track down this worm and kick his tail and that's about it. Also, many of the special effects really stink--especially the gigantic papier mache hand that comes into the room to grab the wicked hubby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely weak on cult charm, despite what you hear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A spectacularly odious film, for these reasons: A "scary" (yeah right), intermittently transparent giant in a gladiator costume, who looks like the old Maytag repairman; genius professors/doctors who don't possess even the insight the audience does, and are so word-tied, it takes them 5 times as long to get to their feeble point; one wobbling giant hand made of parachute nylon, with hair painted on with a broad house painter's brush, that keeps intruding limply into scenes, where it never fails to generate all the menace of a front-porch windsock your grandma bought at a craft fair; an exquisitely stupid ending with what may be the lamest payoff line of dialog in film history. No fooling.Now, I know a lot of the guys are gonna love this awful movie for the obvious reason. And certain types of women will to, I am told. But come on now, if it was a film about a giant man, you wouldn't give this flick 15 minutes of your time. --The whole thing is such an achingly sad, desperate display of ineptitude in every recognized facet of film making.A five star, all-stops-pulled BOMB. It gets 2 points, mainly for a few aspects (the scenario, the direction, the effects, the performances) that are impossible to view without amusement. See it in excerpts only. Believe me, not worth a contiguous hour and a half of your life. The worst of its kind.</fullReview>
