		<shortDescription>Very suspenseful, fun thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this on video, and let me say it is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen! Its got chills, some laughs, spooky atmosphere, and Pussy Galore! I mean, it has Honor Blackman, who played Pussy Galore in Goldfinger. She is wonderfully twisted in this.The story is rather simple. The relatives of a dead millionaire are called to his mansion on the 20th anniversary of his death. Via 8 mm film, the dead man names his heir to the assembled group. The sole heir must spend the night in the house with the group and be deemed sane the next morning. To add to the jealousy of the losers and the creepy house, the local insane asylum curator drops by to say a homicidal maniac has escaped and is hiding out in the area. All these things add up to a great story and climax. I really liked the clever way the end credits are displayed too. I gave this 9 out of 10. Truly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old warhorse still has legs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This old theatrical warhorse gets another outing in what is (to date) the only colour version of a classic play.There are some pleasantly swish performances from a good cast and neat direction from Metzger. Film takes a while to get going but the last reel packs in the action.Wilfred Hyde-White's appearance on film is a nice touch and he even gets to "host" the end credits. But the best moment is Edward Fox's spectacular entrance and his scene-stealing thereafter : a moment to treasure, especially his delivery of the line "We're just up the road"! (It'll make sense when you watch it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch out! There's a cat on the loose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A family gathers at Glencliff Manor, their deceased uncle's mansion in England, for the reading of his will - 20 years after his death! It's a typically dark, wet and thundery night in 1934......the perfect weather for a will reading......and a murder (or two). For it also happens to be the same night an escaped, murderous mental patient, with a penchant for all things feline, sneaks in (via a catflap - sorry, couldn't resist) to dry off, lick his fur clean......and sharpen his claws!The family remains unaware of the cat's presence inside the mansion until an anxious mental hospital doctor, searching every nook and cranny for the cat, smashes through a ground floor window brandishing a gun. He urges the family to lock themselves into their rooms and wait for morning.But the cat attacks. And he breaks a nail...er, a claw or two in the process.Headlined by Honor Blackman, GOLDFINGER's Pussy Galore, and Carol Lynley, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE's onboard singer extraordinaire - the latter having mastered an English accent for this role (Funny! When I was younger I thought Carol Lynley WAS English!) - CAT AND THE CANARY weaves thrills, murder, biting wit and choice dialogue into one satisfying hour and a half or so.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable misfire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film version of greedy relatives gathering for the reading of a will has been crucified in some corners as a pale shadow of the original, or if not the original the Bob Hope version. While certainly no classic this is a fun retelling of the story that works because the cast is so enjoyable to watch and because the old story works even if its done half way decently.This was the first version of the story that I ever saw. Endless reruns on HBO years ago have burned portions of this film into my mind, but I didn't mind since the film was just a good time passer.No, its not perfect. The 1970's retro feel that it has doesn't really work and makes the film feel like it doesn't belong anywhere. There were several films in the 1970's set in the 20's, 30's or 40's that suffered similar fates, particularly if they had any European connections. This is not the place to discuss it, but when you see this film you'll understand what I mean. And you should see this since its good but far from great. Is this the version if you can only see one go at the story? No, that would probably be the Bob Hope version, but if you want something for a rainy Sunday that won't tax the brain, this is it.7 out of 10 on the pure enjoyment scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Well-Done Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not overly fond of seeing remakes of movies that I hold in high esteem, such as Paul Leni's excellent silent film "The Cat and the Canary" (1927), but the 1979 British remake (actually the fifth filming of John Willard's 1922 stage play) has such an impressive cast that it was hard for me to resist. And, as it turns out, this most recent incarnation is as fun as can be; an amusing and at times pretty darn scary updating. In what is a now-classic setup, a group of relatives convenes in England, at Glencliff Manor on a stormy night in 1934, to hear the reading of Cyrus West's will, while outside the house, an escaped homicidal maniac stalks the neighborhood. Here, West's attorney, Dame Wendy Hiller, screens the 20-year-old filmed testament of the old man (Wilfrid Hyde-White, whose grumpy recitation for his latter-day "leeches" and "bastards" easily steals the show) to a group of millionaire wanna-bes that includes yummy Carol Lynley, lesbian cousins Honor Blackman and Olivia Hussey, and American songwriter Michael Callan. Radley Metzger, in his sole horror outing in a career more known for various erotic entertainments, directs this film with style to spare, and his screenplay is clever and at times even sparkling. Callan gets the lion's share of the script's comical one-liners, and his quips regarding "putting on heirs," "where there's a will, there's a way" and "kissing cousins" are actually very funny. But don't get me wrong; despite the screenplay's cleverness, this "CATC" does dish out the scares, especially in the film's final 1/2 hour, when that maniac (who reminded me a bit of a bloodied-up Keith Richards, of all people!) gets into the house and things turn pretty nasty. All in all, a surprisingly well-done remake. Now...when is somebody finally gonna release a Region 1 DVD of the 1939 Bob Hope/Paulette Goddard "CATC"? That's what I want to know!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Man West was a funny old thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cyrus West has a huge fortune to leave. Twenty years after his death he still holds the strings to his family, he arranges for his family, solicitor and faithful housekeeper to gather for the reading of his will. It's 1934 and Glyncliffe Manor plays host. Cyrus was considered an eccentric, ahead of his time, he presents his bequest via moving pictures, presenting his legacy from beyond the grave. His fortune is left to the beautiful Annabelle, just because she shared the same surname, West. Wanting to put a bittersweet twist on the affair Cyrus added a proviso, should the heir die or be judged insane in a twelve hour period the legacy would go to a second heir. Events that evening are made all the more complicated when Doctor Hendricks bursts in with a warning, an escaped psychopathic killer is on the loose, he believes he's a cat, killing his victims with his bare hands. Annabelle has a tough night ahead, a killer on the loose and a greedy grouping of dubious relatives.I'll start off by saying I think it's a really great movie, I prefer this to the previous version. It was produced more so as a horror/thriller then a supernatural thriller. It does have some moments of humour which work, mostly coming from Paul Jones.Annabelle is set up nicely as the victim, she is made sweet, nice, kind, such a contrast to most of the others who are shown as greedy, devious, even murderous. Paul being the exception.The acting is solid as opposed to awesome, it's the two seniors that I enjoy most, Wilfred Hyde White and Beatrix Lehmann, both are so much fun, quite underrated gems. Honor Blackman too is excellent, she's tough but rather creepy. Carol Lynley played the English Rose really well, I had no idea she was a native New Yorker. This film was not Edward Fox's finest moment, I think he's guilty of overacting somewhat, he's definitely enjoying himself, just a little too much.There are some excellent moments in this film, some of the best ones include, the disappearance of Mrs Crosbie, the theft of a slumbering Annabelle's necklace and of course the finale. That torture room was a rather nasty creation, although nobody lost any blood after being shot.Another good moment, the attack on Susan was ruined a little as it ended in a somewhat cartoon sketch.Mrs Pleasant says to Annabelle 'The Canary in a cage almost dies of fright when the cat walks around the cage. Dies a thousand deaths, although it's quite safe.' It's a great analogy for the film, with the house acting as the cage, and the killer, the cat.Such an underrated film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cat got your fortune?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1979 saw the reworking of the 1922 silent horror benchmark 'Nosferatu' by famed director Werner Herzog, and on the other end of scale to follow that up we see another (there's a few, but this was a British) film adaptation (inspired by John Willard's play) of the 1928 silent murder mystery 'The Cat and the Canary' by kitsch soft-porn director Radley Metzger. I haven't seen any seen of the other versions, so I don't know how close it was to them, but I found this effort to be a hot and cold fable. A wonderful star-studded cast including Honor Blackman, Olivia Hussey, Edward Fox, Carol Lynley, Daniel Massey, Wendy Hiller, Beatrix Lehmann and delightfully riveting cameo part by Wilfrid Hyde White lend strongly to the theatrical and eccentric comic styling that Metzger opts for. The offbeat interplay and rapports between the actors were authentically drilled and sprucely delivered. The isolated mansion comes into its own with its baroque etched details that create character with its shadowy interiors, creaky sounds, flickering lights, various rooms and secret passages. A stormy backdrop with the side-splitting thunder was the tip of it. Material-wise it's an often told, but twisted and cunning tale of mystery, murder, corruption, greed and insanity with a wicked sense of humour underlining it. The thick script is talky with many lyrical exchanges and goes about things in a slow-tempo. It takes a good hour to really kick into gear and this can make it feel a little too sluggish, as some urgency and suspense could've gone done much more for the beginning set-up. Nonetheless the edgy tension effectively builds and eeriness showers the air towards the latter end, but it never feels like enough by the end. Steven Cagen's music score is atmospherically good, the art direction is polished, photography placement is crisply crafty and Metzger directs with sophistication. One thing that did strike me was how the film ends with its revelation on who's doing the murderous acts and somehow it had me thinking did this have an influence of Wes Craven's 'Scream (1996)'? It's more about the way the killers in both films go about setting things in motion and then presenting themselves to their desirable object.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would you do for a fortune?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- A will is read in a big, old, dark house. The beneficiary can only claim the inheritance if she survives the night. Otherwise, the fortune goes to a secondary beneficiary who will only be named should the first beneficiary die. Anyone could be that secondary beneficiary - and someone is willing to kill to find out who it is.- The house is wonderful - lots of rooms and secret passages. I love a house with a sliding bookcase and that's exactly what you get here. The house creates a perfect setting for a murder mystery. Surprisingly, there is some pretty good atmosphere.- Much of the movie is meant to be a comedy and that's where The Cat and the Canary falters. Had it been played straight, it might have been more enjoyable.- The movie was directed by Radley Metzger. The fact that a porn director was able assemble a cast including Edward Fox, Olivia Hussey, Honor Blackman, and the wonderful Wendy Hiller is amazing. The fact that he was able to pull the whole thing off as well as he did is a miracle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Finally Found a Copy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy! It took me quite some time to track down a copy of this film that I remembered seeing on HBO in the early 80's. I saw it then and remembered I rather liked the film as a small(OK not so small) young man. The film is obviously a remake of a film that has been done by the same title at least twice - really three times. Paul Leni's silent masterpiece from 1927. The Bob Hope version that is easily the most fun. Those two used the same title but John Willard's play was also used in 1930's The Cat Creeps. Let us not be naive; however, that this is it. The Willard ply has been the basis for any and all haunted house pictures since the 1927 version(The Old Dark House and James Whale owe it immensely). Creaky doors. Hidden panels. Masked killers. A will reading at night. A hand from a hidden panel. Eyes moving in pictures. All these and many more are due to the many versions of this wonderful play. Now, I digress with a brief history of the play to say that I do not agree with those that this film, the 1978 version, was unnecessary and trivial. Having just watched it again, I found it withstands the test of time rather well. Is it as good as the silent film or the Hope film? Probably not(definitely not the silent), but it is an enjoyable film nonetheless. The plot has been changed a bit here, but the general spirit is basically the same. What I do think is that this film clearly has the best acting. We get a nice array of British acting stalwarts: Dame Wendy Hiller as the lawyer Allison Crosby(Is it just me or did anyone else find her quite alluring in that well-tailored business suit?) I love Hiller's vocal intonations and think she is a might good actress and, even though she is an Oscar-winner, a generally forgotten actress. Anyway, she is in top form here. Then there is Daniel Massey playing what he plays best: irritating, gruffy, huffy-puffy men. Lovely, and I mean just lovely Carol Lynley. She looks like an angel in this film. She is an adequate actress as well and does a pretty good job with the comedic by-play she has with Michael Callan as the Bob Hope funny person. Callan desperately tries to be funny but mostly misfires. He is not horrible though. Honor Blackman and lovely Olivia Hussey(somewhat wasted I thought) play a "couple" in every sense of that word. Strangely I do not remember that at all in the 1927 or 1939 film versions. Spooky Beatrix Lehmann looks like she just walked out of her sarcophagus. She definitely has an air about her. Then we get Edward Fox chewing up the scenery in his small role as only he can, and Wilfred Hyde-White stealing the show, so to speak, as the deceased who talks to his relatives contemptuously through a film. He is always wonderful. The director Radley Metzger does a good job working with his cast(it is actually his screenplay being used here). Metzger uses his own vision for many things in the play - I mean he changes things quite a bit but the general spirit of the Willard play remains intact. There are some very creepy scenes from Hiller's body being found to the closing one with Fox, Lynley, and Peter McEnery. There is also a plethora of wonderful images from the icy vault that kept the secret films in tact for twenty years to the set pieces, costumes, etc... Producer Richard Gordon obviously used what financial resources he had well as this film looks very stylish. It is a stylish, fun film. Really its only real flaw was when it came out. Audiences were really not looking for stylish film in 1978. After all it was the dawn of the 1980's - what for me is the least stylish decade in all film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Divine little "killer-on-the-loose-inside-the-creepy-mansion" thriller as someone supposedly from an insane asylum will perhaps harm a group of cousins, hoping for an inheritance from dear Cyrus West(Wilfrid Hyde-White, simply marvelous in his limited screen time), who stay the night in his eerie large residence, filled with secret passage-ways. Annabelle West(Carol Lynley)is the official heiress to the fortune and mansion because of her being the next in line by name. But, stipulations regarding her getting the money come with receiving the inheritance news..if she is proved to be insane..or murdered..after that night, the next in line to the fortune will get it. When Cyrus' lawyer, and preparer of the will, Allison Crosby(Wendy Hiller;simply wonderful when on screen)is viciously killed, Annabelle is in fear for her life for anyone amongst them has reason for perhaps using blood shed if it means gaining a fortune.A great cast, macabre sense of humor, and stylish direction really works wonders off of your basic drawing-room, Agatha Christie mystery. The house is a delightfully ominous setting and such spirited, game performances really works wonders in the setting. Edward Fox has a great entrance, through a window no less, as a flamboyant "asylum doctor" who informs the cast of the escaped loony who has fashioned a likeness with a cat, creating claws and such to heighten the effect. Beatrix Lehmann also has a memorable role as the quiet and oddball Mrs. Pleasant, a maid for Cyrus West who often is seen sneaking around corners and entering situations after something important to the plot has taken place. Carol Lynley as the heiress is simply radiant and charming..also having sparkling chemistry with American cousin, songwriter Paul(Michael Callan)who becomes the unlikely hero. Mustn't forget Honor Blackman as the scheming Susan, trying to push Annabelle over the edge while the simply beautiful Olivia Hussey(it was quite hard for me not to drool she's so lovely) is perhaps her lover(it's hinted at mainly when they insist on sharing a room together in such a large place full of empty rooms) Cicily Young who hopes to possibly inherit the money herself. Daniel Massey is Harry, a man who had gained quite a bit of wealth through corrupt business practices while Peter McEnery is the homosexual bit actor/double Charlie, who was quite "close" to Cyrus and favored by the old man. Some of the ugly stuff(despicable slow death of Crosby by the killer(s); possible unsavory activities in one of Cyrus' secret rooms no one accept a select few knew about)is subtly hinted at in key moments of dialogue. A ton of fun, colorful, and at times quite spooky.</fullReview>

It starts off promising in the first half hour but really peters out with all the gab and not nearly enough suspense or action. It looked like a modern English TV drama with a little profanity added. I was disappointed to see two very pretty faces of the 1960s, Lynley and Blackman, not look very good on the facial closeups. All the makeup they had on looked almost grotesque.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cat and the Canary is directed by Radley Metzger who also adapts the screenplay from the play written by John Willard. It stars Honor Blackman, Michael Callan, Edward Fox, Wendy Hiller, Olivia Hussey, Wilfred Hyde-White, Carol Lynley, Beatrix Lehmann, Daniel Massey and Peter McEnery. Music is by Steven Cagan and cinematography by Alex Thomson.Ah the dark house murder mystery, sadly seeming now like a relic of our cinematic pasts. There are many to choose from for those of us who choose to go back in time and cosy up by a warm fire, with drink in hand, to involve ourselves in the standard plot formula of various folk getting bumped off by a scheming murderer during a short time period and under one roof. John Willard's The Cat and the Canary is a well mined source for such fun and fearful frolics, as of the time of writing, this 1979 version stands as the last attempt to transfer the play to the screen.There is nothing unduly bad about Metzger's movie, it's just that it is rarely inspiring either. The cast is well assembled, with one or two creaky performances aside, the mystery element holds strong, and period flavours are tasteful. But the mansion it's set in is too bright and un-threatening, it's overtly talky as a good hour is used to set up characters and plot dynamics, while there's a distinct lack of acidity in the script. Still, it's never less than fun, and for the innovative reading of the will segment alone this version is worth seeking out by those who decry the demise of the old dark house set mystery thriller. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fondly remember seeing this film in '79, and I was taken by it but this was long before I started demanding quality from the industry. I wish I hadn't seen it again, so I could have preserved the memory of the atmosphere and lightning and secret passageways, the reading of the will -- I could go on. But the sun rises. How can a film that boasts such talent lie on the floor so limply? There is no depth to any of the characters except the house keeper. Playboy to Doctor to Sportswoman to Pet girl to Instant heiress -- stick characters played by bored actors. The leading lady seemed miscast. Sorry, Miss Linley but the accent came and went so many times, it was distracting. Not that Miss Lynley got much help from Randy's adaption. To sum it up -- it was all there, all the spooky/ horror elements, but nothing jelled. There was no chemistry between anything... the movie lied there, the end offered nothing but who the killer was and even that was obvious from the onset. Yes. Yes. Very sad. Sometimes it's best to keep childhood memories in your mind's eye rather then try to relive the moment.......................</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where There's a Will, There's a Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1934, blonde fashion designer Carol Lynley (as Annabelle West) and an assortment of greedy relatives gather at "Glencliff Manor" to hear the taped reading of wealthy Wilfrid Hyde-White's last will and testament. Relatively soon, we learn Ms. Lynley is to inherit everything, but not without stipulation. First, she must remain alive and sane after one night in the deceased's spooky old mansion. As a storm rages outside, the suspicious cast is joined by psychologist Edward Fox (as Hendricks), who informs them a homicidal killer known as "The Cat" has escaped from the local insane asylum. That's a recipe for murder and mayhem? This fairly tepid re-make of the 1927 "silent" classic was likely inspired by the success of films like "Murder by Death" (1976). Lynley and Michael Callan (as Paul Jones) could be described as the leads. As a stand-in for Buddy Rodgers (make that Ben Lyon), Peter McEnery (as Charlie Wilder) figures prominently, and Daniel Massey (as Harry Blythe) doesn't. Lawyerly Wendy Hiller (as Allison Crosby) arches her eyebrow. Elderly housekeeper Beatrix Lehmann shows how unflatteringly the film's extreme close-ups can exaggerate a face. And, Honor Blackman and Olivia Hussey somehow manage to make a lesbian subplot unexciting.***** The Cat and the Canary (11/78) Radley Metzger ~ Carol Lynley, Michael Callan, Peter McEnery, Edward Fox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hm. That wasn't very good, was it?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an odd film. A few decent chuckles, a few wonderful camera tricks, but far too much chitchat and a very nasty sadistic tinge.The "old dark house" thriller idea is hardly given any new energy, and the thunder sound effects often swamp the dialogue, making some sequences a challenge to endure. I agree with other reviewers that this feels like a 70s version of the 30s, with the same costume/lighting ideas as many of the 70s Agatha Christie adaptations (and Olivia Hussey in the cast).Wilfred Hyde White is great fun from beyond the grave, and a special word for the wonderful sequence where the usually glorious (but here slightly subdued) Beatrix Lehmann walks behind his projection screen, appears on screen, then emerges from behind the other side. Also, a very effective sequence where Ms Lehmann talks about her late employer with her face reflected in his photo.Far too many characters I found it hard to care about, all written in very poor, sub-Cluedo dialogue. Even Honor Blackman struggles with the poor material she is given. Some sequences are, frankly, silly. Edward Fox leaps through a window instead of knocking on the door. After relating the saga of the escaped loony, Mr Fox instructs everyone to lock up the house and hide in their rooms; this comes despite his having rendered the house insecure by destroying the lounge window. There is a nasty tinge of sadistic enjoyment to the final sequences, where the barking mad murderer is cornered in his lair. As much of the rest of the film tries (and very occasionally succeeds) in being light-hearted, the unpleasant conclusion, followed by a twee little "happily ever after" coda, seems at odds with the film's intentions. Very uneven and unsure of whether to laugh or scream, this really isn't very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While most noted for his adult films, Radley Metzger proved he's not limited to the ol' in-and-out with this fourth remake of the oft-filmed reading-of-the-will format play. The plot is fairly typical stuff (a bunch of heirs, a will with loads of cash to be handed down, a history of insanity in the family), but a good cast, some clever plot twists and Metzger's usual adept hand at visual imagery (check out the shot where the maid recites a monologue through the reflection on a picture of the old man) make this a welcome change of pace to the dreary and remarkably similar Agatha Christie murder mysteries of the same time period.</fullReview>

A car approaches the Manor as the rain lashes down, it's a lawyer named Allison Crosby (Wendy Hiller) who knocks the door &amp; is greeted by Glencliff Manor's long serving housekeeper Mrs Pleasant (Beatrix Lehmann) who says she is the first to arrive &amp; invites her in. They both head for a room in which is a wooden coffin sized box with various bits of running machinery attached to the sides, the box has been chained &amp; padlocked shut for twenty years &amp; only Crosby has the keys, once opened they remove a smaller box inside containing some film. More guests arrive, ex surgeon Dr. Harry Blythe (Daniel Massey) is the second, a sportswoman named Susan Sillsby (Honor Blackman) &amp; Cicily Young (Olivia Hussey) arrive together next, a war hero named Charlie Wilder (Peter McEnery) is the fourth while an American songwriter named Paul Jones (Micheal Callan) is the fifth &amp; finally a young fashion designer named Annabelle West (Carol Lynley) is the sixth &amp; last to arrive. After everyone has been introduced they get down to business, they are all informed that they are the last surviving relatives of Cyrus West (Wilfrid Hyde White) who has requested the reading of his will exactly twenty years after his death. The film that Crosby recovered earlier in the evening features footage of Cyrus as he talks his potential heirs through his will, he states that only one will inherit his fortune but should that person die before the night is over or is pronounced insane then the next in line will inherit instead. Cyrus reveals that Annabel is to receive the lot, everyone else are visibly disappointed &amp; jokingly suggest that someone has a good motive for murder. Later on that night a Dr. Hendricks (Edward Fox) unexpectedly turns up to warn everyone that a murderer has escaped from a nearby sanatorium for the criminally insane, to be careful &amp; that no one should leave until the morning. As the night draws on sinister events start to unfold as either there is a killer running around Glencliff Manor or Annabelle is going crazy...This 1979 version of The Cat and the Canary is the sixth &amp; to date last filmed adaptation of the play by John Willard, the others are the silent The Cat and the Canary (1927), the Spanish La Voluntad del Meurto (1930), The Cat Creeps (1930), the popular The Cat and the Canary (1939) with Bob Hope &amp; the Sweedish made for TV Katten och Kanariefageln (1961). Written &amp; directed by Radley Metzger I thought this particular The Cat and the Canary was an OK murder mystery but ultimately nothing special. The script is simply too slow, there is no foul play at all in The Cat and the Canary until well past the 50 minute point. Leading up to this the film merely sets the situation up &amp; introduces the characters far more than is needed, I was starting to become inpatient after the 30 minute mark &amp; generally speaking the film could have done with a little less chat &amp; few more incidents. You may figure out the killers identity, you may not but I was left wondering how a character who is a complete stranger, has nothing to do with anyone else &amp; supposedly never met any of them before knew so much about their personal lives &amp; for this reason I thought they basically stuck out like a sore thumb, I'll say no more... The characters are OK &amp; most of them have a motive for murder but the actual body count is very low, just the one for most of it's run time unfortunately, I really wish the filmmakers had included a couple more murders much earlier to create some tension, mistrust &amp; mystery. The Cat and the Canary has vague horror elements &amp; overtones, the old dark spooky house, secret passages, an escaped killer, murder, isolation &amp; a constant raging thunder storm outside &amp; while it has a nice atmosphere throughout it isn't particularly scary &amp; I don't think Metzger intended it to be as there are no real jump out of your seat scares which seemed a bit of a wasted opportunity if you ask me. The acting is solid from all involved especially Hyde White who makes for a great grumpy old relative. Technically The Cat and the Canary is very good but I can't help thinking that the period setting didn't quite work for some reason, the cinematography, editing, music &amp; production design are decent enough for not to complain about anything. Overall I liked The Cat and the Canary as a one time watch &amp; is a reasonable mystery that should have been more, well mysterious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much in this film for a cat to chew on but the canary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was so much potential in a modern color remake of this old dark house mystery tale, but this one is just so average. The muted colors and static direction give it the look and feel of something filmed for British TV but shown theatrically. More spooky stuff with the escaped lunatic who rips his victims to shreds with his sharp nails would have been vastly appreciated without sacrificing the mystery element. The most striking scene has a woman walking behind a movie screen, appearing on the B&amp;W film being projected and walking off the other side to appear from behind the screen. I wonder how many takes it took the bring this effect off so flawlessly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Britain Really that Small an Island?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers, perhaps.What I found to be quite off-putting was the incestuous relationships of the cousins. All the male cousins dated Carol Lynley at one time in the past and Olivia Hussey and Honor Blackman have a homo-erotic type relationship as well, with Olivia playing the lipstick lesbian and Honor the butch. And no one even bats an eye about it all. Now I've never been to Britain but I can't imagine the single's pool is so dry one has to give a cousin a call.This film is a remake of an old stage play and it clearly has the stage setting: one location and an assortment of characters spending the entire evening there. Descendents of Cyrus West (Hyde-White) gather at his estate twenty years after his death to hear his will read by none other than Mr. West himself. Cyrus recorded himself before his death so he could call all his descendants a bunch of lecherous bastards--which he does often. One of the six relatives gathered at the house will inherit his fortune but if said individual doesn't survive the night or is deemed insane, everything goes to the next in line, who Cyrus will reveal in the morning.The plot thickens when a doctor from an insane asylum (Fox) visits warning the relatives of a homicidal maniac who believes himself a cat on the prowl. When Carol Lynley is awarded the inheritance, relatives become quite charming towards her again but all could be plotting her demise. But with the maniac hiding out inside the mansion, they may not have to plot too heavily for the cat-man may make Miss Lynley's evening her last.STORY: $$ (I fail to see why this stageplay was made for the screen as many times as it was. The entire twist ending is all but revealed when the insane asylum doctor shows up to issue his warning. He knows far too much about Cyrus' descendants than a person should. It doesn't take a seasoned mystery buff to pick up on the fact he is more than he lets on. Also the "kissing cousins" thing was off-putting and the attempts at comedy seemed too forced. They seemed like perfect antics for Bob Hope (who starred in the 1939 version) and not these actors).ACTING: $$$$ (The acting is top notch even if the screenplay isn't. Everyone does a fine job. I thoroughly enjoyed the cameo of Wilfird Hyde-White as the eccentric Cyrus West. He belittles his relatives from beyond the grave, calling them all leeches. Carol Lynley is in fine form as winner of the inheritance. Michael Callan does a good job as the only descendant of Cyrus who isn't a fixture in the papers. Wendy Hiller, as Cyrus' lawyer, was difficult to understand at times given her thick British accent. Olivia Hussey is marvelous as the aloof descendant who plays the doe-eyed dame bit perfectly. And Peter McEnery shines as Charlie the pseudo war hero. Seems he trumped up his war record to impress ol' Cyrus).NUDITY: None. There is plenty titillation however. Carol Lynley in her lowcut nighty, showing off as much cleavage as modesty will allow. There is also a homo-erotic lesbian scene when Honor rubs down Olivia Hussey in bed. They may not be kissing cousins but they sure are touch-and-rub-in-your-nighty cousins).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CHILLING, BUT GRATUITOUSLY SADISTIC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some truly scary moments, but the sadism is gratuitous. The cast is fine, but the sentimental closing montage of cast credits is puzzling, particularly after such a bloody film. I question why this remake was even made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crass and the Unfunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the film this film was made (late 70s), this type of set-up was well past its sell-by date. The original play is considered a 'classic' and has been influential but frankly it is badly dated now. A deeply contrived and unconvincing plot, an assortment of unbelievable, unappealing and frankly inbred characters and a lot of clunky, expositional dialogue make this a leaden hour and a half.To compensate for the tired plot, the makers introduce some 70s gimmicks. A pointless Lesbian couple only succeeds in making lesbianism look dull. There's also a nasty line in sadistic mutilation which unusually is inflicted only on the female guests. One woman is gruesomely tortured to death, another assumed to be so, and a third scheduled to be so. This 'kills off' any pretence the film has for being a comedy. The delight with which the camera voyeuristically pans over the instruments of torment is actually disturbing.With the exception of Wilfred Hyde-white, who does a good turn as Cyrus West, none of the actors really shines. They all appear lost in this huge house. One really yearns for a likable central character like Bob Hope in the 50s version. A few good gags and less torture would go a long way to making this watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tiresome Brit comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was supposed to be a comedy/mystery/thriller. However, there was no comedy, a little mystery, and few thrills. The story took place in a beautiful old manse, at night, during a violent storm, and a will was read. This was a pat formula film that offered absolutely nothing new. Not a total loss, but no real winner either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a cult movie at all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't really understand why this British 1979 production is sometimes credited as a seventies' cult movie. It's not cult like at all, it's not good, not too funny, not to scary and not gory or trashy at all, just bland and very boring. The plot of "The Cat and the Canary" is derived from the usual Agatha Christie/Dorothy L. Sayers crime novels - in his testament, an old rich English guy determines that his greedy relationship only get his money when they are spending a night at his old mansion in the English countryside. Of course this turns out to be a deadly affair, and a masked killer diminishes the amount of slick thirties' high society kids until the big showdown reveals his identity.This plot is well known from many classic crime novels and films, but Radley Metzger's direction misses to add some new elements or an own style. It's rather the opposite - the usually thrilling suspense of the whodunnit plot is replaced by a deadly boring pacing, uninspired acting and a complete missing of suspense. The director also couldn't really decide if he wanted to make a black comedy, and so some included jokes completely fall flat. Even the good British cast of Edward Fox (Day of the Jackal), stunning Honor Blackman (The Avengers, Goldfinger), Wendy Hiller (The Elephant Man) and movie veteran Wilfrid White-Hyde can't help to rescue this movie from drowning in a sea of boredom...</fullReview>
