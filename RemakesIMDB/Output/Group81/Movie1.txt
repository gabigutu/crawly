		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The silents brought us a number of classic comedians who were skilled at making the audience laugh without uttering a word. With the advent of sound, some of these comedians found the transition hard and most still relied on their old silent routines for their jokes. Bob Hope was the first comedian who's mouth provided the punchline. The Cat and the Canary was his first leading part and yet it's not designed purely for his advantage, this is a great picture, both funny and exciting.Bob Hope is the star. He's hilarious. He's sympathetic. He's also a coward, which isn't such an asset when you're staying in a house filled with escaped lunatics, suspicious servants, and numerous trapdoors. Hope plays a radio personality who involuntarily becomes the bodyguard to a woman, Joyce, who recently inherited a lot of money. The house is filled with other guests that are upset at having lost out on the inheritance. To make matters worse, if Joyce dies within a month, the money goes to whoever was the substitute inheritor and that person's name lies in an envelope safely hidden in a safe. As guests start dying, the tension increases, as does Hope's one-liner's. "I've got goosepumps. In fact, my goosebumps have got goosebumps." Today, the plot seems like one from an episode of Scooby-Doo but it's still fun and surprisingly smart. The cast is small but solid and the murderer is never guessed until the end. A few red herrings are thrown in but when the guilty party is revealed, it does make sense, a necessity rarely used in Hollywood today. As a vehicle for Hope it works a charm. As a movie in itself it should be recognised as a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful pseudo-comic remake of the original murder mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1927 late silent filming of this creaky John Willard play was stylish and had to its credit excellent cinematography, art direction and editing. The acting was less than up to par but taken for itself, it was quite enjoyable. Hollywood didn't get around to re-filming it until 1939. Paramount acquired the rights from Universal and rewrote the script to give it a comedic bent -all for the talents of Bob Hope in his first big role. The added one liners are still quite funny, especially the one about Republicans. Hope is great, as is Paulette Goddard in the lead, although she is a tougher heroine than the original is intended to be.The rest of the cast is well-assigned their roles. Standouts are George Zucco as the lawyer, Mr. Crosby and Nydia Westman as Cicily. Gale Sondergaard is properly menacing as the housekeeper, Miss Lu - and Douglass Montgomery is dashingly handsome and kind as Charles Wilder.The plot devices, make-up and menace did not give me any thrills, but then, I knew the plot and who the killer would turn out to be. I imagine it's much more fun for someone who has never been exposed to the original play or silent film. Changes in the original - only ten years, not twenty, have passed since the old millionaire's death and certain character names have been changed - Annabelle West is now Joyce Norman. Paul Jones is now Wally Campbell. Harry Blythe is now Fred Blythe. Mammy Pleasant is now Miss Lu - etc.There's delight, humor, a few chills - and a literally surprise unveiling of the murderer, the motives, and the method. Highly recommended and newly (2004) available on DVD - its first release in any video format.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hope at His Wittiest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of Bob Hope's films rely heavily on the humour of the times, with references to political and cultural events figuring in significantly. Sometimes this detracts from his films, because the humour is not always self-evident. Not is the case with his performance in the remake of Paul Leni's The Cat and the Canary. Hope has one great one-liner after another in this old dark house mystery-comedy. The story is pretty familiar: a group a relations must stay a night in a house, listen to a will, and then remain there for the evening to see if the inheritor remains sane throughout the evening. Of course, we the audience are treated to secret panels, an occasional murder, hooded culprits, and a great mystery. The Cat and the Canary works so well for a number of reasons. First, it is a very atmospheric film taking place in the swamplands of Louisiana. The film is by no means big budget but does do the most with what it has. The surrounding swampland have an authentic feeling to them and the house itself is magnificently eerie. The cast is quite good with Bob Hope saving the film from tiresome formula with his special brand of humour and his excellent timing. Despite his great performance, he is almost upstaged by Gale Sondergaard as a dark, brooding servant. George Zucco also has a nice supporting role. All in all a nice way to spend an evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CAT AND THE CANARY still is a great mystery/comedy film. With it's two young stars Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard, who go on to make yet another two films together, THE GHOST BREAKERS and NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, there is great fun and thrills as they spend the night in a spooky old house with several guests that disappear or are found killed mysteriously. Paulette inherits the place through a will, including a jewel necklace which she promptly places under her pillow before going to bed. There is a scary scene with the damsel in distress in bed sleeping, and a hairy grotesque hand slowly starts to creep over her pillow. A wonderful performance by the supporting cast including Gale Sondergard as an evil-looking housekeeper, George Zucco, again in a thriller, and Elizabeth Patterson and Nydia Westman as the two dizzy relatives. This film put both of the leads over the top and onto major star caliber. Rarely on television, it can be seen around Halloween on American Classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best version of the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This tale of greedy relatives out to get a fortune had been filmed at least two times before Bob Hope took a crack at it, and the world is a better place for it.Though not the perfect haunted house film, this is a very funny movie. One of the reason that this isn't perfect is that the wisecracks get in the way of the mystery, or if not the mystery, the suspense. Such is the danger of comedy thrillers, either its too funny so its not scary, or too suspenseful and the comedy destroys the tension at the wrong time, here its simply too much humor before it turns serious.Fortunately here funny is good, so even if the suspense gets the short end of the stick, its still an enjoyable time at the movies. What more could you want, especially since it gives Bob Hope ample chance to do what he does best.See this movie. Its a lot of fun. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be classed as one of Bob Hope's better films, even though it was one of his first in a starring role. He uses the script to perfection with his one-liners while playing the role of a pretty scared coward, and he is admirably supported by Paulette Goddard as the future heiress. In a very good supporting cast there are a number of stalwarts like George Zucco, Elizabeth Patterson and Gale Sondergaard who add so much to the atmosphere of the film. Take it for what it is - a fun scary romp, and you will be spending a most pleasurable 75 minutes, Oh, and by the way it has the required sliding panels, mists, falling bodies, etc that go such a long way in providing Hope with suitable cracks. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has always been one of my top10 favourite films, since I first saw it in 1972, at least 14 times since. Bob Hope was still a little green at this stage, but you can almost see (and hear) him coming of age in CATC, his comic delivery technique and timing noticeably improved by the end. The spooky atmosphere generated onto the b&amp;w nitrate stock by the Paramount cast and crew was palpable, compare it - if you can stomach it - to the 1979 remake!8 people are summoned to a will-reading at a rather eerie old house; the one that wins the fortune seems to be going insane as one of her relatives sweetly puts it, whilst another just says she's going out of her mind. There's only 2 nice people here, Hope and Goddard, the rest are more or less on the make. She's the visual jewel in here - as Hope says, "Terrific". The scene with Goddard and the Cat in the library is my all-time Spooky Moment on Film - nowadays all the "artists" involved in the making of "horror" films don't trouble about niceties like Spookiness, but just get on with the Gore. That of course is the problem for most people coming to this, they've probably inured themselves over the years to see disgusting and vile-ent things - so much so that they would laugh at the most savage scene in this where someone gets knifed in the back. The 1927 Laura LaPlante version is good and nicely atmospheric too, but it's difficult comparing chalk and cheese to silent and talking pictures - they're both great comedy films on their own merits.A wonderful piece of art, topped the next year with an even better follow up, Ghost Breakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite "old dark house" comedy-mysteries...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a plot that sounds right out of Mary Roberts Rinehart or Agatha Christie, Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard join forces to let her inherit her rightful inheritance before a series of murders occur. I was a kid when I first saw this and it has haunted me ever since--it's a child's nightmare with its secret passageways, cobwebs, hidden panels and relatives gathered to hear a rich man's Will.But seeing it today, I'm not sure that it's quite as wonderful as other comments suggest. All the cliches are there--and Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard both had better roles in THE GHOST BREAKERS, another comedy released the following year. Gale Sondergaard provides a few chills as a sinister housekeeper and other performances are adequate. The revelation of the murderer is in the tradition of "the one you least suspect". George Zucco is so sinister as the lawyer that I almost expected him to "come back from the dead" and be revealed as the killer.It has the look of a low-budget movie despite some good atmospheric effects. Good for a rainy day or a Halloween evening--just don't expect too much. Hope had much better lines in THE GHOST BREAKERS and obviously more was spent on production values for his follow-up film with Paulette.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cat and the Canary was a suitably atmospheric movie with entertaining wisecracks from Bob Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of only reading about this-Bob Hope's first starring role in an A picture after a few years struggling in some B's-I finally got to watch this rare showing of The Cat and the Canary on YouTube. Long unavailable on TV and video, this was a very pleasurable experience with the mostly clear print I saw on the site. While director Elliott Nugent provides the right sinister atmosphere for this third film adaptation of this classic mystery play that takes place in New Orleans in my home state of Louisiana (by the way, Crescent City residents would not take kindly to the way George Zucco pronounces their city's name here), Bob Hope provides perfect wisecracks in his role of a radio actor who's one of several possible heirs to a man that's been dead for 10 years. Besides him, there's also the stunning Paulette Goddard as the woman Hope falls for and is willing to protect despite his admitted cowardice (though it's not too emphasized here). As the housekeeper who was long loyal to the late house owner, Gale Sondergaard provides her own haunting beauty to the fore. I was also pleasantly surprised by a couple of familiar character actors who would become recognized on TV: Elizabeth Patterson (later Little Ricky's babysitter on "I Love Lucy"), and Charles Lane (who appeared as Homer Bedloe on "Petticoat Junction" and is another player that is in my favorite movie, It's a Wonderful Life). Even today in this age of more explicit horrors, The Cat and the Canary is great fun to watch. Oh, and I have to mention that one of my favorite lines from Hope concerns dead people coming back. "You mean Republicans?" he asks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine comedy with loads of thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An almost perfect film, "The Cat and the Canary" will have you laughing aloud while peeking through your fingers. Although the 1927 version has recently gained in reputation, this 1939 version is the better of the two. Paulette Goddard and Bob Hope (who would team again a year later in the equally scary and hilarious "Ghost Breakers") make a wonderful team as a newly revealed heiress and a less than brave romantic interest. Paulette, who's inherited a fortune, can lose it all if she's proved to be insane. While someone tries to drive her over the edge, Bob's determined to protect her. Together they may just solve a big mystery that also involves a priceless necklace...if they live long enough. Fine support, particularly from Elizabeth Patterson, George Zucco and Gale Sondergaard. The Hope-Goddard Paramount productions were noted for their brilliant Art Direction-Set Decoration, and Hans Dreier's reputation was enhanced by the remarkably evocative and moody atmosphere depicted in this first class production. Ernst Toch's original score skillfully blends the whimsical with the menacing; and, Charles Lang's cinematography is sublime, a perfect mixture of light and shadow. Elliot Nugent directs with winning style. The French critics made much of mise-en-scene, and this is a perfect example of how the totality of an image equals a heady remarkability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE CAT AND THE CANARY (Elliott Nugent, 1939) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, this has yet to be released on R1 DVD and has never been on TV in my neck of the woods; consequently, it's been my most-wanted Bob Hope vehicle for as long as I can remember. Unfortunately, the occasion of my first viewing of the film wasn't the most felicitous: after persuading myself not to spring for the R2 DVD because of its reportedly substandard quality, I finally came upon it via a DivX copy. I'm not sure if its source was this same edition but, if that's the case, it's not so bad after all ? soft and lacking in detail, to be sure, but certainly better than nothing! However, the conversion to disc seems to have proved faulty and the blasted thing kept freezing on me ? so that I had to watch the film on a 17" computer screen!! Anyway, this is the archetypal comedy-thriller ? not only in the way it ably mixes the laughs with the chills, but also in its plot complications (involving an old dark house, the reading of a will, an innocent heroine, greedy relatives, suspicious-looking servants, secret panels, a hidden treasure, a creeping menace and, of course, the cowardly hero which Hope would make his own). The atmosphere it builds (thankfully, not taken for granted by the film-makers) is quite impeccable ? at its best during the climactic rampage of "The Cat", and aided immeasurably by the inspired bayou setting.This, of course, is the third of four cinematic adaptations of John Willard's famous play; I've also watched the 1927 Silent version and the 1978 star-studded color remake. While I'd say that the original (directed by a great stylist, Paul Leni, as opposed to a mere journeyman like Elliott Nugent) slightly edges this one, the comedy is better integrated in the Hope film (it follows the then-fresh traditions of radio rather than those of the stage, which were reasonably passé by this time). Hope is here ideally teamed with leading lady Paulette Goddard: in fact, the two were re-united soon after for the similar (and even better) THE GHOST BREAKERS (1940) ? with Hope growing nicely into his beloved trademark screen persona. Incidentally, despite having taking this long to catch up with THE CAT AND THE CANARY, I was already familiar with several of its one-liners ? which have since entered cinema folklore! The supporting cast includes John Beal and Douglass Montgomery ? both of whom seem to be jealous of Goddard's nomination as sole heir of the estate, while vying with Hope for her affections; Elizabeth Patterson as a slightly dotty relative; a striking Gale Sondergaard as the slinky and vaguely mediumistic house-maid, who has remained devoted to the late owner all these years; and George Zucco as the ill-fated notary named Crosby ? some may take this as an in-jokey reference to Hope's frequent partner Bing Crosby, but the character is similarly called in the Silent version at least and, in any case, the two Paramount stars would only 'meet' on-screen a year later for the first "Road" film! By the way, Sondergaard and Zucco ? later to play two of Sherlock Holmes' most formidable opponents ? would appear in villainous roles in a subsequent classic Hope vehicle, the espionage comedy MY FAVORITE BLONDE (1942). Incidentally, too, veteran character actor Charles Lane (who just passed away at the venerable age of 102!) shows up here briefly at the very end as a reporter.One final thing: I was slightly let down by the fact that we never really get a good look at "The Cat"; ironically, I'd long admired a still of its prowling figure in "Halliwell's Film Guide" (which, rather tactlessly, also gave away the identity of the actor under the make-up!) ? needless to say, my expectations had been considerably raised by this aspect over the years (as it turned out, unrealistically so)...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** Possible Spoilers ***I just saw this, and already being familiar with the 1927 silent film, I saw many differences, and never anticipated what the dialogue would be, which actually brought more to the film than I'd originally known. The characters generally have very different personalities than the 1927 cast had. I hoped that someone else would turn out to be the killer, but the role was excellently played. John Beal as Fred Blythe is much more surly than the polished gentleman Harry Blythe from '27, and generally a disappointment. Douglass Montgomery, one of my favorite actors in general, makes an impressive Charles Wilder, dashing and self-assured, a major improvement from his boring counterpart. Gale Sondergaard makes a mysterious but glamorous young housekeeper, another improvement. Paulette Goddard is excellent, similar but better than Laura LaPlante (LaPlante was a popular silent film actress, but sometimes exaggerated her emotions, a common practice). But Bob Hope was the standout as Wally. His counterpart was played by Creighton Hale, who was basically comic relief, not clever, easily frightened, and very shy to LaPlante (his love interest). This time, Bob Hope takes that characterization to a whole new level, making everything better, in addition to being very intelligent, sociable, and amusingly boastful. The sets were not nearly as impressive as in the original film. It only seemed like an "old dark house" when the lights would flicker or go out.</fullReview>

The atmosphere generated in this movie is perfect for all you who like the early 'old dark house' movies. Creepy internal and external sets, secret passageways, lurking danger, mysterious housekeeper and house guests.Hope is the focal point for the film and injects darkly comic humour at all the right moments, which not only provides laughs but also cranks up the tension beautifully.This film is great to watch on a Friday night with a bottle of wine, but will also be a hit with the kids at Halloween!

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in 1939 when I was just nine years old. It was a comedy, to be sure, but it scared the heck out of me. It was at night when I saw it and when I left the theater alone, I ran all the way home. That was just three blocks but a dark and spooky three blocks. For many nights I couldn't sleep because of a skeletal hand that kept reaching out of my headboard and was creeping ever closer to my throat. No scary movie, before or since, ever scared me as much as this comedy. It made a star of Bob Hope and he and his co-star, Paulette Goddard, appeared in a similar scary old house movie later that became more well known than Canary, but it was the canary that kept me awake every night for a week or two. I have never seen this film for sale or rent and never have seen it on TV and I have always wondered why. It was such a gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top notch Horror/Comedy with great performances and a classy mix of spooks and laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another Classic movie from 1939, one of the first Horror/Comedy hybrids, and one where the mix is almost flawless. The first teaming of Hope and Goddard is a fun one with the two stars playing off each other well. Paulette Goddard playing the much put upon heroine of the piece conveying terror without tipping over into annoying "get a grip!" timidity while all the while more than holding her own in the give and take wit stakes with Hope. Hope is a little more constrained by plot here than in a lot of his other films. He is, as was to become usual, the timid unwitting hero of the piece, but shows a little more backbone and heroism here than in any of his other pictures, and it serves him well. There is a lot less mugging and his performance is memorable, also perhaps because the gags (while razor sharp) aren't coming at you rapid fire and it gives the ones that do come time to really strike home. The plot itself is pure cheese, but tasty cheese. Dead rich relative, family gathering for will reading, remote house in backwoods bayou, no way off till the boat comes back, creepy housekeeper, dead bodies, murders and clutching hands. Hokey even by the standards of the day but there are a few genuine "jumpy" moments and there's a good chance that you won't actually figure out "whodunit" till the end. But it's the comic element provided by Hope and several of his "relatives" among the top notch cast, that really gives it a kick. And the inimitable Gale Sondergaard as the creepily psychic Housekeeper lends both tremendous atmosphere and tremendous comic fodder to the whole proceeding.Great stuff for a late night in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For years I have heard that "The Cat and the Canary" was a very good movie. For some reason--rights, maybe?--I have never seen it before. Well, I finally caught up with it. As a number of previous reviews have pointed out, "The Ghost Breakers" was better--far better. Even the politically incorrect aspects of the second film worked. Hope and, especially Goddard (no wonder Chaplain was so bewitched), were much better the second time out.I saw the Laura LaPlante silent version on Turner Classic Movies recently, so the identity of "the cat" was no surprise, although I suspect most viewers would have figured it out not too far into the movie. The best performances in the 1939 version were by Gale Sondergaard and Nydia Westman. On the other hand, John Beal and Douglass Montgomery gave confirming evidence of why they are now largely forgotten.Still, I would rather watch Goddard and Hope in this "Cat" than the gore-fests--"Saw," anyone?--that are ground out like rancid sausages today for the mystery/thriller market.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A groups of relatives, including pretty artist Joyce (Paulette Goddard) and cowardly actor Wally (Bob Hope), gather at a creepy old mansion in the Louisiana bayou for the reading of the will of millionaire Cyrus Norman. In the will, everything is left to Joyce. As the relatives spend the night in the mansion, scary things start to happen and Joyce fears that her relatives might be trying to kill her.Hope has lots of one-liners and funny comebacks. This was his first big hit movie. Goddard plays it straight but does a good job as the heroine. Hope and Goddard re-teamed a year later for the similar Ghost Breakers. They're both good movies but I prefer Ghost Breakers to this. George Zucco and Gale Sondergaard have supporting roles here. I hopefully don't need to tell you all how that's a big plus for any movie.The Cat and the Canary began as a play but it's been filmed several times. The first was in 1927 and that version happens to be one of my favorite silent movies. The play and the first movie were highly influential, being imitated often in what would come to be known as the "old dark house" subgenre of horror/thriller. This 1939 version of The Cat and the Canary mixes things up by turning the original into a comedy. Today more people are probably familiar with this than the silent classic. I suppose there's no harm in that but I would recommend you seek out the earlier film as it's very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bob, Paulette and a Haunted House - what could be better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may sound strange, but there was something so cute and appealing about Bob Hope in the '30s and '40s. I loved that guileless, spineless sweet character he played.Here Hope is in top form in "The Cat and the Canary," the 1939 version also starring Paulette Goddard, Gale Sondergaard, John Beal, Douglass Montgomery, George Zucco, and Elizabeth Patterson. A group of relatives have to spend the night in a haunted house after the reading of their late relatives' will.Hope and the beautiful, vivacious Goddard are wonderful together -- so good, in fact, that they did it again in "Ghost Breakers." No one could do one-liners like Hope.This movie is a lot of fun, with secret panels and things that go bump in the night. Delightful, funny, and spooky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of The Ghostbreakers with Hope and Paulette. I am delighted with this teaming done prior to the other. Hope pretty much establishes his brave coward role here in this one though it is the same role he would use for many motion pictures after this one. The brave coward allowed Hope to work in his verbal quips and yet still be part of the story. This was a great idea.This film contains the equal time quip about Republicans that book ends the quip about Democrats in Ghostbreakers. Hope was pretty much hitting both parties during his career.While the effects in this movie are ordinary, the script based on the successful stage play carries the night quite well. Paulette - known as Chaplin's lady when this was made is great. Someone should put both party lines from this and Ghostbreakers together. They prove why this country is in such a mess that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: This is a spoof, not a remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the 'talkie' remake (well, in fact, more of a spoof than a remake) of the famous silent mystery classic from 1927; this time we start directly on the evening the millionaire's will (who died 10 years ago, in this case) will be read to all the more or less greedy relatives. Again, the attorney (George Zucco, an 'old friend' from many a scary movie) notices at once that the safe has been opened, and again the strange housekeeper Miss Lu (Gale Sondergaard) receives the guests. This time, there IS electric light in the house - but it isn't too reliable...And the last ones to arrive are actor Wally (Bob Hope) and beautiful artist Joyce (Paulette Goddard), our protagonists of course. The will is being read, and Joyce is the 'lucky one'; and again under the condition that she won't become insane - and what's more, that she won't die within a month... 'An invitation to murder', as one of her cousins remarks quite rightly...Then the warden from the asylum comes and warns them about the escaped lunatic they call 'the Cat'; then the attorney disappears behind a moving bookshelf, Joyce is getting more and more nervous, and Wally's already shaking with fright - and so the 'horror' spoof goes on; only with the ending slightly altered to give Miss Lu a little more attention...Of course, there's no comparison on ANY level to the original mystery masterpiece; this is clearly romance and comedy entertainment of the late 30s, with a few scary moments thrown in - of the fans of the CLASSIC kind of mystery, only those with a very good sense of humor will find it interesting; otherwise, the good acting and funny lines will be quite entertaining for friends of the 'lighter' side of old Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Or, as I would call it, "The Ham and the Tomato".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watch this movie with the idea that it is an old dark house mystery with a touch of comedy, you will find the film to be quite good. Even Bob Hope, in spite of spouting jokes that are either silly, dated, or just plain bad, underplays his role of a cowardly actor thrown into the midst of murder and mayhem. Paulette Goddard is the heir to the fortune of the deceased family patriarch who resided in a spooky estate with his cat-like housekeeper (Gale Sondergaard), and distant cousin Hope protects her, as best as a coward can. This film has enough sliding panels, spooky looking hands (apparently belonging to an escaped mental institution patient only known as "the cat") and many sinister innuendos from Sondergaard.Future "Z" grade horror icon George Zucco ("Fog Island", "Scared to Death") is good as a dour attorney, while Nydia Westman (as a fluttery cousin), John Beal (a hunky cousin) and Elizabeth Patterson (as their spinster aunt-what else?) are among the others present. Sondergaard steals the show with her resemblance to "Snow White's" Wicked Queen extremely uncanny here. She keeps her tongue firmly in her cheek while obviously enjoying portraying this glamorous possible villain. While a remake of a silent classic, this is the prototype for many old dark house comedies yet to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Millionaire leaves a wacky will</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Uncle Cyrus left quite a collection of greedy relatives looking to be the number one heir at the reading of his will at his home on an island in the Louisiana bayou swamp. Among the possible legatees are Bob Hope, Paulette Goddard, John Beal, Douglass Montgomery, Elizabeth Patterson, Nydia Westman and housekeeper Gale Sondergaard. Presiding over the reading of the will is lawyer George Zucco. Besides Bob Hope a lot of the names of the cast spell out sinister.As usual the deceased always makes out a will with wacky provisions. Winner of the prize is Goddard, but she has to spend some time at the creepy mansion, essential in these kind of films. And if she's driven to madness or killed there is a secret provision for a second heir among the crew that only Zucco knows. The Cat And The Canary is a nice blend of both comedy and melodrama with of course Hope in charge of the comedy. He's a successful radio star as in real life at that time and Uncle Cyrus's money while nice isn't going to be the difference in where his next meal is coming from. And he's liking what he sees in Goddard so he's protective of her in his own comedic way.This was the first of three films that Hope and Goddard did. Immediately afterward Paramount put them in The Ghostbreakers which certainly had some similar themes. They worked well together too bad they were not able to collaborate more.This was a nice film for the career of Bob Hope which was zooming into high gear right about now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Bob Hope comedy spookathon for me last night as I doubled this with The Ghostbreakers to hopefully lift me out of the hazy blue cloud hanging over me? I started with this offering from director Elliott Nugent that at times sadly flatters to deceive, whilst also at others delivers some mirth courtesy of Bob Hope's cheeky coward act and Gale Sondergaard's quite deliberate camp performance as the mysteriously eerie housekeeper. This was my first viewing and I have to say it didn't deliver all that I had hoped for, the house was nicely set up with bookcases spinning and spooky pictures brought to life by some nice camera work, yet the moments of hilarity didn't outnumber my let downs. The print of the film is very poor and this only added to my distraction with the film. I will certainly revisit it again next year, but for now it's an above average film that maybe suffers from my expectation of it from the off? 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a silly, silly, silly film. If not downright, for want of a better word, stupid. Not that it has to make sense - no need for that, given the nature of the beast - but it ought to have had some semblance of sensibility. Stilted and forced, nothing flowing easily. A petulant and cranky John Beal, unusual for him; a good-looking but vacuous Douglass Montgomery who has been better; Elizabeth Patterson as Elizabeth Patterson only a shade meaner; Nydia Westman perfectly cast as the jittery screamer; George Zucco, gone too soon; malevolent Gale Sondergaard who never fails; Paulette Goddard as Paulette Goddard and lovely at that; and Bob Hope in one of his worst efforts from that time period. His films from the late 30's through the late 40's were usually fun and he was usually fun, but if he gets to say something like "shut up", and mean it, to Patterson, something is not right. It's not in character for him. I've wanted to see this for years and have never found it and now that I have, I can rest easily. I'll never have to see it again.

		<fullReview>There is little fault that can be found when watching a film which is as well written, well performed, atmospheric, creepy, and downright funny as this. If only modern day comedy actors could stop and look at how Hope delivers lines we might get a better standard of comedy from todays supposed " comedy " actors.Sure, this is an old movie, and the setting is tight, as likely was the budget. But when you look at the story ( en mass gathering of family for reading of a will leading to suspicion and murder ) the tight setting perfectly suits the nature of the film. The who-dunnit aspect will is not exactly tasking on the brain, but this is not the point of the film. This is a comedy suspense film and on these two fronts it is a stand out. Hopes lines are priceless and almost everyone else essentially play foils to Hopes comedy genius. The suspense also works very well thanks to the isolated location and what in its day would have been far more unjaded use of the secret passageways and haunted house themes.I could wax lyrical for a long time about this film ( and the fact it is not available on any format ! tisk tisk ! ) but seek it out on a late night showing on TV and enjoy a little gem of movie magic.</fullReview>

Lots of running down corridors from room to room, people splitting up when they should stay together, and responses to cries for help that come slowly or quickly, according to the needs of the scene.Nothing special about the production. The music is overbearing, but not hugely.Overall, faintly amusing ancestor of Scooby Doo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This archetypal Old Dark House movie made Bob Hope a star and defined his Wise-cracking Cowardy Custard screen persona for the rest of his career. Paulette Goddard is a smart and feisty heroine while the rest of the cast give good value as the eccentric family forced to spend the night in the creepy mansion. George Zucco and Gale Sondergaard also stand out as the sinister Lawyer and mysterious Housekeeper.A group of people gathered in an isolated and spooky location while a killer prowls was already very familiar to 1939 audiences. Bob Hope's character knowingly jokes about this early in the film and speculates who will be bumped-off first, anticipating Wes Craven's "Scream" gimmick by half a century.This version of the tale is played for laughs as well as thrills and holds up remarkably well to this day. Hope's lines are still funny and Director Elliott Nugent paces the film well while evoking plenty of spooky atmosphere, especially in the suspenseful climax. The plot is actually quite cunning too, and may keep some viewers guessing.The success of the movie spawned a slew of imitations involving 1940's comedy stars in spooky situations, yet these are now largely forgotten because none matched the charm of this minor classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, if creaky, haunted house tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This creaky old haunted house movie is the feature that consolidated Bob Hope's stardom, and is quite clearly a handpicked vehicle for his particular brand of cowardly comedy. All other cast members, including a feisty Paulette Goddard, are really just foils for Hope's routine, although Goddard and Gale Sondergaard manage to make an impression.Hope plays Wally Campbell, one of a diverse group of distant relations summoned to Cyrus Norman's creepy old house deep in the Bayou for the reading of his will exactly ten years after his death. Other potential beneficiaries of Cyrus's will include Fred Blyth (John Beal), a bitter young man who spends most of his time warning the other men away from the lovely Joyce Norman (Goddard), Charles Wilder (Douglass Montgomery), a dashing charmer and former beau of Miss Norman, and Aunt Susan (Elizabeth Patterson) and her scatty friend, Cicily (Nydia Westman). Miss Norman is named as the beneficiary providing she can remain alive and sane for one month, which is no easy task given the spooky shenanigans that take place in the house in which they are spending the night. People disappear and reappear as corpses, hairy hands emerge from panels in the wall above sleeping maidens, lights flicker eerily and, to cap it all, there's an escaped maniac on the loose.Based on an old, straight, stage play, The Cat and the Canary is ripe with comic potential which writers Walter DeLeon and Lynn Starling take full advantage of, and the young Hope is at the top of his game as the cowardly Wally Campbell. Of course, it's a routine we've since seen him perform in almost every other movie he's ever made, so it obviously lacks the impact it must have possessed then. But the support players each get enough screen time to prevent the whole thing from becoming a Hope showcase, as most of his later films did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a point of semantics on its UK release the then censor(? Lord Tyrrell of Avon) decided it was more scary than amusing despite the presence of Bob Hope and clamped the "H" for horrific cert on it. Following the outbreak of war &amp; the general hardening of contemporary attitudes away from the earlier 30s, Paramount reissued "Cat" with the reduced "A" cert( PG)as the support to P Sturges' farce "Miracle of Morgan's Creek" as if to reverse the emphasis &amp; offering a great 3 hrs of fun. This would previously have classed it with such as "Dark Eyes of London"/"Son of Frankenstein"/"Boy Slaves"/ "Monster &amp; The Girl" &amp; Warner's "Hell's Kitchen". And incidentally,to mitigate the childish terrors of some contributors, the cat's hand or claw appearing out of the sliding panel while P Goddard was apparently asleep was grasping for that valuable necklace - not her throat. And on a point of curiosity, in a couple of books with illustrations. I have been mystified by a "still" from this movie, showing P Goddard,on some steps, very apprehensively pointing a torch down one of the secret passages and clearly in the foreground is an unpleasant disfigured cloaked figure grasping a wooden lever that could have been her pursuer. You can look in vain for this frame, it is not in the film. For any fellow historians, a similar cut was made much earlier in the F March version of "Jekyll &amp; Hyde" as he is slumped in a chair staring into the fire seeing the image of his alter ego in the flames. You won't find this either."I'm used to empty houses - I used to be in Vaudeville".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this movie as a young child and it was my introduction to Horror, it changed my view of films. Films were no longer filled by colourful animated characters or zany glove puppets. The world can be murky, where even the funny can be endangered. The movie is your archetypal 'Haunted House' movie. The type of film that explains why ghost trains were invented. The fear of the unknown, the fear of being watched, the fear of hidden passages.A group of equally disparate and distant family members are gathered on a small island to hear the reading of wealthy, reclusive Uncle's last will and testament. Things take a turn for the worse when an inmate known as 'The Cat' escapes from the local institute, sending the destitute cast into panic.Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard play a likable screen couple that the audience can believe in. Hope is the mouthy, witty and cowardly Wally who is appointed as guard to the eventual heiress. Threats come from moving wall panels, hidden passages behind bookcases, jealous relatives and 'The Cat.' Superb entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you watch these old things, you must guess about what they were when they were new.Are what we now see as clichés not clichés but have become so since? Would the genre have been solid by then and ready for self-referential comedy? For instance Bob Hope arrives and starts to mention how movies like this always go. He says that at this point such and such usually happens, and then that thing does happen. Was that a new thing then?I suppose that what we see as cliché's were already solid clichés. And that the genre was well established but that genres meant something quite different then. There were fewer and the format in each genre was more narrowly defined. So cliché wasn't quite the negative thing it is today, rather consisting of familiar touchstones. Genres were a new thing, really only taking on something like their modern meaning in the thirties. So by the end of the thirties they were solid enough to start getting the humorous self-reference like this, and what would later be the Abbot and Costello formula, recently evolved into "Scream" and its children.Here's an example in this movie. It is a remote mansion where ghosts are suspected and spooky happenings occur. Secret passages. Murders. A lost necklace. Early in the game a uniformed policeman shows up and says that he is chasing an escapee from the nearby insane asylum. All during the action, he hovers outside.Caution here: there are spoilers that follow for the 1934 "The Ghost Walks."This plot device is from that quite popular earlier movie. Viewers would recognize it, because it is so oddly shoehorned in. In the 34 movie, there's a clever twist in that the uniformed guy turns out to be the killer; he's the escaped inmate in disguise. So to have this inserted here (it wasn't in the earlier versions) can only be because the writers wanted to play with the trick. I study these things where the movie includes external comment on itself. I believe this was formed in the thirties and that this was an important milestone. And "The Ghost Walks" was too, which is why it is referenced here.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cat and the Canary, The (1939) *** (out of 4) Remake of the 1927 silent classic has a group of people showing up for a will reading ten years after the man's death. The entire estate goes to one person (Paulette Goddard) and it doesn't take long for them to realize that someone is trying to kill her. The woman, with the help of a friend (Bob Hope) must try and survive the night while also figuring out a couple secrets about the will. This isn't the greatest film ever made and God knows there were probably way too many of these "old dark house" movies made back in the day but there's no question that this Paramount film has plenty to recommend in it. What I enjoyed most is that they went for the laughs but at the same time they wanted to try and deliver some shocks as just about every horror movie cliché can be found here from the creaking doors to the black cat to the strange maid who of course knew the original owner way too close. The film knows very well the genre it's trying to spoof and I think the movie works so well because they never let the comedy overtake the film and they're smart enough to try and deliver the goods on both accounts. I thought the atmosphere of the film was quite strong as the Louisiana swamp setting really looks terrific. The swamps really build up the atmosphere with the thick fog and creepy noises but it also plays perfectly well with some nice laughs including one bit where Hope becomes worried about the alligators. I'm not the biggest Hope fan in the world but his comedy style was perfect for the material here and it's easy to see why movie audiences would fall in love with this film and it would launch the actor's career. I thought Hope managed the comedy very well and I thought it was a great choice not to follow the footsteps of earlier "old dark house" movies by making his character someone annoying. For a large portion of the film Hope is the "star" but he never comes across as someone leading the action and instead he just sits back and reacts to what the others are doing. Goddard once again shines in her role and you really can't help but fall in love with her easy and fun character. The supporting players include George Zucco and Gale Sondergaard. This story was told several times before and since but there's no question that this here is one of the most interesting ways to tell the story. Again, it's far from a masterpiece but fans of Hope will certainly want to check it out as will fans of the genre.</fullReview>
