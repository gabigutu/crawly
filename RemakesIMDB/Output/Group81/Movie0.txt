		<shortDescription>Influential Silent Film Is Still Amusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1922 play THE CAT AND THE CANARY was so popular that it made the fortune of author John Willard, who lived to see it filmed no fewer than three times before his death in 1942. Even today the story remains a classic of its kind, inspiring a host of films that mix comedy, mystery, and horror--not to mention still more that focus on suspicious doings in old, dark houses. When questioned by author Gavin Lambert, director James Whale very specifically indicated that the 1927 film version, along with the 1928 THE LAST WARNING, influenced his own work in such films as FRANKENSTEIN and THE OLD DARK HOUSE.Both THE CAT AND THE CANARY and THE LAST WARNING were created for Universal by director Paul Leni. But while THE LAST WARNING is not presently available to the home market, THE CAT AND THE CANARY most certainly is, and even some eighty years later is possible to see what all the fuss was about. In term of cinematography, CAT is a remarkably imaginative film, using a series of over-lapping images, close-ups, and dissolves to astonishing effect. In a visual sense it is easily one of the most stylish films of the silent era.The plot is a classic of its kind. Like the original Willard play, the film's story mixes a host of already-clichéd ideas with several then-new ones. Today, of course, it can be a bit difficult to them apart! But even so it remains a fair amount of fun. An eccentric millionaire has been hounded to death by his greedy relatives--and when he dies he leaves behind a will that imposes a twenty year waiting period between his death and delivery of his estate to his heir. But who will the heir be? The candidates assemble to hear the will at midnight... and no sooner is the heir named than strange doings are afoot.The characters are archetypes: the nice girl (Laura La Plante), the mild-mannered boy (Creighton Hale), the fashion princess (Gertrude Astor), the battle ax matron (Flora Finch), and so on. Perhaps most memorable is the housekeeper (Martha Mattox), an exceedingly dour woman most ironically named Mammy Pleasant! Add in an exasperated lawyer, a creepy doctor, secret passages, hairy hands with needle-like finger nails, stolen diamonds, and as many dashes of comedy as you can get away with, mix well, and you have the inspiration for a seemingly endless list of classic films.Although they may seem overly broad by modern standards, the cast plays at the level of what was considered comic-realistic in the late silent era, the production values are first rate, and the plot is quirky enough in a silly sort of way to make the whole thing fun. But it is really the direction and the look of the thing that scores; in its best moments, THE CAT AND THE CANARY is plenty good indeed.The film is available in several DVD releases. You should avoid the Alpha release; although the picture is passable, the score is so dire that it completely undermines the film. Although it clearly needs further restoration, the Image release is superior and offers your choice of scores, both of which work with the film rather than against it. Recommended for silent fans and those interested in the development of the classic horror film!Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Silent Is Golden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This late silent movie shows off the considerable talents of its director, Paul Leni, as the camera prowls the environs of an old dark house with the gracefulness of a cat, while the actors bob around like canaries, forming uneasy alliances and plotting against one another. The cast is well chosen. Laura La Plante makes a lovely heroine, while bespectacled Creighton Hale makes an agreeable, somewhat Harold Lloyd-like hero. Tully Marshall and Martha Mattox represent, none too flatteringly, the older generation; the former has the face of a drawn, white prune, while the latter makes a perfect battle-axe as the ironically named Mammy Pleasant. By today's standards the movie isn't too scary, though its mood of foreboding is still effective. Its qualities are pictorial more than dramatic, and the print I saw was badly in need of restoration. The Cat and the Canary is a key film of the silent era, and was hugely influential in kicking off the old dark house genre that continued into the early talkie period. When sound came in the wisecracks proliferated, which tended to lighten the mood and detract from the suspense. In this one the humor is visual, and the tone is more consistent. There have been dozens remakes and imitations over the years, but the dark, Gothic beauty of the original has never been surpassed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you take it as a good-natured send-up of the 'old dark house' genre, or simply as a semi-serious horror/comedy, either way "The Cat and the Canary" is good entertainment. The atmosphere in the dusty old mansion is done very well, with plenty of creativity, and the story moves at a good pace and is told well. These are more than enough to make up for a few plot holes and a couple of characters that are left undeveloped.The cat/canary image, which was deliberately exaggerated somewhat, is simple but it ties the story and characters together rather well. Most of the characters are interesting, although a couple of them never really take shape. Most of the performers seemed to enjoy their roles, and they worked well together, with most of them making good use of their moments in the spotlight.If you enjoy silent movies, you should find this a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half or so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Enjoyable Silent Creeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the deadly game between THE CAT AND THE CANARY, so a young heiress feels trapped in a very peculiar haunted house, surrounded by lurking, unseen evils...This is a dandy old creeper of a silent horror film, with just the right mix of menace &amp; mirth to please the uncritical viewer. Universal gave the movie very fine production values, which extend not only to the atmospheric sets, but also to the humorously spooky title cards scattered throughout.This film is really story driven, rather than dominated by the personalities of its stars. However, mention should be made of very entertaining performances by Tully Marshall as the scabrous old lawyer, Flora Finch as a terrified auntie, and Lucien Littlefield as an exceedingly strange doctor. Laura La Plante as the lovely, frightened heiress &amp; Creighton Hale as her nervous, scatterbrained cousin give a light touch to the romantic subplot.THE CAT AND THE CANARY is a choice example from the Old Dark House genre of spook tales. All the elements are here: distressed young ladies, a crumbling mansion, a housekeeper of baleful aspect, a lawyer who knows too much, an escaped lunatic, stalking ghosts or monsters, missing wills, meetings at midnight, bony and/or hairy hands appearing from hidden bedroom panels, secret passageways, and sudden death. Unnerved characters are forever making silly choices which always lead them into the clutches of the ravening ghosts/monsters/lunatics. But the Old Dark House has for long years been a respected avenue in literature &amp; movies to maximize suspense &amp; tension. Indeed, it's only a short walk from West Mansion in this film to Wuthering Heights, Baskerville Hall, Manderley &amp; the Bates House...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent ! All that needs to be said.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love watching movies from years ago, particularly silent films. Some are good, some I cannot finish. However, there are those films that are simply brilliant. The Cat and the Canary falls into the latter. I have watched this over and over and marvel at how real it seems. The viewer's post prior to this was accurate in everything she said. The sets were so realistic, I actually thought it was a real haunted house. My particular favorite scene is the opening, as the camera pans down the hallway, with the curtains blowing in the wind. Very ethereal, ghostly feel. As far as the acting, I could find no fault with any of it. This is simply a wonderful movie and is worth viewing again and again. I feel guilty only spending $5 for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read other user comments on this film, and I want to add my own. "The Cat and The Canary" is one of those films that is often spoken about as being one of the classic horror films of the silent era, and after watching this film it is easy to see why.From the opening sequence, of a hand brushing away dust and cobwebs to reveal the films title, to the closing shot, the film is very spooky. Yes, I will say that at times the film is almost too spooky, and that some of the acting is overdone.The plot of the film is simple: 20 years after a wealthy and thought to be insane man has died, his family gathers to read the contents of his will.Those who see this film will see all types of cliches in the horror movie genre, hidden panels, hands reaching out from behind walls, creepy shadows, but the interesting thing to note is that this film was among the first to use these effects, in other words you are seeing these things occur before they became commonplace.This was an early horror film made by Universal Pictures, fresh on the success of other classic Universal horror films like Phantom of the Opera and Hunchback of Notre Dame.The director of this film, Paul Leni, was German, and the film directly relates that. This film is a classic example of how German filmmaking influenced American films. If you like this film, and especially the camera style, stylish sets, and the general modd and feel of the film, take a look at other German silent films, and you will love them as well.This film is now Public Domain, and is available on DVD and VHS from several companies. IMDB lists its length in the 80 minute range, however the version I saw, with a new score is 101 minutes long. I highly reccomend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing "Old Dark House" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Cat and the Canary" has been considered a masterpiece, and that the film is still known today is a feat in itself. It is easily my favorite silent film. Paul Leni (the director) has a great deal of prowess on films like these, and it has been admitted by others.First, the sets are realistic, making this film a believable "journey back in time" (it was made over 70 yrs. ago). I am shocked to hear one reviewer say this film as broadly acted and visually stunted. The sets are marvelous, especially the drawing room (it looks very nice to be part of a "haunted house"). The camera work (ex. the skeleton double-exposure, the subtitles occasionally moving like a ghost) is very enjoyable, too.About the acting, first get this straight: Much of the acting is quite normal. But in the fright scenes (especially by Laura La Plante), the acting has nothing wrong with it. Much of it is very funny (contrary to common belief). Flora Finch (Aunt Susan) is funny as the gossiper, and Creighton Hale as Paul is cute. Why do most of you find the broad acting painful to watch? If you can't find silent films enjoyable, all I can tell you is, tough luck. Classic films are as a general rule better than the new ones, but even new films can be very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy Mystery and Horror Silent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The millionaire Cyrus West has spent the last years of his life in his mansion nearby the Hudson River considered insane by his greedy relatives and feeling like a canary in a cage surrounded by cats. When he dies, he stipulates that his lawyer Roger Crosby (Tully Marshall) would read his will that is kept in a safe in the twentieth anniversary of his death. On the scheduled day, Cyrus West's loyal servant Mammy Pleasant (Martha Mattox) and the lawyer welcome the guests in the creepy mansion that people tells that is inhabited by ghosts: West's nephews Harry Blythe (Arthur Edmund Carewe), Charles "Charlie" Wilder (Forrest Stanley), the scared Paul Jones (Creighton Hale), Aunt Susan Sillsby (Flora Finch), Cecily Young (Gertrude Astor) and West's niece Annabelle West (Laura La Plante). When Roger Crosby opens the will, West's mansion and fortune are left to the most distant relative having the name West, meaning Annabelle. However, she should prove first that she is sane; otherwise, the inheritance would be bequeathed to another heir whose name is in a sealed envelope. Out of the blue, a guard (George Siegmann) comes to the mansion and tells that a dangerous lunatic has fled from an institution. During the night, Roger Crosby disappears and Annabelle receives an envelope from Mammy Pleasant where West tells the location of his precious diamonds. Annabelle finds the jewels and wears a necklace, but while she is sleeping, a hand comes from the wall and steals the diamonds from her neck. With the exception of Paul Jones that loves Annabelle, her relatives believe that she is insane. But when Annabelle finds a hidden chamber in the wall with the body of Roger Crosby, Mammy Pleasant decides to call the police and the identity of the lunatic is disclosed."The Cat and the Canary" is a creepy mystery and horror silent film by the German Expressionist director Paul Leni. The plots blends black humor with elements of horror using the atmosphere of the expressionism with shadows and lighting, and the result is a stylish movie where even the inter-titles are funny. The beauty of Laura La Plante is very impressive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Gato e o Canário" ("The Cat and the Canary")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The prototype for all haunted house thrillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been restored by Kevin Brownlow and Photoplay Productions. The new print is beautiful and shows why Paul Leni was considered a master. Sure, the plot is slight, but Leni is so imaginative and unrestrained in his style that you just sit there with your mouth open in amazement. Most every shot is a masterpiece. The sets and photography are wonderful. There's way too much silly humor in it -- Leni's far more effective at the scary moments. But leading lady La Plante is effective; and the more ghoulish secondary roles are handled with relish. You wonder why most haunted house movies of the 30's and 40's didn't have this much style. They should have learned from the Master. I hope this restored version makes it out on DVD soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the stereotypical old dark house movie, all the relatives come to and old dark house and some one begins to kill them, or tries to. This has been remade several times, each version having its flaws and its strengths. This is the first version, and while I would like to say its the best, I can't since the silent medium has rendered its pace a bit too slow for modern audiences.This isn't to say that its a bad film. Its not. Anyone interested in film and what can be done with it should see this film because the first half of this movie is a treasure trove of cinema techniques. The first half is also a damn good movie as well since it wonderfully sets everything up. Only as things begin to follow there course does the pacing slow. Its far from bad, it just may have you look at your watch now and again.I give it seven out of ten, not perfect but watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kino Does It Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen The Cat and the Canary several times before I sat down to watch the Kino transfer. It has amazing clarity, a beautifully appropriate score, and does more than ample justice to one of the cornerstones of the silent era and the horror genre respectively. The story is simple enough: a wealthy man dies leaving his money to an heir detailed in a sealed envelope for all to see years after his death. We are introduced to the main star of the film early on - the eerie, creepy, web-strewn house. A house filled with long-flowing drapes, creaky(we must imagine) steps, mazes of twisting hallways, a series of hidden compartments and passageways all over, and the obligatory servant that hangs on to her job years after her employer has passed away. Director Paul Leni knows how to set the mood and make atmosphere reign supreme as his camera lens moves to shadows and light with the greatest of ease. The acting complements the atmosphere with great turns really by all involved. Tully Marshall, though in a small role, makes more impact with his little screen time than other actors would be capable of doing. Martha Mattox, as Mammy Pleasant of all names, is exceedingly creepy and effective as the old maid of the manse. Beautiful Laura LaPlante is the heiress who must spend a night amidst jealous, vengeful, greedy relatives. LaPlante has an exquisite smile and grace about her and effectively can go from light horror to light comedy. But Leni makes more than just a horror film here with Creighton Hale as Paul Jones, LaPlante's cousin and love interest. With Hale Leni relies heavily on mixing horror and atmosphere with broad light comedy. Hale, with his Harold Lloyd glasses and look, really is quite amusing as a bungling, easily frightened man who gets to relive his adolescent crush. The other actors are just dandy(seems to work in a review for a film this old) and the killer is not terribly hard to figure out - but that is secondary to the mood, tension, pace, and characterizations that lead to his/her unveiling. The Kino print is really just gorgeous. The music is just right and the title cards are perfect. Two scenes in particular stand out for me as classic Leni: One, Mattox, with candle in hand walking down a corridor with a row of windows draped and blowing as the winds blows indiscriminately and two, Tully Marshall about to read the name of the heir should LaPlante be proved to be crazy. Wonderfully shot! An ageless classic of the silent cinema for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exceptional production values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had incredible production values--with amazing and creepy cinematography and an excellent musical score in the latest restored version. They did so much to set the mood and make this a genuinely scary film.The story concerns a rich old guy who has written a strange will. It is only to be read after 20 years and remains sealed until that time. His surviving relatives all return like vultures to pick at the fortune but instead of dividing it among them, he leaves it to one of them with another to receive the fortune if anything happens to the sole inheritor. Naturally, bad things start to happen and the film becomes a whodunit. At times it's really good--with lots of trap doors and suspense, but it also suffers from predictability. The actual conclusion isn't all that surprising. Considering how few potential murderers there are among them and how the one guy sneaks away early in the film with a flimsy excuse, it isn't too surprising who is doing all the bad things in the old dark home.It's very entertaining and fun--just not exactly the best conclusion I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best Old Dark House film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of both horror films and silent films, but I didn't have a chance to get around to this one until now--and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Other reviewers have already indicated how well-directed it is, and some have pointed out that the "overacting" is intentional in what was always understood by 1927 audiences as a spoof of the "Old Dark House" genre that was popular on Broadway for much of the decade and spilled onto the movie screen. Once you understand that everyone KNEW these were cliches, you realize there's no reason to take a patronizing attitude. I have to say this is the most satisfying "ODH" film I've seen (not considering actual haunted house films like the first version of "The Haunting"). It has a light touch and almost every shot makes some delightful choice--moving camera, jarring close-up, dutch angle, etc. Director Leni succeeds in making this stage play seem cinematic. One shot has a frightened character speeding through the corridor, apparently on an unseen bicycle! The shot of the body falling down out of a closet onto the camera has been much imitated, both seriously (as in "Public Enemy") and as parody (Warner Bros. cartoons). For a quick comparison, check Roland West's early talkie "The Bat Whispers." Although nothing in "Cat" reaches quite the level of West's most astonishing shots, the film as a whole is more satisfying and less stagey.</fullReview>

This one now replaces the earlier 1998 Image version altogether and has many improvements in it. I've seen several favorable reviews of this new version in several of the better silent film websites. Also, take care to avoid discount versions on this film. You'll be disappointed. This preservation effort was headed by David Shepard of Film Preservation Associates, as it was remastered from a very good quality 35mm print. It's visually far better than any other version I've seen. Also, there are TWO scores to choose from. The default score is an original composed by Franklin Stover with the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra performing. The other score consists of the original 1927 score by James Bradford, performed on synth-org by Eric Beheim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cat And The Canary (Paul Leni, 1927) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall being somewhat underwhelmed by this on first viewing (its reputation having ensured it a place in my very first online DVD purchase!) but, rewatching the film now, sees it elevated to its rightful place among the best horror films of the Silent era - indeed one of the great Silents, period.It's the quintessential "old dark house" film which, in their 1920s heyday, seemed to always incorporate comedy (since many of these had actually originated on the stage). Of its kind, I've also watched THE MONSTER (1925; starring Lon Chaney) as well as the Talkie remake of THE BAT (1926), called THE BAT WHISPERS (1930) - all of these, incidentally, were made by director Roland West; one more I'd love to catch up with is Benjamin Christensen's SEVEN FOOTPRINTS TO Satan (1929), though two other films he did in the same vein - THE HAUNTED HOUSE (1928) and HOUSE OF HORROR (1929) - are, regrettably, considered lost! Leni himself directed THE LAST WARNING (1929; though that was actually set inside a theater).Anyway, the film certainly provided the right atmosphere: visually, it's a real treat (even if the DVD I own is the earlier Image edition, i.e. not the Remastered one) - highlighting Gilbert Warrenton's mobile camera and optical effects and Charles D. Hall's fantastic set design (but even the title cards bring their own inventiveness!). The cast, some of whom are familiar (such as Tully Marshall, Arthur Edmund Carewe, George Siegmann and Lucien Littlefield), is well-assembled - even if none of the roles require much depth and are more or less stereotypes, such as the 'fraidy cat' who eventually makes good, the elder female relative (equally terrified), the sinister-looking old servant-woman devoted to her dead master, the innocent and put-upon heroine, etc.While the pace is somewhat slow (the plot really gets going during the second half), the film is tremendously entertaining all the way through; when I first watched it, I had felt that too much attention was given to the comic relief but this time around I saw the film's mixture of thrills and laughter as more evenly balanced (and the gags themselves not terribly archaic). With respect to the horror element, it's not so much to the fore - since the film is more of a thriller really; in fact, "The Cat" itself doesn't feature in it all that much, but there's no denying that it's a memorably ghoulish creation! The end credits themselves are quite amusing: reproducing the cast list (which would come to be a Universal trademark) so that patrons could cite those participants who had particularly pleased them - followed by a request by company President Carl Laemmle, urging the public to write to him personally with their opinion of the film! The score (which is a re-recording of the original accompaniment to the film) sounds awfully familiar and was probably re-used for other Silents or subsequent Universal horror films.Some years ago I had also watched the 1978 remake of THE CAT AND THE CANARY (surprisingly directed by Radley Metzger, better known for his ventures in Erotica!) and would love to get to the 1939 version which cemented Bob Hope's popularity and is, actually, as highly regarded as the original(!); unfortunately, it's only available in a reportedly atrocious print on Region 2 DVD...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperfect yet Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If, like me, you've heard this movie for years touted as one of the most influential silent horrors of all time, you may be a tad disappointed. As Mike Weldon points out in the `Psychotronic Video Guide,' midnight will-readings and creaky old houses were already old hat by the late twenties, and this film probably got as many giggles as shudders even in its day. Nevertheless, there are some nice camera-effects and decent sets, and for fans of the genre, it remains a must. A particularly noteworthy image is the chiming of the long-dead clock, with its innards superimposed upon the characters collected for the reading of the will.Plotwise, I was surprised firstly by the hero's (perhaps unwitting) resemblance to Harold Lloyd - accentuated by the presence of `Haunted Spooks' at the end of the tape. Noticeably lacking, however, is Lloyd's irreverence and comic timing ? this fellow just winds up being a comedy-relief dud, oddly reminiscent of the wanna-be adventurer from `Seven Footprints to Satan.' Even Lloyd's most clownish characters would not have missed the obvious romantic interest of the heroine, or failed to at least pretend to be macho in front of her (with the usual hilarious results). Our boy in `Canary,' however, seems to be entirely unaware of his opportunities.Without needing to give anything away, I was also a bit disappointed by the final revelation of `whodunit.' In fairness, that means I didn't manage to predict the perpetrator ? but this was more because the film did not play fair and offer enough clues than because of its brilliant web of complexity. That certain characters are more than they would seem is obvious, and the primary `red herring' of the film is easily detected, but one needs a fuller appreciation of the motivations of our various suspects in order to make a reasoned guess. This is particularly important in a silent film, where so much has to be judged by facial expressions and visual cues.It would not be fair to place blame upon Paul Leni for the unfortunate score on the videotape, which was obviously composed by someone from the "some guy with a Casio" school of music.On the whole, however, `Cat and the Canary' has its place as a classic of the `spooky old house' genre, whether it invented the cliches or merely enhanced them, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to any viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always tend to get a bit soft and emotional when commenting on old films, such as the 1927 version of "The Cat and the Canary". Just imagine ? 85 years of age, this film is, and it still manages to find its way to new audiences. Everyone of the cast and crew is long dead and ? to put it a bit less respectful ? decomposed ? but at least their legacy will live on for much longer than mine or yours (probably). "The Cat and the Canary" even still reaches fairly large new audiences, as I watched it in an artsy theater during a thematic festival and complete with musical guidance on the piano. Paul Leni's version of "The Cat and the Canary" isn't just the first of many adaptations of the famous stage play by John Willard, it also still stands as the ultimate and most prototypic Old Dark House horror. All the trademarks ? commonly referred to as clichés nowadays ? can be found here in this trendsetter, and presumably for the first time ever: the reading of the will at midnight, the ominous housemaid, the mysteriously vanishing notary, the secret passageways in the library and behind the bed, the clumsy comic relief cousin ? and yes ? even the predictable identity of the maniacal killer on the loose. This film is a joy to behold, thanks to the splendid performances (particularly Tully Marshall as the stern notary, Martha Maddox as the creepy maid and Laura La Plante as the cherubic victim) and the atmosphere that is simultaneously frightful and light-headed! Through some imaginative camera angles, Leni generates and handful of spooky moments but the overall tone remains accessible for wider audiences. There are a few obvious holes in the plot (like for example the main heiress being too young for a testament that lingered around for two decades) but you will gladly overlook those. Silence is golden!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I always look under the bed but I've never found anything yet".I really enjoyed The Cat and the Canary, but I'm at somewhat of a loss to explain exactly what it is that I liked. Not that anything in it was bad-on the contrary, pretty much everything about it was good.The story is simple enough. A wealthy man dies, but stipulates that his will should not be read until twenty years after his death. At that time, assuming she is of sound mind, he leaves his entire fortune to his niece. If a doctor finds her to be insane, then the fortune is left to an unnamed person found in an envelope held by the attorney reading the will. But he disappears in the house before informing the heirs who this would be, and it seems that someone is out to make the niece insane, or worse.IMDb lists this as a horror movie and a mystery, and while I would agree with that classification, I would also have to say that this film is a comedy. There are too many comical aspects for it not to be counted as such. But this film does a great job of setting up a "spooky" atmosphere and carries with it an aura of suspense and mystery that lasts throughout the whole film.There are a lot of haunted house clichés in this film, but it is early enough that these were probably (at least in some cases) not clichés at the time-I suspect this may be the film in which the beginnings of the cliché are found. At any rate, it is an entertaining movie which I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic Grand Guignol comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>German director Paul Leni seems, from my personal experience with his films, to be one of the more lighthearted directors to apply expressionist horror techniques to his films. At first glance this might make his films appear as somewhat routine, but there has to be something said for taking horrific subjects and turning them into comedy or adventure, as he's done here in this much-imitated mystery/suspense vehicle derived from the Broadway hit. He exists in roughly the same tradition as the French "Grand Guignol" -- the elaborate setup makes it possible for the audience to have fun with being "chilled." In this case, we have what would today be a very standard haunted house situation. Relatives of an old man who went insane return to his mansion 20 years later to hear the reading of his Will. As part of the Will's conditions, the person receiving the inheritance (who turns out to be a character played by lovely Laura La Plante) must be adjudged sane by a doctor, so someone in the group is trying to drive her insane or make her appear insane so that they can win the money.It's very obvious to the audience from the beginning that there are no real ghosts, so the fun in the movie is largely watching the way that the characters are scared by the possibility. There is one character, played by Creighton Hale (who later made B movies for AIP and other companies) who is just completely there for comic relief, and yet he is also the only man in the movie who's sincere and wants to help Annabelle (La Plante). A lot of elements in the movie were probably cliché already by the time it came out, but others were inventive.I didn't find the film visually as exciting as some other films in the same genre such as Roland West's "The Bat" or James Whale's "The Old Dark House". Also the performances are pretty much by rote. However there's just a kind of breeziness to the whole thing that makes it fun. And a couple of scenes were very well done visually, such as the scene with Annabelle's pearls being stolen. The use of the looming title card there would be an ideal example of how title cards were used to enhance film artistry rather than as a limitation. In fact that scene in particular very much reminded me of the way Alfred Hitchcock shot the very beginning of "To Catch a Thief" with the jewelry theft. None of the images are quite as disturbing today as those in Whale's and West's films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish Spoofery of the Old Haunted House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laura La Plante (as Annabelle West) and an assortment of greedy relatives gather at a Gothic Old Mansion to hear the reading of The Will. Relatively soon, we learn The Fortune will be inherited by young Ms. La Plante; however, she must be declared Sane by a doctor - naturally, this is an incentive for someone to drive the dear girl Insane! This is a stylishly shot silent "comedy/thriller" spoof of "haunted house" stories - like "The Bat" (a 1920 play, and 1926 movie). La Plante and Creighton Hale (as Paul Jones) are okay as the nominal "leads", but the veteran cast must have been much more amusing to the typical 1920s viewer. Tully Marshall (as Mr. Crosby) and Lucien Littlefield (as the Doctor) were two of the best supporting actors around, and Flora Finch (as Aunt Susan) must have been considered a film legend in 1927 - they are all a hoot, but Martha Mattox really steals the "The Cat and the Canary" with her terrific turn as haunted house hostess "Mammy Pleasant"! Interestingly, this was an adaptation of a (1922) stage play - oddly "silent" films made much better movies out of plays than did later "sound" adaptations. Some may argue "sound" productions never figured out how to turn a good stage play into a good movie. Director Paul Leni and Gilbert Warrenton were among those making art (more or less) out of silent film. By the way, there is a scene with the possible "killer" walking in from the right of the screen; but, this is not a "who-done-it" movie as much as it is a spoof of said? ******** The Cat and the Canary (9/9/27) Paul Leni ~ Laura La Plante, Creighton Hale, Martha Mattox, Flora Finch</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one eerie movie. That it is over 75 years old shouldn't detract from its place among "scary movies." The production values are scrumptious. The acting is a bit over the top (Aunt Susan) but all in all, an eerie night with shadows and interesting interplay among the characters. But the Paul/Annabelle relationship is a bit creepy. Aren't they (gasp!) cousins????? The hairy hand is a bit over the top too. Mammy Pleasant (is her name an inside joke?) is waaay too menacing. I saw this on TMC (loved the sepia tone) and the soundtrack is exhilarating, though a tad too fast for the action. This is a gem of a horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twenty years after the death of Cyrus West, his remaining relatives come to his foreboding manor to hear the reading of the will. Cyrus leaves his estate (including the prized West Pearls) to his most distant relative, Annabelle West. The will also stipulates that Annabelle must be deemed sane by a doctor the following morning or she will forfeit the estate and it would be left to another of West's heirs whose named is sealed in an envelope. The person mentioned in the envelope starts a campaign to terrorize Annabelle and convince everyone else in the house that she is insane, including kidnapping the lawyer Crosby. Its up to Annabelle and her distant relative (and romantic interest) Paul uncover the guilty party. This film is a real treat for Old Dark House fans with plenty of suspense, thrills, and mystery to keep the audience in attention from beginning to end. The cast is non-descript with no one really stands out, but Leni's direction and Warrenton's cinematography create the exact mood the film needs. The film's drawbacks are Hale's characterization of Paul and the characters of Cecily and Aunt Susan, who become annoying to watch. Rating, 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie set the bar for the "who-done-its" and may very well be the inspiration for the game of "Clue". The death of a rich uncle brings the family to a crumbling and of course, dark mansion for a reading of the will. The uncle who was driven crazy by his greedy family put a stipulation on the will that it could not be opened until 20 years after his death. As the family gathers together along with the family lawyer a second will is discovered in the locked safe with the original will. This mysterious second will claims a second heir if the first one cannot meet the conditions of the first will. The condition set by Uncle Cyrus was the sanity of the heir must be proved by a doctor. You can all guess what happens next, all sorts of spooky goings on that test the sanity of the heir including lawyers disappearing through secret passageways, diamond necklaces being stolen in the middle of the night and lunatics escaping from the asylum and taking up residency in the mansion. A terrific thriller, dark and brooding, terrific overacting by the lead character and inheritor of the fortune, Annabelle West and the brilliant portrayal of the housekeeper named Mammy. The movie is made better by the fact that it is a silent film. I highly recommend watching it with the lights on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a lawyer arrives at the estate of a recently-deceased client for a reading of the will, he finds that there's a living moth inside the safe he sealed twenty years earlier. Clearly, something's not quite right in THE CAT AND THE CANARY. The ensuing attempts by various and sundry people to gain possession of the dead man's riches (by legally proving that the heiress is insane) leads to some classic Horror Movie moments (and images ingrained in many minds long ago by Forrest J. Ackerman's FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND)- moments that have been "re-imagined" a million times since. There's also a Harold Lloyd look-alike who has perhaps the best line in the movie. "Don't interrupt me," he says at one point: "I think I'm thinking." Besides these assets, THE CAT AND THE CANARY offers some amazingly MODERN filmmaking techniques (not to mention the greatest number of dissolves and super-impositions I think I've ever seen). It's called a classic for a reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most CLASSIC 'old mansion mysteries' of all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title clearly suggests, this is a murderous 'game' of the hunter and the hunted... It all starts - where else - in the dark old mansion of a dying millionaire, who draws his will, to be opened only 20 years after his death... So, after all those years have passed, his relatives all assemble in the creepy old house - every one of them, of course, hoping that he or she will be the sole heir to the fortune. But first arrives the old man's attorney, to greet the old housekeeper (Martha Mattox, who specialized in roles like this, and fits perfectly into the spooky atmosphere) - and to find that the safe has been opened recently, and the papers have been tampered with...And then the family members make their appearance one by one; but the feeling between them, of course, isn't very friendly. Finally, the old clock strikes midnight, and the attorney opens the will; and it declares the deceased's niece Annabelle (Laura La Plante) as the 'winner' - under ONE condition: that a physician has to prove her mentally sane! Otherwise the fortune will go to the person mentioned in a second envelope that's still sealed...So we can all imagine what's bound to follow: a night of terror, with the attorney being murdered, tales of the old man's 'ghost' spooking around, a warden coming in and speaking of an escaped lunatic - in short, everything possible is being done to drive the 'canary' Annabelle crazy...This is a CLASSIC among the Classics of the genre, perfectly directed and acted, with a very effective musical score, constant games with shadows on the wall, nice (and very modern for the time) camera effects to enhance the suspense; and of course the whole 'old dark house' repertoire with turning bookshelves, terrifying claws reaching out from behind every corner, dark figures walking through the old halls... And there even is some comical relief, provided by Annabelle's cowardly cousin Paul (Creighton Hale); the entertainment as well as the suspense value - not to speak of the historical importance - of this movie is really immeasurable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome back to This Old Dark House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remade about five times, this is the grandfather of haunted house films. But, fear not, gentle viewer, not all tis scary here. This plays more as a comedy than a horror or thriller. Oh, there are a few moments when the lady viewers may swoon and require a hand fan or a handkerchief, but as a whole, you'll be smiling.About as good of a silent film as your likely to see, especially with this subject matter, the director has a great eye for setting the stage for a spooky night in a haunted mansion. There are some excellent overlapping shots, especially of the aged, sickly homeowner in a "cage" of medicine bottles surrounded by giant, snarling black cats. Long hallways, stormy night, billowing curtains, creeping shadows, hidden rooms, hidden passages, old cobweb-covered gears running the show on the other side of the walls, and the complimentary maniac complete with fake bulging eye and monstrous bulldog teeth stalking the unsuspecting guests---what more could you ask for? The old man died, leaving a will that requested all those who might stand a chance to inherit any of his loot should return to the old house 20 years to the day after his death for his lawyer to handle the estate. A handful of distant relatives arrives, including the sole inheritor, Annabelle, plus nerdy Paul, Aunt Susan, Cecily, and two other idiots. We also are haunted with the spectral image of the very much alive Mammy Pleasant who would make Frau Blucher cry. Then, naturally, during the course of the evening, an escaped mental patient has made his way to the grounds of the estate and could be inside, followed by his pursuer, a burly hospital security guard with a hat that reads "Guard." I would have enjoyed this even more if it was played totally straight, but there is plenty o' comedy here. Can't say enough about the cinematography and atmosphere. I would have thought a great ruse would have been to use Paul as the killer, since he seemed the nerdiest and most frightened of the bunch(he even hides in the girls' bedroom and gets jammed in the backside with a bedspring for his trouble). But, there are plenty of other red herrings to go around, and you will find yourself counting who is present and who is not during different scenes to see if you can figure out the killer before the film's action packed fight at the end. If you are already a fan of silent films, then this would be a good film to introduce to your friends, spouse, or children if they are reluctant to "read" a movie. Tons of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apparitions from another world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those must-see-at-least-once haunted house films, being one of the originals. I've seen it more than a few times. It took me years to track it down on VHS, nowadays it seems everywhere on digital platforms. It was very well done, a very pleasant comedy and well worth while and yet imho is nowhere near as good as the 1939 remake, that is if comparisons between silents and talkies are permitted. To me it's the same story therefore the two are comparable, although the 1979 version is probably best utterly forgotten if not completely forgivable for being such a time waster.Various quirky guests assemble at huge spooky mansion at midnight exactly 20 years after the death of their eccentric relative Cyrus West to hear the reading of his Will and who gets his money. It always struck me as odd that the greedy relatives didn't initially contest the bizarre rule, after all some of them might have joined him Upstairs in the intervening 2 decades! Creighton Hale and Laura La Plante played the lead characters of Paul and Annabelle excellently ? but unfortunately without the same sparkle Bob Hope and Paulette Godard had when playing Wally and Joyce 12 years later. However, the 1927 version had some nifty camera-work, inventive intertitles, some witty moments (especially Aunt Susan encountering the wide eyed Paul under her bed!) and nice sets with a lovely atmosphere that all still manages to suck you completely into the plot. I would add that the version I just saw ran 93 minutes with a rather stale soundtrack, I thought the tape I watched in the '90's was more sympathetic at 126 minutes long - there's apparently a wide range of versions now available on DVD so a little care in choosing seems required. As I'm still searching for the Perfect Copy this applies to me too!All in all an enjoyable and essential silent film to see even if you don't like the genre; if you do then I would particularly recommend the remake as one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic, Historic Winner, And Not At All Creaky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the course of this film, one of the characters utters the line "Gosh, what a spooky house," and boy, does that line ever ring true! The original "old dark house" story, "The Cat and the Canary" (1927) was based on a John Willard stage play of 1922 and has been filmed no less than four times as of this date. The film shows us what happens when a dead man's will is read in a creepy old house on the Hudson to a bunch of oddball relatives, one of whom, Laura LaPlante, inherits a fortune with the proviso that she passes a sanity test. And poor Laura's sanity IS put to the test that very night, what with an escaped madman on the loose, a possible ghost running around, hands coming out of the walls, mysterious disappearances, and a house full of secret passages, swing-out bookcases and so on. Despite some comedic bits that border on the inane but never quite cross that fine line, "The Cat and the Canary" is genuinely creepy in parts. It also features excellent photography, interesting camera angles, expressionistic and surrealistic backdrops, some blatant symbolism, fascinating use of superimposed images and an appropriately strange score. The dialogue cards are at times very imaginative, and this crisp-looking print has been nicely color tinted for our viewing pleasure. As usual in many silents, the comedic, cowardly character proves to be more than he initially appears. But I'm not giving anything away here; most viewers will never guess who the murderer/ess is in this film. It's a classic, historic winner, not at all creaky, and even suitable for the kiddies. I do recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing yet eerie silent haunted house romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A charming silent film about a group of relatives and friends who gather in a creepy old mansion for the reading of their deceased patriarch's will. I believe this is one of the first films to use the "old dark house" theme, and it uses it well-the setting is indeed dreary and ominous. The lively characters and their amusing antics create a playful atmosphere that counters the creepiness of the house and keeps this from being a complete spook-fest. We have the good girl (lovely Laura La Plante) who is to inherit the patriarch's fortune, and the wacky folks around her who all want a piece of it. Some of these side characters are downright hilarious in their facial expressions and reactions to scares. There's also in an escaped lunatic that may be haunting the grounds. It's all eerie and funny good times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An old man (Cyrus West) dies accusing his relatives of hovering over him--like cats over a canary. 20 years after his death his relatives get together as his will is read in his creepy mansion on a dark and windy night at midnight (of course). One person gets all the money and estate--unless they are proved insane. And how about the escaped lunatic from the nearby asylum...? This is probably one of the first (if not THE first) movie about the reading of the will, a dark and (purportedly) haunted house and people being murdered. Plotwise it's nothing new and contains some terribly unfunny "comedy". Still it's worth catching.It's very well directed by Paul Leni (the juxtaposing of images was clever) and he has fun with the title cards (see how "HELP!" is done). The acting is a little bit overdone (but that's common in silent films) and star Laura La Plante is pretty good. I saw the restored print (which is still in pretty bad shape) and it has an excellent music score that helps too.So, worth catching. No great shakes though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You might think that you cannot take a horror movie with comedy features serious but here they are welcome in what otherwise would be a pretty standard and perhaps tedious film about a house that might be haunted and where mysterious events happen. Comparing this one to the shorter Midnight Faces which has the same premise is like day and night. The Cat and the Canary beats it in every way. The Cat and the Canary starts of with some impressive visuals about the deceased uncle's feelings about his relatives portrayed in a very symbolic way with cats. A few times we see some nice special effects, impressive for its time. The eeriness of the dark mansion remains constant for start to end. The cast is really versatile and fitting with in the starring roles Laura La Plante as the lucky heir Annabelle West, Creighton Hale as the first not so brave and therefore unintentionally funny Paul Jones and of course Flora Finch as aunt Susan whose hysteric talking would drive any sane person crazy (perfect example is when she is picked up by the milkman and drives him nuts with her chattering about ghosts). Honorable mention to Martha Mattox as housekeeper Mammy Pleasant (that name in itself is the biggest paradox when you see her face) whose presence alone does anyone expect there is something scary about the whole thing. And of course the doctor examining Annabelle looked creepy too. Simple but effective story with wonderful characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shadowed Spires Emerging Out of the Darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening of "The Cat and the Canary" is amazing. A layer of dust and cobwebs are wiped away to reveal the opening credits. The mansion is first seen as a tall, distorted silhouette, a series of shadowed spires emerging out of the darkness. The towers of the mansion fade away to a series of glass bottles. Mr. Cyrus West, the ill millionaire watched over by his greedy family, the metaphorical canary, appears in the bottles while cats leer hungrily at him. We cut to a POV shot of someone walking through the shadowy halls of manor, the huge white curtains billowing in the wind. As far as classic Gothic horror imagery goes, this is a buffet.This wasn't the first 'old dark house' movie. D.W. Griffin's "One Exciting Night" predates it and the genre existed on the stage first. If you're looking for a compilation of clichés, this one provides. We've got greedy relatives gathering in a spooky mansion, awaiting the reading of a will. Some are trust-worthy, while others are duplicitous. The mansion has secret doorways, including one in a bookcase. There's an escaped homicidal maniac. Someone tries to discredit the sole female benefactor with old fashion gas-lighting. A dead body falls out of a secret compartment. The villain even wears a fedora. This is clichés 101 and how you feel about that depends on how you feel about classic horror in general.Another hallmark of the 'old dark house' genre is incorporating laughs with thrills. The leading man, Paul (Creighton Hale), hides under beds, gets vexed by giant bed springs, runs around hallways, gets spooked by the creepy maid, and bounces around. It's not hilarious. Another problem is the large cast. The main characters are developed to basic ideas while the supporting cast doesn't even get that much. Laura La Plante as the main heroine does nothing but gets threatened. She's the dullest of the damsel in distress type. The movie ships these two cousins without question which is a little weird. Aunt Susan (Flora Finch) reminded me of Una O'Conner in "Bride of Frankenstein." It's as funny in '27 as it was in '35. The movie drags in its latter half. Since the supporting cast is so thinly devised, you can't guess, nor care, who the killer is.The film isn't without merit. Beyond the amazing opening, there's a cool shot of Paul hiding under bed, lights reflecting in his glasses. The shot of a hand appearing out of the wall, over La Plante's sleeping face, is great. An appearance by a sinister doctor doesn't add to the story but is a weird, off-putting moment. The Cat, the villain, is actually pretty cool looking. One of the fun things about the movie is how it plays with the silent movie titles. Words like 'Ghosts!' and "Help!' are presented in wiggling or growing text, while a series of swears are presented by comic book exclamation."The Cat and the Canary" isn't a great movie but it was, no doubt, influential. Universal made two sound remakes in 1930, one in English, one in Spanish, both of which are lost now. Paramount remade it as a farce starring Bob Hope in '39, probably the most famous version. A British version was produced in the 1960s, somehow by a studio other then Hammer. This isn't discussing all the films that took its clichés and ran with it. Despite all of this, the movie isn't discussed too much today, probably do to the lack of an iconic presence like a Chaney or a Karloff. Some bits are brilliant, even if the overall film doesn't really come together.</fullReview>

The camera strolls down the windy hallways, peeks through furniture, etc. Leni even adds the silent equivalent of a scary sound--at one point a character is startled and yells. As they yell, a huge skull with blazing eyes appears next to them in the frame for just a moment snapping it's jaw. Probably caused quite a start when first shown on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early version of the famous stage play has lots of creepy atmosphere...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any "old dark house" story should have lots of creepy atmosphere and THE CAT AND THE CANARY is no exception. I grew up on the Bob Hope/Paulette Goddard version made in '39 which had all the familiar ingredients we expect in this horror genre, as well as a comedy suited to the talents of Hope and Goddard. And, of course, to make it even more credible, it had Gale Sondergaard as the sinister housekeeper and George Zucco as Mr. Crosby, the lawyer. Unfortunately, like the stage play, it never did have a plausible or really satisfactory solution to the mystery. That weakness is also evident here in the silent version.LAURA LA PLANTE is the distant cousin Annabelle West about to inherit a fortune if she can spend one night in the mansion after the reading of the will by lawyer TULLY MARSHALL, and CREIGHTON HALE (with the spectacles looking a bit like Harold Lloyd) is Paul, the role that Bob Hope played in the later version, a bumbling man in love with the heroine.TCM is showing the silent version with a busy Theramin background score and sepia-tone photography in a restored Photoplay version. The main drawback is that none of the characters are fleshed out and the murderer's character is never fully established at all. But the photography is amazing considering when the film was made and altogether it makes for a pleasurable viewing experience.Highly recommend that anyone who likes this sort of thing ought to check out the Hope/Goddard version to see how the sound version compares to the original. Both versions opt for comedy over horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This silent version of The Cat and the Canary retains its enjoyability</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The version I watched on Amazon was the one issued by Kino with the music score intact. This was quite both a scary and funny movie with Creighton Hale a hoot as the comic hero. This must have been one of the early movies in which a group stays at a haunted house after a reading of a will and the one who stands to inherit it all is the one who gets almost scared of his/her wits. This is the kind of plot I used to regularly watch on "Scooby Doo" cartoons on Saturday mornings when a kid during the '70s. Anyway, I quite enjoyed this silent version of something I watched a talkie version of years back-the one with Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard from 1939. So yeah, that's a recommendation of this version of The Cat and the Canary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonably Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As silent films go, this one is probably more entertaining than most for modern viewers. The B&amp;W visuals are interesting, even if predictably drab and bleak. Most of the plot takes place inside a "mansion", ironic given how dilapidated the place looks. Immensely high ceilings lend a touch of the Gothic. And light and shadow are played for all they're worth.The story is cliché-ridden but kinda fun. A wealthy old man has left his fortune to one of six people, all of whom gather at midnight in the spooky old house to hear the will read. After a promising first Act, the middle Act treads water as characters scurry around in a state of semi-fright, scared of the mansion's "ghosts".A ghastly looking hand with long fingernails reaches out to steal a necklace from a fair maiden's neck, in one sequence. And, in another, one person is found dead. The film's ending is less disappointing than I had initially feared. But still, a lot is left unexplained. The plot inserts humor at various points throughout, which helps, given the lengthy runtime. The Aunt Susan character is a hoot.Bleak production design is typical for films of that era. Ditto those drab glad rags that pass for costumes. I have yet to watch a 1920s film wherein the visuals did not look like precursors to the 1930s Great Depression.Acting is predictably melodramatic and hammy, maybe deliberately so. Exaggerated facial expressions, bug-eyed responses, and lots of animation in general emphasize that this film is mostly visual.Nothing is to be taken seriously here. "The Cat And The Canary" is an early example of a whodunit mystery, set in a spooky old house, played as semi-comedy. As such, except for the lagging middle Act, the film is reasonably entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cat and the Canary, The (1927) *** (out of 4) Classic "old dark house" film has an old man dying and then twenty-years later his relatives arrive at his creepy mansion for the will reading. The estate goes to Annabelle (Laura La Plante) as long as she is proved to be sane but throughout the night various visions of demons appear to her. Is she losing her mind or is someone just trying to scare her? One needs to remember that all the cliché moments in this film weren't cliché when this was originally released. So many films have since ripped this one off that one might forget how original this movie was when it was originally released. What really stood out after eighty-years is how brilliantly this thing looks on a technical level. The cinematography ranks as some of the greatest I've ever seen and there are countless moments that you could point to as being ground breaking. Even the opening title credits are downright breathtaking with the creepy hand moving the dust and spider webs away. The set design by Charles D. Hall is just as wonderfully done and adds to the overall atmosphere, which is very thick from start to finish. Not only does the film deliver many creepy moments but there's a nice mixture of laughs thrown in as well. I've read reviews that said there were too many laughs but I'd have to disagree with that as the laughs are kept rather low-key and never take away from the actual story. The middle section of the film moves a bit too slowly but all of that picks up towards the end. The characters really aren't well-written but that doesn't matter too much as the real entertainment comes from the visuals and the creepy atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adequate but hardly essential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as silent cinema is concerned, this film is considered a classic by many. I have an extremely large silent collection, and really love these old pieces. I do not love "The Cat And The Canary", however. The problem is the so-called 'comedy' inserted throughout the film: it isn't funny, it doesn't work, all it does is annoy and detract from the main story. I think that, generally speaking, comedy that (apparently) was enjoyed by the audiences of that time just doesn't translate well all these decades later. With notable exceptions, of course. But even some of the most successful film comedians of the silent era fall flat today. Everything else about this film is pretty good, not great. Leni's earlier film "Waxworks" is so much better that it's hard to believe "Canary" is by the same director. And a lot is made of this film being some sort of trailblazing genre entry, although D.W. Griffith had made "One Exciting Night" (a very similar type of film) at least five years before Leni's movie. All in all, "The Cat And The Canary" is good entertainment, however, really not worthy of it's classic status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror mystery with plenty of Laughs to go along with the suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is classified under the horror and mystery genre, but you will find a lot of laughs to go along with the suspense. A true treasure, staring Laura La Plante as Annabelle West, Creighton Hale as Paul Jones, and my favorite Character, Mammy Pleasant played by Martha Mattox. A stoned faced woman who is anything but pleasant. This film is fun to watch, and you will find yourself riveted to your seat as the suspense builds. The sets are splendid for setting the mood and the whole movie is filled with wonderful visual effects. When you watch this 1927 film, you will notice horror gags that were passed down through the years in the movie and television mediums. Even Scooby-doo seems to have been influenced in one way or another by this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting to watch, but not notable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I know the good folks at IMDB will get mad at me for starting my review with a plug. But the folks at Kino Video have put together an excellent series of old silent horror movies out on video under the banner "Silent Screams". The Cat and The Canary is one of these, and while it was certainly interesting to look at artistically, storywise, it really doesnt hold up well.A will reading at an old house (why do they insist on doing them in the most descrept places possible) is done with the inheritor of the estate having to stay at the house until a doctor arrives to see if the inheritor is sane (which the original owner wasn't). Well, until the doctor arrives (which seems like an eternity) the other relatives, who got nada in the will, do their best to make the inheritor mad. There are plenty of creeping hands, strange maids and even the insane lunatic here to keep things rolling along, with somewhat confusing results. There are plotholes galore, and the acting is very broad.But on the positive side of things, the camerawork here is pretty amazing. I have to admit, during the panning shots of inside the house, I felt that I was in Disneyland during the ride portion of the Haunted House attraction.Strange how movies make you react...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't Always Keep My Attention, But a Good Genre Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rich old Cyrus West's relatives are waiting for him to die so they can inherit. But he stipulates that his will be read 20 years after his death.Although not the first film set in a supposed haunted house, The Cat and the Canary started the pattern for the "old dark house" genre. The term is derived from English director James Whale's "The Old Dark House" (1932), which was heavily influenced by Leni's film, and refers to "films in which murders are committed by masked killers in old mansions." I found the film somewhat slow and hard to watch, but this may have been my frame of mind at the time. There is clearly a sense of humor here, and intrigue, with secret passageways and a killer on the loose in a mansion full of heirs. As mentioned above, this influenced "The Old Dark House", but also many other films... more than I can even list here.I would recommend this film for historic value, but beyond that I would say to look for one of the many remakes (there are at least three or four). Added talking or color might make the film more accessible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cat, Canary and Several Hams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the many flattering reviews and comments for "Cat and the Canary", I wondered if I should rethink my position - my position being that I disliked it very much. I appreciated the cinematography and several directorial touches that must have made this picture a hit in the 1920's. I also appreciated that it was probably one of the first of its genre, and many situations have been done to excess since then.First off, it was too long - I have the Alpha 101 minute version and the picture moved at ice-cutter speed (don't know about the 80 min. version) - is this really how it moved in 1927? But worse, this film contains some of the most outrageous,scenery-chewing, hambone overacting ever put on celluloid, the performance by Creighton Hale the biggest offender - One more look of pop-eyed surprise and I was ready to sue his estate. Reading other readers reviews, this was de rigeur for silent films of this genre but I found it very irritating and thought it detracted from the final product.It could have been a better film. Maybe I would have liked it better when it was first shown; and the 1939 remake is even worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The acting is excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "overacting" of the early cinema, as stage actors made their transition (or not) to the more subtle art of film acting, was long gone by 1927. In his book "The Parade's Gone By..." (1968, Knopf), Kevin Brownlow refers to Paul Leni's The Cat and the Canary as "one of the best of the spoof melodramas." Laura La Plante et al knew what they were about when they made their gestures large for this film. Imagine our grandparents thinking how "campy" it was in 1927 to see this old-fashioned stuff.</fullReview>
