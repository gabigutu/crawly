		<shortDescription>A Fascinating and Disturbing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a real psychological experiment at Stanford University in 1971, using a group of male students, the mood of this film captures the sense of disorientation and loss of reality that was experienced by the original volunteers. Acts of humiliation present a violent and effective method for stripping individuality and asserting power over prisoners. The psychological transformations into masochistic and submissive roles are fascinating when you consider that that the only real distinguishable difference between the characters, is that by a random selection process, some are labeled 'wardens' and others are labeled 'prisoners'. The levels of violence, brutality and humiliation in the film seem extreme but in the original experiment, humiliation tactics were also extreme ? prisoners were also made to wear chains round their ankles and stockings on their heads at all times! The film's conclusion is carefully constructed and appears to bear an implicit reference to the real prison riot of San Quentin (which occurred the day after the Stanford experiment was prematurely halted), in which guards and informant prisoners were tortured and murdered during the prisoners' escape attempt. This film is a sensitive study into power relationships within an altered reality and is masterfully crafted to build tension and invite the viewer to question the character's morality and ethical codes. Far more relevant and interesting than the bland reality TV shows we are plagued by these days?highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a surprisingly intense film that I'm so glad I watched. The concept was great and this was even before I found out it was based on a true story. But once I heard that it makes me want to look into it a lot more and see what differed from actual life and such. Supposedly the movie was pretty accurate though. It's amazing that good foreign films blow the socks off of most Hollywood garbage any day of the week. They're more realistic and the characters act more like real people would in day to day situations. The love story in this might've been the only thing that I think could've been done better since it became a little weird here and there. Other than that the suspense kept me going and the thought that this could happen to anyone is really scary to ponder. I'm pretty sure I'd like to see this made into an American version only because I'm quite positive they'd butcher it and wouldn't contain anything near the desired effect as has usually been the case in the past. It was kept simple and because of that...it worked! The acting was great all around as it really was a job well done.Final Import:Movies: Not a possibility here in the U.S.DVD Purchase: Worth looking into.Rental: A wise choice my friend!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best and Most Powerful Movies of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Germany, a group of men is invited to participate in an experience promoted by the Army. They would receive DM 4,000.00 for fourteen days performing the roles of guards and prisoners in a prison, under certain predetermined rules and monitored by a team of doctors. A journalist infiltrates in the team looking for a great matter. However, problems happen and the experience looses control, jeopardizing the integrity and the safety of the prisoners. This movie is amazing: just released on DVD in Brazil, it is certainly one of the best films of the year. Tense, powerful, having a wonderful screenplay and outstanding direction and performances, it is another great example of how the absolute power corrupts. All the cast is magnificent, but I would like to highlight the role and the acting of Justus Von Dohnanyi, as the sadistic Berus. A must-see movie, which will certainly provoke a reaction of the viewer! It is almost impossible not to make a comparison of the situation presented in this film with the abuse and humiliation of the prisoners of Iraq recently showed on TV and newspapers. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'A Experi?ncia' ('The Experience')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling thriller that disturbs as much as it entertains.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was initially a bit dubious about 'Das Experiment', thinking it looked like it was going to be lame, but within half an hour I was hooked. It isn't the greatest movie ever made, the most technically dazzling, or the most insightful into the human condition, but as a thriller it is first class, and far better than any I've seen come out of Hollywood for years. The movie in inspired by an experiment conducted in America in the early 1970s. 'Das Experiment' isn't a documentary it is after all but a thriller, so the outcome is more sensational than in real life. But I think people may be shocked when they read about the real experiment, as they will see that the basic pattern of what happens in the movie happened in reality. And if people are still skeptical I just suggest they look into their heart and ask themselves honestly what they would do in a similar situation... The cast are all terrific. The only actor I recognized was the star Moritz Bleibtreu, from 'Knocking On Heaven's Door' and 'Run Lola Run', but it really is an ensemble piece and all the actors were well cast and convincing. I highly recommend this movie and just hope that Hollywood doesn't decide to remake it because I'm sure it'll be another 'Insomnia' farce all over again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too true to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film recently on the Sundance Channel. I could not stop watching. After seeing the prison pictures from Iraq, the film fully explored the reasons for the abuse of prisoners. When I read some of the reviews posted, I noticed how many dismissed the film as contrived and not plausible. I wonder if any of those reviewers would like to modify their dismissal of Das Experiment. Human behavior under stress often declines to the lowest common instinct. It reminded me of an adult Lord of the Flies. Degradation and humiliation seems to exactly follow what happened in Iraq. As a veteran who spent most of time working on Military Mental wards, I witnessed a number of abuses, as force had to be used patients were acting out or lost control, but all those memories seem pale compared to the horrors of the Iraq prison camps. Since life imitates art, this makes the film even more profound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see the movie. I thought:"Oh, well, I wouldn't be caught losing my temper there. I'd just be there to get the money and I wouldn't care about anything more". What the movie did in a brilliant way was to show you that it COULD be you. As time passed, I was looking at my watch. And that was because I had become one of the prisoners. The end of the movie would mean the end of their torture-the end of the experiment. Near the end, I caught myself thinking "Kill him!Kill him!"And I'm a calm person, you know. It's very surprising and also frightening to realise that all people are the same. When they feel threatened, they tend to make groups to protect themselves, like animals. And they can get very violent, too...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is the kind of movie Hollywood should make!Movie about an experiment gone all out of hand, with 20 men posing to be guards and prisoners for a period of 2 weeks. We follow the events mainly through the eyes of reporter/taxidriver Tarek, a 'prisoner', who thinks there's a good story to tell.But things go all wrong when the guards really feel like they're God and things only get worse from that moment on. There's an amazing scene with Tarek in a 'black box', that scene is as scary as I have ever seen on screen.Surely a movie you won't forget too soon.

		<shortDescription>Interesting, involving and exciting ? made more interesting with revelations involving the US troops in Iraqi prisons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taxi driver and freelance journalist Tarek Fahd spots an advert in a newspaper for volunteers to take part in a psychological experiment over two weeks. He arrives along with a group of others, to be divided up into prisoners and guards before being placed into a simulated prison and provided with rules, Tarek being prisoner number 77. Initially everyone is enjoying themselves but soon the guards tire of the prisoners taking the p*ss and decide it is time to clamp down on their behaviour. As they realize that they have no limit on their powers, the actions of the guards become increasingly brutal and uncaring.Based on the infamous experiments carried out at Stanford in the 1970's, this film had it all going for it in terms of being an effective thriller while also looking at the ways that human nature will gravitate towards the cruel once they are placed in positions of power. I decided to watch this film because it seemed interesting on this basis but also very topical considering the behaviour of the US soldiers in the Iraq prisons ? mostly poor 'white trash' types who were corrupted when they suddenly found themselves in a position they had never been in before ? control. Like them, the characters here gradually get more extreme ? just like they did in the real experiment as well. With this topicality it is no surprise that I was easily taken in by the film and was never really bored by it. Being a thriller in its own right, the film has to settle into the eventual action conclusion but even this works pretty well and doesn't detract from what has gone before in terms of interest.This is not to say it is perfect, because it could have been much better than it was. The constant cutting to Tarek's girlfriend now and in flashback only took away from the film and she could have still played her part at the end with much less time during the main body of the film. Also it became a little too far-fetched for the sake of drama ? a recent television drama in the UK did it differently by actually recreating the same experiment as opposed to this film which needed to go harder and faster in order to reach the eventual running and fighting stage! But it still works and, to be honest, it is well worth seeking out for the 'human nature' aspect alone ? it had a special resonance in Germany but it is hard not to be put in a thoughtful mood given recent events in Iraqi military prisons.The cast are roundly good and all slip one way or the other in a convincing manner. Beibtreu is good once he gets past the stage where he is making trouble for the sake of it ? this is necessary to speed the descent into cruelty but it was laid on a bit thick at the start. After this his performance is much more evenly balanced and he is a good lead. I struggled to pick up the names of all the others because they were mostly unknown to me but the head guard was very good while the rest of the cast did more than just deliver their pigeon-holed characters, where really they could have been nothing more than 'prisoner who goes crazy', 'timid guard', 'angry guard', 'silent prisoner' etc ? they weren't, they were all pretty real people.Overall this is not the best thing to come to if you are after a sort of documentary drama about the original experiment but it is still a very good film. It is exciting and dramatic while still having a bit of a brain on it ? an asset made more interesting by what we have seen in Iraq over the past few months with guards becoming even worse than those we see in this film! Not a perfect film but a well made one that is interesting, involving and exciting and one that is well worth looking up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Experiment" is a kind of movie you won't forget easily. It is an amazing spiral of fear, horror and anguish.A taxi driver decides to be an human guinea-pig for a strange experiment. Twenty men. Two groups. Guards vs. thieves. The prize is money. Every man will have money.After two days something gets wrong. The taxi driver, who is a reporter too, wants to face the guards. So he provokes the guards: they can't use violence against the prisoners...After more days the situation becomes more extreme. The guards want to impose their dominion on the prisoners. And now the situation is out of control...The script isn't really original, but it's been developed in a satisfaction way. The direction is dynamic. If the Americans do movies like Germans, we'll have more interesting products.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably one of the best films ever made, an experiment itself!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Das Experiment is a masterpiece with flawless acting. It keeps the viewer attached to the screen throughout. It's probably the only movie ever made that has 90% of it taking place in a prison, but is still a great watch. Ok maybe Shawshank Redemption is another, but this one is at least as good as that one if not better. Violence does occur, however, people don't end up shooting everything that walks as in American films. It has a realistic side, psychological balance is really tender as screened on this movie. I found myself captured watching the movie, and I realized I was feeding a strong hatred against the guardians. Very very successful shot! I recommend it to everyone for sure, but especially those who are interested in the science of psychology, as the film is not solely ABOUT an experiment, but it turns out to BE a psychological experiment itself. I'm out of words... Go watch it, and please shoot me if you don't enjoy it. A well-deserved 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the best I have seen this year, after Behind the Sun and possibly The Devils Backbone. I was so freaked out by the actions of the guards to the prisoners after such a short space of time. I must admit before I saw this I had very little knowledge of the Stanford Prison Experiment, to be honest I was under the impression that this was based on fact and that people did get actually die.Having visited various websites I know that the experiment was stopped before any 'major' damage was done, however there perhaps should have been a disclaimer at the start of the film stating that this was the directors take on what would have happened. As I say though, the film intrigued me that much that I have read quite a few articles about the actual case. *********************Possible Plot Spoilers Ahead!************But I have to say the movie was fantastic, it had such a claustrophobic feel to it and was supremely directed. I loved the scene near the end where the remaining gaurds and prisoners are standing around, it looked like a scene from Night of the Living Dead. Also when "77" is in "the box" it was great to see those black and white shots of him trying to get out, the way his eyes lit up was so spooky. Bleibtreu as "77" was simply brilliant. Very, very highly recommended, catch this before it gets screwed over by a team of some Hollywood script-writers and directed by some bland no-hoper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A violent, but not so believable "experiment"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This German movie has just been released here in Montreal, with lots of advertisement, long after it won the prize for Best Director at last year's Montreal Film Festival. Thus, the anticipation was quite high. And the result, I feel, does not quite deliver.The film evolves around Tarek, a young taxi driver who decides to take part in a scientific experiment after seeing an ad in a newspaper. His main incentive is money (4000 Deutch Marks), as it is for most of the men who join him, but he also sees this as an opportunity to get back in the journalism business, striking a deal to write a full article about the whole "experience". He will soon find out, however, that this will not be a walk in the park. Looking to study the effect of power on men, the scientists have Tarek and half the other "guinea pigs" thrown in jail as the other half is asked to play "guards". What first starts as a pleasant game soon erupts in chaos as the latter group begins to take its role very seriously...Loosely based on actual events that occurred in 1971, this movie starts as a very interesting study of human behavior. How a man can react if deprived of his freedom, his most basic rights, his intimacy? And, on the other side, how a man will react if suddenly awarded total control over other men? These are scaring questions, and the results are frightening. While Tarek, intensely played by Moritz Bleibtreu (Run, Lola Run), tries to provoke his pseudo-captors to use violence in order to boost the report he intends to publish, some of the guards soon find real pleasure in inducting psychological and, inevitably, physical pain. The whole atmosphere being so well rendered, due primarily to very realistic sets and overall impressive acting, I found myself wishing more than once never to be part of such an experiment. Especially when all hell breaks loose and blood begins to spill...I could never, however, totally immersed myself in that film because, mainly, it is not made very plausible. The scientists (some would say "masochists") do not seem very serious nor professional to me. And even though they are supposed to be in charge, they are rapidly overtaken by a flagrant lack of preparation (the guards even gain access to a room with no camera in it, thus being able to inflict whatever treatment without nobody knowing). And what about the goals of the experiment? Never clearly stated, they make the whole thing look a little cheesy, and almost presumptuous, as if the scientists were doing it only for the sake of doing it...And if the character of Tarek is very believable and has understandable motives to which we can at least relate, if not accept, some of the other characters are poorly sketched and their relevance in the plot is highly questionable. It is the case of Tarek's one-night stand (whom he met the night before the experience started), who unexpectedly becomes a very boring subplot, or this major who shares Tarek's cell and who has issues that are never really revealed.In the end, the premise is great, but the development lacks in consistency and plausibility. The film remains very intense and quite violent, especially at the end, which will probably leave you breathless. All in all, I would not call this entertainment, but more of an "experiment", although an uneven one. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! DAS EXPERIMENT is a German psycho thriller inspired by " The Stanford Prison Experiment " from the 1970s which involved a bunch of volunteers some of whom acted as guards and some of whom acted as prisoners with the experiment being brought to a premature end because the guards were enjoying the power their authority gave them a little too much which endangered the volunteers who were prisoners Unfortunately if you're aware of the background to Stanford you'll also be aware of how DAS EXPERIMENT is structured . Even more unfortunate is the fact that the character motivation isn't strong enough to make the movie work in a totally convincing manner . The guards make some light hearted comments to their colleague who's an Elvis impersonater so Elvis decides to give the prisoners a hard time which doesn't ring true . Perhaps the most confusing thing is how the previously mild mannered airline pilot decides to become an evil sadistic brute to the prisoners , there's no motivating incident to this change . There's another couple of niggles with the script. The hero is called Tarek Fahd which is surely a Turkish name which led me to believe there'd be some kind of racial or German war guilt subtext to the movie but after the story is ended it's obvious there is none while Dora is nothing more than a literary device there to save the day at the endDAS EXPERIMENT isn't a dead loss however and I don't want to give the impression it's a bad movie - It's not ( Though it is spoiled by the script in some places ) and for such a small budget movie there's much tension and some impressive scenes , the best of which involves Tarek placed in a box where he begins to hallucinate about Dora due to sensory deprivationThis is the sort of European movie that Hollywood buys the rights to . Please don't remake it Mr Brukheimer . DAS EXPERIMENT may not be perfect but I never had the urge to switch it off either</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Downfall, there was Das Experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Downfall, there was Das Experiment, Oliver Hirschbiegel's 2001 study of claustrophobia and the misuse of the power.Based on a true story, the notorious Standford Prison Experiment in 1971, the film tells the story of 20 men who volunteer to be placed into a makeshift prison for 12 days. Once inside, some are chosen to be guards whilst the others will act the role of prisoners, a process that involves abandoning their names, their clothing and their civil rights for the duration of the experiment.The job of the guards is simple, maintain peace and order at all times without using physical violence.At the heart of the film is Tarek, prisoner 77, an undercover journalist who is secretly filming from inside the prison, hoping to sell his exclusive once it's over. Tarek underestimates his own role in the experiment, though. He starts in irreverent mood, thinking it's just a game until he sparks a conflict with one of the guards, Berus. The two adversaries drive each other on relentlessly forcing the experiment to become darker, more grotesque, as each man fights for their own idea of power and identity.Das Experiment asks what happens when good people are put in an evil place. Does humanity win over evil, or does evil triumph ? Also, it examines the role of memory when faced with extreme stress and deprivation. Whilst the film is based on a true story, it's cinematic influences can be traced back to Samuel Fuller's masterpiece "Shock Corridor" and, to a lesser extent, Chris Marker's "La Jetee". The comparisons to "Shock Corridor" are there for all to see but it's also worth noting that in all three films, the protagonists are obsessed with the memory of a girl, often using that memory as an anchor to cling on to a more idealised past, a potential escape route from the situation they find themselves in. For Tarek, as the situation becomes more extreme, the memories become stronger and stronger as he attempts to block out the present and focus on the past and a possible future with the girl.Das Experiment is more than simple homage and pop psychology, though, largely due to it's director. In his first film, Hirschbiegel manages to create an entirely dark world, both inside and outside of the prison. Only in the final frames of the film do we see any natural daylight at all which offers stark contrast to everything we've seen before. The sense of claustrophobia, the complete lack of space, carefully manipulates the viewer throughout the film and, at times, it's genuinely unnerving. Consequently, it's difficult to find any real distance between yourself and the film as you become more and more absorbed. Like the characters within the prison there appears to be escape route for the viewer. A sparse script and real sensitivity from the actors, none of them overplaying their role, only adds further to the film's power. Moritz Bleibtreu (Run Lola Run) is particularly strong as Tarek whilst Justus Von Dohnanyi is positively menacing in the role of the sadistic guard Berus.Hirschbiegel would, of course, develop these themes further in Downfall a few years later and in many senses, Das Experiment can be seen as a companion piece to the latter. As a debut work it's nothing short of astonishing, a director completely in control of the film and the viewer. Cinema not for the faint hearted, where you have to go the dark places first before you can see the light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without fancy tricks and clichés, this movie tells us why riots occurs, why hatred spreads, and how to solve it.In the beginning of this movie, the main character (prisoner no.77), an ex-journalist who hopes to take his job back, participates in a experiment in a mock prison for 2 weeks in order to record down this story, and publish it on the newspaper. Furthermore, he taunts and insults mock prison guards who are also the participants in this experiment so that he can make this story more interesting. However, things become worse and worse...I am really surprised that this movie doesn't either glorify main characters, nor malign bad guys. Everyone has their characteristics, and their interaction is cruel but practical. We can see how the whole thing becomes worse. Don't stereotype this German story as a reflection of Nazism, because this movie is a warning for every culture which the power is overused. I am really glad that German dares to make this movie without too much clichés and fancy tricks. If you are tired of clichés in Hollywood films, this is a great movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no way on God's green earth that this experiment would be allowed to continue as long as it did. This film was based on the Stanford prison experiment which was cancelled early because of the effects the experiment produced: prisoners became extremely depressed and the guards became incredibly sadistic. This film crossed the line too many times to be taken seriously. As it is, it's a very good and very explicit reality TV show, but the ridiculous depictions of the people running the experiment are laughable in the extreme. In the real world, there would be lawsuits from here to Judgment Day. Still, it's better than the American flick Series 7, but on the other hand, a lot of movies are better than that. Kudos to Moritz Bleibtreu for a solid performance. Worth a look, if you can overlook the shortcomings and are willing to look into the dark heart of man.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Das Experiment' is loosely based on the Stanford Experiment of 1971. During the original experiment, after intensive psychological profiling, background checks and health tests, 18 volunteers who were mostly students from the Stanford area, were brought to an undisclosed location and split into two groups on the flip of a coin. Nine became prisoners and nine became guards. All were perfectly normal, healthy, middle-class students in their early 20s. The experiment was supposed to last 2 weeks. It lasted 6 days, before being forcibly cancelled due to concerns over the prisoners' safety. In the movie, the same experiment is reapplied in a contemporary setting. A similar thing occurs, only the experiment is never cancelled. 'Das Experiment' is superbly directed; you find yourself feeling angry and frustrated alongside the prisoners, and you even feel yourself routing for them. It's refreshing to watch a film that not only has gravitas, but also an unrelenting emotional charge. There certainly aren't many films that can claim to be as emotionally taxing. The acting is also superb. Every character involved in the experiment, including the psychologists monitoring it, are interesting. They have depth, morals, scruples, fears, anxieties, passions; they have depth. The film gives an interesting insight into the human psyche, and how we are all intrinsically and irrevocably linked to our primal urges to dominate those weaker than us. 'Das Experiment' is an excellent and uncompromising movie, which is well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This German film is a great piece of psychological horror. Based on the real life Stanford Prison Experiment from 1971, the basic storyline revolves around a group of twenty male volunteers who role-play prison life (twelve guards and eight prisoners). The prisoners have simple rules to follow and the guard's job is to enforce them but without violence. It is, after all, a research project to study human behavior. At first, both the guards and prisoners take it as simply a game but as it goes on, things get drastically out of hand. When certain prisoners don't follow a basic command or joke around too much, the guards are forced to come up with punishments. Some people just can't handle authority though. The days go by, sadistic humiliation and violence ensues, and eventually, all control is lost. Das Experiment explores human nature with disturbing results. The movie is well made, despite a few weak plot points, and has fine acting from the leads. One final thing I would like to praise is how well claustrophobic tension is captured in some scenes of Das Experiment (such as with the gagged man tied to a chair and the black isolation box)?I could really feel the distress and helplessness of the victims.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The line from the "order" to the chaos was made brilliantly! In my opinion, the action which is growing constantly throughout the movie is the most powerful characteristic. Let's say, idyllic and under the control scenes at the beginning of the movie becomes tense, bloody and very dynamic at the end. The last scenes exactly show the human madness and mental instability under some circumstances... The quotation from the movie "nothing is the game" could be the motto of the Das Experiment. The relationships amongst the guards and the prisoners, the guards themselves and the prisoners themselves were shown very profoundly and intelligently. Great story! Great camera! Great European movie!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An ad is sent out by scientist for people who are willing to take part in an experiment. They have i take part in a simulated prison. The group of people are divided into guards and inmates. At first many take this as a joke and an easy way of making money, but this all turns around on them.The guards start to take the experiment to serious; but they don't feel so. They have a set of rules they must enforce, so they feel they are doing their jobs, and they can't use violence. But they find ways around this. They start attacking inmates psychologically; humiliating, and degrading the inmates, making them strip naked, blasting them with fire extinguishers, and above all taunting them. The inmates start to feel the pressure and they start to lose it.This is a great view on insanity, megalomania and degradation. Though the people were given roles to play, when does it reach the point of going to far. Its basic human nature that people don't like being humiliated and degraded, but all people are stubborn, and this can over-ride common sense. When one inmate starts to taunt one guard, the guard retaliates, inmate fights back, guards fights back. Megolmania can be a very blinding emotion. Once people feel it, they will fight to keep it.Oliver Hirschbiegel directed The Experiment, and when i heard he was the director i knew this was going to be good. Oliver also directed the movie Downfall. Just like downfall, the experiment is dark, disturbing, and totally engaging. This is a twisted movie. The steely grays make a suffocating atmosphere, and the music score, or lack there of, enhances the mood too.What I find interesting is that this actually happened in 1971. It's kinda hard to think this all happened. You wonder how did it all just get out of hand.This was a great watch, I'm very glad i watched it. You wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An escalating claustrophobic nightmare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an overwhelming film. I have not been so affected - physically - since I was run over by "Terminator 2" ten years ago.If you have any claustrophobic tendencies or if you find it hard to endure situations of powerlessness, this film will be a total nightmare for you. But I urge you to see it anyway...The acting is superb and the directing is moderate and intelligent. As a result, the potentially predictable story becomes very unpredictable. Its surprise effects are not sudden. You get plenty of time to realize what is about to happen (and how little you or anybody else can do about it...).At one time, despite being almost completely absorbed by the suspense, I was able to look away from the screen and notice that I was sitting in a movie theater, at a safe distance from the experiment. Thank God!My grade: 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Psychological Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Das Experiment is a German film loosely based on the Stanford University Prison Study in the 1970s where a group of students were split into guards and prisoners which lead to minor authoritarian regime with torture being used.The film focuses on a Tarek Fahd (Moritz Bleibtreu), a taxi driver, who see an advert for the experiment in the local newspaper. He volunteers and offers to write about it for his former employers, the Colonge Newspaper. He plans to secretly record what does on and interview other particaents. When the experiment starts Tarek is made a prisoner and he starts to rebel against the guards. He leads a mini-riot within 36 hours and the guards are forced to take drastic action. It's from that point when things start to go downhill very quickly, with the guards looking for new ways to humiliate the prisoners, and secretly torture some of them. The leading psychologist ignores what is going on and the film ends up in a violent conclusion.The obvious theme of film were the dark side of the human mind who are willing to use violence and extreme messages to keep order and how quickly authoritarianism takes over. The film also deals with the psychological toll on the prisoners who are involved, some resist, some try not to rock the boat and some shut down completely. It was an interesting viewing experience. The acting was of a high standard, and the direction of Oliver Hirschbiegel was spot on. Hirschbiegel later goes on to direct the excellent film Downfall and I hope he has a great career in cinema. The writing was of a good standard, but it does go a little action like at the end, making an effort of trying to be dramatic and cinematic. I admit that the love story/surreal aspect was the weakest element of the film, but Das Experiment is an excellent film. It is a sign of how good the German film industry is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engulfing thriller that will leave you in disarray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first came into contact with Oliver Hirschbiegel in 2004's "Der Untergang". After that, I decided I should look for more of his work. Stumbling upon "Das Experiment", I would soon find I would not be disappointed.The plot here is well-known, the film being adapted from a real life scenario where a team of psychiatrists took to simulating a prison-like environment with a group of volunteers, only to watch them turn into rabid wolves."Das Experiment" possesses a number of qualities: the musical score does much to keep the pace going energetically forward. As such, from the very first minute the viewer is treated to a veritable roller-coaster ride.The main story is sidelined by #77 (Moritz Bleibtreu)'s spur-of-the-moment and accidental, if very intense romantic involvement with the beautiful Dora (Maren Egert). Their encounter is quite serendipitous, and the speed at which they move toward intimacy with each other is inspiring."Das Experiment" relies on stellar performances all around. Of note is Steinhoff (Christian Berkel) who seems to be a regular appearance in Hirschbiegel's pictures, also being present in "Der Untergang". To single actors out, such as Justus von Dohnanyi (who plays Berus) or Oliver Stokowski (Schütte) is, however, futile, since they all act well.To sum things up: Alexander Bubenheim's pace-setting music coupled with the brisk and practical set and fine acting create in "Das Experiment" a masterpiece of contemporary German cinema. Mr. Hirschbiegel is to be congratulated. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No thriller, but very scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: A group of different men sign up for a well-paid psychological experiment. At the start they are divided into two groups, prisoners and guards. The prisoners are locked into cells in the university's basement and the guards are charged with the task to keep order and that the prisoners follow certain rules. But the power of authority is not easily handled...Comments: No thriller no, at least not if you ever heard of the Stanford Experiment, which this movie is closely based upon. But knowing just that, that the movie is so closely based upon a real event, that makes it very scary. The implications are dreadful. That ordinary people, you and me, just given the right circumstances may turn into the worst kind, and not stop even at murder. That people may be guided and taught to be pure monsters. And that this seems to happen over and over again around the world. So, for me, there were no real surprises, no real thrill because I knew how it would go, mostly. But I didn't dare leave the TV. It was just scary, and not horror-film scary, but real scary.As for the movie, it is very well made. There is a slow but inevitable development. Acting is good and directing too. It uses different viewpoints and cameras, as surveillance-cameras for effect. The only thing is that there were some subplots, subplots that faded away during the movie, that might just as well been cut from the beginning. Mostly I'm talking about Tarek's journalist aspiration, but there were others.Definitely worth a watch. Not as the fun movie to entertain you but almost as an educational, a reminder that each and every one of us are responsible for our own actions, and responsible to stop abuse when we see it.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prison. One word that can mean a lifetime or a couple of months. In this case it's two weeks and in a prison where you get paid for your stay. You might think, 'Huh?', but these men are paid 4000 marks to stay 14 days in a homemade prison set up where they will be studied by scientists. But do they really know what they're in for?In Oliver Hirschbiegel's The Experiment (Das Experiment in German), Professor Thon and his associate Dr. Grimm are conducting an experiment where they need a group of people to play prison guards and prisoners. They will stay in these positions for two weeks and will be paid 4000 marks at the end. There is to be no violence and the guards must be obeyed. Each prisoner is to wear a number and address each other by that number only, no names. Most men are in it for the money or just to try new things, like Tarek Fahd (Moritz Bliebtreu; Run Lola Run). Some are doing it for fun.The men seem to be enjoying themselves at first, but are ordered to act their roles. They must become their role in order for the experiment to work and to get paid. First the prisoners start heckling the guards who just laugh back. Then it escalates when Tarek, or Prisoner 77 starts a little riot, causing Prison Guard Berus to react by humiliating the men. He convinces the guards that they must keep the peace. Adfter stripping them of beds and clothing, the battle begins...From here on out, the guards make it clear who is in charge. Guard Berus takes his job a little too seriously, creating chaos. When Professor Thon leaves town, Dr. Grimm, a woman, is left in charge and the guards decide to take action against the prisoners, using physical force. Now we have a real war both on the physical level and in their minds.Hirschbiegel creates a phenomenal thriller based on the 'Stanford Prison Experiment' of 1971. This experiment gone wrong is very well directed using great cinematography and a well crafted set. The claustrophobic feeling is definitely in the air. The acting on both sides is perfect for the situation they are put in. We all experience oppression. This movie shows how when an ordinary group of men are placed in a situation where they turn on each other in the worst way.The Experiment is a fantastic film. Hirschbiegel creates another work of art. Although it isn't as good as his Oscar-nominated film Downfall (Der Untergang), this is a brilliant thriller with much to look at. It's an 'edge of your seat' thrill ride that will leave you astounded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty and compelling drama based on the Stanford Prison Experiment of 1971</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real-life Stanford Prison Experiment involved volunteer Californian students who (on a coin-toss) were assigned positions as guards or prisoners. It was intended to last 14 days, but had to be abandoned after only 6 because the intimidation and violence was getting out of hand. (You can read all about it on the experiment's website.) The plot of Das Experiment starts by documenting the real experiment's first few days, and then carries on to explore what might have happened if the experiment had run on. It's violent, even sickening, but it is faithful to the well-documented cruelty (and mental collapse) that spontaneously occurs in many ordinary people when placed in the same situation.It's a challenging subject for a filmmaker: there is a large cast for us to keep track of, half of whom are referred to mainly by their prison number; there are rapid and extreme changes in behaviour that have to be executed without losing plausibility; only the set, being a small prison, is simple. But the film is skillfully constructed, and we are quickly sucked into the world of the experiment where we can suffer alongside the prisoners. Definitely one to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect of this film. I am not all that familiar with German cinema. I was shocked. This is a good film. The lead, Tarek, is a disconnected journalist who seems at odds with himself at the beginning of the film. He takes some time off from his job at the newspaper to drive a taxi. He answers an add in a magazine to participate in a scientific experiment to study the behavioral differences between guards and prisoners. While driving his taxi, he has a car accident which then introduces a woman with whom he identifies. She is just as lost and disconnected as he feels. This relationship seems, at first, very much of a clich? but the director handles this brilliantly by revealing what happens in reflections throughout the rest of the film. Once the action begins after Tarek's arrival at the prison environment, the tension is almost unbearable. For the most part, the beginning of the experiment seems quite usual. Those who are the prisoners feel obligated to act out but the true tension begins when the guards must respond with what they think is appropriate. I should write that what is disturbing about this film is not necessarily what is revealed on camera, although there is plenty of violence and blood. What resonates mostly with me is the profound revelation that conflict needs both an aggressor and a submissive. Both roles are dependent of one another and both, in most cases, are equally responsible for damages done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is based on the Stanford Prison Experiment conducted in 1971 and the first part is somewhat faithful to how the experiment went. Of course this gives it the German Avant-garde treatment which makes it more interesting. The acting was good, especially Moritz Bleibtreu from Run Lola Run, and the others did a good job. Of course conducting this with Germans where study participants who play the "role" of guards quickly transform into fascists has an extra meaning. I thought Maren Eggert was good as Dora, Tarek's girlfriend. And contrary to some reviews the Dora element really added a lot to this film. I felt solidarity with the "prisoners" as they are humiliated and abused more and more as the film goes on. And what happens to the psychologists running the Experiment could be considered poetic justice. The ending was over-the-top, but it worked as a film. And just think of what actual prisoners have to endure every day.  I think the wider point is the human rights issue. Here in the US we have millions of people imprisoned, dehumanized, with no real rehabilitation, and we're all the worse off for it. One thing this (as well as the actual experiment) shows is we shouldn't let Psychologists control things either...because that industry is one of dehumanization in itself (drugs, coercion, institutions, etc.) What we need is a world run by human rights activists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A look into the soul of man - and it is black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Experiment is essentially a film about power and power relations; how people in positions of power abuse what they have; and the potential of power to corrupt.Inspired by an infamous psychological experiment conducted in the early 1970's along the same lines, 20 men are divided into 8 guards and 12 prisoners and have to "play prisons" for a 2 week period upon the completion of which they will receive $4000 marks.The film comments on how people fall into roles of dominance and submission, which they soon do. What starts out in good humour, takes a nasty turn about 1/ 4 of the way through, bringing one to the realisation that things are about to get UGLY. The guards atempts to suppress the growing dissidence and establish order, inevitably build to an explosive climax, that is at the same time heart-stoppingly brilliant, but also an ugly window into what we are capable of given the right circumstances.It is, interestingly, made in Germany, with the obvious Nazi comparisons easily made. Particularly for the film's antagonist who, unfortunately for him, was born just a few decades too late and is one of the most easily despised characters since Nurse Ratchett. One could consider the film a microcosim of the human condition itself; thatthose who get power will subordinate those without it and do anything to hold onto it. Das Experiment is, on the one hand, an excellent, excellent film, but on the other a disturbing insight to the destructive potential of man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very telling as to what a delicate thing the human psyche really is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the preview for this German movie a few weeks ago, I knew it was a film I HAD to see! My major in college was Law &amp; Society and one of my favorite classes was a sociology class, Punishments and Corrections. It's always been an area that I've been interested in. This movie is based on a failed Standford experiment in 1971. The premise is 20 people are selected for the study and divided up into guards and prisoners. The guards are told to maintain order without the use of violence. The results both in the study and this movie are very telling as to what a delicate thing the human psyche really is. As for the movie, it has some real strengths and a couple weaknesses. The strengths of the movie include the extremely interesting story idea, some very fine acting and directing, and the willingness to take on the bleak subject. The biggest weakness for me was how unbelievable I found it that the two head's of this delicate experiment would leave the experiment virtually unmonitored. I would expect either the head guy, or his number one assistant to be watching at all times and for certain precautions taken to avoid letting the experiment get this far out of hand. The other slight unbelievablity for me was that both the guards and the prisoners could be SO affected by the experiment SO quickly. Even if it may be true, it's still hard to believe. Which does lead to one of it's strengths, the showing of how delicate the human mind is and how stress can affect it. I know everyone is different, but it would take a lot more than this experiment to change me enough to act like these people did. What I do find believable is that if someone is already on the edge and predisposed to this type of behavior, that it might not take that much to push them over the edge. It reminded me a lot of William Golding's, The Lord of the Flies. I remember reading the book for the first time as a kid and being equally surprised how quickly people could become uncivilized and deadly. That's different though, as I think children are much more impressionable and likely to go with the follow the popular crowd. But then again, maybe not. Maybe that's what this story tells us...that even as established adults, there's a fine line. I find it somewhat troublesome to think that normalcy be so easily forgotten, but it is very intriguing to me. I am really glad this movie was made and that I saw it. I'm interested to see others impressions. How realistic people think it could be?! I don't think many would want to admit it, but I don't think it's that far from reality.***1/2 (Out of 4)Rank: #5 in 2001</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie and expected, well yes, a german movie. For me this is not really a sign of quality ;)But I got a film with a dense atmosphere you nearly could feel, and people around me who were relieved that the movie had finished because they were scared of what they had seen, not because of horror pictures but because of the picture of people who changed from perfect normal people like you and me to brutalists who tortured a man to death.I think this is a way to understand history, OUR (german) history as it happened: Give power and rules to a weak man, and he will take care that these rules are observed, despite of the instruments he has to use. It isn't disputable that these rules may have been invented by maniac people, but you can see this film as a key how the system in Nazi-Germany has worked. There are few people who want to keep the rules, the price for this do not matter to them, and all the others are ruled by fear, in this case to loose money.There are many nuances in the film which you all can see as a sign to this "theory", but I can't describe them all here, you have to watch the movie ;)My sister didn't want to see "Hannibal", because she thought it is too cruel, but she absolutely want to see this movie. I'm not sure if this will be the right (she hasn't seen it yet), because this film is more cruel than "Hannibal", in my opinion. But Anthony Hopkins isn't as cute as Moritz Bleibtreu (at least not in the opinion of my sister ;)) ), and I'm curious how she will like it ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please note....this movie is very disturbing. It deals with many different ethical themes and morality issues, such as abuse of power or things like that. It also talks about the Stanford prison experiment, in which men who weren't real prisoners and who weren't real prison guards. The objective of the experiment: stay 14 days in the prison then leave with the money the scientists will give you. But the experiment goes horribly wrong and the guards of the prison start acting abusively among the prisoners. Now at first when I first saw this movie's poster, I felt that it wasn't going to be a bad movie, but boy was it ever disturbing! This shows how sometimes you can get very over-the-top with who you really are, and forget that what you do is bad. Of course the prison guards weren't natural murderers, but I guess that how psychology works is basically the explanation to their action and how they behaved.I'm 13, and I was able to follow this film perfectly. Of course I find it hard to explain, so if you weren't able to understand my brief summary of how the guards behaved, then let me tell you that I have it all perfectly written in my mind. The actors were good, especially for Moritz Bleibtreu who delivers an incredible performance, but Christian Berkel and Oliver Stokowski were really good also. Some of the scenes were really disturbing like the near rape scene, or when Tarek washes the toilets by himself with his robe and with his bare hands or even when a guard forces the female doctor to undress and go with the prisoners. All in all this is a very disturbing movie, but if you can handle the movie then you will find an interesting movie with a lot of depth.</fullReview>

This is an amazing psychological drama that's compelling to watch. It compares with Midnight Express in its intensity. I think the native language, German, adds to the overall feel of the viewers' experience. This film puts the viewer on edge without the sense of feeling of being contrived. It gives the viewer a very real sense of not knowing just how far things will deteriorate, or how and when it will all end. This movie should be seen exactly as is (with subtitles) to capture the intense drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin I am going to say that "Das Experiment", a film from Germany, is in fact based on actual events, even so don't expect so much realism in the film. I know this had to be made in order to add tension and entertainment to the film, etc. But believe me, when a story is already interesting it is better not to change it."Das Experiment" begins when Tarek Fahd, a taxi driver, discovers an advertisement in the newspaper in which people will be paid 4000 German marks by participating in a experiment for 2 weeks. The experiment consists in a simulated prison, in which 12 of the 20 participants will assume the role of guards and the rest will act like prisoners, who have to be oppressed and controlled, but with the only condition of not recurring to violence. All of this is made in order to investigate the human behavior in a different environment and under the control of an authority. At first the prisoners, aware of the fact that is just an experiment, take their roles lightly, as well as the guards. But as soon as the guards lose the control of the prisoners they begin to embody their roles, as if they were real guards and in a number of days everything becomes chaos.The suspense in the film is effective and at the first minutes the events are well presented, but early in the film an unnecessary subplot is developed in which Fahd, after a car accident before the experiment, meets a woman called Dora. When the experiment starts Fahd can't stop thinking about Dora and she can't stop thinking about him. In my opinion this adds nothing fundamental to the plot, but seem more like the typical cliché in which romance is involved but not important to the story.Another problem I had was the character development. About Fahd we only know that he works as a taxi driver and wants to win some money (not just by participating in the experiment but by filming everything for a newspaper). In the rest of the film, and considering the amount of characters, no clear motivation is given to each character to behave like they do, and there is also the fact that the guards become very quickly in sadists. In the final act, when all is chaos, characters' actions become exaggerated in comparison to the real events, and the movie starts to feel like a typical thriller as the final events unfold.But all this aside "Das Experiment" proves to be an effective, though average thriller, with good acting, full of thought-provoking questions and critiques (in some sense), and with a good and interesting story. Anyways I have to admit that when the film finished I got the feeling that reading the original story was more entertaining that watching the film.My Score: 7.1</fullReview>

The actors did a very good job getting more and more into their parts either as a guard or as a prisoner. The tension between the two groups grow faster day by day. You, as a viewer, feel like you're changing together with them.It shows that there is likely a devil in everyone, you just have to be put in the right situation with certain circumstances, so it comes out and you no longer control it.

		<fullReview>The movie is made after a real experiment carried out in Palo Alto, U.S.A. A group of scientists gathers 20 people and have them carry out a psychological experiment for a cash reward: The group is split into 12 prisoners and 8 prison guards. The prisoners have to move into prepared cells and follow some "prison rules" while the guards are told to retain law and order in the prison but are strictly discouraged to use force.Of course the obvious happens, there is some comeradeship at first but one of the prisoners (a newsman in disguise, but that is not important) starts small revolts and the guards retaliate with ever increasing brutality: It starts with "pushup" sanctions and ends with the first dead on the 5th day of the experiment. In the end, the "guards" not only torture the prisoners but also the captured scientists...Inspite of the pretty obvious plot, the atmosphere in this movie is so dense that the audience gets literally pushed back into their seats. I saw the movie in a sneak preview with an audience not really adapted to this kind of films (something "funnier" usually...), but the movie seemed to capture everyone: Noticeable reactions from the audience included mild interest in the experiment at first, increasing bewilderment at the guards brutality and helpless laughs at every new turn of bestiality and then cheers of relief when the "prisoners" finally strike back at the most evil "guards".Not really "easy viewing" but very impressive and definitely a movie to remember. Especially when keeping in mind, that it is made after a real event...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The experiment succeeded</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At least it did on the screen. The story behind this movie isn't as charming. I must note that Das Experiment caught my attention after I recently watched the remake of this movie (The Experiment). After being disappointed with that movie (but somewhat fascinated by the matter) I read that the original is much better. And the critics weren't wrong. Das Experiment is the total package. A movie with depth, realism and great directing and acting. The movie makes you think. The tension build up. Nothing feels forced. We are sucked into the movie and feel like we're dealing with real people and real behavior. No silly copouts or plot holes. A movie about human nature, group-dynamics; what will happen when you put a group of people (all with very different personalities) in a small, stressful environment for a long period of time.. All around a great and quite brutal movie about human nature. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start of with I've got to say that this movie really struck me. I heard some things about it and it really was worth the watch. The way the whole situation escalated and how this is brought to the viewer is magnificent. The director does a very good job in getting the viewer to realize what is possible in the given situation. What maybe makes is even more real is that it was based on the actual Stanford Experiment. The movie is really good and left me with a lot of questions and opens up a lot of ways to think about what happen in the world as we speak. Prisons all over the world are affected by the phenomena expressed in the picture. Getting someone in charge of a group of others who have no way to defend themselves seems to change one and I think we should really not overlook such problems. The same thing is happening right now somewhere in this world! The whole atmosphere is very striking too. And not to forget, excellent acting, no doubt about it. Incredible movie, you should watch it!</fullReview>

Perfect acting, all is completely realistic, sometimes almost breathtaking. And from the artistic/cinematographic point of view it's very good, too. I read somewhere that the romance wouldn't have been necessary - that's not true. It's a contrast to the obscure things happening in the pseudo-prison, and maybe important for the main character's psychology. And (now comes something like a spoiler) as a spectator I needed the happy end (well, not for all involved persons) after all those cruel and shocking things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A scientific and psychological experiment where two groups of regular people will get money by spending two weeks serving as guards and prisoners in a simulated prison is what's inside of "Das Experiment" ("The Experiment"). The scientists are trying to see how the relations between inmates and guards occur and the way they change and why they change inside of closed spaces. We have all the sorts of characters and different backgrounds playing those guinea pigs but the main focus is on Tarek Fahd (Moritz Bleibtreu), a taxi driver who, like most of them, is there for the money and for a chance to sell to a newspaper his experience there. In this place he's selected to be one of the prisoners (the number 77), playing the provocateur type who tries to get some attention from the guards and from there things are never going to be the same. They're all together on the same space, they're under emotional and physical pressure, limited to certain things, going for the same purpose. The main difference between the groups is between who calls the shots and who is obeying to them. If in real life with real and dangerous prisoners, and sometimes abusive officers, things get out of control how come these people (and I include the scientist too) would imagine things always going well? After some small arguments over how tyrannic the guards were in giving orders (including force a guy to drink milk, something he doesn't like), the guards explode in their pressure and decide to be even more firm with the inmates, specially with Tarek. This one seems to try to prove a thing by pushing everybody (even his colleagues) too far but as long the doctors controlling the experiment are not complaining he'll try everything.Yes, this is pretty much like "The Wave", an good experiment that goes wrong simply because it goes, there are uncontrollable things and there's "blind" people behind them who fail to foresee the consequences of their acts, predict at some level when the danger is approaching and stop before it reaches the point of no return. To make things more appealing to audiences we're informed that this was based in real events, although in the real experiment things didn't get so darker as the things depicted in here. Even so, it's very believable the characters motivations, their actions, all the absurd. For those who complained about the plausibility of the story, specially the one concerning the guard's change of behavior, I admit the film failed a little in showing us why they changed but on the other hand I don't think the film needs to clearly answer that to us; the answer is there an you just have to see it. The man is a product of his environment and he adapts himself according to the situations given to him, simply as that. And that's why the outbursts of violence; the guard who attempts to rape one of the doctors, and other situations. Of course, the film could be better developed if the story was placed in another country where racial and sexual tensions are more violent in prisons, places where the excess of human degradation really puts a man in the worst possible conditions that he can't do the right thing and think about the others around him but always trying to do the best for himself. In terms of film "The Experiment" is a film to be viewed more than just a thrilling entertainment (the final minutes forget about the pertinent discussion, going for a more exciting and rushed conclusion, effective but without higher arguments to cause an debate). It shows a lot about how prison systems should be modeled in the best possible way, with good treatment for both sides; guards must receive a proper training and not do what they feel like to, things like that. But do governments out there know how to make great investments in the prison system just like the ones (supposedly) made in this experiment? Things would follow in a proper way between both divisions of this space? Things to wonder while watching the film...I loved the film, loved the performances by the cast, and the script was pretty good even with some predictable moments (loved the irony at the ending though). Don't know why it took me so long to watch it, always interested me but only recently I watched it. Again quoting about the man being a product of its environment and the way goals to achieve might be a problem in the process, and people locked in a small place go through that it makes me wonder why some of us keep insisting in watching reality shows (at one time so called "experiments" as well) that doesn't add anything to their lives when a film like this can do so much more? 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Das Experiment relates the tale of a prison simulation experiment which derails due to the natural psychological trauma and disorders which (an important detail) do not result from - but are inherent to - the subjects under study.It is fascinating to watch the gradual change in both collective atmosphere and in individuals along the two week period. The conclusions with regard to underlying human tendencies are frightening. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more so.I just finished watching this film and I highly recommend it. It is the sort of film for those who like reflecting on the nature of humanity and human society, in a similar manner to - although not as good as - Dogville (surely the greatest love-it-or-hate-it film ever made). The only aspect of this film which made me not grade it as "exceptional" is a somewhat weak romantic element that feels pushed into the story just because the producers wouldn't fund the film without one, but maybe that's just me.Whatever your favourite film-genre is, this is one to watch, if only to reflect upon what you would do, under similar conditions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>courtesy of www.PopBunker.net This German language film was a nice surprise as a piece of tense and entertaining film-making. I'm a little surprised at some of the reviews that I read after viewing the movie. I agree with the almost universal acclaim that the film receives, but I don't understand the level of sincerity and claimed psychological satorie attributed to "Das Experiment" as a dramatized documentary. It's not. The movie is based off a novel which is loosely inspired by a real life experiment.The rough premise of the film is The Stanford University Prison Experiment which took place in the United States in 1971. Information available regarding the experiment is patchy, but it is suggested that the reactions escalated to the hypothesized extremity in a matters of days instead of weeks and caused the experiment to be abruptly halted. That general outline is the basis of this film, but it otherwise never pretends realism.The peak of the humiliation and brutality of the real experiment is represented in the film early on, but from that point the film sheds all viewer expectations of being realistic cinema and instead opts for stylish and amped up tension. It is in this dramatization that the movie works very well as, if not exactly thought provoking, then entertaining cinema.Moritz Bleibereu, who appears to be Germany's answer to a young Billy Zane, is Tarek Fahd, aka Prisoner #77. Tempted beyond resistance by the $4000 payout for volunteering for the experiment, the smart ass Fahd signs up and through psychological evaluation is placed as a "prisoner." There is some psychological mumbo-jumbo used by the generic (but mostly well acted) scientists in charge of the experiment regarding the reasons some volunteers were placed as prisoners and some as guards. A quick cheat is: Fat or Aryan = guards; skinny, old, or ethnic = prisoners. As in many German films, there is a subtle subtext of apology that attempts to assure the viewer that Germans still hate Hitler (it's so common that seeing a modern German movie without the subtext is surprising).#77 doesn't take the role of "prisoner" seriously. He cracks jokes, is obstinate to the "guards," disobeys rules, etc. His wit and bravo quickly gets under the skin of the guards to the point where they eventually feel they must strike back to subdue #77 and make the experiment as realistic as instructed. Here the most Aryan of the guards, Berus (Justus von Dohnanyi), takes control of discipline and keeping order with psychotic (Hitler-referenced) glee. Other guards begin to enjoy the humiliation of #77 and other prisoners, so they join in and, with the help of lax security by the scientists, things quickly nose dive out of control. The ending sequence is worthy of the film and takes a step back to avoid the gluttony of a hyper sensationalized finale.The acting in "Das Experiment" is its strongest attribute. The script is mostly tight with one completely unnecessary side story told in hard to follow and excessive flashbacks. Even with that one minor caveat, however, "Das Experiment" succeeds in presenting a tense and surprisingly action-filled story that only fails to entertain during the cumbersome flashback sequences.courtesy of www.PopBunker.net</fullReview>

What seems to be some sort of game in the beginning soon becomes a dangerous situation. Das Experiment is loosely based on the Stanford Prison Experiment and its not a film for everyone.The raw nature and the disturbing outcome of the experience will shock many but it is absolutely necessary to make the point the director wanted... Its a very interesting film and reminds me of the 2008 film "Blindness"...at least in some ways.

		<fullReview>This is not a horror movie, though I found some horror elements here. Personally I prefer psychological horror movies like Blue Velvet, where is some psychological terror, because these movies are shocking and you know how hard it is to find nowadays a shocking movie, when people are used to see just about everything on screen, when we have The Bride dressed up like Bruce Lee was in The Game of Death, running around with a samurai sword, chopping off heads, arms and legs of those who stands in her way. This movie was really shocking though there wasn't much physical violence. The story was great, although some acts of characters didn't made enough sense, I will not explain what, because that would spoil a movie, but if you have already seen it, I think you know what I mean. It's well directed, the acting was great and the script was almost perfect, so it's a really worth watching movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Experiment is based on the Stanford Prison Experiment which was conducted in the basement of Stanford University's psychology department in 1971. In the experiment twenty four male volunteers were offered $15 a day to take part in a two week "prison simulation". The men were split into guards and prisoners with the only rule being: no physical violence. After only six days the experiment had to be shut down due to the extreme behaviour of the guards and the severe emotional breakdowns of several prisoners.While browsing the paper one morning taxi driver and ex-journalist Tarek (Moritz Bleibtreu from Run, Lola, Run) spots an ad wanting twenty volunteers for a fourteen day experiment in a simulated prison environment - the gig pays 4000 Marks so he decides to go down and register. Once there the men are divided up into eight prisoners and twelve guards - Tarek is a prisoner - and no one takes anything too seriously, the prisoners jokingly insult the guards and refuse to take orders. But eventually the guards tire of this behaviour and realize something needs to be done, specifically with Tarek as he is the head troublemaker. From here on out things quickly gets out of hand as the guards rapidly loose control and begin to sadistically take their power far beyond the limits which eventually leads to acts of extreme violence and severe emotional trauma.The Experiment is an extremely interesting film as it shows the results of what can happen when humans are put into extreme situations; the guards obviously have a kind of pack mentality where they egg each other on and end up committing acts of violence and mental torment that, as individuals, they would never have even considered. The prisoners automatically come to rely on their fear instincts which intensifies things even more and puts them in the victim mindset.The claustrophobic setting and labyrinthian design of the "jail" also really adds to the oppressive atmosphere of the film and perfectly captures the profound feeling of doom and total helplessness that the test subjects feel once the guards begin their cruel reign of terror and brutal mindfu ck tactics.</fullReview>

It's a thought-provoking and well-performed look at an experiment where a number of male volunteers are placed in an experimental environment where some are chosen to be prisoners and some are chosen to be guards with the incentive to complete the experiment being a cash payoff.What unfolds after the experiment is underway a clash of egos between a headstrong "prisoner" (who is actually an undercover investigative journalist) and a strict and cruel "guard" who appears at first to be quiet and introverted but eventually becomes mad with power. Their struggle splits the prisoners and guards down the middle and turns 'em frothy on each other. Sh!t gets real real quick.

		<fullReview>Can't say that I was all that pressed to see THE EXPERIMENT, despite the several recommendations that I had received about it. The box art looked lame and just didn't really look to be my sort of thing. But after watching this film - it's one of the best I've seen in a long time. Somewhat comparable to other films concerning "good situation turned bad in an enclosed area" like THE HOLE and MY LITTLE EYE - THE EXPERIMENT is a harrowing view of what can happen when people are treated like animals...Loosely based on actual experiments conducted at Stanford University - THE EXPERIMENT focuses on a group of "test subject" who volunteer to be part of a study on prison behavior. Twenty men are split up into guards and prisoners (8 guards, 12 prisoners) and are to be paid for their 2-week participation in the study. The guards and prisoners are left pretty much to their own devices by the experiment "overseer", with just some very flimsy rules to keep both the prisoners and guards in-check. The film primarily focuses on Tarek, a prisoner with a penchant for disobedience - and his "nemesis" Berus, a no-nonsense guard who will go to any lengths to "succeed" in the experiment. As rules get bent and things get out-of-hand - the whole experiment eventually turns into uncontrollable chaos...THE EXPERIMENT is excellent on every level. The story is interesting and engaging, the performances are top not, the prison location is suitably stark and oppressive - I really can't find fault at all with this film, I truly enjoyed it immensely. Not exactly a horror film - but I would definitely recommend this one to horror and action/drama fans as one of the more tense and suspenseful films I've seen in quite a while. Highly Recommended - 9/10</fullReview>

I first saw this a couple of years back aired on BBC 2 and I was really impressed to say the least. OK, you could argue that it is unrealistc. An experiment of prisoners and guards taken to the extreme. But who cares? It was a compelling and tense experience. A well cast Moritz Bliebtreu who I must admit i've never heard of delivers a great performance and is the prisoner put under most pressure and the prisoner who initially pushes things to the limit. But then, the guards bend the rules and start to take over. To be quite honest, you don't really need to understand the language. The picture tells its own story, but the subs are there on the DVD if you really think you would be lost otherwise. Go buy the DVD now. It is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a true horror film- meaningful exploration of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a highly disturbing, well-wrought, careful examination of the hellish edge of the *reality* of the human condition. The truth and skill of how the characters are revealed and interact enhances the superb acting, and swiftly rolled away any heavy-handedness for me. Most interesting though is the message. The point of the film is less "what happens when regular people are given absolute control," but more "humanity in conflict is evil, and the human condition is conflict." Both the prisoners and the guards go insane as they cannot step away from the dominance contest. Biology impels them to win at all costs, and breaks down their psyche as it becomes apparent that while neither winning nor freedom is an option, they must fight. The strong eventually learn what the soldier knows-make no friends, be anonymous and thus difficult to manipulate, and the weak are just crushed. This movie is upsetting as it reminds us of what we really are away from the blissful lazy comfort of home and protection. It reminds us of the real horror in the world. Much of what humanity experiences is brutal struggle for survival, from Iraqi prisons to L.A. gangs. Without hope of refuge from the struggle, or outsider influence, humanity is boundlessly cruel and violent. And here I would like to explain to the countless people who thought the "girlfriend subplot" was extraneous: love is what gives peace, and keeps us civilized.And yes, many of the details were "unrealistic," such as the timetable of events, but EVERY MOVIE has this characteristic. Why do people complain about it when a movie has real power? Does it matter whether it took 5 days or 45 days to get to that point? The message remains, and you will have trouble sleeping after you watch this.Really good movies (all also based on books) that this movie reminds me of: Apocalypse Now A Clockwork Orange Requiem for a Dream</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome film, very exciting and involving and technically excellent.The love interest has been mentioned as being out of place and I am in 2 minds about this. When everything else has been picked apart, the love interest will probably linger as the most 'artistic' part of the film - it's told in odd flashes that represent thoughts and feelings of #77. On the other hand the meeting between the 2 is extremely silly and her moving into his apartment while he is away and replacing his buddy monitoring him (whatever happened to him?) in the experiment was just silly. There's no on screen chemistry between them or a sense that they even know each other, no background of the girl, rather just these flashbacks presumably taking part in a day or 2.Fundamentally, the disintegration between the 2 groups happens way too fast. Friendly bantering gives way to vicious and violent bullying almost immediately (#77 gets beaten, his head shaved and communally pi**ed on - IMDb didn't allow this word, ironically considering the film and they insisted on capitalising Nazi - almost immediately) and there's no acclimatisation boundary between the 2 - it just happens almost immediately. This is what makes the film fascinating though and makes you want to seek out the results of the 'real experiment'this is based on, that I'm sure many people have heard of. I've read psychological texts about children being split into blue/brown eyed groups and we all know that in Nazi extermination camps atrocities far worse than this film took place that more horrifically prove the basic message of this film. I doubt the guard group would have resorted to such violence so soon though - especially as they seemed to be released from the experiment back to their normal lives for periods every day? I'm not sure if this is right? They seemed to come and go in the facility as they pleased? I find it interesting people compare this film to the recent Abu Ghraib abuse which I hadn't considered but is probably very valid.I also didn't get the (ex?) air force man? What was his motivation and purpose there? Maybe just ex-forces looking for money? What was 77's ultimate purpose there? He seemed to say he wanted to 'bring the experiment down'? Why? There was little background to him other than being an ex-reporter with a never seen partner who currently drives a cab? Wasn't he more interested in getting sensational footage, which explains his early actions taunting the 'guards'? Wasn't #77 set up to be claustrophobic? - he certainly coped with the 'black box' easily (it was displayed as a thing of dread both in the prison and to the audience) and why was there a screwdriver in there?? Hope I don't sound too critical as it was overall a thoroughly entertaining (in fact exciting and gripping) film and quite thought provoking - pretty rare these days.</fullReview>

This ought to be a must-see for all fans of reality shows on TV, not to forget all who delve deeply into philosophy and the different aspects of the psyche of mankind.As I see it, this movie shows a glimpse of what a Theologian probably would call original sin, the rottenness of humanity and how it surfaces based on drifts towards power - or rather the lust for power.But hey. There are more to the human mind than that. Never count it a fact that everyone who is stepped on remains a subject. Absolutely a movie you should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping,horrifying,must see German thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting German psychology drama that takes its inspiration, and a large amount of its narrative detail, from the doomed Stanford Prison Experiment. Ultimately ridiculous, but nonetheless compelling viewingThe Stanford Prison Experiment was a doomed research project in the early 1970s that aimed to test the psychological effects of prison life. A group of student volunteers were divided into prisoners and guards and placed in a mock-up of a prison. Famously, the experiment got completely out of control and had to be aborted when the prisoners began to rebel and the guards began to torture them. It was nothing like as crazy, however, as the events depicted in The Experiment. In its early stages, the film closely follows happenings in Stanford - mirroring actual events (the prisoners are stripped naked and deloused and made to wear dresses; there is a unified uprising against the guards) and even providing plenty of pseudo-scientific interest by closely marking the psychological deterioration of the subjects. It trots along, aided by a pacey Teutonic-techno soundtrack and some impressive ensemble set pieces.We get a few decent characters: Tarek (the likable Bleibtreu - star of Run Lola Run), a taxi driver and journalist who hopes to sell a story about the prison; Sch??tte (Stotowski), a lonely, but unfailingly sweet kiosk owner who dreams of buying a Ferrari; and Berus (Dohn? nyi), a guard with severe body odor problems. It is he who begins to send things off the rails - encouraging the guards to enter a frenzied battle against the rebellious prisoners, particularly ringleader Tarek. Eventually they drag him naked from his cell, beat him up, shave his head and urinate all over it as Berus screams "Who stinks now?". Events escalate from there, moving from the almost believable to the utterly ridiculous. The pressure cooker build-up of the early stages collapses into a no-holds-barred orgy of violence. Psychological probing and motivational questioning makes way for a distinctly straightforward and increasingly ludicrous fight of good against evil. Originally subtle allusions to Nazism and the corrupting nature of power are replaced by camp salutes and elaborate, over-the-top torture. However, as far as dumb entertainment goes, it's good stuff. Head bad guy Dohn? nyi makes a great Nazi - all mad staring eyes and raging red jowls. And although overblown, the violence still has the power to be deeply shocking. There's some particularly nasty playing with knives and a claustrophobic's worst nightmare: 'the box', a tiny dark safe that the luckless Tarek is shoved into. The final showdown plays out at a cracking pace and it's nothing if not visceral. Riveting - if crazed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, violent drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well acted thriller in which a group of men volunteer to take on the roles of prisoners/guards in an experimental situation. Very quickly, the guards become menacing and the prisoners become more and more cowed one by one, with just a couple of them left willing to stand up to the bullying. The film illustrates vivdly how power struggles can become more and more malevolant as the two factions vie for supremacy. The struggle eventually comes down to a head to head struggle between two individualsl, neither of whom will back down. The acting is very good, if a little overwrought at times, but a particularly subtle and touching performance by Oliver Stokowski as the sad and lonely Prisoner 82 is very moving. His use of facial expressions to show his emotions is excellent and for me carries off the honours. Worth watching if you are into serious drama but be prepared for an emotionally draining experience when the tension cranks up in the last half-hour of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Experiment is a German film inspired by the true story of the Stanford Prison Experiment conducted in 1971. As part of the experiment, a collection of random volunteers are split into two groups and put into a make-shift jail for two weeks with the promise of $2000 if they complete the full term. Half were put in cells and given numbers as prisoners, while the other half were given uniforms &amp; batons are were told to portray that of peace keeping prison guards. The experiment was intended to observe and chart the behaviors of males given adverse conditions. The prisoners waived their civil rights and the guards were given the authority to direct the prisoners without as necessary without the use of excessive violence. In just one day, the role playing becomes severe and the guards begin to exert their presence by punishing those who do not obey their commands. Punishment at this point would result in simple push-ups.By day three, the punishment evolves and the men are stripped of their clothing or forced to sleep on the floor if instructions were not carried out to the letter.Things continue on a downward spiral until day six, when all hell breaks loose. One prisoner is put in a box as a form of solitary confinement, one prisoner is beaten and one of the sympathetic guards is thrown in with the prisoners due to his acknowledgement that maybe they are going too far. The movie is centrally focused on two characters ? the head guard Berus played by Justus von Dohnanyi and Tarek Fahd (known throughout the film as prisoner 77) played by Moritz Bleibtreu. As hours pass and each volunteer dissolves more into their role playing character, these two enemies begin a cat and mouse game that results in violence and eventually, death.German director Oliver Hirschbiegel, does a fairly good job by keeping the pace moving and the main characters interesting. His failure is spending the time to try and explain to the audience how the guards could so quickly change in personality and become so sadistic in just two days. Hirschbiegel then throws in a potential rape situation that just seems too implausible to believe. However, in his defence, the actual Standford Prison Experiment did conclude that based on the environment, ordinary people cut off from the outside world do begin to evolve quickly into their role characters. The experiment ? which is still widely quoted and supported by the psychology profession today ? was shut down early (only 6 of the 14 days were completed) due to the violent nature exuded by the guards and harm inflicted upon the prisoners.In all, the movie is an above average character study. In German, it is hard not to relate the sadistic guards as Nazi Gestapo, but that makes the movie more believable. We may not understand the motivation of the characters, but an interesting yarn all the same. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was reminded of the Milgram experiment where, in the interest of psychological research, they pulled in a random selection of people and had them sit in front of a console with a video screen and a dial. On the video screen they could see a person (a psych student) wearing electrodes and strapped down. They were then told by people wearing white 'lab' coats (psych students)to turn the dial to a certain number. They then saw the ostensible subject of the experiment writhing in pain and screaming. As they turned the dial further, the 'subject' reacted even more extremely. If I remember correctly, less then 1/5 of the randomly selected individuals questioned the 'white coats' as to the necessity of the electric shocks. Only one person flatly refused to go further. One person even went so far as the 'death' of one of the 'subjects.' This film is much more terrifying than any horror I've ever seen precisely because ANYBODY could've been a prisoner or a guard. Any human has the power to hate and fear or to be hated and feared. The film forces the question- a terribly intimate one- what would I do in this situation?Here's a helpful link that Atbauer posted on the message boards about the experiment upon which this film is based.http://www.prisonexp.org</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on a true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new German movie is based on a novel, Black Box, by Mario Giordano, which drew on the famous Stanford Prison Experiment for inspiration. In 1971 the university began a planned two-week experiment into the psychology of prison life by dividing up a group of students into prisoners and guards. The whole thing had to be scuttled after only six days when the guards became sadistic and the prisoners showed signs of extreme stress and depression. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel effectively translates the psychological horror of the experiment, skillfully peeling away the layers of acceptable behavior until the grisly final third of the film. A study in what happens when you strip away the power from one group and give it to another, The Experiment casts stereotypes ? the rebel, the submissive, the sadist ? in easily identifiable roles. It's no surprise that Tarek Fahed, Number 77 (Moritz Bleibtreu) is the rebel, he has the look of a troublemaker, what is surprising is the idea that by simply changing their clothes to shapeless prison smocks or dark blue guard uniforms changes the personality of the characters. The prisoner's dress-like smocks strip away their masculinity, making them subservient to the sharply dressed authority figures. The Experiment packs many ideas into its 114-minute running time, and by the end you'll be questioning the very nature of all relationships, not just institutionalized ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So ok, there were points where the film failed to deliver like what is the purpose of the experiment and the subplot of Prisoner 77 and his love interest ? However, beyond that, it was a movie that got me feeling stressed and yet riveted at the same time. I was wondering the real possibility of it happening to all of us should we be thrown into such a situation, and I think it is here that the film succeeds. This film blurs the line between film fiction and life reality.I have not seen such an intense film in a long while, and I found myself looking at my watch for the ending - not so much because I was bored, but because I was feeling the exact emotions as the characters in the film - namely, stress, claustrophobia, fear... Great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still shaking,having trouble on breathing well and disturbed,I just came back from watching "The Experiment",this movie was so powerful that on it´s climax there so many mixtures of emotions that i found myself dropping a few tears without even knowing why,The tension and the stress of it all made me vulnerable to its story and got to some inner fears or something,It just got me upset and when it was over i just sighed in relief, It´s been a while since i´ve had an experience like this in a movie theater,up to a point where in a scene near the ending I was the only one who kind of screamed "Ohhhhhh"...when the scene continued i sensed i was the only one watching it...then kind of listened to the guy on the side of me saying "Damn...what is this movie" and i felt o.k.The story is easy,there´s an experiment going on and they choose 20 men to make it happen,it´s a mock prison,8 of those guys are guards and 12 are prisoners, They´ll all get well paidd for lasting 20 days and they can go away from the experiment anytime they feel like it.The main character is a prisoner and he doesn´t like rules very much so that´s when the punishment begins.Excellent camera work,great casting because they really deliver and great timing makes this movie a masterpiece you have to see. I´ll give it a good 10 out of 10 on Suspense movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, taking you all the way to its climax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! I've been on the edge of my seat after 10 minutes of this movie. people saying it has a slow start? not me. It takes you very slowly to it's climax, a bit to slow maybe but that is how holds your attention, so thats perfect.This movie is in my top 5 for 2002.some weak points: The whole "legal" situation around the experiment doesn't feel right. Where is the contract? show it! Why are the scientists be?ng so na?ve and unprepared? Why are human rights violated here. Also the volunteers seem to be unknowing about what the experiment exactly is until their right in it and its to late.strong points: On the other hand: doesn't the smell of power feel familiar to you? as for the herd behaviour of humans, acting in groups etc. Everyone of you knows what is is to act in a group, you've probably all experienced it. And add to it that a person is smart but that a crowd is dumb. I personally have a great apathy against situations where people do things they would normally never do, just because that is what the "group" does or that it feels good to do it in a group. This movie only strengthens that feeling even more and makes me even more frightened of the strength(power) and the stupidness of people in groups.To conclude, the big strength of this movie is, imo, the frustration, but also the familiarity with the escalating, cascade of the events and the knowledge they can't be stopped. The inmates are annoying, the guards strike back, the inmates become resistant, the guards take counter measures, etc. It only grows worse. And it's that knowledge of people that stays with you after you've seen this movie...Also it reminds me of Umberto Eco's (Italy) masterpiece "Il pendulo di Foucault" ("Foucault's pendulum"). Where he describes how a couple of people get killed by believing in a plan or "game" they made up themself by misinterpreting the world around them (or their frame of reference of it). It seems to me that the guards took the experiment and specificly their objectives too seriously. And they lost their common sense with it. On the other hand, it happens all the time, or at least, we should be weary that it doesn't happen all the timePS: For the (American/English) people complaining about subs.... please stay objective and don't judge the movie by your irritations about subtitles. I imagine it can be annoying, being used to english movies. I grew up with subtitles, no problem for me here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was simply amazing. Personally, I normally hate films with subtitles because you don't get any of the emotions from the voices, but this was different. The film starts off slowly enough, with the main character, a journalist, applying to a newspaper ad for an experiment with 20 men, simulating a prison. Gradually as the film progresses we start to see the guards getting power hungry, and forgetting that the experiment is not real. They are terrible to the prisoners, and everything they do pushes the barrier of what is OK further and further. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but by the end, I really, truly hated the prison guards, and it stirred up some strong emotions in me when they got their come-uppance. If you haven't seen this film, then rent it out, it is too good to miss. Incidentally - and I am not entirely sure if this is 100% true - in the 70s the British and other Western governments conducted such experiments, and got the same frightening results. Really makes you think, doesn't it: could I have done what the guards do?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't like German films. Yes, I am German, but I think that most german movies are either plain boring or stupid rip-offs of successful Hollywood-movies. There were some very bad slasher movies (Flashback for example) or extremely stupid teen comedies (Harte Jungs). And I hope noone has seen Werner Herzogs remake of Nosferatu. God, I hate that movie!!! But Das Experiment is a film that is entirely convincing. The acting is superb and you have a really great story. This movie left me breathless and left me thinking what I would do if I was in such a situation. Where does civilization end and instinctual group behaviour takes over where power is everything and the individual is nothing? This is a movie standing in line with other great German films like Das Boot or Run, Lola, Run.Believe me, these are very rare moments in German film.</fullReview>

The men are all given such humanity and depth, and their mutual descent is so horrific, that it makes the extraordinary events all the more believable and poignant.

		<shortDescription>Absorbing, disturbing film that makes you think and shiver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absorbing and increasingly disturbing film. Reminiscent of "Lord of the Flies" and "The Wave" (Die Welle), the experiment shows how a simulated situation rapidly turns into real experience for the people involved and how it just as rapidly gets out of hand.Just as the Professor leading the experiment tells the guards at the start that they are not to play the role of guards but that they are now guards, so all involved, both prisoners and guards, slip into their new personalities at a pace that is frightening. Provoked by the rule-breaking prisoner number 77 (Moritz Bleibtreu), a reporter looking for a big scoop, a natural leader begins to emerge from among the guards. The apparently quiet Mr Berus, who prides himself on never having been late for work in 7 years, soon turns into a power-hungry, dictatorial figure who punishes by degradation and prides himself on keeping order in his prison. The other guards, seeing that these tactics work, follow him and begin to like the taste of power too.The strict rule of no violence against the prisoners is really meaningless from the start, as what is meant by "violence" is not defined beforehand. Right from the second day where the guards force the prisoners to strip naked and then blast them with water from a fire extinguisher, it becomes clear that the line between keeping order and the use of violence is very thin indeed.As the tension in the prison rises and the treatment of the prisoners turns, without doubt, into brute force, a couple of guards begin to question the tactics, especially as some of the prisoners are showing signs of deep psychological stress. However, dissent leads to punishment even amongst the guards and thus no critical momentum can be built up.This film undoubtedly recreates the conditions prevalent in the Third Reich, showing how in an atmosphere of threat and tension, it is frighteningly easy for normal people to assume roles that lead to behaviour that they wouldn't have believed possible before.Well-acted, well-filmed, it is a film that glues you to the screen and pulls you in to the harrowing scenes. It is a film that makes you think and shiver, but that's the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is based upon a true story - an experiment at the Stanford University in the 1970´s: a simulation of a real situation in jail. A group of men is separated in guardians and prisoners. In times of German puberty comedies as "Mädchen Mädchen" it´s amazing that "Das Experiment" is so successful. It´s dark, with "edges", uneasy to watch. It could happen anywhere and anytime. At first sight a harmful experiment - a psychological test of human behavior. It shows how easy it can escalate. Prisoner Tarek, a reporter (Moritz Bleibtreu) begins to provoke the guardians to write his big story. The guardians loose control of the reality. Violence, no basic laws - soon the situation looks like during the 2nd world war. But we´re in the year 2001. And that was exactly the point that made me afraid.A big praise to director Oliver Hirschbiegel and all the actors for their believable performances - especially Oliver Stokowski as prisoner Schütte touched me. I can recommend this film to anyone. But be prepared: it is VERY disturbing - and that is not enough to describe it! A truly memorable piece of German cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I say it was unwatchable, that would be a great injustice however the movie was nothing special, the story idea was not new and even within the known cliché there was no innovation. The critical problem was the very slow pace of screenplay. 2 hours is a long time for such movie, it could've been much better if they would trim the movie to something between 80 to max 90 minutes. Movie started very slow and remained slow till the end. Supposed to be shocking scenes were merely flat and unattractive. Another problem was poor character development which was worthy of a B movie and at the end there was some unanswered questions (not the good type of unanswered questions). Why the guard group had access to the outside? why they could even go home? Why no one searched them before letting them in? in one scene, one bottle of wine looked like a big deal among the guards but if they had access to the outside and apparently no one was searching them, it should not have been a big deal. Also the mysterious air force major, what was he doing among inmates? A 2 bit former reporter/taxi driver meets a woman one night in a car accident, takes her home (I buy that) and sleeps with her (I buy that too) and develops telepathy connection with her (total bull***, a rip off). The presence of this lady has nothing to do with the resolve of the movie, even when she shows up at night at the experiment facility (known as medical school), she fails play any roll in the resolve except to take the gun from one scene to another which could have been done by anyone. I guess they squeezed her in so they would not end up with an all male movie which would've been unattractive for most females or couples. Overall not a movie I can suggest even for merely a night no brainer entertainment.</fullReview>

However, the second half diverts massively from the true story, thereby completely missing the point of this psychological folklore.

		<fullReview>The best group psychological behavior movie since long, or how would act/do most human under the Authority agreement, considering the fact that most people have sadistic and/or submissive potentials (under certain circumstances), as long as there is a strong leader in any group.The Stanford Experiment is the basis of this movie, and even though the conclusions of the S.E. were contested, with comprehensive reasons from a scientific point of view, for my humble understanding of human nature, I unfortunately have to agree the conclusions are definitively true.Many comments do take in consideration Abu Graib, or the last WW2, but it's only because we know nothing about what is still going on every day of the year, in too many countries.Newspapers make a big thing every once a few years, but it's only because the Freedom of Knowledge is quiet under control on this Earth, as long there are only very few courageous journalist/politicians/legal actors/banking or industry leaders/and/or individuals that really act/shout against Unjustice, because most of them live and make money on it ! (except last category)And second (the possible main point), they are mostly friends, even apparently and publicly they disagree with each other.I remember an incredible thing that happened in Madagascar in 1992, or 1993; I was working there 4 months a year (for 8 consecutive years), and since 1991, there was a big clash between the then actual President ("elected dictator") Ratsiraka and the opposition of most malagasy people, politicians included.For the background, that year there was a manifestation and one million people marched against the president palace. My malagasy friends told me to come... I just replied that was may be not the best way to do, because president's were no good boys... However this day according to the government, there were about 12 officially dead, killed in a "self-defensive response" from the guards, but it was from an helicopter gun machine and the more reality there were about 200 persons who were killed this day (according Red Cross)... Sad you'd say... obviously me too !But coming back to the "Newspapers paragraph" above, what really puts me down is that a few time later there was a direct TV show between two representatives of the government and two from the "opposition" party, and a journalist. As the talks went on, they all started quiet politely, but more and more it went on were really becoming aggressive, to almost shout against each other at the end, I mean government and opposition people.The only one who tried to cool it down was the TV showman... who at the end of the official program thanked every one...This was the end of the program... BUT the camera continued to shoot on live...After about 30 seconds everyone started to chat and laugh to each other very friendly, and pleasant again ! The show was supposed to be off program, no more shooting...This very day, I will never forget !2 minutes ago they were all together apparently showing a real and true disagreement, talking about how many were killed, arguing, and so on, almost fighting...Then laughing and chatting...If you consider this story, this is not exactly the topic of this movie... but close to what I'm saying : most people collaborate, even though it possibly does not please them entirely.Following other "happenings" I've seen before I thought I was no more so naive...For everything what is in The Experiment, it's brilliant, the only weakling thing is the woman flashback, but it's a very minor thing, to cut down the tension, but finally helps to reinforce it afterward. The escalate is real, the acting and script and filming is all together compact, for real !At the end, I just cried, not for the movie, I know it's one !But because this could help many to realise and behave differently...The "Authority" is always a bad thing, unless it's not due to self respect to the authority's kindness and knowledge which should only be taken as a positive example.For me, may be only the Dalai Lama is a worldwide known person (to me) who really is a true example, and as for he's not invited in a main ecclesiastic conference, I just laugh : one of the Only !To kill someone, is a bad thing, an horrible thing, but if you do it under the Authority consent because it tells you have the obligation and right to do it otherwise you'll be the next one on the list to be killed and not ONLY because YOU are sincerely convinced you must do it for your deepest belief AND for your personal soul justice (if it does possibly exist), then you may enter in doing things how we see in this movie.Of course, it's not easy : self respect is a difficult thing to deal with, for everyone...It reminds me another brilliant must see movie : Closet Land (1991), which deals too with the topic, beautifully shots, but only with an inmate and a woman prisoner.I wonder if any movie maker could translate and adapt the topic... for a children movie !It seems, since a few years, in Europe and particularly in Germany, they are again excellent directors, who deals with the notion of Autority or Power abuse...Die Welle (The Wave) (2008) is also a damned good example.Anyway for The Experiment, just take the helicopter for you next dealer... (but just don't shoot him :-)or easier, take the phone to buy/rent/steal (for the last word, I do sincerely discourage it:-) this must see movie ! *** a film is never really good unless the camera is an eyes in the head of a poet Orson Welles ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Berus vs 77, Experiment, Das (2001) , amazing experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it took me close on 7 years to watch it, so it took me to do a thread about my personal prison based film project on IMDb to get some prompts for this film, I'm just like Novacaine, if you give me time, I get there.Based on the real life Stanford prison experiment in 1971, Das Experiment is a fabulous construction of seams coming apart in the human psyche, the film's triumph is that we are never left in any doubt that things are going to go pear shaped from the off, but the fact that it manages to bash you over the head with its bluntness to reinforce the point, is, magnificent story telling. As much as the film disturbs, it is as much an education of the human condition under trying circumstances. Moritz Bleibtreu &amp; Justus von Dohnanyi play Tarek &amp; Berus respectively, with both men giving superlative performances as the two lynch pins to the film's unravelling terror.This is not merely an experiment, but a test where the results are dangerously grounded in facts, it's bleak, it's at times harsh, but it actually is essential cinema for those looking for a kicker where the boot on the foot is all too real and was once wore by the man next door to you. It's rating on some internet sites is a disgrace IMHO, I have drop-kicked Der Untergang over the goal posts to make this my new favourite German film. I probably shouldn't go 10/10 for the film after it has scarred me from ever listening to The Beach Boys classic "Wouldn't It Be Nice" ever again, for now that tune will never seem jolly, it will just serve as a reminder of what a brilliantly bleak film Das Experiment is. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling psychological thriller. A satisfying movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard a lot about this movie before I saw it so my expectations were exceptionally high. Usually when that happens, no matter how good the movie turns out to be, I'm always a little disappointed. This was not the case with Das Experiment. It is by no means perfect but I would classify it as exceptional.I think Hollywood will not be able to make a remake that even comes close to the original. I wonder why they bother...remakes are very seldom any good.Lately I've become a big fan of German Cinema. It all began with the great 'Goodbye Lenin' and went on with 'Das Leben Der Anderen' and other great German cinema art. I decided to give Das Experiment a try. I half expected it to be some over the top sick and violent movie and even though it was violent, the violence is necessary in the specific scenes and those scenes are very powerful because of the great tension build up in each one. The director deserves credit for that. It takes a long time before anything actually happens and when it does, it's really shocking.The plot is fairly simple and I think they did a very good job writing the screenplay. The story flows naturally and never feels like a screenplay but like something that could actually happen in real life. The reactions of the prisoners are very natural and so is the dialog. No fake speeches or complicated exposés here.The acting was good, especially the 'evil' antagonist delivers a great performance. The protagonist was a bit over-classed but he hold his own too.The build up to the climax is superb and I felt really satisfied at the end. That's pretty much all I want out of a movie so I award this movie a well deserved 8.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film based on true story adapted on a book concerns about a diverse group of 20 male participants what are locked for a psychological experiment.They are contracted for human experiment as prisoners and wardens. The jail is set up in a research laboratory with hidden cameras and complete surveillance . Some of them become into prison guards and inmates .The starring is an undercover journalist(Moritz Bleibtreu)to investigate the quirky experiment. In the beginning the events happen easily and everybody can to leave at any time but the experiment turn into fascist situations when the jailers employ drastic pains including punishment, physical abuse, panic attack and crude violence.The movie contains a thoughtful argument with suspense, psychological intrigue and lots of violence. Although is quite interesting, however packs some tiring moments but is pretty claustrophobic. The picture is classified ¨R¨ because displays strong scenes with attempted rape, male nudity, urination and profanities. Casting is frankly excellent with special mention for the protagonist Moritz Bleibtreu, he's an experienced actor with good acting in ¨elementary particles¨ and ¨Lark farm¨, and played as secondary in ¨Munich¨, furthermore a recent filming of ¨Baader - Meinhof¨. The film is well directed by Oliver Hirschbegel in his first great success. His previous work was for TV episodes and television pictures like ¨Todfeinde¨ with Tobias Moretti and Heino Ferch and directed to Moretti in some chapter of ¨Kommissar Rex and Baby Rex¨. His greatest hit smash is, of course, the magnificent¨Downfall¨ with Bruno Ganz as Hitler. He's nowadays working for Hollywood in his recent shooting ¨The invasion¨, a new version of ¨Body snatchers¨with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly well done, but don't watch it for the facts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not watch foreign films much. I usually find that constantly reading the subtitles takes me out of the movie. However I was extremely surprised with this film. The spoken language is German (which is actually more effective than if they were speaking English) and although the subtitles are in big white letters at the bottom they never get in the way of the screen. The camera shots are very well done and the sets are all realistic in an eerie, creepy sort of way. However, even though this is a very effective thriller movie, there were some problems. The first one was the side story of the main character (#77) and his girlfriend. This story only slowed the movie down. Also, while this movie is based on a true story, it takes many liberties at the end to the point where it becomes almost unrealistic. The suspense still remains, but afterward you will question how the events could have happened in that manner. Also, the ending left many questions unanswered. Nevertheless, this was a thriller that surpasses most of the junk that Hollywood is putting out these days. So if you are looking for something a little different and can read English, I suggest "Das Experiment."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Yeah that is what you'll be thinking after watching this movie. I recently watched this film on an Encore channel and I swear there were a couple of times I thought of turning the channel because of how much this movie was getting to me.The first 30 minutes are mildly entertaining but after that is when it starts to get VERY interesting. You pretty much know from the start of the movie that things are going to get out of hand but that won't take the shock away when it happens. The beatings, humiliation, killings, attempted rape. It's hard to imagine that things could go that far and these people could stray from reality that much. But it happens.I don't want to give any spoilers away even though as I said, it's pretty obvious what will happen. And this is based on a real experiment (though loosely I imagine) so if you wanted to look up information on what really happened I'm sure you could.I can honestly say that this was one of the most upsetting movies I have ever seen. By the end of the film, my anxiety level must have doubled. Very few movies give me this reaction but this one did. I wanted the movie to end and it be resolved yet I didn't because it WAS an interesting movie. I would recommend this to anyone looking to watch something a little different but I warn you, this is not a movie you can simply take lightly. And I would be surprised to find anyone who watched this and wasn't disturbed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you're still going to watch Das Experiment, don't expect too much of it. It's a movie mainly made for entertainment, not necessarily as a subject for long conversations about human nature or any other purposes.It's a thrilling movie that grabs your attention from start to end. The acting was great. I especially liked Nr.82, played by Oliver Stokowski.Although it probably wasn't meant to give any "psychological insight", I missed it a bit. The cruel behaviour of the guards was quite obvious, but I would have liked to see a slower, more detailed, development of this behaviour and the peer pressure between the guards. Where does this cruelty come from? Perhaps Dogville is a better choice to see how a group of normal people can get incredible bad towards weak persons. Luckily this lack gets compensated by a brilliant tension development.However, I enjoyed my eve watching this film. It was certainly worth rending. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating study of violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DAS EXPERIMENT is to violence what THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was to fear; an examination so thorough that the viewer is actually caught up in the maelstrom, and has no choice but to hang on until the end. Based on a real-life experiment conducted at Stanford University in the 1970s, the film studies the ease with which violent situations erupt in a realistic simulated prison setting, even when both the "inmates" and "guards" are just regular guys with no criminal background. The "prisoners" are locked down 24 hours a day and told to obey the orders of the "guards", who are allowed to leave when their shifts are over. Both are admonished not to use violence, at the risk of being expelled from the experiment without pay. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel paces this film perfectly; as each day passes and tensions grow, we find ourselves sympathizing more and more with the prisoners. This is not to say that the guards are strictly portrayed as heartless monsters. In fact, the brilliance of the film is how little difference exists between the two; a case could be made that for each prisoner, there is a guard with a matching personality, and vice versa. It is only when they taste arbitrary power that the guards begin to become corrupt and malicious, and the ones who have not, themselves, become vindictive and cruel are just swept along by the opinions of the guard with the loudest voice. It is as if the institution actually brings out the freedom to express their most primitive feelings. I would highly recommend this film to anyone with a taste for harsh, realistic filmmaking; the script, performances and visual style are all impeccable. Also, it was nice to finally see a prison movie in which the nudity wasn't exclusively male.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christian Berkel came out to be the only reason I even tolerated this movie. The movie is about 'What if Germans did the Standford Prison Experiment'. Or something along those lines. I am still at a loss for words after seeing this a few days ago, so I will say this. If you're one of those people who can't tolerate a movie where the characters make asinine decisions for what seems to be the sake for the movement of plot, then you will hate this movie, as I did. Although I didn't hate it that much. There were some interesting parts that were interesting, however, the characters, on all sides, were just so unrealistic to me that this would simply never happen. I am not one of those people who yells out about unrealistic things. However, I do hate when characters are 1-dimensional and pretty much just play the role of bad-guy, anti-hero, and etc.Just to give you a glimpse of what to expect out of the decisions you can look forward to in the film: If you were a lead professor in an experiment consisting of 20 human subjects and were making giant breakthroughs, would you take a day or two from your schedule to completely IGNORE your experiment/project? Well this guy does.It's just stupid and in the end has no real conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and Confronting Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Olivier Hirschbiegel received a lot of criticism and opposition when he released his masterpiece "Der Untergang", focusing on Adolf Hitler's final days, but his first major international success (if you can call "Das Experiment" that) wasn't exactly a "safe" project, neither. Let's face it; of all the countries in the world, Germany was the least likely one to first adapt the true story of the infamous Stanford Prison Experiments. This project led by professor Zimbardo in 1971, which severely ran out of hand, studied the human responses ? mental as well as physical - to captivity and this seen from both sides of the bars. Considering the nation's history this adaptation was quite a risky cinematic undertaking, especially if you know that the real project revealed the true (and unimaginably hideous) nature of people when offered unlimited power and it had to be terminated prematurely because the guards became overly sadistic and the prisoners traumatized for live after just five days. So, definitely hats off to Hirschbiegel and the entire cast, because the film version definitely didn't "soften" the facts. Quite the contrary, the movie goes one step beyond the actual outcome of the Stanford Experiment, but it's easy to imagine that real casualties would have fallen if it hadn't been stopped in time. "Das Experiment" is a constantly suspenseful and disturbing thriller, and it's often very confronting as well, since you can't help wondering how you would react to the situations depicted on screen. It's easy enough to claim that unlimited power won't affect you in a negative way, but this film proves that inside every calm and reasonable human being homes a vicious and power-mad animal. The script follows Tarek Fahd (Moritz Bleibtreu of "Run, Lola, Run" and "Fandango"), who enrolls into the project as an undercover freelance journalist, armed with a hi-tech video camera hidden in his glasses and an unhealthy dose of courage. He's appointed a prisoner, along with eleven fellow participants, against eight guards. The inmate quickly discover they're on the wrong side of the cell doors, as the guards revert to physical violence and severe acts of humiliation after only 36 hours. Particularly the participants that are the most aggrieved in real life (like Berus, the guard who suffers from an unpleasant bodily odor) fully grab the opportunity to release all their oppressed anger and frustration. The situation rapidly escalates even beyond the authority of the scientists and the "guards" take over the insinuated prison. You could claim that "Das Experiment" only states the obvious, namely that power corrupts, but director Hirschbiegel brilliantly processes the subject matter and it continuously feels like an originally shocking movie experience. The film never reverts to any gratuitous bloodshed, but it's far more disturbing than any gory film could ever be. The sub plot revolving on main character Tarek's romance with a woman he met just a few days before the launch of the experiment (illustrated through flashbacks) is rather redundant, but in the end it neatly amalgamates with the pivot storyline. The movie's atmosphere is very grim and ominous at all times, and the ensemble cast achieves this effect without the help of specific set pieces or visual gimmicks, just sheer versatile acting talents. No wonder director Olivier Hirschbiegel enjoys a respected status in Hollywood these days (he just finished directing the umpteenth remake of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers") as his debut film, after numerous made-for-TV films and episodes of Krimi-shows, is a psychological masterpiece with vision and loads of stylish elements like the use of tight color patterns (eerie variations of green) and shadows.</fullReview>

The delusion of authority unfolds, and where it was an experiment at Sanford, it was real elsewhere at Gitmo and Iraq.. It gives great insights into the social situation of guards, and how the most paranoid/authoritarian choice gains group acceptence over a simple matter like drinking milk, and then it quickly grows to the point of absurdity. Those in authority fear to lose their grip, and will turn on their own people, too. Like an imperial president who replaces honest advisors with those who follow his orders, the situation in the prison is our society. The fear of losing authority to a challenger quickly changes authority to tyranny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a true incident. Scientists ask for volunteers in an experiment--they pick 15 people (I think) to be prisoners and 7 or so to be guards. For 2 weeks they are to live in a prison-like environment with the scientist monitoring them to see how people react in that environment. One rule--no violence can be used by the guards. Right away the prisoners act up and the guards use humiliation (making them strip naked) to calm it down. Then the humiliation escalates, the scientists lose control and the guards take over...The message here is nothing new--it just shows us how easily people can turn brutal or completely break down under extreme circumstances but I've never seen it done so graphically. This movie does not pull back and you see the guards become more cruel and the prisoners trying to keep control (and their sanity). All the acting is superb which, unfortunately, makes this movie harder to shake off. And the last half hour is almost unwatchable. This originally was unrated in the US (no one under 18 admitted)--it's been lowered to an R but it's VERY strong stuff. There's plenty of male nudity too.Worth seeing but only for strong stomaches.</fullReview>

I read about Philip Zimbardo's experiment a few years ago in Intro to Sociology, and I wondered how long it would take someone to make a film based on that experiment. While the actions of the guards near the end became a little too stylized, at least it kept to the main lesson of the story: people are easily prone to conformity and sadism. Sure, one will state that the former infusions of Nazism were being flaunted in the film, this evil is inherent in all men. Zimbardo's experiment was done on a college campus, and reading the accounts of what happened in that experiment proved all people hold and share that inherited evil. The only thing I didn't like about the film was the constant cutting away to Tarek's future girlfirend.It stunted the process of the story and slowed it down.</fullReview>

Although it is clearly not shot by the best technicians and directors around, and it has a TV movie feel, there's no denying that the story is so crazy that you cannot help but to be gripped when you discover the events that took place in Germany over a decade ago. As a social experiment, it has an extraordinary value. You are made to learn the extent of how humans operate depending on the circumstances that surround them and especially the amount of power that they have been handed. The scary thing is that you cannot help but realize that it could have been you. You could have been as cruel as any of the guys that humiliated the "fake" prisoners. This sort of experiments help better understand group behaviors and how to handle societies at large. Truly a must-watch movie. Not so much for its cinema value, but for the content of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A psychological thriller that observes the behavioural changes people undergo when they're placed in a position of power or submission in a confined atmosphere, Das Experiment is a patiently crafted, concisely narrated &amp; brilliantly performed feature that begins slowly but escalates soon enough into a nail-biting tale of survival.Das Experiment tells the story of Tarek Fahd; a taxi driver who, in order to make some quick cash, decides to take part in a social experiment after learning about it in a newspaper. The volunteers are assigned the role of guards &amp; prisoners in a simulated prison situation but it soon spirals out of control when the guards become aware of the power they have.Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel (best known for Der Untergang), Das Experiment borrows its concept from the real life Stanford Prison Experiment and pushes it into a dangerous realm but there are a few subplots it could have possibly done without for it only slows down the entire narrative and at times, is an unnecessary distraction. But the final act still brings it all together quite nicely.The situation under the prison is ingeniously captured on camera for we see human nature coming into play as the psychological effect of the roles assigned to these volunteers lead them to act in ways they possibly wouldn't in a different scenario. The regulated movement of the camera steadily intensifies the given circumstances as the story progresses and the cast chips in with convincing performances.On an overall scale, Das Experiment is an escalating nightmare that illustrates how a given situation attributes to unexpected changes in the behaviour of an individual and tends to intensify more n more as the plot moves forward, eventually culminating on a devastating note. Although a tighter editing would've benefited its narrative, Das Experiment delivers the goods for the most part and is definitely worth a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prison experiment gone wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Das Experiment" is a German thriller movie from almost 15 years ago. It runs for 2 hours and was directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. This is not the only very famous German film he made, because he is also responsible for "Der Untergang". Hirschbiegel and lead actor Moritz Bleibtreu, around the age of 30 here, received awards recognition on really a lot of occasions and Justus von Dohnányi had his big breakthrough with this movie as well and received a German Film Award just like Bleibtreu. There are more German actors in here who are still somewhat famous quite some time later today. This includes Möhring, Gärtner, Monot Jr., Sawatzki and Berkel.The premise is simply: 20 men are recruited to take part in a role play, in which 10 of them are prison guards and the other 10 are inmates. It does not take long until authority, testosterone and power turn the whole scenario into a complete mess that results in 2 casualties in the end and many more heavily injured, all of them emotionally basically. Early on, there is some joking about the whole situation, but things get far more serious pretty quickly. I thought this was a good thriller, very tense from start to finish, but very graphic as well, so this may not be for the easily offended. Violence is only psychological for almost the entire movie until it escalates physically towards the ending. I personally think that the way things turned out here is not too realistic, but it is not a problem at all to enjoy this as a fictional film, even if it is based on a real experiment. This film was so successful that there is an American movie from 2010 based on this one starring Oscar winners Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker. And, even more recently, there is another new American movie based on this one here with rising star Ezra Miller in the lead role. Overall, I recommend it, but be warned: This film is pretty tough to digest. Little final note to close this review: "Das Experiment" was Germany's submission to the Foreign Language Oscars, but did not score a nomination. One year later, Caroline Link's "Nowhere in Africa" won the Award.</fullReview>

It was disturbing and traumatizing in the most beautiful sense. I love to test my mental boundaries and indeed this movie did it for me; it danced around my threshold for psychologically distressing works of art. I'm not forgetting this one anytime soon (or rather, the mental masochist within me hopes I don't).Das Experiment was intense, definitely (an understatement). But the build-up of this tension was handled so masterfully, in terms of the pacing of the movie. In summary, it is about a group of men who volunteer for a high-paying experiment; a simulation of prison life and the power struggles average men undergo when some men are given the role of being guards, and others, prisoners. I think you can imagine how it turns out. I feel that things got out of hand a little early in the experiment portrayed (but not in the pacing of the movie), but what can I say, I'm not a psychologist and I haven't read up on the actual experiment. Moving on, the bulk of the movie was very thought-provoking for me, and I had to let those thoughts pour out on in a longer version of this review, on my blog. The point where I stopped thinking is when the movie got so intense and what was happening felt so inhumane and unfair that I just broke down. I was distressed with the characters' situation and I could not take it anymore. It wasn't sadness, so I felt like it was really a break down from the intensity of the movie. After that I guess I stopped thinking too much and focused more on the eventual resolve of the movie. The scenes preceding the resolve were intense and exciting as well, but at this point I was just taking it all in more passively than before. In summary, it was raw, gripping and well-paced; I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good thriller but not as interesting as it pretends to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Experiment' is based on the famous Stanford Prison Experiment, in which 24 Stanford students took on the roles of guards and prisoners for a psychological experiment in 1971. And within a period of only 6 days, those students had adapted to their roles so well that the conductors had to shut down the experiment prematurely. The experiment was seen by the conductors as an example for their hypothesis that the personality traits of prisoners and guards are the chief cause of abusive behavior in prison. However, it has since gone through quite a lot of criticism for many things including the ways the conductors influenced test subjects through their instructions, and the fact that students who volunteered for the experiment were mostly aggressive and authoritarian. It's also notable that BBC attempted to replicate this experiment in 2002 but did not get the same result.So in short, the Stanford Prison Experiment is not really an interesting discovery as it aspired to be, and so is this movie. Compared to the real-life experiment, the movie is even more ridiculous since it eventually ignores the test subjects' salary, one of the driven factors in the original experiment, and more importantly, it fails to mention the experiment's goal, and therefore makes the whole thing rather pointless. As the result, the only thing that the movie has 'proven' is violent people will act violently given the chance, a fact that can be seen in almost all thriller/action movies ever. The execution, fortunately, is a bit better that the premise. It's actually very suspense and gripping at times, and the characters' progression, at least within the first hour, is quite logical. The acting, however, was much less convincing. I've found myself laughing at some scenes that were supposed to be serious due to the terrible supporting cast. It also contains some very implausible details like how unprepared and understaffed the conductors are, or the relationship between the main character and his 'girlfriend'. I especially question the parts with the girlfriend, because I'm still not sure why the movie makers even felt that they needed to have her in the movie. As far as I can see, all she does is dragging the movie out, and showing some nudity.In conclusion, 'The Experiment' is a quite entertaining movie with a unique setting, but that's it. There's nothing really groundbreaking, or interesting about it. If that's what you expect, then I recommend watching a documentary on the original experiment instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't too sure what to expect when I first placed this movie in my 'watchlist' some days ago. Needless to say, however, i'm more than glad I did. 'The Experiment' was a rather harsh movie which really makes you feel helpless while watching. It's a story of insanity, fear and psychosis, all brought on by a poorly managed experiment. It was a very entertaining movie and I could really feel the emotions of each character and felt like I could somehow relate to their plight. My only complaint would have to be a lack of character development at points, because even though you felt for the characters in the movie, it still didn't really feel like you knew them. I would have especially liked more background on #77s cell-mate (that's not a spoiler now, is it?). Anyways, overall it was a great movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to a lover of violence and psychological suspense, as well as to someone who is captivated by cognitive experimentation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a already gripping true story, this German gem takes your heart out and plays around with it in this uncomfortable masterpiece. Already when the main character Tarek is tested for claustrophobic spaces, you get the feeling something's going to go wrong. The Stanford Prison Experiment this is based on (though more specifically based on the book "Black Box") plays out that twenty people are given the roles of prisoners and guards. The guards get huge advantages and can boss around very much as long as they don't use violence while the prisoners have no advantages whatsoever and have to watch their ass carefully is they don't want to get winded up in anything. Some of the prisoners, especially Tarek, begins provoking the guards almost from the very start and the more intense it gets, the more you start to shudder and feel like you are taped to an electric chair. I won't spoil too much, but I can say that pissing off the guards is not a particularly neat idea as they use drastic methods as early as on the second day, though partly it's also THEIR own fault that everything gets out of hand. The punishments the guards uses get all the more crueler. Not only that, but one of the organizers, Dr. Klaus, is completely oblivious to the seriousness of the continuing escalation... Moritz Bleibtreu is fantastic as the teaser who pushes the limits way too much and just as excellent is Justus von Dohnányl as Berus, the coldest prison guard you'll ever see. The dynamic between those two is great and another reason why you'd be a fool to miss out on this breathtaking experience! The cinematography is mesmerizing, nicely shifting between orange, blue and green. The music is not that present, but it's great also. The only minor criticism I have is that the relationship between Tarek and Dora is developed too quickly, but otherwise, it's a hit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed the blatant attempts to make this appeal to a wider audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's some grainy footage on youTube of the Stanford Prison experiment - it's worth watching either before or after seeing this film, to see how closely they tried to follow it. For example, the humiliating gowns that the prisoners had to wear are identical to those at Stanford Prison. How do you make a film that is entirely about men in a prison, interesting to women? Or indeed to a wider audience than just those interested in the psychological experiment? What this director did was contrive a female lover for one of the prisoners. The film cuts to her every ten minutes or so. Her role is loom around looking sad or anxious or concerned (she really is no deeper than that), and occasionally take her clothes off. They also invented a female, youngish employee of the laboratory, who is also always anxious and concerned, and also manages to lose her clothes at one point.This film envisages the original experiment going much further than it did, with the violence becoming extreme in the last half hour, leading to lots of running around from one peril to another. (I found it hard to retain my attention, as the interesting stuff had all been done and I expect they only put the chase scenes in to widen the audience appeal.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was impressed with this German made film which I found to be superior to its American copy starring Sean Penn later produced.This film is based loosely on a US sponsored experiment in which a prominent psychiatrist ran amok creating a prison in the basement of a noted liberal University. However differing from the real life experiment in which the participants, recruited from students between semesters received rather small emoluments, the movie version claims that the test subjects, recruited from newspaper ads were offered stupendous incentives for their collaboration.The film correctly states that volunteers were assigned roles and that as the experiment went on the participants fell into the roles that were given them. Indeed at one point the 'guards' kidnap one of the staff and throw her behind bars.In this version, a MI undercover agent has been inserted in the scenario in the role of a prisoner to act as a controller. He knows an escape route and can break up the experiment if he has to.There is a feel-good ending in which the mad scientist behind the experiment comes down on charges.In real life that never happened. Jocularly speaking of it a quarter century later, the real life psychiatrist hosted a US sponsored college course on psychology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not stop thinking about the fact that they had no security measures taken while conducting the experiment. Then again, this helps increase the suspense through the course of the experiment. I just did not find the take on "security" very convincing, since the only emergency protocol they had was to "call the professor". From the beginning of the movie, I couldn't stop thinking such an experiment where people are asked to surrender some of their civil rights would require supervision by government authorities and such. Apart from that, I was also troubled by the ability of the guards to access the outside world, while prisoners could not. The audience is not given much information about the layout of the experiment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film based on the novel by Mario Giordani about the Stanford Prison Experiment in which 20 volunteers agreed to spent two weeks in which one group of them will take the roles of guards and another group will take roles of prisoners. The prisoners were placed in the cells, and the guards had an easy task to maintain order without violence. Of course, if it was all by the rules, this film would not exist. Movie is directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, who became widely know for his movie from 2004. Downfall. He done his job very well, atmosphere is great, camera work could be better but it's satisfying. Technical par of the film is more than solid with excellent acting, especially from Moritz Bleibtreu (Run Lola Run, Munich) who plays the main character, Tarek Fahdia, journalists who expects to deliver a good story by participating in the experiment. The story is very interesting and tense, almost a textbook example of a real thriller with a well thought-out characters. Love story is completely unneeded and it largely destroys the impression of serious movie, but it is well blended into the overall story and does not cause as much damage as it seems at first glance. Historical inconsistency must be mentioned. Because of the dramatic story the events are shown much more extreme and violent, and real experiment was terminated when some volunteers became too violent and there were no deaths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abu Ghraib redux?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the German film The Experiment last night on Rialto Channel. The tale is a muddled psychological set up but the issues it looks at are interesting, what with all the prisoner abuse holding a lot of attention lately. How man turns beastly to man as soon as you grant him an inch of power over his victim was very interesting, especially the power games and humiliation meted out. Those British army watersports scenes - real or not - were inspired by a movie like this. There was a curious absence of sexual abuse, apart from calling each other 'weichei' (soft-boiled egg, or sissy). The main difference of course was the absence of women in the prison guard group, which some social theorists think would be mitigating male behaviour. Not that this was the case at Abu Ghraib, but then after her TV interview I have difficulty in classing Lynddee England as a member of womankind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A claustrophobic and artistic image of human barbarism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this film, and it is one of the most disturbing films I have watched to date. It constricts and confines your situation until you reach a state of claustrophobic foreboding and subliminal entrapment. The urge to take a break to open the pressure valve is one you must resist, this films full effect can only be attained by throwing yourself victim to the building tensions of the plot. The inability to sympathies with the lead character, the tacked on feel of the newspaper plot that is never really followed up is more than made up for by the delicate nuance of the flashes of love/lust/humanity interest Dora. Which though curious and open ended do contrast fantastically with the oppression of close confinement.Slight plot inconsistencies are bathed away with the psychological curiosity and the fear tinged tension that can easily envelop you if you let down your critical guard. This film is a a poignantly artistic reminder that in a society with an increasingly wide safety net, this film is a peak off of the edge: it is terrifying how far we have to fall and how easily we make the jump.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good movie, albeit some cliches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>possible spoilers aheadI rented this movie from the local videostore after having read about it in the newspapers. The critics were positive so I gave it a try.The story and idea behind 'Das Experiment' is like the Big Brother type of TV shows shown nowadays on television: isolate a few handfull of individuals, divide them into guards and prisoners, and observe them with cameras 24 hours a day. Sometimes it goes right, but in the case of this movie it escalates with several people killed and wounded. And that is what made this movie in my eyes worth seeing, that it demonstrates how ordinary people transform in little sadists when given a uniform to wear, and some other to shout at, especially if one of the guys wearing a uniform is persuasive towards the others, and when there is no control.However, some cliches are apparent in the movie, I will name two: the scientist who set up this experiment wants to continue at all cost, and the guard who initiates the abuse of the prisoners is the type of creepy fellow you expect to behave the way he does in the movie. But perhaps these are only cliches because there are true cliches.I rated this movie with 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible! I haven't been really shocked and horrified at a film for quite a while, since Requiem for a Dream, but this experience topped that. I know that the real experiment didn't go nearly as far as the film portrays, but I like that it extended the logic of the situation. In a way, it completes the sociological study. The problem with a lot of experiments involving humans is that it is inhumane, as shown here, but in film-making, with a little imagination, we can predict how the characters would have continued their descent into primal, dog-eat-dog type carnage. The rape scene was particularly hard to watch, just devastating. And the entire theater was shrieking at 77's encounter with the knife. The revenge was very sweet, a real release from the built-up tension of the rest of the movie, but it's turning the blame to the audience in a way, asking how we can judge the men in the film when we're reveling in what we feel to be "deserved" death. The Nazi references are pretty subtle, to the director's credit. A little "Heil" from the guards, seen in the security camera, was my favorite touch. Wonderful film all around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a powerful, tense thriller; I am by no means a hypersensitive type, but by the end of the film I found myself trembling with emotion, of which the predominant one, perhaps, was rage, yet mixed with helplessness. I was so affected, in fact, that I immediately started researching the real event on which "Das Experiment" is based, the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE) conducted by Dr. Philip Zimbardo in 1971.This is where a little disappointment occurs; although Giordano took some trouble to create many similarities with the SPE, his filling-in of details (and in particular how the plot develops beyond the point the SPE was aborted) is based largely on Zimbardo's conclusions, which have since been strongly criticised. (To take just one example, hooding of prisoners has often been held up as an example of the supposed spontaneous development of sadism in the "guards", and inevitably is compared to the Abu Ghraib scandal. But it turns out that in reality, the hooding of SPE "prisoners" by their "guards" was not spontaneous at all but was ordered by Zimbardo himself.) And the denouement in the film, while powerful, does rather strain credulity.As such, while this is a powerful film, any claims that it provides deep insight to the human psyche's potential for evil should be treated with caution.</fullReview>

There's so much to this movie. I had the accidental pleaure of seeing it late night on Encore True and couldn't go to bed, as I was so engulfed in the story and concept.

		<shortDescription>Gripping but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stanford Prison Experiment was a famous error in the field of experimental psychology. A group of volunteers was called upon to role-play as prisoners and guards. Predictably, the initial power struggles soon turned nasty as the line between fiction and reality blurred. The experiment was abandoned prematurely and the only real conclusion was that it should never have been allowed to start.Oliver Hirschbirgl's movie, inspired by this story (though set in conptemporary Germany) has to struggle with the fact that we know the horrific details of the true story: can fiction compete? Stylistically, the film is a bit confused, as the director flirts with a cinema-verite approach but combines this with elements of the thriller and in places, the art-house. A movie shot as if was composed only of "real" film of the event might have been more compelling in the earlier stages than the obviously manufactured picture we get. More seriously, to reach its (admittedly gripping) conclusion, the film requires its scientists not just to be ignorant of the original experiment, but also to display complete incompetence and lack of ethics. In spite of these failings, 'The Experiment' is still worth watching, because its central idea rings disturbingly true: the film makes you think about what you might do in such a situation; and the detail is always interesting. But the themes of this movie have been explored with more subtlety elsewhere.</fullReview>

It's visually exciting from start to end, and the psychology is strictly a gimmick to heighten the thrills and broadly-staged emotions.

		<shortDescription>Absolute cracker of a movie that had me in awe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>never realised anything good could come out of Germany. I have now been proved wrong after watching Das Experiment. It's based on a real life psychological experiment that took place. The experiment consisted of 20 ordinary people who would be put into a prison environment. 12 would be prisoners and 8 would be guards. Who would be put into what role would be decided by a computer. The experiment took place over two weeks and was to see how each person would cope within the environment as whatever they were. Would the guards be corrupted by power? Would the prisoners succumb to weakness? They never knew, until they performed the experiment. Now films based on real life events are usually pretty on the ball because everything needed for the script has already panned out and is there for the taking. Naturally, adjustments are made and the result is a disaster or a movie that makes you realise how shocking real life is and give you a sense of satisfaction at the same time. Das Experiment satisfied in every sense of the word. If all films were made like this one, then Hollywood wouldn't be slated so much for churning out mindless crap like it usually does. This film trounces everything ever produced in America and Britain. The direction is near perfect and he uses his actors to their full potential. It's pretty shocking considering this was Oliver Hirschbiegel's debut as a feature-length director. If anyone has ever seen Run Lola Run you will recognise one of the names connected with the film, Moritz Bleibtreu as Tarek who is the main protagonist. I have not seen anything else starring him so I have nothing to compare with, but his acting was pretty damn good. His role as the undercover reporter Tarek, who constantly provokes the guards into action, has made me want to see more of his stuff. If you are interested in the slightest bit after reading this, then go check it out now. It's too good to miss. Even if you don't like the sound of it, check it out NOW.</fullReview>

The movie is about this professor who gets volunteers to pretend like they are guards and prisoners!! One of the guards takes his role too seriously and the tension mounts!!!I suggest that everybody sees this. The Germans are no longer the NAZI party that they were in world war two!!

		<shortDescription>Indifferent to different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never viewed a movie such as this until my fiance` talked me into watching it. The idea behind it alone was intriguing enough to watch, but the movie itself didn't really cut it. It's about an experiment of prisoners and guards for 10 days. It's evident what is going to take place through the duration of the movie; guards become more violent the longer they have power and the prisoners don't take them too seriously, until.... read up on psychology it'll explain a lot of it before you even watch it. I was confused with the girl, because it was unnecessary and simply put, poor filming. The movie showed her a lot without any relevance to the central theme which is irritating. I was bored after about an hour of it, and had to finish it later. Good idea, poor directing/acting/mise-en-scene. Take this idea and give it to America where effort can be put into it, and you have quite possibly a film of the year type of movie. It beats random Action movies and Chick flicks so at least it has that going for it. I gave it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When ? first read the subject of the movie, I really thought that it would make a good effect on me.I always enjoy jail, prison films so ? undoubtedly chose to watch it.I expected that the film was about to be placed in 1971, the year which the famous experiment was done.But this had made only en encourage to undertake this movie project. Some scenes might be thought as of violence but it really reflects how a human can react to the effects that come from the surroundings of the living space which was a experimental jail.Two scientists wants to catch the human's reactions in a jail, but they lose the control of the guardians.This leads to a fight, including mental, between guardians and the victims. The most negative thing about the movie is the love concept.We see a love between our boy and girl was born after an unlucky car accident.During the film love theme rarely is rarely pointed out. All in all, the ones who like the environment of a jail and its life should watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confronting the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At least Oliver Hirschbiegel (now filming the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers!) is not afraid to confront the dark historic past of Germany. Before the Oscar-nominated and critically acclaimed Der Untergang (Downfall) about the last days of Hitler he here takes on another angle of the Nazi-past: How ordinary people can become savage beasts when certain conditions arise. Here the reference to Nazis is only short (the guards make the salute to the leader in a two-second scene seen by camera) and the story can be applied much wider: To the recent American and British prisoner abuse in Cuba, Iraq and Afghanistan for example, and to war conflicts in general like the recent civil war in Bosnia.That this is only based on the original Stanford Prison Experiment and could not be a real experiment is not important here. The same underlying principles at work could give this outcome and the movie makes that painstakingly clear. Slowly the guards and prisoners dehumanize each other; rules set out are broken; violence used when forbidden; leadership taken on and taken over; one person (the journo!) stirring at all. Some have noted here that the whole process goes a little fast, but there are some big time lapses in the movie. The military man Steinhoff seems the only one early acknowledging the forces at work here, as he has gone through it all in his military training and service. It makes perfectly clear how rapidly personal frustration leads to Nazi-like behavior.This is also somewhat convenient for Germans (Serbs, etc.) facing their recent history, as there is a rational explanation for war crimes and we can all sleep comfortably now. Of course other forces (political, cultural and social) are at work to create the circumstances and while serving as an explanation, there is always individual responsibility. A good idea would therefore have been to show part of the trials in one way or another.Using the thriller-format is a good choice, because it keeps the audience on board to convey a deeper message. The limited budget and Hirschbiegel's background as director of TV-movies shines through with a completely redundant love interest, a very slow start and some camera-work from TV-land. But once the experiment starts, there is also the restriction of space present where these problems shift to the background. And the story itself is so compelling you will soon forget about the cinematic restrictions. This is also very well paced and seen on a stand-alone basis a very good thriller anyway.This is extremely powerful stuff. It is shocking and most viewers will probably be thinking about this some weeks after the experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 2003, the Pentagon held a screening of&nbsp;La Battaglia di Algeri (The Battle of Algiers, 1965), a classic anti-war movie about the anticolonial revolution in Algeria. Judging from what happened at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, they clearly didn't screen Das Experiment as well. Or maybe they did, but didn't learn anything from the movie. After all, it seems they did not learn anything from La Battaglia di Algeri either.Not just the Pentagon, but anybody who still thinks 'torture lite' is acceptable, should see Das Experiment. This extremely gripping film shows how allowing even the seemingly most unthreatening 'torture lite' quickly leads to terrible excesses.The barbarous tortures that happened at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib were by no means 'accidents', as the Bush administration wants us to believe. These excesses are the logical result of allowing 'mild forms of pressure'. Das Experiment makes a very convincing case for this line of reasoning.</fullReview>

It left me shivering an catching for breath, I skipped scenes because i just couldn't stand them, the last 20 minutes I was playing it fast forward.The two main reasons for reactions like this are 1. that this movie is based on a real story and 2. it shows that something like that can happen very easily, the only thing you need is human beings, no matter what their character is like and I know many people who, given the "chance", would act like the actors did in the movie, which made it even more realistic and frightening.This movie makes you think about yourself, about the depths of the human mind and the human nature, makes you afraid of yourself, of every other human being around you (which doesn't last very long, don't worry).I would recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it, it will be an experience you'll never forget. 10/10</fullReview>

Near the end I actually began shouting random stuff at the characters..

The 29 positive comments were made by people from Europe, New Zealand and Canada, and the 2 bad ones by Americans. Coincidence? Maybe.. But then take a look at the user ratings page (http://us.imdb.com/Ratings?0250258) US voters: 3.8, non-US voters: 8.2 Why are all Americans bashing this movie? Do they miss a celebrity starring in it? Or explosions? Or do they just REALLY hate reading subtitles? It would be great if someone could try and explain this to me! Thanks :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great premise but ultimately uninteresting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this review by saying that I don't classify "The Experiment" as a bad film, but rather a mediocre and forgettable one that managed to make me feel uncomfortable, but failed to engage me.The initial premise is intriguing and very engaging; a failed reporter and taxi driver volunteers for an experiment about the relationships between prisoners and their guards. In said experiment, eight of the volunteers become guards, and the remaining twelve become prisoners. Our protagonist becomes one of the prisoners.For roughly the first two thirds of the movie, I intermittently was fascinated and uninterested in the film due to several consistent problems it has. For example, the truly intense sequences in which the guards try to maintain control over the more rowdy prisoners without the use of violence (as the people in charge are always watching via cameras) are repeatedly broken up by completely useless cutaways to 77's girlfriend, and far too many scenes of the same variety. The film is a good fifteen minutes too long.However, the feelings of claustrophobia, tension, and eventually hopelessness that the film tries so persistently to evoke are conveyed brilliantly at times, such as a panic attack suffered by a character midway through the film. The performances, while unoriginal, serve their purpose well and don't detract from the film.In the end, "The Experiment" is a bit of a mixed bag. It has an intriguing concept with some truly disquieting moments, but it has a huge problem with predictability and editing itself. The film would have been far more effective with a minimalist style, never leaving the prisoners and their torments, rather than cutting away periodically for a character who, in the end, could have been erased entirely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good plot idea ruined by bad plot developments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was loosely based on so-called 1971. Stanford Prison Experiment where a group of average college kids were arbitrarily divided into groups of "prisoners" and "prison guards". The point of this psychological "game" was to see whether humanity and individualization would win over type-casting and group psychology. The experiment was a failure (or a success, depends on the viewpoint) because it had to be stopped after only 6 days - the "guards" were becoming overly sadistic and the "prisoners" started to develop psychological problems.Anyways, German movie "Das Experiment" follows the same scenario but infuses it with some additional elements as well and offers a bit more drastic resolution. Unfortunately, the final result is not really impressive.For me the movie fails on what should be its strongest point - characterization. The whole point should have been the experiment subjects' slow deterioration from average joes to sadistic guards on one side and tortured prisoners on the other side. But obviously this was too large a bite for the director to handle, because the movie starts to fall apart right about the middle of it and then proceeds to become more and more unbelievable and unrealistic by the end almost no one can take it seriously. There are so many dubious coincidences and decisions that at one point or another you will simply have to give up.There are additional points which drag the movie further down. A whimsical love-story is introduced which is absolutely pointless and just further waters down the plot. It would have been far more interesting for the audience to see more of the characters involved in the experiment before it actually started rather than watch a development of a pretty phony-looking love story. Also, and I must say this, I seriously detest product placement in movies. There is a certain German bank logo popping up throughout the entire movie, and it REALLY messes up the whole experience. Shame on you for that.But with all its shortcomings, this is not a bad movie. Performances are great (especially those by the lead protagonist and antagonist), camera work is impressive, the movie is never quite boring in spite of majority of it happening in the same location and so on. It's a nice time spender, but sadly nothing more.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll never forget sitting in Psychology class watching this odd guy on a video. He looked kind of like that man who started the Church of satan, Anton Le Vay. His name was Phillip Zimbardo. I remember he had a series of videos, the title of them escapes me. But I do remember his most compelling video was about a famous experiment gone horribly wrong. In late summer of 1971, Zimbardo and a team at Stanford University constructed, in a basement on the Stanford campus, a makeshift prison. He then paid a bunch of subjects to live in it. The men who took part were separated into two groups, prisoners and inmates. The experiment was to last two weeks, to bad it only lasted 6 days. Soon essentially normal men, given the role of prison guards were savagely beating the inmates. Power had gone to their heads. Just like Zimbardo's ill-fated experiment, director Oliver Hirschbiegel DAS EXPERIMENT doesn't fare much better.Set in the present, EXPERIMENT follows Tarek Fahd (Moritz Bliebtreu, Run Lola Run), a cocksure cab driver/journalist as he infiltrates a prison experiment. It all seems like a game at first. That is until the guards start beating up on the inmates, and the scientists running the experiments begin to lose control. Let the carnage begin.I wanted so much to love this movie. The premise is there and the characters are there. A great movie is striving to break free. But alas it all fails. Weaknesses begin to show up at the beginning and the film never quite recovers. I think I know what the biggest problem is. The film bites off far more than it needs to.This movie should have been a character study. But instead, it puts itself at a distance that is way too far away from its subjects. It meanders where it should move on. It introduces ideas when it should be building characters, and it creates subplots where none are needed.The biggest problem with the film is a subplot introduced mere minutes after the movie opens. It occurs when Fahd's cab gets into an accident with another car. The other car's driver is Dora (Maren Eggert), a beautiful women, who falls for Fahd instantly. Then she starts showing up all over the film, taking us away from the prison. She serves no purpose. In a stronger draft of the films screenplay they would have chopped her out with extreme prejudice. But we have to suffer through endless scenes of her standing by herself, and dreaming of Fahd, and for what? I'm not sure, but if anyone figures it out, let me know.Past the inane girlfriend, what I really wanted was focus. I wanted more from the scientists, I wanted more from the inmates, and I wanted more from the guards. Instead we get silly black and white sequences, we get government conspiracies, and we get very little about the nature of man. On top of that the film needed to be edited tighter. The opening credit sequence feels like an eternity, and yet nothing happens. The experiment screening process meanders to the point of silliness, and the final 20 minutes just drag. With the film as it is, 90 minutes would have sufficed but at just under two hours, it becomes unbearable.It just makes me sad that I didn't like the movie. It makes me sad, because it's a compelling premise. Why do men get violent? Does prison culture turn otherwise non-violent men into monsters? How does peer-pressure effects us? All questions are worth answering. But we get no such answers.I wouldn't recommend you conduct DAS EXPERIMENT. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clarification regarding this film's events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want viewers and potential viewers of this film to keep one thing in mind. Although the film is based on the Stanford Prison Experiment conducted at Stanford University in 1971, many (or is most?) of the events depicted in the film did NOT occur during the actual experiment. The film is a fictionalized account, not a "true story" as more than one reviewer here has claimed. No one died during this experiment, and the experiment was abandoned after six days because the "guards'" treatment of the "prisoners" was becoming more and more disturbing, although it was psychological torment, not physical. Also, the "prisoners" were showing signs of depression and severe stress. All of this is documented in complete detail on Dr. Philip Zimbardo's web site: This is a day-by-day account of the entire TRUE experiment, and believe me, it is chilling enough without having to fictionalize it. It is especially instructive when reading this account to notice the clear parallels with the concentration camps; obviously this is what attracted the German filmmakers. On a personal note, I attended Stanford shortly after the experiment and it was part of the curriculum of the course I took from Dr. Zimbardo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking, yes; realistic, no</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I posted a comment years ago in reference to the differences between the actual Stanford Prison Experiment and the film inspired by it. (Check out Dr. Zimbardo's website for details on what actually occurred during the experiment.) Now, I have finally seen the film myself. (My wife is German and she saw it in Berlin when it came out. We had several conversations by phone at the time, which prompted my original comments.) Once you consider that this film is merely inspired by, and not a depiction of the original experiment, there are some real storyline problems with the film nonetheless. First, the unrealistic time line -- almost instantly, both guards and prisoners assume their roles with vigor and the psychological effects seem instantaneous. Second, the experimenters are under-developed as characters or participants in the drama, which will later just confuse the viewers. Third, the subplot of the girlfriend doesn't work, and is totally unnecessary to the storyline (Billy Wilder cautioned filmmakers that if it doesn't advance the plot, throw it out.) Fourth, the fellow prisoners would most likely have punished Number 77 themselves for causing trouble that resulted in their own punishment at the hands of the guards -- we don't even have some verbal abuse thrown at him. Fifth, it is unrealistic to think that the experimenters would have given the guards batons after telling them "No violence." This would be sheer stupidity and criminal negligence, as we see later on. Sixth, the experimenters do not take measures (given point #5) to ensure that they can prevent or stop violence from occurring. Seventh, outside of the two characters Tarek and Berus, no one behaves in an independent manner, but slavishly follows these two dominant personalities -- possible, but unlikely, and there is no adequate explanation for this given. Eighth, for all the careful screening of the participants, are we to believe that the experimenters had no idea that Berus was psychotic, or that if he was as authoritarian as they admit in more than one scene, that he could not possibly be pathologically sick? Ninth, the experimenters are not held responsible in the final reel. What could have been an interesting film is undermined by the filmmakers' desire to manipulate audience emotions. We are supposed to feel repulsion and hatred for Berus and his weak companions, yet the thinking viewer will be more led to blame the experimenters themselves, which I don't believe is what the director intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine actors in an original prison movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise is very interesting, the actors are good - some are truly excellent - and that's enough to make a good movie. I must say that without some outstanding performances this would be a TV movie at best since there are quite a few flaws that would otherwise distract you from the building tension.The unsatisfactory part in Das Experiment comes, IMHO, from the novelization of the Stanford Prison Experiment. The background story created around the main character, Tariq, both professional and sentimental, adds very little when it is not simply distracting. The importance of research supervisors is played down to a point it is almost painful. I mean, it is supposed to be scientific research but the story shuns the constant monitoring to easily let things go loose inside the makeshift prison.Sure there has to be a point were drama takes over true story elements, yet the most interesting point in the original experiment is its lack of ethical and scientific values. The supervising Stanford professor put himself inside the role of prison superintendent instead of objectively monitoring the experiment. For me, this overall failure to design an ethical and scientific study is the main point. What happens inside the prison is only the illustration.Thus I'd say this could have been a much better movie, while it's only a good movie because it's the first to deal with this experiment and thanks to the cast. There'll be no excuses for Americans when they seize the concept.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on one of the most eerie psychological experiments in US history, this film proved to be true to the form of obedience and abuse. While the whole situation seemed a little too perfect to be considered realistic, at least someone finally picked up on one of the coolest ideas that wasn't made into a movie. The only downside to the film was the prevalence of the brutality of the supposed `Nazi' complex that people think Germans still subconsciously hold onto. Sure, it brought a whole new insight into the movie, but the fact it overtook all of the guards at the end proved to be too much of a stretch for me. We'll have to see when the American version comes out to see how far these ideas are taken.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was actually at one of the initial screenings of this movie in Freiburg, Germany when the movie came out. After the screening, Hirschbiegel and Bleibtreu came out and talked about the movie. They even fielded some questions from the audience.Hirschbiegel apologized that he couldn't make violence "beautiful" in the movie - "like it is in 'Die Hard'", he said. Both he and Bleibtreu made several other critical comments about the violence in American film media. The point of this movie, they both said, was to show how normal, every-day people could easily be persuaded or conditioned to resort to violence - and, in my opinion, this movie makes their point quite forcefully and effectively.Similar anti-violence trends can be seen in some other German movies, such as "Der Krieger und Die Kaiserin" (the Warrior and the Empress, or perhaps 'Princess' as it was released here), a film by Tom Tykwer (of "Lola Rennt" fame) that was out shortly before "Das Experiment."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Dirty, Rotten, Stinky Nazi!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Das Experiment (The Experiment) is a decent psychological thriller loosely based on the 1970s Stanford Prison Experiment. It follows the travails of failed journalist Tarek Fahd as he attempts to reinvigorate his career by joining and secretly documenting a prison simulation experiment. What follows is a descent into violence.The film is at its best when it examines the psychological degeneration of the experiment's participants. Initially charming guards, such as an Elvis impersonator, It is no coincidence that this is a German film, as there is a heavy emphasis on how ordinary men can degenerate into sadistic monsters. The Third Reich parallels are made explicit when one prisoner calls a particularly brutal guard a "dirty, rotten, stinky, Nazi." It is arguable that Hannah Arendt should have been given writing credits.The film suffers in its latter half, however, from an all too typical degeneration into action movie clichés and violence, with the film losing all sense of verisimilitude. (Particularly given the fact that in the actual Stanford Prison Experiment, students who played prisoners became submissive, not aggressive.) Furthermore, the film includes an all too typical romantic angle that distracts from the psychodrama. These flaws mar what could have been a far better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not great, but effective and extremely European thriller that seeks to examine the psychology of prisoner/warder relations, through a controlled simulation of a prison, using volunteers off the street as guinea pigs. I mean its hardly believable, the entire time your brain will keep repeating "lawsuit, lawsuit..." but hey, it is Germany. Things I'm sure are different over there, Heaven knows they used to be. In an attempt to compete with American cinema, the Germans have seemed to accept the notion that since everyone still sees them as Nazis, why not just go with it, and play the role, make a few bucks. The film's plot follows a straight and very steep line of character disntegration as we watch the volunteers change from average blokes into prisoner and guard, and ultimately into tormentor and victim. While brutal and unbelievable in many spots, its nonetheless well executed and rather riveting. The bit with the girlfreund is totally absurd, and could have been easily written in much better than it was. So there it is in a nutshell. A window into the German collective psyche? Probably not. But if your up for something different and maybe even unnecessarily disturbing, Teutonic style, by all means, rent away. Otherwise nah...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but too much violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about this movie - on one hand I liked it, on the other hand I didn't. I speak German and I didn't need to read the subtitles so I could concentrate on what was going on. Before one of the characters was killed, it was interesting but escalating violence seemed to have ruined my enjoyment of the movie. I think everybody would get the point without this much violence and in my opinion the filmmakers tend to over-dramatize things. I was at a screening where the director held a short Q&amp;A session after the showing. He said that guards in Stanford experiment were meaner - they wouldn't give food to prisoners if they didn't obey the orders. I can't agree with that - at least nobody was killed during the Stanford experiment. As much as I like the lead actor Moritz Bleibtreu (Run Lola Run), I wouldn't recommend this movie. My rating is 5 out of 10 (might be downgraded though).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre psychodrama for the naive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Experiment" is about a psychological experiment in which a group of men are paid to role play as guards and prisoners; the purpose being to see what, if any, mutation of the conventional social ethos takes place by virtue of the appearance of subordination and domination. The result is a sort of psychodrama action flick which reeks of nonsense and is muddled by a couple of inconsequential side plots used to spice up the meager plot. The film is artistically and technically good with good acting but fails on story credibility and content. An okay watch for foreign film freaks into action flicks with psychodramatic overtones. (B-)Note - Proponents of this film attempt to derive credibility from a the poorly executed and infamous Stanford Experiment. It's important to remember there is science and there is BS. One only has to harken back to the O.J. trial to see how easy it is to mix and muddle those two ingredients to achieve a desired outcome. The field of psychology and the APA have been fraught with credibility problems from day one (eg: Timothy Leary, etc.). Exercise caution when attempting to exact conclusions from this film and remember boot camps would never work if the Stanford Experiment was representative and there are plenty of real prisons available for research. Caveat emptor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The experiment failed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone giving this film a 10 out of 10 should consider growing potatoes instead of writing reviews. It feels like a remake and a bad one. Sole reason is the script writing which is some of the worst I have ever witnessed on German films. Performances are "good" - not too thrilling but solid. The Story is as plain as the one line summary states. Keyword for the whole story line and plot development: implausible Take the professor for instance. In a world full of mobile phones, he is the only one who cannot be reached by phone when the not too bright assistants who can't act on their own try to reach him. As THE one person in charge of THE EXPERIMENT this is the DUMBEST excuse for NOT being on scene but rather at a cocktail party. Seems the professor has no real interest in the experiment after all...The only thing this movie achieved when watching it is to make you wonder "When is this over?" at least the professor got shot, not fatal though. Pity. Waste of time. Maybe the &gt;&gt;original&lt;&lt; "Stanford Prison Experiment" (2004) will do better: http://www.imdb.com/Details?01525904/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say that sometimes, reality is much more interesting than fiction, and this movie bolsters that statement. Das Experiment is premised on the Stanford Experiment, which was conducted in 1971 by the Stanford University Psychology Department, in California. *****POSSIBLE SPOILERS*******Like in the real experiment, the movie has volunteers who respond to an ad for an experiment and at the conclusion of the test, are given money for their time. The people who are chosen are divided into prisoners and guards and placed into an area to simulate a real prison. The volunteers are chosen from all backgrounds with no tendency for violence. Initially, both groups are playful but as things progress, each group begins to conform to their role and behave accordingly. To control the rowdy behavior of the prisoners, the prison guards use humiliation, physical exercise, and even violence to quell any opposition to their authority. Eventually, both sides are so immersed in their roles that they forget that this is nothing but an experiment.I had several problems with this movie. First, instead of concentrating on the test subjects and the people who run the experiment, the filmmaker deviates from this by shifting the focus on the love relationship between one of the prisoner and a woman he met before volunteering for the experiment. On top of that, the film goes into the suicidal tendency of the woman because her father had just died.Second, the experiment in this movie is supposedly secretly funded by the military and therefore, a military officer is put in as a volunteer to become a prisoner, in order to gauge the experiment. This part is pointless and serves no purpose to the story.The only thing I liked about the movie is the actors and actresses who performed their parts well.On a personal note, I remember seeing the Stanford Experiment documentary in my psychology class in college and was shocked because this was real and not a movie. We were watching people do things that they normally would not do.That reality heightened the magnitude of what I was seeing. I suggest those who really want to see the "real" thing, go to your local library or research the internet on the Stanford Experiment. You will see afterward how this movie just pales in comparison to the actual thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grown up in Germany, but this film is simply awful. There was one cliché put after another. There was no character which was authentic. Everything was so simple and not worked out. I hope that nobody thinks that a German character is so simple manipulative and turn after a little trouble into a bloody Nazi type. In the beginning I thought this may be a good film, because the situation of 2 groups of ordinary people come in a situation where one group becomes master and the other slaves, could bring interesting confrontations. But there was nothing. Only results who no one understands. At the end of the film there is some interesting fighting but when I want to look for fights I go to Wrestlemania.greez Achim</fullReview>

Oh my god, what was this Director thinking? The sub plot is the most worthless piece of scriptwriting I have ever seen. And the characters: the Elvis imitator?! hahahahaha. ... hilarious!

		<shortDescription>A 'Shocking Film', Based on an 'Unethical Experiment'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A disturbing and shocking film, based on the unethical 'Stanford Prison Experiment', that should not have been conducted. It's a sneak preview of 'The Holocaust' revisited, and what Americans can expect from the 'Bush Administration and 'conservatives' until the end of his 'Nazi-like re-election reign' but, then, you folks exerting the 'popular vote' in Ohio and the other 'conservative domains' re-elected him. I certainly did not vote for 'Bush', nor did the majority of voters in Connecticut. Thus proving, to this 'liberal left-winger', that the 'conservatives' and a 'representive government' (not-directly-run 'for and by the people') certainly stinks, and is far from 'democratic'. Movies like this, and such experimentation, 'heroizes' torture. If this film is like 'reality television', it surely presents itself in its distorted and flawed concepts and images of what an 'ethical' research study should be like, or purports to be. It can only be a 'blockbuster' to those supporting violence and war. 'Bush' probably loves this film as, no doubt, he 'gets off' on 'war and rumors of war' (using 'Bush/Christianeze' jargon). But, then, Christians, and significant numbers of other people, like to engage in 'war mongering'. Personally, I find such 'belief and value systems', as well as their sense of 'morality', to be nothing more than a 'ball buster'. And, there are certainly significant numbers of people, in America and throughout the world, who enjoy abusing gay and lesbian people in such a harsh, rigid, and hateful manner. Perhaps 'Bush' should consider setting up 'concentration camps for gays and lesbians', so that he can eradicate them from the universe. Some Americans could then celebrate their deaths, and their bloodshed. Let's kill off all of the gays and lesbians, and America can start an 'Arian race', a 'pure race' consisting ONLY of 'heterosexuals'. After all, 'heterosexuals' are the ONLY people 'blessed by God', and that makes the rest of us 'sinners'. Don't forget that 'Christians' are 'SAVED by GRACE' and the rest of us, 'being without grace', are 'unredeemable'. Many classes of people, without Jesus, are 'doomed to damnation'. 'Christians' will go to Heaven, and the rest of us will be 'forever lost in sin'. Personally, if 'Christians' truly represent God, I wouldn't want to go to Heaven. I firmly believe that the entire 'God concept' was created by man (not by God), to 'keep human beings in their place' by perpetuating 'guilt and shame'. People engage in 'avoidance and denial', so that they do not have to deal with real-life issues, thus 'avoiding' honest and open discussion. Such people are 'in denial' about certain issues, but perpetuate 'violence and war'. If you positively support this movie, and such research, why not 'kill your neighbor'? After all, your neighbor may be gay, or some other minority, that you hate. That may justify murder, watching this movie, and supporting unethical research. Kill 'the bastards', and 'hang them by their balls'. Perhaps we should re-institute the death sentence, and have public hangings in every town and city. And, at these events, we could sell hot-buttered popcorn and ice-cold beverages, to increase our very frigid, capitalistic economy and increase revenues. After all, Americans will do anything for 'the almighty dollar'. And, we'll get more excitement for 'the buck'. We've 'sunk very low' in America. The question is, 'how low' will we allow ourselves to go? Perhaps we could insert electrodes in every female's vagina, and every male's penis, when they do not behave, feel, or think in accordance with the status quo. After all, 'ethics' should have no place in establishing societal norms and, under such circumstances, isn't punishment (no matter how harsh) justified? We could also perform involuntary lobotomies and sterilizations. Such things would make people adhere to standards, by forcing them to live in constant fear. So much for 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'. We have a right to violate a person's civil and constitutional rights. Liberty invites license, and we can't allow people to be happy.Obviously, this film is intended to attract those who indulge in 'cheap, low-level, and mindless' entertainment. It would appeal to those who have a 'sado-masochistic' bent, and endorse the very sick 'military code' inside and outside of the prison environment.</fullReview>
