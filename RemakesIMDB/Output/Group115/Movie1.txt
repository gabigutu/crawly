		<shortDescription>Much better than average musical/romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cut to the chase: Betty Grable looks and sounds great as usual. The filming at the Diamond Horseshoe gives it authenticity. Color is excellent. Acting is very good. So why is this film given a weighted IMDb average of 3.9? Who knows? There could be something wrong with the formula as it's applied to this film. The mean vote (when I voted) was 6. That's better, but not up to the 9 I gave it. See this film! Vote for it! It does not deserve a 3.9!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem of a picture with great singing and great songs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has always been one of my very favorites. The songs (by Harry Warren) are lovely, especially the classic "the More I See You". Anyone watching the picture can see why Grable was a huge star. Dick Haymes sings like a dream and makes a terrific leading man. Although it centers on Grable and Haymes getting together, the story is not one of the silly boy meets girl plots so typical of the 40s. Many of lines still have a bite more than fifty years later. Anytime this picture is on TV, I'll treat myself to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fun Fox musical starring Betty Grable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe" is another effervescent Fox musical in Technicolor starring Betty Grable, this time supported by Dick Haymes, Phil Silvers, William Gaxton and Beatrice Kay. Grable plays Bonnie Collins, a performer at the Horseshoe who doesn't get along with the head guy, Joe Davis Sr. (Gaxton). When Joe Davis Jr. arrives (Haymes), Senior turns his attention to Junior, ignoring his girlfriend Claire (Kay). Junior has decided to try his hand at show business and forget his studies to be a doctor, to the chagrin of his dad. Desperate to get the kid out of the way, Claire asks Bonnie to pretend she likes Junior and then dump him, figuring that Junior's ego won't allow him to stick around. The prize for doing this is a fur coat of Claire's that Bonnie has always envied. Of course, the inevitable occurs.Grable looks fabulous in a variety of costumes and is very funny as Bonnie, who is annoyed at first by Junior's attention. She has some good numbers - "Shoo Shoo Baby" and "A Nickel's Worth of Dime," plus a reprise of "More than You Know." Dick Haymes' lyrical sound is delightful singing "I Want to Know" and "The More I See You." Silvers has a great comic bit at a dinner table. The one off note is William Gaxton's character of Joe, who for most of the movie is absolutely hateful and so nasty to poor Claire, you want to slap him.Great entertainment, the kind of stuff that made Betty so popular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diamond Horseshoe-Great Doctor in the House ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wonderful 1945 musical has a terrific plot. Dick Haymes, 6 months away from being a doctor, wants to chuck it all and join his widowed father, Bill Gaxton, in show business.His appearance is a threat to Beatrice Kay, who is about to tie the knot with the widower Gaxton. She enlists the help of Betty Grable to fall for Haymes and then dump him so that he will go back to medical school and she can resume her life with the Gaxton character.Naturally, Grable falls for Haymes, but eventually comes around to the idea that he should finish medical school.The songs are wonderfully staged and Grable does well as the girl disliked by Gaxton, but comes around to do what's right.Of all people, Margaret Dumont appears in a one scene dream sequence and actually sings part of her lines! Wonder what Groucho thought about that. Naturally, she is an upper crust matron in the dream.A blend of great music, good story and all enhances this well done 1945 film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>20th Century Fox Studios promotes this film as a "Technicolor Extraganza," as the greatest Musical to hit the silver screen, but even though its stars may outdo what they do best, its screen-story, Cinematography and direction seem to cry for help here.For this, 20th creates another backstage Musical, this time borrowing from the plot of the Broadway production of "The Barker" (1927) (Claudette Colbert and Norman Foster star in its original cast), adapted for the screen as "The Barker" (1928) (with Dorothy Mackaill and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.), and now changing its venue from a carnival setting unto a nightclub circuit for "Diamond Horseshoe" (1945).Betty Grable, by now, has become a major headliner for 20th especially because of WWII-era pin-up posters, war bond drives and USO tours, and, oh yes, those Techinicolor extravaganzas. Her co-star, Dick Haymes, a very capable deep rich baritone, handles his material well in an early leading screen role.For their supporting performers, we find a cast rarity: the film debut of Beatrice Kay coincides with the film swan song for William Gaxton. These four, along with comedian Phil Silvers, advance the balance of the plot, as most others appear sporadically, in one scene or in uncredited roles, for which there are multitudes.Carmen Cavallaro as Himself (pianist) appears in performance at Club 21. Willie Solar as Double-Talking Singer Comedian appears in performance at Diamond Horseshoe nightclub. Margaret Dumont as Mrs. Standish appears in Bonnie's dream sequence, along with Charles Coleman as Majordomo, Bess Flowers as Duchess of Duke, and Evan Thomas as Duke of Duchess.Familiar faces as Phyllis Kennedy, Julie London, and Ray Teal as Tough Customer appear in bit roles although "Billy Rose," owner of Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe fails to make his appearance throughout the entire picture.And as for story, this also borrows rather heavily from customary "the Coney Island Plot," a rags-to-riches type, in which cast members form an entertainment group, and something happens to break them up, and it's back to rags again, while someone tries to find a way to bring them back together.Here, Bonnie Collins (Betty Grable), a chorus-dancer-turned-star and her roommate, Claire Williams (Beatrice Kay), a nostalgia singer, entertain at the lavish Diamond Horseshoe Nightclub, along with Joe Davis Sr. (William Gaxton), a widowed career singer, who spends his life in near poverty, saving his earnings, and hoping that his son would become an engineer or doctor to receive some sort of career security, which he's never known.Claire and Joe Sr. have been seeing each other socially and plan for a future together, while Bonnie and Joe Sr. often cross swords after the curtain closes each evening. The someone who steps among the three would be Joe Davis Jr. (Dick Haymes), who arrives backstage to announce his plans to become a singer rather than an engineer or doctor, to his father's disapproval, which also causes a rift between Claire and Joe Sr.Blinkie Miller (Phil Silvers), who works as a stage-hand, would be the one to try to bridge the feuding foursome with a semblance of peace if he can manage such a thing. But the plot thickens when Claire bribes Bonnie with the prize of one of her mink coats if Bonnie manages to convince Joe Jr. to return to his medical studies so that Joe Sr. wouldn't be worrying about Joe Jr., thus leaving Joe Sr. to concentrate upon his romance with Claire.Binkie then introduces Joe Jr. to the manager of a rival night-spot, the Footlights Club (not to be confused with the "Stage Door" (1937) boarding house). Bonnie then launches into her extended dream sequence about being received as a "somebody" in mink, before being awakened by Joe Jr. to picnic (in front of a painted wall scene, it would seem), riding on a riverboat, lounging by the pool, and nightclub-hopping amid various camera effects.So, because Bonnie, Claire, Joe Sr. and Joe Jr. each has an agenda of her or his own to fulfill, as well as harboring conflicting notions as to what the mink symbolizes, Binkie pretty much has his hands filled if he aims to try to gather the old gang back into Diamond Horseshoe in time for the big number and plenty more top-heavy head-dresses and ostentatious costuming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typically loopy Fox vehicle for Betty Grable...energy and cheap razzmatazz to spare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Diamond Horseshoe" begins with a stage number wherein all the showgirls are ingredients in a French chef's recipe, with Betty Grable as the main course, of course. She fights with her co-star offstage (he tells her, "You are in show business for only two reasons...and you're standing on both of them!"). In order to bring romantic happiness for a gal-pal, wisecracking Betty agrees to come between a singer and his son, the latter of whom was to become a doctor but now wants a taste of the footlights. Taken from John Kenyon Nicholson's play "The Barker", the plot (though relentlessly padded with novelty numbers, revues, and sketches) is far stronger than those of other Grable-showcases, and screenwriter George Seaton isn't afraid to be catty and snappy. Some of the put-downs are priceless, while Grable infuses the funny interplay with a jazzy '40s-era spirit (she's both jaded and sassy). Unfortunately, most of the songs are unsingable, and Dick Haymes is such a shallow love-interest that it doesn't make any sense for a tootsie like Betty to actually fall for him. The production probably looked elaborate in 1945, but today it seems tacky, and at 104 minutes the movie eventually wears out its welcome. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>
