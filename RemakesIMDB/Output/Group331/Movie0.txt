		<shortDescription>a very great "grudge" movie for Asian horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i read a lot of bad reviews about this fantastic movie, so i watched it without even expecting something good.Of course i was positively surprised,the actors are very good : very few American actress knows how to express pure terror on they're faces as well as a Japanese actress.Miike success in creating an intense and creepy mood that follows you all the way till the end credits. o.k. so the story is not very original,if you have seen Ju-on, Ringu or Dark water there is nothing new here. it's another Japanese movie with a "grudge" (grudge: curse that happens when someone "most of the times a girl" dies in a tragic or horrible death,then the girl return from the dead to kill,usually grudges have long dark hair covering they're faces) but the ghost or grudge in "one missed call" is a lot more scary than Sadako in ringu or even the one in ju-on and there is a lot of murders going on from the beginning to the end. It's definitely not slow paced like dark water and a lot more entertaining.But if your like me, when you watch a zombie movie you expect zombies,if you watch a killer movie you expect killings so if you watch a Japanese horror movie expect a grudge cause it's a part of the Japanese mythology so don't go crying out loud that this movie sucks because it's a pale imitation of ringu and ju-on, IT IS NOT!!!! so, i give this movie 10/10 for three reason: 1: a lot of good scares 2: a very effective and disgusting grudge 3: entertaining from opening credits to the end</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun ride into Miike's more commercial world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to do something new in the world of horror these days. Even Japanese horrors which were deemed fresh in the late 90's got more and more repetitive, and we can say that after Kairo, there is nothing really fresh coming out of the horror department of Japanese films. The quiet atmosphere and the fear towards darkness within colorless world possessed by vicious female ghosts is no longer new to both Japan and the rest of the world. Ju-ons (all of them except the part 2 of the one made only for video which sucked badly) are scary; the series break the silent rule of Japanese horrors, its director even say that he tried to go the opposite way Nakata and Kurosawa went, he will scare the audience by showing the ghosts and gore as much as possible. And Ju-ons worked, to some extent; the director is successful in creating the world of nightmare that co-exist with the ordinary world that people live in. He use a normal house/apartment as his stage of fear and bring out all the every possible scare out of every corner of that place. But one can also say that Ju-ons are good only in parts; its strength is just the sum of a few very scary scenes that the director successfully created and not the overall atmosphere or the story of the films. Now it's time for the ever creative Miike who once scared the hell out of the audience, not by using ghosts, but using a sadistic but innocent-looking girl, to put some new blood into Japanese horrors. As a big fan of J-horror and Miike, I was so looking forward to the film and that I was afraid my high expectation will kill it, but the result was beyond my expectation, I enjoyed this thrill ride so much I wish it would never end.In terms of story, Chakushin Ari is nothing new. It's the Ring plus mobile phone plus Miike trademark's world of weirdness. However, it's execution is a very good blend of Nakata's the silent and dark world and Simizu's bang bang ghost is coming style, and the result, IMHO, is very fresh and satisfying. Miike has toned down his weird and over-the-top scenes to suit the taste of wider audiences, but this film is still full of creative and scary scenes (the scene at the TV station which I deem so good it's classic, and the scene at the hospital which is so weird and spooky that I wish it could last longer) with quite satisfying story and (many may argue) acceptable open ending. Although his ingredients are nonetheless recycle of old tricks (everything from dark corners, female ghosts, old apartments, old hospitals, scary-as-hell sound effects, and right out of the screen gore and ghosts), they are orchestrated in such a stylish and enjoyable way that I can't help jumping and flinching while at the same time enjoying the ever rushing adrenalin in my vein. Repetitive, may be, but fresh ideas are still everywhere; Miike stood very good balance between Nakata's atmospheric scare/strong story and Shimizu illogically outrageous and bizarre world. In sum, a very very entertaining grade A pure horror (not psychological thriller in disguise) which is both repetitive and fresh at the same time. This film should satisfied both hardcore horror fans and those who want satisfying entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made horror, courtesy of Miike Takashi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most Japanese movies are considered as low-budget compared to their Hollywood counterparts. This is because their production costs are so high. However this factor does not deter Japanese creative production teams to come up with movie gems, in different genres.In the realm of Japanese horrors for example, a studio working with a limited budget has to resort to Jaws-style direction, in which you hardly see or visualise the ghosts/monsters.And it is through the movie's simplicity, or by not showing/explaining too much, that J-horrors have turned up the notch on the haunting and horror levels through movies such as Ring and Dark Water. Of course there are the still plenty of gorefest movies such as Suicide Circles and Ichi the Killer, the latter being a courtesy of that notorious but prolific J-director, Takashi Miike.So it is remarkable and truly rewarding to see how Miike toned down his tastes for the twisted and perverted in One Missed Call. Furthermore he implemented his flair of storytelling through symbolisms and graphic metaphors quite nicely. Any shock/gore elements were used in such a way that they serve the movie, instead of downgrading it to a cheesy flick.In conclusion, One Missed Call satisfies on many levels, providing you keep an open mind and just enjoy the ride. Another plus of the movie is the appearances of several gorgeous J-idols, such as Kazue Fukishii and Kou Shibasaki. Nifty!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Japanese horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good Japanese-surprise.Was looking for something different to watch in Americanized Netherlands, and found this movie. If you have never seen any of the recent Japanese fear movies, then this one is a good compilation of the others (Ring, Dark Water, Kairo...) : strange camera angles, blurry pictures, good sound effects and music and a nice-and-somewhat logical script. I was worried about the Miike's touch, but in fact it was a surprising plus for this kind of movie, where ghosts and gore combine well. Takashi shows he knows a lot about filming methods, and also gives us an overview of the Japanese craziness about mobile phones : I can assure you that you will never look again the same way at your phone after seeing such a movie.For the ones who have seen other Japanese horror movies, I would advise it as well, as you enjoy seeing again the same old tricks in a different context...and it works again !So if you have the chance to have this one in a nearby theater...just try it !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say? Takashi Miike's take on the whole so-called J-horror hoopla. I bet he was thinking "I can do this too. And I can do it better". And you know what? He was right! RINGU can be considered as the original one that started it all (because of being the first big hit in the genre, for one thing). I'm not even gonna argue about whether it's the best J-horror movie or not. But I am gonna say that ONE MISSED CALL is without a doubt, on some levels, more effective than RINGU. Where Sadako's ghostly tale of terror was sort of touching the boundaries and establishing some clearly defined characteristics of the genre, CHAKUSHIN ARI pushes the boundaries and uses these characteristics as a reference to the genre.Miike handles a very tight script and a plot that has virtually no holes and a lot of eye for details. Almost every little aspect that is being mentioned in the plot, carries a little set-up within that delivers a pay-off later. The story is intriguing. The death scenes are original and rather graphic. The ghostly creepiness is there. Every jump-scare works (there was one were I almost went through the roof! I recommend watching this with the sound turned up a notch; just let it blast out of the speakers, and I guarantee you: you will jump!). The conclusion is great and practically unpredictable; the twists were damn good. And then there's Miike, who just once again had to give this movie that Miike-touch of his, making it all just one bit more special in a way. And this time, surprisingly, he doesn't do it in the usual way. Not be inserting a sickening scene, or adding some repulsive imagery (though some events and effects really are quite gruesome). No. This time he does it by taking the movie to a different level, by adding that very last scene. And the very last shot should normally have you thinking about something that someone in a very brief scene said, earlier in the movie. The effect it had on me was: wanting to re-watch the movie. Now that's just great if a movie manages to do that. So maybe I should really rate this one 10/10. But I'll reserve that rating for THE AUDITION, my favorite Takashi Miike film ever (for now, at least).And, by the way: I'm ready for the re-make. It's gonna be directed by Frenchman Eric Valette, who previously directed the magnificent, claustrophobic &amp; Lovecraftian-like MALÉFIQUE. For once, I just might have a little faith in an upcoming re-make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylish addition to Miike's portfolio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Audition" and "Ichi The Killer", I had great expectations for this movie. What it delivers is essentially the "greatest hits" of Asian horror. There's more than a passing resemblance to "The Ring", with bits of "Ju-On" and other films thrown in for good measure.The film revolves around mobile 'phones. A girl has a message left on her mobile 'phone answering service - only it's been left by herself and in the future! To make matters worse, it ends with a blood curdling scream! Well, it soon turns out that the message is the girl's final words on this mortal coil.The girl is not alone. It's only a matter of time before the body count starts rising and a race against time begins to solve the mystery of the bizarre calls.Despite being more than a shade Ringu-clone-esquire, I heartily enjoyed this film. It has some great set-pieces (including a memorable death), some spooky moments, a few "jump" sequences, etc. What the film didn't deliver, though, was any real fear. It was a case of "seen it all before" (a criticism that some levelled at "Ju-On").The plot unravels in a logical manner and there's a decent pay off. It may not be a future classic, but this is a very well made example of Asian horror cinema.My rating: 8 out of 10 for a stylish addition to Miike's portfolio</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chakushin ari is another ghost tale but it gets a bit special when Miike-san is in charge of things.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I strongly disagree with some other posters at the board who weren't bothered by Chakushin ari facing a Hollywood remake. Why can't Hollywood keep their dirty fingers away when they fail in their own miserable creativity. Anyhow...I've just started to dig deeper into the works of Takashi Miike and I have no problems admitting that his movies are awesome. Chakushin ari is another ghost tale but it gets a bit special when Miike-san is in charge of things. What you get in Chakushin ari is, besides the beautiful surroundings and awesome camera work, tension, thrills and a plot which does quite good for being in this genre. It has its moments of originality and compared to the works of Hideo Nakata, I'd say Miike here accomplish a heavier load of tension throughout the whole movie, while Nakata's movies have tension coming in waves, sort of.I have really nothing to whine about here or rant at. The actors are doing a good job and the piece kept me interested throughout the entire playtime. Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miike's best since Ichi the Killer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've noticed that B-grade horror directors always try to scare us with otherworldly visitors, plate-throwing spooks, etc. but, as Kubrick wondered, why be afraid of ghosts? It's proof of life beyond death! This is why A-grade directors like Kubrick, Dreyer, Miike, Hitchcock, and Shymalan, realize that the true horror is existence itself, incomprehensible in its mortality, its suffering, its hopelessness. We all die; therefore, WE are the ghosts. It's the same kind of reversal you see in that Casper short where he meets a living human child and screams, the same way the boy screamed upon seeing him.In One Missed Call, Miike quietly confesses to a deep, profound spirituality that was only apparent beforehand in his obvious contempt for everything and everyone who lacks Buddhist poise ( and the only character who even had that was Grandpa in Happiness of the Katakuris: "Yeah!" ) The movie is split into two parts. The first is a parodistic one involving lots of cell phones and tropes from The Ring, Ju-On, and other recent J-horror movies. I admit this phenomenon never made any sense to me, it was just visual noise based on memories of Poltergeist and Japanese folk tales. But Miike, who makes movies the way other people write 800-page books of philosophy, converts pop-culture dross into Renaissance-art gold, drawing out and savoring the connection, only hinted at in The Ring, between the way technology gives us the illusion of having superhuman capabilities ( talk to anyone on earth, at any time of the day! send them a video of yourself doing jumping jacks naked! ) but fails outright to protect us from the inevitable: death. You know that dread you feel when your Internet connection breaks down and you're "cut off from the world"? Miike exploits this modern fear to the limit in the greatest horror scene since the one in the shower, or 9-11 itself -- I'm talking about the very public death of Natsumi Konishi.The second half of the movie tracks the heroine as she tries to locate the source of the malevolent phone calls who are picking off her friends left and right, hoping to escape the same fate. Her journey eventually takes her to a disused hospital, where the film's second great scene takes place, as death reaches out to life, as the departed try to close the gap between them and us. Those expecting to be "scared" won't be; others who know how to watch films without expectations, and may have seen Ordet or Vampyr, will find this scene to be curiously sorrowful and moving unlike anything they've seen before. The movie would have been a classic if it had ended here, but Miike, as he always does, spins out his concept to dizzying, unimaginable lengths, as the movie begins to concentrate more on its hero, Hiroshi, who seems to embody a very Christian kind of ethos: "When knighthood was in flower" and all of that, like Orlando Bloom in Kingdom of Heaven. I won't spoil the ending, but as he discovers, the "ghost" turns out to be a variant of Ichi, from Ichi the Killer, a destructive innocent, and it's the hero's sympathy, his capacity for loving the unlovable, that not only saves his life but wins him eternal love and eternal childhood -- the symbol for which is the candy that he rolls about in his mouth in the final shot.No point in complaining that One Missed Call is too mainstream. Like so many other crossover movies, from Gangs of New York to Lovers on the Bridge, future generations will discover that genuine subversion resides in the collision between mainstream values and the truth; in fact, that collision IS the truth: Independent purity duking it out with the world, rather than sitting in its iron lung, all spotless and lily-white. Who wants to see a movie where the director rigs his own little belief system, his own critics, his own executioners? Every indie director, if he wants to be a great director, needs to make a large-budget film, needs to expose himself to the incomprehension and disappointment of critics, who are, though it's not often said, more of a threat to progress than the masses. Miike must find their disappointment, like that of the sadistic fanboys, proof that his quest is a true one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Call from Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While in a bar with her friends, the teenager Yoko Okazaki (Anna Nagata) receives a call in her cellular with a voice mail from the future telling the date and time when she would die. On the next day, Yumi overhears a group of students talking about the urban legend that people connected in the address book of cellular are mysteriously receiving phone calls with date and time of their death in the near future. In the precise informed hour, Yoko is attacked by a supernatural force in a train station while talking to her friend Yumi Nakamura (Kou Shibasaki) by phone and dies with severed arm and leg. Yumi seeks out Kioto's boyfriend Kenji Kawai (Atsushi Ida), who also received a call, and witnesses his death in an elevator shaft. When her roommate Natsumi Konishi (Kazue Fukiishi) receives a call, Yoko befriends Hiroshi Yamashita (Shin'ichi Tsutsumi), who tells her that his sister Ritsuko (Azusa) that worked in the Child Guidance Center with abused children was the first victim of the phone call. While in the hospital, Yumi hears an asthma pump and recalls that she heard the same noise when Kenji died. They decide to investigate victims of asthma in the hospital and find the name of Marie Mizunuma and her daughters Mimiko and Nanako. They search the family together trying to save Natsumi from her fate."Chakushin Ari" is scary like most of the Asian horror movies, and has a promising beginning supported by a great acting and a good plot. However, the last quarter of the movie is confused, not clear, needing interpretation; therefore, the screenplay writer Minako Daira or the cult director Takashi Miike or both failed since they were not able to transmit a clear conclusion of the story to the audience. I glanced in IMDb the most different interpretations for the end of the story to ratify my opinion. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Ligaç?o Perdida" ("Missed Call")</fullReview>

Takashi Mike(Ichi the killer) direction sometimes is actually creepy and frightening like proves the first entry ¨Dead or alive¨with the execution starring by a mobster and much more in ¨The audition¨.This horror film is inspired by ¨The ring¨with certain remembrance more even storyline coincidences.Like that and in fact happen in the most part of recently Japan horror cinema deals about an urban legend.It's the initial argument for introducing the terror in the ordinary life by means a phone.While the look is suitable spooky and eerie the plot spread to the breaking point and the final resolution results to be a little confused.The flick will like to Japan modern terror cinema enthusiastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who think this movie is derivative, and specifically cite Ju-On, Ringu, and Dark Water as its inspiration, perhaps they should check the release date of MPD Psycho. It's 2000, the same year that Ju-On was premiered on TV. I wouldn't go so far as to say that Takashi Miike invented this spooky technology genre, but the evil spirit/ghost in the machine in MPD Psycho originally moved from host to host via mobile phone and internet connection. Maybe Miike was influenced by Joe Dante's electrical Gremlin, or Wes Craven's Shocker. Only he would know. Whatever the reality, One Missed Call, plays out like MPD Psycho episode seven, shot on film instead of digital video, so it looks darker, less jokey, and consequently, more professional. The ring-tone even has an air of eerie familiarity about it. As an oblique footnote to the MPD series, it's pretty good. As a moody grudge movie in its own right, it punches well above its weight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A MISUNDERSTOOD FILM: a new lens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't write reviews often, but I felt compelled to write this, because I think this film is under appreciated due to it's categorization as just another J-horror movie with nothing new to bring to the table. I think most viewers completely missed the social commentaries in this film about traditional Japanese culture vs. the rise of technology and westernization. Maybe I am over analytical, but I thought this film was about a lot more than just horror. (POSSIBLE SPOILER) I point to the scene when Natsumi is on the television program specifically. The filmography and cuts here are amazing, and I also loved the contrast of the exploitation of the event, with the detective, the priest, and those who really do see this as supernatural and as a reflection of traditional Japanese folklore and ghost stories.I love horror, and J-horror, but with the exception of the traditional Japanese portrayal of a ghost, I didn't really think of this as J-horror. I think it's more a social commentary, under the mask of a horror film, on the contradicting feelings of "gut" reactions and belief in traditional folk tales vs. the modern era, the ideas of logic and reason over superstition, and westernization.(POSSIBLE SPOILER)For instance, when talking to the nurse about "Munchausen by Proxy," I love the contrast of this "logical" "psychological modern approach vs. the scenes of the true abuse, and with traditional legends. Like I said, I might be over analyzing the film, but I honestly don't think I am, because Takeshi Miike is NOT A TYPICAL J-HORROR DIRECTOR. This is obviously more related to J-horror than his other films, due to the use of superstition and the traditional long haired, pale ghost, but that is culturally significant, and if you can view this film with these ideas in mind, and with a basic understanding of Japanese history and culture, it's a different experience</fullReview>

The rather thin trail of clues leads them to a hospital where a young girl died of an asthma attack; her (apparently) abusive mother (it is rumoured) intentionally waited too long to seek treatment, resulting in her daughter's death. The mother, who mysteriously disappeared, is eventually found, dead, and the malevolent ghost apparently put to rest - until a twist ending keeps the horror alive.This movies had some really good creepy moments , Awesome creepy Death Ring tone was great.talking about the Ring tone in Japan, had become rather popular and even I have it on my Phone in the UK.

		<shortDescription>Nothing Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLOT OUTLINE: A group of friends are shocked when they start receiving voicemail messages on their cell phones from themselves 72 hours in the future. As the time that each message arrives, the recipient is killed by a malevolent entity seeking retribution for their death.One Missed Call is one of a spate of Japanese horror films (commonly known as J-Horror) that came out in the late 1990s / early 2000s. The genre was kicked off by Hideo Nakata's ridiculously successful RING, which set up the clichés that all the other films, including this one, follow almost to the letter.As far as horror films go, this particular one is nothing special. In some respects, it is a bit of a disappointment, mainly due to the fact that its director, Takeshi Miike, is capable of making some really individualistic films that can be fairly compared to the works of Shinya Tsukamoto. One Missed Call follows the Ring formula almost to the letter ? there is a technologically-minded curse (in this case cell phones) where the owner of the device is given a warning &amp; a deadline before they are killed. To be fair, Ring was not that good a film, but it did have an atmosphere that was creepy &amp; unearthly. This film doesn't even have that, not to mention the fact that, at nearly two hours long, it overstays its welcome. There is the occasional moment which suggests a work of promise ? one of the victims meets her fate in a television studio ? but for all intensive purposes, One Missed Call is dead on arrival.The execs at Hollywood conducted a remake some years later, which was actually quite better than this original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ringu with cellphones!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although a very formulaic movie, ripe with unoriginality, still very scary, and sure to give you nightmares afterwards.It basically follows the standards that Ringu set up. Some vengeful ghost sends warnings out to people before it kills them. There is even the funeral scene after the first death, where a school girl tells the female lead all about the myth. And also just when you think it is over at the end, the ghost comes back for one last scare. Not very much character depth or plot depth. Just a very very good exercise in trying to scare the audience, which works very well here in One Missed Call as it did with Ringu.The problem is that the day before I saw this one, I saw A Tale of Two Sisters. Another equally terrifying movie, but with an incredible story and character depth, so it is hard not to compare. Check it out if you haven't seen it.Best scene in the movie? The Exorcism show. Chilling as much as it is funny; very entertaining! Well done!7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that slowly bleeds to death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a more than interesting and good premise and it also has a real promising beginning but as the movie and its story start to progress more the movie actually gets worse and starts to drag and become overlong.Japanese horror movies are well known and appreciated over the world now days, due to the global success of several genre pieces, with of course "Ringu" as the best example of this. And even though these movies are always well made and good looking ones, there are often more or less the same. Aside from its premises, they are often hardly original in their execution, with the exception of an occasional memorable and effective sequences. And yes, this movie is also pretty much more of the same. It's welcome for the fans of it but it's just offering too little originality, which makes this a movie you'll easily forget.This is a pretty mainstream movie for normal Takashi Miike standards. Guess he needs to make these type of movies, every once in a while, before he can continue and finance his other movie projects, that are less mainstream and just plain odd and weird with their style and approach. But it are still the movies he is known for and also most appreciated more by people all over the world. I'm not a fan of just all of his movies but often his weirdness, extreme graphic violence and humorous approach of it all can still appeal to me and make his movies something unique and enjoyable for me. But this movie really doesn't has any of that. It's made in the same style as any other popular Japanese horror movie, which means that this movie will probably also disappoint most Takashi Miike lovers.Thing with this movie is that it has an alright story and main premise in its beginning but the more it all progresses the harder it gets to understand and the less interest you'll keep in this movie. It's the reason why the movie feels like it's dragging at points and feels also certainly overlong. This is a movie that should at least had been 20 minutes shorter really.This also certainly goes at the expense of the horror and mystery of the movie. Horror-wise this movie is certainly disappointing in what it is offering. Again, because it's being nothing too original but also because the movie it's story-telling doesn't really get you involved with things and therefore a lot of the mystery and tension dies off pretty quick already. It also doesn't help that the movie becomes more and more confusing toward its ending.But overall, this movie still does a lot of things well. It's certainly not any worse than the average Japanese horror entry and despite all of its problems, I still consider this a watchable movie.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuinely creepy J-horror romp brought to you by the one and only Takashi Miike.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the first and certainly not the last in a long, long, (very long) line of Japanese horror 'creep' flicks, "One Missed Call" was not one I anticipated to be much really. The premise is awfully teenybopper: a strange voicemail message on your cell phone tells you when you will die. Somehow I felt like this must have been done before. But not like this guy did it...It takes a lot to creep my out and Takashi Miike managed to do it pretty well in the final twenty minutes of this movie. The setting becomes extremely scary and the jumpouts are not typical; they don't really build up, they just seem to come out of nowhere.My only complaint with this film is that it never really ties itself up into a neat little package in the end; it's a little convoluted as to why certain people are connected to the original death. Without giving anything up, I'll just say that I was a bit perplexed.I have to ask: who thinks it's a smart idea to keep remaking these awesome Asian horror flicks and dumbing them down with Americanized garbage? Are we really that lazy that we can't read subtitles? And if so, why not just watch the dubbed version? I just don't get it! "One Missed Call" is one that should not be missed by horror buffs. I liked it.8 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was very well done. It had just enough creepy moments in it to keep my interest and had enough of a plot to make sense to me. If there is one thing that I believe it is that the Japanese are the kings of horror movies. They just do creepy very well. One of my favourite scenes is in a TV studio when one of the girls is getting an excorsism, which of course goes wrong and she tears down a flag covering thing revealing a wall section with a gap in it into which our friendly ghost appears. That, for me, was very well done. It was this image of the ghost that had been sent to the girls cell phone, a bit like sadako coming out the well in Ring, and it was truly awesome. If you like Japanese horror movies like I do then you should really like this movie. The atmosphere is good, the acting is superb and the plot is decent. That is why I give this movie a 9/10. It would have gotten a ten but sometimes I found the lead actress to be a little annoying, all she seemed to do near the end was scream. I would put this movie on par with the Ring. It was very good! And I still can't get the ringtone out of my head!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'd have to have the movie on Japanese Audio and English subtitles to appreciate the movie. Without that, you won't be able to appreciate the good dialect of the movie.The direction of this movie is wonderful. Every moment fills the viewer with suspense. Your heart is racing, your mind is thinking, "Who is next?". The DVD description is no lie. This really does take the style of "The Ring" and "The Grudge" and put it together to make a chilling film.One thing that got me impatient but still excited was that how everything was a little slow. Some times, things just grew silent and made me just want to say, "How is she going to die?". I found my self at times saying, "Don't do it! Don't die!" But that was in my mind.Chakushin ari (One Missed Call) is a movie you can truly enjoy. I love the style of Japanese films. They always seem better than American films. If you are a gore fan, this is not all that bloody. There is a part where someone's arm twists and bones are breaking. But some times, you just have to say, "Screw it." and watch the movie.I plan to watch more of Takashi Miike's films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J- Horror at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the kudos and credits being thrown at Shimizu and Suzuki its a shame Miike is not given the same accolades as his films are just as well done as his counterparts, the only difference being he hasn't accepted any Hollywood millions to redo his films himself. I found the film as creepy and scary as any of them. The acting for all J-Horror took me a while to get used to but once I quit looking with a Hollywood eye the superbness jumps right out at you. the special effects by our standards are a bit unreal but the way they are done makes them even better. I have the directors cut DVD with all the interviews and extras as all my DVD's do but it opens up a whole new aspect to the ideas in the directors vision, I recommend the film to all J- Horror fans as well N.A. fans that will watch it without the expectation of giant HW. sfx and budgets and watch with an eye for what a director can do without hampering by a studio or over priced production staff, I give it 8/10 only because I know he has better works coming and older ones being translated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takashi Miike's somewhat unique entry into the Japanese ghost sub-genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miike is well known for making visceral and disturbing horror movies. Think along the lines of 'Audition,' 'Ichi the Killer' or 'Visitor Q.' Upon hearing that he delved into supernatural horror ala Ju-On and Ringu I was quite excited. I finally caught this on TV a couple of weeks back and was surprised...and disappointed. Although this holds up very well amongst the recent crop of J-Horror (and American horror), it isn't entirely original and it all felt a bit "been there, done that."Chakusin ari (or One Missed Call) revolves around mobile phones. A group of friends start receiving ominous voice-mails from their future selves. At the time that they die. This starts a chain of odd deaths which causes our main character, Yumi (Kou Shibasaki) to investigate the source of the phone calls with the help of policeman Hiroshi (Shin'ichi Tsutsumi).Miike knows how to create suspense and he proves it here. There are many tense and creepy moments throughout, although the pace does slow down a tad in the middle. The acting is very good from all the actors and the story proceeds in a logical manner (with no plot holes; rare in a ghost movie). Expectedly, the deaths are gruesome and bloody (it IS Miike after all). The ending is typical Miike, confusing, disturbing but original and oddly suited.However, this movie cannot escape the feeling of "seen it all before." The typical long-haired girl scares are the there, along with a couple of "boo" scares; so basically it carried a 'Ju-On' feel throughout. As far as J-Horror goes, though, this is a fitting contribution.3?/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I suppose I should be impressed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By all the fawning people have been doing over Miike and his work. I sat through this flick tonight. I figured, if it's half as good as Ringu, as I assumed from these comments it might be, then it will be worth my time.No such luck.I'm all for finding the next great director (or writer), but I don't think Miike is the one. I don't have an NYU Masters of Fine Arts, but I do know this much: a horror movie has to have pacing. It also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie does.This film's pacing had me shaking my head. Some of the scenes near the end dragged so badly, I went to the fridge and lingered there while Kou Shibasaki stared at the camera for seemingly minutes on end, eyes wide and mouth agape. A famous director once made the claim, and I'm paraphrasing, a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll. Kou is not a good enough actress to make that work. She stares paralyzed at the undead girl for more scenes than I care to remember. And she isn't the only one doing an impersonation of a deer in headlights; other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this non-performance. The script gives them little room to do much else for far too much of the time.I like Asian cinema. Hong Kong action flicks from the last 30 years, Korean horror like "Phone" and "Koma", Ang Lee's work, some of the trashy but fun Filipino movies with gratuitous sex and fighting, as well as others. Chakushin Ari I could have done without.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Miike's better films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little put off in the beginning, felt like a mix between Ju-on and Ringu. It is the same kind of 'ghost gonna get you' story lines, but Miike succeeds where the others failed. He gave the story more depth and showed you more of the evil. As the film progressed it got creepier and creepier. It was shot very well and the story moved along well. As opposed to most horror films of late, the death scenes were not the main focus. Instead, he really focused a lot on the events leading up to the kill. Compared to a lot of his films, One Missed Call did not have a lot of blood and gore. (It still has some, but not a lot.) I rarely get "creeped" out by movies, but this one gave me goosebumps at least a dozen times. I loved this movie and can't wait to spring it on my unsuspecting friends, like I did with Audition! Ha ha ha.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating hall of mirrors like abstraction of loss, abuse and alienated youth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This just might be the most interesting psychological drama that I've seen since Miike's own masterpiece Audition (1999), and one that it seems has sadly been misinterpreted by many critics and viewers as being a work of simple J-Horror by numbers. Though it has elements of this, the characteristics of J-Horror, which are very much rooted in standard social and spiritual taboos that many Japanese people take incredibly seriously, are used as window dressing here, intended to distract the audience from the more important and subtle ideas at work behind the surface of the narrative.It certainly isn't a pastiche or a spoof as some viewers have indicated, though you could argue that it works on a certain satirical level, with the odd hint of benign humour that we've come to expect from Miike woven throughout. However, judging from much of the stylistic tone of the film, with its deeper allusions to child abuse and the murky and alienated tone that the director attaches to it, I honestly can't imagine that this is meant to be laughed at. Those who claim that the film is a comedy or a spoof are more likely to be Miike fans that are unfamiliar with the broader aspects of his work and the way in which he puts his films together; instead judging his films simply on the shock-value and tongue-in-cheek triviality of projects like Ichi the Killer (2002) and Dead or Alive (1999). Yes, he does accept any film that is offered to him, and more often than not chooses work that he feels he can do something interesting with; experimenting with the form and content and occasionally adding his own touches that are often subversive and somewhat attention seeking, but he always has in mind an approach that best suits the material.He doesn't condescend to his work; there's no cynicism here. As ever, Miike is fulfilling the wishes of his producer whilst simultaneously bringing something else to the film that may have been missed by a lesser filmmaker, more interested in the superficial quality of the story. In this case, a sly comment on the media and how it manipulates tragedy for profit; turning horror and pain into spectacle. It also continues the theme of lost youth; something quite prevalent in Japanese cinema, with films like Battle Royale (2000), Visitor Q (2001), Pulse (2001) and All About Lily Chou-Chou (2002) documenting the recent struggles in both social environments and education, with the idea of a generation of Japanese youth overwhelmed by expectations of family and society and cast adrift in such a way as to leave them ultimately more venerable to a greater evil (be it drugs, gang violence, suicide or crime). It's all done metaphorically of course - with the J-horror elements used to mask these ideas - though certainly, in many of the scenes, we see characters, kids even, isolated and with no one to turn to.Think about the presentation of both the film and the narrative; the absence of responsible adults creating a ghost world that these kids drift in and out of, turning only to each other for solace. The creation of a nocturnal world where school children hang out on railway bridges in the early hours of the morning, watching scenes of abject horror in a way that suggests tragic familiarity. The way that the background characters - the everyday people on the street - huddle under umbrellas watching a televised exorcism in the centre of Shinjuku completely cut off and detached from everything that is happening, becoming an almost representation of the audience even; eating up the pain and suffering as dismissible entertainment and completely missing the personal horror and exploitation of the abuse itself. Likewise, look at the scenes shot during the day. The streets are mostly empty, save for the presence of the adult media, the police (who have a complicated role within the film) and the students who are at the centre of the whole thing.Those claiming that this is a comedy seem uneducated when it comes to Miike and his work; looking for the vapid cartoon character and his torrents of gore and depraved sex, and not the finely nuanced filmmaker who gave us excellent, multi-layered works like Shinjuku Triad Society (1995), Rainy Dog (1997), The Bird People in China (1998), Audition (1999), Dead or Alive: Birds (2000) and Gozu (2003). As a horror film, this is effective. The scenes in the abandoned hospital, although clichéd, work incredibly well at ramping the tension. However, there's more to the film once we dig beneath the surface. The final act of the film takes place on at least three different levels; taking in the real, the imagined and the abstracted memory of both. The way Miike brings the various elements together - using stylised production design and skewed perspectives - creates a hall of mirrors like sense of abstraction familiar from the final act of Audition. Think about it. Is Gozu simply an absurd spoof on the latent homosexuality of the Yakuza sub-genre, or is there a more interest sub-textual argument about identity and gender being woven within? One Missed Call works on a similar level.Those who make the effort to watch Miike's work will know that there is always much more to his films than it initially seems, though you really have to work at it. To suggest that this is a spoof because you fail to appreciate the subtle, sub-textual storytelling and ask simply for mere cartoon-like abstraction is a discredit to a great filmmaker and those of us familiar with Miike's work beyond that of Ichi the Killer. With One Missed Call, Miike gives us a multi-layered film; shocking and satirical in equal measures and tied to a truly tragic depiction of loss, abuse and alienated youth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same bullcrap, different movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically, take the concept of every Asian horror ghost movie and smash it into one and you get this movie. The story goes like this: a bunch of college kids get voice mails from their own phones that are foretelling their deaths. There's some s*** going on with ghosts, which if you've seen any Asian ghost movie, isn't scary by now. This movie was quite upsetting because it's very clichéd. It's the same bullcrap, different movie.The acting was pretty good. Unfortunately the actors are put into a very Ring-esquire situation, so it's nothing we haven't seen in the past. The two lead acts did a solid job though.As far as gore, there's not much going on. We get a cool sequence that includes an arm twisting a head off (I don't know how else to explain that), but it was cut away so you don't see anything except the final result. You see some blood at times, including decapitated arms and a zombie (that looked really cool I might add), but this movie isn't too bloody.The scares in the movie are few and spread out, and it's really not that scary. You'll get some creepy images at times, but it's not enough for me to consider scary. It's nothing different from Ringu, Ju-On, or Dark Water, and none of those scared me either. That's really the downfall of this (and most Asian horror movies) is that if it doesn't deliver the scares then it's just not that good.As far as directing, Takashi Miike still did a pretty good job. He seemed a little tamed in this movie compared to his past movies, but he still portrays a lot of his messed up style he's become famous for. A lot of images were a lot like Miike (including a scene with a bunch of jars of dead fetuses), and the last 15 - 20 minutes seemed far more Miike then the rest of the movie. Still, the movie is flawed by its unoriginality.I would recommend this only to people who are huge on Asian horror movies (even if you are, I can recommend much better) or big Miike fans. Warning to those who want to get into Miike, this is NOT his best work.I'm giving it a 4 because it's just mediocre. Perhaps if this was released 4 or 5 years ago it might be worth a higher rating.Also, I'd like to b**** about Asian horror movies real quick. How come if it's an Asian horror movie it's automatically suppose to be good over here (US)? A LOT of these movies are the equivalent in Japan to what Scream, Urban Legends, and I Know What You Did Last Summer were over here in the 90's. If you've seen one you've seen them all. And a lot of these movies rely way too much on scares and imagery that if it doesn't deliver the scares they set out to do then they're just not that good, and nothing would change that. More Asian horror films need to be more like Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, two movies that if they don't frighten or scare you, at least they have great stories, acting, direction, cinematography, and much more to back them up. Two movies that aren't just great horror movies, but great movies in general. More Asian horror movies need to be like these instead of the cliché, "A ghost just wanted to be found so it went around killing people through their phone/video tape/house/electric appliance/water pipes/google search engine/vibrator/groceries/etc."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A low-rent knock-off of other similar films, "One Missed Call" is nevertheless often thrilling and enthralling thanks to some expert scares from director Takashi Miike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, let's just cut to the chase. Because there's no other way to really describe this film without comparing it to numerous others that came before.The story of "One Missed Call" is essentially just a cocktail comprised of two-parts "Ringu/Ring" to one-part "Ju-On: The Curse"... garnished with a dash of the visuals and tonality of the first couple "Tomie" flicks here and there for good measure. Oh, and a pinch of a handful of director Takashi Miike's previous films once or twice during particularly "gooey" scenes.Yes, yes, yes... I know it's based on a novel and that it's fair to say many Japanese horror films (Heck, I'd say Asian horror films in general) share a lot of common visuals, story structure and occasionally specific scenes. But at the same time, it's hard not to notice how much the movie does rely on borrowing materials we've generally seen done much better before, while just giving them a slight cosmetic face-lift.Stop me if you've heard this one: A small group of friends must fight for their lives after receiving phonecalls alerting them that they will die in just a few days. (...never heard that one before. Oh, wait...) Except instead of relying on a cursed video-tape, the dark forces at play in this film skip right to the nitty-gritty as the curse is just focused on the phone-call itself. You get the call, you die, someone else close to you gets the next call. And so, the search is on as young Yumi- who has lost several friends to the curse and appears to be its next victim- must team up with investigating detective Yamashita to solve the mystery of what's happening and how to stop it.I will make a minor apology for the use of sarcasm above, but I can't blame myself too much. It's just too hard to really talk about this film without addressing those obvious similarities that it has to other films. Really the only thing that sort-of sets this film apart from being just another generic horror-flick are some wonderfully subversive little scenes that pop up now and again and a few big stand-out scares thanks to the skill of director Miike. That and admittedly fun performances from our leads Kou Shibasaki and Shinichi Tsutsumi, who are both able to salvage some fine work despite a painfully derivative script and clichéd character development.One particularly remarkable scene relatively early in the film is what pulls it all together for me, and makes me able to forgive the film's faults and shortcomings. While I won't spoil the outcome, I will say it revolves around a character desperately trying to survive, even going so far as to appear on live-TV for an "exorcism" to save her from whatever dark force is at play. Not only does the scene contain some nice and very subtle bits of satire, but it's also just REALLY darned creepy and unsettling, building tension like a tightening wire until it all snaps and goes completely nuts. It's about a 10 minute sequence, but it packs more suspense, fear and even small chuckles than most films do in their entire runtime. It's frankly shocking just how amazingly effective this scene is compared to the relatively by-the-numbers rest of the proceedings. Another sequence set in a hospital later does come close with some truly twisted imagery and visual direction that just drips and oozes pure, dread-filled atmosphere... though it never quite matches the sheer power and ferocity of that earlier sequence. Still, it's another great sequence in its own right and should be mentioned as another of the film's stand-out moments.And honestly, it is scenes like those two that do make this a worthwhile sit... at least for hardcore horror fans or movie-buffs with a taste for Asian films. It's most definitely a case of "the parts being greater than the whole", but even still, the whole isn't too bad. It's just very routine. We've seen it all before. But that doesn't mean there's not still some fun to be had with it. It may not be one of Takashi Miike's best efforts. But it's one I think most people will get a kick (and a jump) out of.I give "One Missed Call" a slightly above average 6 out of 10. It's worth checking out at least once thanks to some great key scenes... just don't expect a particularly original story. And be prepared to roll your eyes once or twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miike phoning it in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Missed Call is a slickly effective J-Horror with scares in all the right places. The basic premise is that people receive a call on their mobile phone, apparently from their own number, which leaves an eerie voice-mail message foretelling of their imminent death. As one person is killed, another number is called from the victim's phone and so the 'virus' propagates.In a post-production interview, Miike reveals that he doesn't particularly like straight-up horror films; that he wants a bit more from his ?1800 cinema ticket than a few scares. Nevertheless, a straight-up horror is pretty much what he delivers - yes, there is a decent back story, centring around child abuse (the abused becoming the abuser) and Munchausen's Syndrome by Proxy, but not in the kind of depth that would elevate it into another genre.Essentially, One Missed Call is derivative of the best J-Horror: if you put Ring, The Grudge and Dark Water into a blender and pressed Go, this is pretty much what you'd expect. Except that with most directors what you'd end up with is a grey sludge, rather than the smooth, vivid cocktail of elements that is One Missed Call: the acting is good, the sets and lighting immaculate (it's hard to imagine a creepier setting than an abandoned hospital), the story coherent, and the script taut. It's also a lesson in manipulating atmosphere - for all the (very effective) supernatural goings on, I think the scene that made me jump highest out of my seat involved a couple of crows banging into the window of a gloomy apartment block. Miike is a hugely accomplished filmmaker, capable of so much more than this, but as J-Horror goes, it's probably still in the top 10%.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into One Missed Call expecting that it was going to be another terrible chapter in Japanese copycat horror films. My hopes were raised when I saw Takashi Miike in the opening credits (longtime fan, didn't know this was one of his).Midway through the movie, my expectations were rising. It was actually good! There was a deep central theme, the story was carried out well, the pacing was good, the characters were accessible and believable, and it was damn scary. For a campy horror flick about cell phones, there was a lot of refinement.The reason I didn't rate it higher was that it had some obvious flaws. For one, it was longer than it needed to be. A campy horror flick is, after all, a campy horror flick, and doesn't really need to be two hours long. Also, the ending threw me for a bit of a loop, but I won't spoil it.Watch it for yourself, preferably in high-def and with the lights out. Seriously scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really surprised with this movie , because all over the Asian movie line it is hyped to the top with ringu and Ju-on, which i have not got round to seeing. But nowhere mentioned this scary gem by horror legend takashi miike. The storyline is good and the acting was at its best for a horror movie. The only bad thing would be that i was expecting to jump a bit more than i did. However this film still leaved me pretty restless.I won't be answering my phone to any unknown numbers any time soon. The concept of ghosts getting to you through technology is something very scary, and clearly Asia is extremely good and covering this concept.Now from what i have heard people say just another grudge movie. Now i do dis-agree as ever movie is different in itself. This was directed and acted brilliantly and the effects were visually great. Many cliff hangers which you expect the film to end on but it just throws you back into the world of darkness again and again and again. This is a classic horror epic and i recommend to any horror fan. Ps. subtitles aren't a problem for me, But whatever you do don't go see the crappy remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favourite J-Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is my Top J-Horror Movie. The pacing of this movie was perfect. Takashi Miike manages to create a creepy atmosphere throughout this entire film. What makes this film unique is that the ghost actually turns out to be a young girl. Some people complain about the ending, but I felt that the ending was done pretty well and unexpected. The actress that plays Yumi does her role very well. There were a lot of scary scenes in this movie. The movie starts of with slightly scary and then extremely frightening throughout the second half of the movie. There was one frightening scene in the middle of this movie that probably would be the most frightening scene in cinematographic history. There were a lot of times the scary scenes make me jump when I was watching this movie. Takashi Miike is my favourite director. I found Chakushin ari to be even more effective than ringu. The terrifying parts of Chakushin ari are shown mainly at night that builds a lot of terror and fear. Another scene I really wanted to comment in this movie is the TV scene which one of Yumi's friends just get twisted and twisted. This film is very well paced because only after a few minutes after the beginning of the film, terror starts to begin. This keeps people glued to the screen right from the beginning of the film. To me, there are pratically no flaws in this film. I thought this film is just a perfect piece of horror. Some scenes such as the horrific mirror scene where the reflection of Yumi just turns out to be mimiko is just fantastic. The ending is also very memorable, if you understand the ending. The ending is so unexpected that the ending for this movie could be the best ending any movie would have. Unlike ringu, which relies on only one scary scene, or ju-on which is a little too fast paced, Chakushin ari is just perfect and the scary scenes in the movie are just shown in so many different ways. The elevator scene, to me was probably the scariest elevator scene in any horror movie. I thought the elevator scene was also scarier than Dark Water. This movie will keep you entertained and glued to the screen right from the start to the end credits. This movie is extremely highly recommended. Score:10/10 I thought this was the best horror movie out of all the horror movies that have been made in the entire world. Storyline: 9/10 Scene: 10/10 Horror: 10/10 Overall: 10/10 I recommend all J-horror fans to watch this movie. Watch this movie if you like shows like Ringu. If you would like to know the ending, Yumi gets killed by Mimiko and Mimiko enters Yumi's body.Yumi shares the same grudge as Mimiko. Yumi's confrontation with the ghost caused her to gain her true self. Yumi stabs Yamashita san so that Yamashita San can fall into the same sky as her when she dies(with mimiko still inside her body.) Yamashita san accepts Yumi's love and allows Yumi to stab him. The ending can be viewed as a happy and sad one. The ending is a happy one because they get to fall in the same sky together. The ending, being sad because Yumi was not able to escape from her fate of being killed though she spent one whole night to stop the curse. Yumi still has to die in the end. I thought this was the best horror movie ever made in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good Asian horror movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the Japanese horror film, One Missed Call last night, and i thought that it was a excellent film, and far better than the American remake. It is about a teenager Yoko Okazaki who is in a bar with her friends, she receives a voice mail from the future telling the date and time when she will die. The next day, Yumi hears a group of students talking about the story where people are mysteriously receiving phone calls with the exact date and time of their death. a couple of days later at the exact hour, Yoko is attacked by a supernatural force in a train station, while she is talking to her friend Yumi Nakamura. Yumi finds out Kioto's boyfriend Kenji Kawaia also received a call, and she witnesses his death in an lift. When her roommate Natsumi Konishi receives a call, Yoko becomes friends with Hiroshi Yamashita, who tells her that his sister Ritsuko was the first victim of the phone call. They find that the name of Marie Mizunuma and her daughters Mimiko and Nanako have something to do with the strange phone calls. They begin a search to find out what is going on. I thought that this was a very good film and would recommend people to see it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly overrated, but still entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One Missed Call" is a little overrated but still fairly enjoyable Asian ghost film.**SPOILERS**Following a friends death, Yumi Nakamura, (Kou Shibasaki) wanders about a strange story being told by her friends, about weird messages on their phones warning them of their future deaths. Reluctant to believe the rumor, her friends Yoko Okazaki, (Anna Nagata) Natsumi Konishi, (Kazue Fukiishi) and Det. Hiroshi Yamashita, (Shinichi Tsutsumi) try to help her with the situation, eventually realizing it is connected to one of the department's previous cases involving Marie, (Mariko Tsutsui) and Mimiko Mizunmura, (Kumiko Imai) who had a history of family abuse within them and that certain elements of them are mirrored in the recent killings. When it comes to be her turn next on the list, they race to stop the deadly ghost encounters before it's too late.The Good News: There was some good stuff here when this one tried to. One of the best elements here is the fact that there's a good element written in the film involving the television crew, once they're involved in the story. This here is quite a new development in these kinds of films, mainly due to the novel idea behind it but also due to the fact that it as well provides some really good stuff to come from the involvement. One of the best is the outstanding live TV report done on the matter, which is just absolutely outstanding and is nearly flawless. The exorcism that opens it is really exciting and thrilling, and when the ghost appears, the chaos of the situation, destruction of the studio in a blinding storm of debris, tossed furniture and general panic is a sight to behold. When the ghost does first appear, it's the slow-burn one where it slowly appears from around a corner hands-first only to the victim and through TV monitors, as others can't see it, before launching into one of the greatest visually-striking deaths in the genre that is just as brutal as can be in the situation without going over-the-top, and then to have the entire scenario broadcast to the world on live-television just makes the whole scene that much more unnerving. Other big pluses include the first meeting between everything, where the intention is first brought up and the whole thing is then interrupted by one-of-the-mysterious phone-calls in front of everyone, which is a little chilling itself but also the follow-up where the mystery is first mentioned is important as it sets the rest of the film's mysteries into motion from here, and the short little plugs seen on TV before the live-interview actually manage to add a little extra dose of tension to the mix as well. As per usual with the genre, when it actually gets the ghost involved, there's a lot of fun to be had, and that's again the case here with a couple of really good encounters. The opening kill on the bridge is really good, working the unknown of the situation to great effect and then ending with a spectacular kill that really sets the film in motion quite nicely. A later one, where the ghost appears to off one of the group through unconventional use of an elevator shaft scores nicely, and then the main one, with the encounter in the abandoned room that is just all sorts of atmospheric, and there's a couple fun encounters there as well. These here make the film enjoyable.The Bad News: There was a couple problems here with this one that hold it down. One of the main ones is that there's a relatively large portion of time where absolutely nothing at all happens. This here is the middle segment, which is mostly the searching for the family that has been at the cause for it all, yet the fact that this doesn't at all provide much in the way of anything terribly interesting is what causes this one to come down. The fact that the ghost is missing from these scenes is incredibly apparent, hardly anything scary or interesting happens and it basically seems to become more of a police-procedural drama more than anything else, which is not all that bad since the mystery is at least given some more weight to than most others, but when it takes longer than the amount of screen-time given to it to fully get the idea across in a completely non-confusing matter is when it runs into trouble. This one here is a case of being over-explained, and in a sense feels like it's got about twenty different ideas crammed into it and then contrivance written into it in order to make it somewhat plausible for the events to be connected, and in the end this whole section is a big loss. The other flaw to the film is that, because of the large number of ideas written into the story, it takes forever for the film to end, and none of the events portrayed make any sense at all on their own. The events inside the trapped room are quite lame anyway, making no sense at all and that's before it allows the official ending to come into play, re-writing that and really doing anything to correct it either. This one is entirely confusing, and pretty much constitutes this one's flaws.The Final Verdict: While not the overall classic that many make it out to be, this is still a fairly engaging enough to be a worthwhile entry in the genre. Give it a shot if you're into the Asian ghost genre or if you happen to enjoy a little mystery with your horror, while those that aren't big on those should heed caution.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Language</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miike going mainstream, again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very visually-pleasing traditional J-Horror flick, with Miike's signature criticism of the state of family and domestic decaying, without delving deeper philosophically nor psychologically of course.What makes most of the Japanese horror film industry appealing is its capability of delivering suspense and actually building a compelling atmosphere while not relying much on seat-jumpers and Hollywood scares, as well as keeping up with non-linear time-line, fragmentation, and other experimental techniques. Such characteristic, sadly, have been gradually abandoned and tolerated with as the exposure on the US market grows.Acting was campy, which is a very strange yet amusing aspect in almost all of the Miike Corpus (except for Oudishon, perhaps, with its pleasing cast and the legendary Ishibashi Ryo.) What speaks in Miike's work is in fact Miike Takashi himself and his visionary talent. Such genius could be seen from the fanatic extravaganza media frenzy in Natsumi (Fukiishi Kazue)'s arc, notably the live exorcism scene.Rich cinematography and decent sounds. Clever deployment of the ring-tone device worked positively for progressing and building up without being overly redundant and jejune.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie made me grab some cell phones and delete my number. Although I do not believe in spirits haunting phones i do believe in spirits such as death and demons. I also believe in bad luck streaks jumping from people to people. That said lets move on to the actually movie.Plot: I never heard of a plot so twisted (literally the twist were at every other scene) I was not sure what was happening until it had happened and I paused and took a few minutes to collect my thoughts on what just transpired. My line of thought was simple at first. People get a call hearing their death they die soon after and candy pops out their mouth they make one more call to someone in their contact list that person is next. Then the questions started coming in. This is when i got confused. Why did candy pop out their mouth? Why a cell phone? Why do they have to die? So on and so forth. The answers somewhat make sense. . . and i really emphasis the somewhat. But they do make sense. Execution: I do not believe it could have been done better. That pretty much all i have to say about the execution. It was a decent length the subs were not a blinding color and a blur across the bottom of the screen. The acting was decent even if their dialogue was predictable at times although the story itself was not.Climax: A beautiful flash of humanity and our fear of death and how we overcome it to live or so i thought until the final 2 twist come in and she stabs her companion as he tries to save her. Closing: It was almost perfect but i was not sure if the male star would be finishing his piece of candy. I hate open endings that leave you wondering was it solved or is he still gonna die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yumi's friends are dying in bizarre ways to what seems to be a supernatural vengeful ghost who forewarns her prey by sending them a ring-tone playing a specific tune. Following that tune is the final words spoken from each chosen victim's mouth before they die. On their phones, is a set date and time in the future when they will perish. Yumi(Kou Shibasaki)joins forces with Hiroshi Yamashita(Shin'ichi Tsutsumi), whose sister was a chosen victim who died from terrible burns. Their journey to find out who is responsible for the abnormal murdering spree leads to a family with possible abuse involved. There's an important sub-plot featuring Yumi's harsh up-bringing that might be an essential aspect in the grand scheme of things. One major question is obvious..why are these certain victims chosen? Why would a ghost go out of her way to kill these people randomly?The film seems like a standard, modern Asian horror flick using technology as a means for ghouls to travel so they can inflict bodily harm to their chosen victims, if you go by the premise alone. But, Miike does get a chance to imbue his warped sense of humor within the plot as Yumi's final college chum, Natsumi(Kazue Fukiishi)is exploited by a television show for ratings as the world watches with bated breath if she'll die in the studio across the airwaves as a monk tries to exorcise her from the monster pursuing her. And, the final thirty minutes toys with us as it shifts from one proposed ending to another. To be honest, the supposed climax in the old abandoned hospital, quite darkly lit, where we think Yumi is finally encountering the ghostly killer claiming her life is next, is solidly eerie. I think, for the most part, this is a professionally made, well-executed, slow-burn creeper. Rather level-headed(..but, still with quite a few WTF? sequences to keep us on our toes), if a bit overlong. I think there's a good 90 minute movie here, but I do still think it's worthwhile even it's not Miike at his best. I'm afraid, this film's air of familiarity will hurt it somewhat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>takes a while to get going, and nothing groundbreaking, but it's scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Takashi Miike, in 2003, decided to take on two very different projects, one Gozu, which was maybe the greatest surrealist-yakuza movie ever made, and One Missed Call, a commercial project (or rather, not as 'art-house' or X-rated for the main cineplex theaters, at least in Japan) for teen fans of the 'grudge' type of horror movie. In all fairness in seeing this film, I have not seen many, or even a few, of these kinds of 21st century ghost stories with the ante upped on gore and things that suddenly spring up out of the darkness. This being said, it was an admirable effort from a filmmaker who's still experimenting even when he's making something for the 'kids' (the theatrical trailer shows this, as it advertises for teens and junior high schoolers to come see the movie). The premise is as follows: teenagers start receiving cell phone calls- from themselves. Soon after, they die, based on what is heard of in the voice message of the person saying something, screaming, and that's that. At first it seems like it's just suicides, but Yumi (Kou Shibasaki) thinks something else is up, something much darker. When the secret starts to reveal itself, there's more to the picture than just a simple 'grudge'.There's a family-history element to One Missed Call that Miike properly exploits more in the second half of the film, and it's by this point that it turns into a (properly) ghoulish spectacle. Although Miike does stop for a moment to make a comment on media hoopla over supernatural occurrences with the TV show that turns Yumi and her friend into fodder for 'specialists', including something like a zen-master or something, he's doing nothing more than helming a story of spirits from the dead- and very scorned dead- going back after the living. His main set-piece in a dilapidated warehouse/hospital is maybe the strongest for pure chills, as Yumi goes through the halls and doesn't see the ghost crawling up on the ceiling behind her. There's even an almost tongue-in-cheek, yet tender, scene involving a green corpse who may or may not be Yumi's mother. But aside from this, there are other good moments of the kind of horror that made Audition the classic that it is, and an ending that puts a very bleak twist on the whole story (and a "it was you all along" kind of connotation that reeks of being lifted from other movies).It's nothing much of a great horror film though, because despite the possible interest in the more horrific side to the story, the one involving child abuse, is not given much clarity- save for a scene in a classroom- until the last twenty minutes of the movie, where lots of emotion spurred on from the actual cell phone ring tone comes out. This being said, it's a recommendable effort for its main genre fans, a very worthy knock-off that is, oddly enough, soon to be another of the many, many, many other American knock-offs of the Ju-On type craze in Japan. It might have even *better* production design and effects (and for a movie from this director it has quite the nifty lot of both), but I doubt it will have half of the ingenuity of Miike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was not a bad Japanese horror movie. I was pretty scared in a few moments and definitely shivering in others. The scene where the dead woman spirit comes out from behind the TV studio wall sideways was really good. The murders were executed well and were shocking. At one point, when the girl's head and arms are being twisted by the entity, I jumped out of my chair. Yumi, the main character, was well acted. My favorite scene was when she got the missed call, why registered her own voice saying... why? why? Her reaction was perfect, and it really got me more into the movie.The things that disappointed me: First, the pace was too slow, especially in the beginning. It took too long to build up. Second, the ending was too confusing, I was totally lost. Third, there were too many smaller plots that made the movie drag more than it should have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misleading ghost story goes bizarre and unique. Miike bends another genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through the many reviews I've read on this movie it seems the main disappointment was the fact that Takashi Miike went too "normal" with it. I guess that the majority of viewers felt the movie was too similar to every other ghost movie via Juon, The Ring, and Dark Water. And that Miike's bizarre fashion and unique touches weren't as present in One Missed Call as in his other films like Ichii, Fudoh, Dead or Alive, or Gozu. I completely disagree. There was actually a LOT of Miike moments in this film. And in his regular fashion we are treated to an unique and bizarre conclusion that thats both disturbing and surprising. If you want to have a clearer picture of what to expect from One Missed Call, think of Juon: The Grudge mixed with the weirdness of Gozu, add a dash of Uzumaki (not a Miike film I know) and the pacing of Audition, and random spots of grotesque images and you have a basic idea of the tone the movie holds. It's misleading at first in making you think it's just going to be another clone of the Phone or The Ring but Miike then pulls you from those tracks and twists everything about.I also think you need to have a sense of not taking it too seriously to truly enjoy the film. A lot of the events which occur are far out there and over the top at times. The weirdness of some of the deaths is almost humorous at times and I think Miike was just trying to have a good time with this one and give his audience a few cheap thrills. It's actually really enjoyable if you sit through it with an open mind and suspension of belief.And whatever you do, DO NOT TRY TO COMPARE IT TO OTHER Asian GHOST MOVIES. You'll ruin it for yourself and really, though the basic idea is comparable to many prior ghost films Miike manages to keep things original and retain his wicked sense of humor and bizarre style.One Missed Call is great. Its definitely not a masterpiece in Asian horror cinema but Miike's addition to the dark-haired-female-killer-ghost fad is exciting, humorous, creepy, weird, energetic, and unique. Give it a chance, don't expect too much, and just go with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"One Missed Call" is an intense and surprisingly splatter-free thriller by Takashi Miike, creator of frenzy flicks such as "Ichi ? The Killer" and "MPD Psycho". The film is involving and compelling right from the first minutes, as it introduces a group of identifiable young friends. Whilst in the bathroom, a girl's cell phone rings but she can't answer. The voice mail shows that the call came from her own number and from a date in the near future! When listening to the actual voice mail, the message seems to carry the girl's last words and a disturbingly realistic recording of her deadfall. This mysteriously supernatural ritual repeats itself several times and each time the recipient actually dies on the predestined time! More than enough reason to freak out, if you ask me! A teenage girl and the brother of a deceased girl start to investigate the case and discover that everything relates to the strange Mizunuma family. Okay, I admit that this film's premise sounds an awful lot like "Ringu" (even including the whole family-mystery), but I liked "One Missed Call" so much better than that dull and overrated "classic". Miike's characters are more convincing, the death-sequences are far more spine-chilling and at least the set-pieces are up-to-date! Japan is THE country of brand new technology and this finally is a movie that uses it! No dusty videotapes here, but fancy cell phones and live television shows that exploit urban legends! The story does get confusing at times (especially near the ending) and some of the overlong dialogue could easily have been cut. The biggest trumps are some small details that make this movie almost unbearably scary, like the petrifying ring tone that is used repeatedly and the wild camera-work during the TV-show sequence. Recommended! Better watch it before the American remake ruins it again.</fullReview>

And I thought it has some elements from Ring and JU-ON. But the story is kinda original and it has lots of big jumps. And of course, the sound track, I really really like it, it's cool!

		<fullReview>One Missed Call is not a good or even a bad movie, but this film is lack of explanation. There is so many scenes in this film that has no connection, like the scene when Yumi is in a dark room, hiding and there are this bottled fetus given by some white hands. The scene does not actually totally "ruin" the film, it's just simply non sense. But the story is as usual good, as seen on previews Takashi Miike works like the brilliant Ichi the Killer. The story is like taken on "Phone" and "Ring" and some scenes are like "Ju-On", that makes the movie too unoriginal. But it is a fun movie. The dark camera work makes the movie more scarier. The only thing that makes this movie an average is some scenes are very non sense. Like the scene I've mentioned earlier, it is NOT a very big deal in the movie, that scene is a totally non-sense and has NO connection on the film.One missed call fails only on originality, but it is a very good psychological shocker freshly made by Splatter Horror king, Takashi Miike....and the ring tone is SO very creepy...6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young and attractive Japanese people are getting on the wrong side of some curse again, this time it involves mobile phones. Various people die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is unearthed, so essentially if you've seen more than 2 recent Japanese horror films you can plot this film in the dark with your hands tied.The main attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. So far I've been more impressed with his low key works like City of Lost Souls, however as One Missed Call plodded along I was yearning for his more renowned envelope pushing of Dead or Alive or the overly pseudo-Cronenberg style of Audition. Despite a lot of his films being essentially empty, at least they do have merits such as these, or at least something to keep your attention like Tadanobu Asano prancing about in shiny suits impersonating Johnny Depp. There's none of that in One Missed Call; there's just very little of credit: the acting is bland and average, there is very little (nothing, in all honesty) in the way of scares or suspense, and in places it's just downright boring.However, there are moments where Miike's glacier-like sense of humour seeps through the bland commercialism; most notably with the instance of the TV show intent on filming the demise of one of the cursed subjects, and the TV programmer more concerned about his ratings than the girls' life. But aside from this there is nothing to suggest it is Miike behind the camera; most notably his usual visual flair has vanished without a trace (and that includes his famous gore), although it's more likely he just didn't have any enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. One Missed Call isn't offensively bad. It's just frustratingly average.Miike obviously loves directing. With his huge yearly output it's obvious he isn't going to be 100% concerned about all his projects. But even with this in mind, One Missed Call felt like he was just paying the bills.</fullReview>

I've been a Japan/Asia-fan since I saw Ringu back in 1999. I say to people to check out movies from other countries than the US. Like Japan or Spain. But a lot of people have troubles with the languae......and rent the US version............ Well, all I can say, they miss a lot of great movies. Like this one. Since I've seen a lot of these kinds of thrillers, this movie felt familiar. Kinda reminded me of Ringu and even Final Destination (...). The story is easy to follow (not always the case in Japanese cinema) and you'll be hooked right away. It also has some great SE and doesn't leave much to the imagination...every time that mobile phone rings you know somebody will die. I was kind of surprised by the SE because you don't see that much in ghost-thrillers. Some chillers moment too...and a couple of surprises. So, you can't go wrong with this movie.....don't wait for the remake....that will only stink...like a lot of movies that Hollywood produces lately!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, ladies and gentlemen...this is certainly NOT "You've Got Mail"... The newly released CHAKUSHIN ARI (You Have a Message/Call) is yet another leap into the world of Japanese ghost-horror.The story begins innocently enough, as Yumi an her friends exchange cell phone numbers with a new friend at a restaurant. Shortly after, as Yumi waits in the bathroom for her friend, her friend's cell phone rings, but to the girl's surprise, with an unknown ring tone. Upon checking the message, the friend hears her own voice, though the meaning is confusing, if not cryptic. To make matters worse, the message is dated 2 days after... The cycle begins...Much like RING, CHAKUSHIN ARI's story rests heavily on the notion of an inescapable, and horrible, cycle of events. Is it terribly original? No. Is is scary? I thought so, especially during the final stretch. With the help of mentally off centre director Takashi Miike, and actors Kou Shibasaki and Shinichi Tsutsumi, CHAKUSHIN ARI is another solid entry for the fans of Japanese ghost-horror.Hope you enjoy it...**SPOILER (Highlight)**:It's not often you see a girl's arm contort and break itself repeatedly, after which her head twists itself around, self-decapitating.

		<shortDescription>Another awful Asian ghost film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chakushin Ari is set in Japan where teenager Yumi Nakamura (Kou Shibasaki) attends University, while eating out her friend Yoko Okazaki (Anna Nagata) receives a call on her mobile. Yoko missed the call but a voice message was left, the strange message is dated the 18th April which is two days away &amp; came from her own mobile number. Then two days later on the 18th Yoko dies in a mysterious accident, after that her friend Kenji Kawai (Atsushi Ida) receives a similar call &amp; he too dies in mysterious circumstances shortly after. The rumour going around the University is that an evil ghost is killing people &amp; using the contact list in their mobile phones to select another victim. Then Yumi's best friend Natsumi Yamashita (Shin'ichi Tsutsumi) receives a call, determined not to let her friend die or even become the next victim Yumi sets out to find the truth behind the killings &amp; stop it...More commonly known under the title One Missed Call to English speaking audiences this Japanese production was directed by Takashi Miike &amp; for me is another rubbishy Asian ghost story, to be brutally honest it's a straight rip-off of Ringu (1998) only difference being instead of a mysterious video tape Chakushin Ari revolves around mobile phones. I suppose it had to happen, since mobile phones have become such an integral part of modern culture it was inevitable someone was going to make a horror film based around them &amp; you know even evil killer ghost's have to keep up with the times &amp; use mobile phones. The basic concept to me seems laughable as Chakushin Ari tries to make something as common &amp; everyday as a mobile phone call scary &amp; for me it fails totally. I'm sorry but seeing a mobile phone rings just isn't scary or a concept that sends shivers down my spine, that's basically what it boils down to &amp; a big reason why I found Chakushin Ari so dull, lifeless &amp; such a chore to sit through. The script by Minako Daira was based on a novel by Yasushi Akimoto &amp; is throughly slow going, I found the whole story revolving around some sort of ghost who was wronged in someway when they were alive &amp; wanting some sort of revenge old hat &amp; the Japanese have flogged the idea to death &amp; usually with considerably more success than Chakushin Ari. Then there's the ending, it's absolutely terrible &amp; doesn't really make any sort of sense although maybe it's lost in the English translation. The ending is a complete mess that seems to have time travel, possession, ghost's &amp; no sort of closure. The one thing I did learn from this film though is if a rotten zombie is walking towards you with the intent to kill you then hug it &amp; say nice things to it, it'll work a treat.Director Miike is usually known for his more outrageous &amp; gory films but here with Chakushin Ari he really tones it down, there's certainly no blood or gore or violence expect for a severed arm. To be honest there's nothing here we haven't seen loads of times before, there's the obligatory female ghost who walks funny &amp; makes strange noises that every Japanese supernatural horror film must include. Been there, done it &amp; brought the T-shirt. Things pick up a bit towards the end with a haunted hospital but it's never really revealed why the hospital is haunted or how a woman's dead body got there or how it's mobile phone battery hasn't run out in six months. Like most of these Japanese ghost films Chakushin Ari is filmed in muted colours &amp; in a very simple sort of way, it just looks bland &amp; forgettable although maybe that was the intention.Technically the film is alright, there's nothing here that's going to amaze anyone but it's reasonably well made for what it is. I must admit I really don't like subtitled films, I just find them a chore to watch &amp; very distracting. The acting seems alright but since we never know what anyone is saying it's difficult to judge.Chakushin Ari is a tedious film that I really didn't enjoy at all, I found it a throughly boring mess with a less than inspiring central premise that were mostly rehashes of other similar films. The film proved popular enough to spawn two sequels Chakushin Ari 2 (2005), Chakushin Ari Final (2006) as well as a Japanese TV series &amp; a Hollywood remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meanders and ponders and ponders and meanders before finishing on a silly note.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If John Carpenter's 1978 film Halloween was a metaphorical and unsubtle morality tale on celibacy, does this make Takashi Miike's 2003 film One Missed Call a metaphorical and unsubtle tale on popularity? If you had sex in Halloween you were sliced and diced; if you own a mobile phone in this ever growing post-modern world of gadgets and modernity as well as being really popular, in One Missed Call you're arguably in even bigger trouble. But then again even I'm not sure if being stalked by Michael Myers is as scary or indeed scarier than being hunted by a supernatural ghost-like being. There is one thing for sure though, One Missed Call takes its idea and its feint ideas on the ever increasing demand for popularity and somewhat makes a hash of it.I suppose there is no surprise that the Japanese would produce a film such as this one. The general feel I think is that the Japanese are consistently producing the best horror films that the world is currently seeing and even when it's not Japan such as 2003's The Eye, it is still that Far Easterly Asia influence that makes them better than American or indeed European films in the genre. But One Missed Call is just one missed opportunity. With its premise revolving around a slice of technology that spawns greater fears (video tape in The Ring/laser eye technology in The Eye), One Missed Call feels a little dated right from the beginning. Usually the film will rely on daft logic from its characters and implausible situations to get across the bulk of its scares.The idea behind the film reads something along the lines of a mysterious caller trying to contact various people. When these people fail to answer their phones they have a missed call and these voice messages are their grizzly fates. It sounds interesting and like a compelling detective idea but the film dumbs down its premise by presenting the women within the film as weak; one-dimensional; squealing; screaming; inferior people who all share the common characterisations of being abused and the victims in general. Compare this to the male characters who have sad back-stories; are brave, strong and toward the end closely resemble a mythical knight in shining armour as the final acts plays out in a hospital. The men in the film are also authority figures with the few incidences of police presence all being of the male variety.But until these gender issues have arrived, the characters (usually the women) are given really embarrassing actions to carry out. Yumi (Shibasaki) is the protagonist of the film and the one who must find out what's going on before she herself comes to harm. In The Ring and The Eye, similar female heroines took on supernatural missions in order to save themselves and future people. Here, Yumi can only squeal, cry and put her hands over her eyes when faced with danger as the false-hero Hiroshi (Tsutsumi) comes to save her. Hiroshi is also given a prior tragedy; his sister succumbed to the missed call curse and he's in on figuring it all out purely out of spite. For him it is a revenge mission and we feel more for him because of this, thus taking away the focus and emphasis from Yumi.The final showdown in hospital makes for some interesting reading. Watch it and ask yourself "Who actually does what?" Yumi can only cry, stare and crawl around when faced with the film's antagonist and yet there is more at stake for her as it's her life on the line ? Hiroshi is there purely for payback but it is him with the weapon and it is he who must fight the monster. Even getting to the hospital is an ordeal. Yumi figures out one thing or another and goes there all alone, at night, poking around. I'm all for scares and thrills, that's why we actively watch horror films but when the motivation for the scares come at such a disappointing and dumbed down level, it is then difficult to 'feel' for the people in the film as it was their own stupidity that got them there in the first place.So this really just acts as a set up to get the male saviour of the film to finish the story off. Getting to the final act is equally as silly. When someone's possession phenomenon is revealed earlier on, everyone's first reaction is to bung her on a TV show and have her exorcised live. This could be a statement on how Japan these days make a media circus out of anything but I'm not in touch enough with the culture to know this for sure. Needless to say that by the time the ghost appears, the entire studio has run away and left the female victim by herself ? where were the security guards that were so desperate not to let Hiroshi and Yumi into the studio? Why are there no cautionary backups? Why does the girl just stay there and let it 'get' her? Because she's a female and it acts as a 'scary' scene, I suppose.One Missed Call plods along with its meek ideation about how phones and technology and popularity are maybe dangerous, but it never makes any serious stand. The film is a series of ill-motivated, uninteresting scenes that do not scare so much as they frustrate. By the time the showdown with the monster has arrived, you expect Yumi to be fighting for her life with it right in front of her alá The Ring, The Eye or even an American film like The Terminator or Alien, but she doesn't even seem interested. Not a great venture into the Far Easterly horror territory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Missed Ringu.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many centuries will pass until the Japanese/Asian horror films abandon the long-haired ghost-woman shtick? Admittedly, they've managed to rip off "Ringu" a million times, and often it worked well - which just goes to show that originality isn't that much of a requirement in the horror genre (or that I'm very uncritical and easy to please?). However, this time around I found myself a little restless, somewhat bored. It's not a bad film, but it's at least half-an-hour longer than it should be, with its absurd 110 minutes length. Compared to many other Japanese horror films, OMC lacks atmosphere and excitement. Plus, the ending is confusing: it makes no sense at all. As for the ring-tone: Miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing. Even though it was played a dozen times I can't even remember it - that's how scary it was. Speaking of Miike, for him this is something of a commercial venture, so if anyone thinks they might be getting perversion of the "Bijita Q" or "Audition" kind, they're wasting their time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually watched this movie over in japan during my stay as an exchange student. It was on in the middle of summer, which made all the more scary since summer is the season for spirits in japan! But while my translations of the movie was limited, i still managed to get a accurate understanding of the movie, and remember the ring-tone exactly. In fact, I downloaded the ring-tone the next day and scared the crap out of my kendo club team-mates (non-intentionally) when my phone started ringing one crazily hot evening!the ring-tone was what i really liked about the story because of the tunes good connection to the children of the story, with it's haunting simplicity. note to self ~ I will have to get that ring tone again one day. For a scary movie, it defiantly has it's freak out scenes, but it's long and dosn't have too much of a love storyline or anything else Hollywood in it to my opinion - which is good, but on the other hand dosn't exactly hold you to the T.V when you want a break. In my opinion, in terms of SCARY movies, it rates pretty average for a Japanese one. while watching a young girl seem to self mangle herself is all good and scary, but if your in for a real thrill, i suggest you pass this one and go straight to your local graveyard, well, or a Japanese temple at night for a personal spirit hunt. For the experience and defiantly the ring tone in my opinion!!!....hmm where could i download that ring tone again i wonder...- Mccu</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A restrained Miike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Takashi Miike's One Missed Call, there's really very little new ground covered. If I've seen one Asian film that revolves around a pale-skinned, long black-haired female ghost, I feel as if I've seen a dozen. Whether One Missed Call is derivative of other Asian horror films or whether it's the other way around, I don't know (or really care). The similarities, though, are undeniable. But it hardly matters when it comes to enjoying the movie. Miike has put together an entertaining and at times frightening tale of a young girl seeking retribution for her death. It's far less bloody and over-the-top than most of Miike's other films, but for the most part, it works. Miike is much more restrained and relies on very subtle moments to create unease in the viewer. One of the best examples is the "ghost in the cupboard" scene. It's a simple moment without a lot of fanfare, but it's very effective in generating the desired response. Other highlights of the film include the death scene at the television studio and the search through the abandoned hospital. These moments help Miike's film standout from the crowded field of similarly themed J-horror films.Whether the plots of these J-horror ghost stories appeal to you or not, as usual, it's difficult to deny the level of artistry and technical brilliance that goes into these films. One Missed Call is no exception. Thanks to some interesting cinematography and lighting, the film has a "look" that helps create an atmosphere of dread. The special effects, both visual and sound, are well done. The acting is good. Both of the leads, Kou Shibasaki and Shin'ichi Tsutsumi, are more than adequate. And Miike's direction expertly creates the desired tension. Overall, it's the kind of well-made Asian horror film that I've come to expect.But One Missed Call isn't without its faults. Beyond the "been there, done that" aspects of the plot, the film's pacing could have been better. While the first and third acts are enjoyable, the middle portion of the One Missed Call tends to drag a bit. Some of the investigation scenes into what's behind the mystery put a halt to what is an otherwise well paced film. A little judicious editing might have helped the film flow better. One Missed Call also includes a number of plot points that are never adequately resolved. For example, why was the mother's dead body in the abandoned hospital? And could the ending have been more confusing? I admit that I'm completely at a loss to explain the films finale. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, but don't ask me what it all meant. Maybe a second viewing is necessary to resolve some of these issues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Miike going Hollywood?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge Takashi Miike fan, and I love pretty much everything he's ever directed, but I was kinda let down by this movie. If you dig the current wave of J-horror films, you'll like this. It's the same as Ringu, Dark Water, and all those other movies. I kind of got the feeling that this is what Miike was aiming for, but I was still surprised at how restrained he was on this one. No hermaphrodites, sociopaths, or lady-boys in this flick! They probably wouldn't have fit into the plot, anyway... On the plus side, the acting and special effects were pretty good. It seems like he had a larger-than-normal budget on this one, and it shows. Considering that there was very little CGI in this movie, some of the scenes are impressive (the ghost floating on the ceiling takes the cake!). Leave it to Miike to make a commercial horror movie that's still better than 90% of the crap coming out of California these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A missed opportunity...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Acclaimed Japanese director Takashi Miike can't seem to get the wheels moving with this torpid thriller, an adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto's book concerning an evil old woman (and child abuser!) who is part of a new urban legend: if your cell-phone rings with a strange tone--and you see the message 'One Missed Call'--you will replay the message only to hear your own final words before your death. Most successful part of the film is the trenchant satire of Reality TV cameras intruding on the future victims, but the not-so-elaborate deaths (which include a hidden piece of red candy!) are disappointing and dispiriting. The frequent shots of ravaged dead bodies are actually displayed rather discreetly, and this overall politeness may be the reason why the film is ultimately so staid. Hollywood predictably jumped on the far-fetched plot in 2008, yet the U.S. version fared no better. NO STARS from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Death cannot be put on hold."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ One Missed Call was somewhat of a disappointment for me. The Asians have had haunted video tapes, websites, cameras, computers, and now cell phones. The vengeful ghost this time finds you through your cellular (good thing I don't have one). Imagine receiving a voice mail from your future self at the moment of death. You've got 48 hours from hearing that message until you meet a horrible end. It's definitely not your typical Takashi Miike film as this was, overall, a fairly tame film. Is Miike going mainstream, or spoofing it here? There seems to be some debate on this point. I think this topic exists because there is no signature Miike craziness going on here. It's, for the most part, a straight-forward J-horror tale in the vein of The Ring or Dark Water. It actually feels more like a Nakata film than a Miike film. But it would not be one of Nakata's better films if he had directed it. Even though there are some unsettling moments, the pace drags and it has a very unsatisfying ending. Did it really need to be 2 hours long? I think they could have cut that whole silly public exorcism scene and tightened up the plot. Because some things don't add up, or I'm not taking the time to make them add up as I would normally do. But what do I know? There are three of these films, a U.S. remake, and a television series. My opinion is definitely in the minority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turns out phones are dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One missed call, another Asian horror based on the cell phone. I recently rented a Korean horror film based on a cell phone called "Pon". One Missed Call was just as boring as that one. Maybe phones just aren't scary or something, but this move was dull and drab. No tension or thrills for me, and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary. The movie dragged quite a bit in different parts, and felt too long. Didn't keep my attention. It seems phones are hard to make frightening, it's kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie. And it is ridiculous to compare this with "The Ring", it seems every Asian horror movie is compared to it and so far I haven't seen any that measure up in the least. To horror directors - take the phone off the hook as a horror device.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow...um wtf happened there?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes this movie starts out like Ringu and seems to borrow from that heavily. Instead of the cursed video tape, however, we have the a seemingly evil entity using cell phones to go from victim to victim. As this played out I thought to myself, "not the most original movie ever, but it is interesting enough". Near the end of this movie things shift a bit and never before has a movie made me say "wtf" at the end as this movie did. I mean I haven't a clue what that ending meant or anything. Actually, it could have ended two or three more times before the actual end as this movie had more apparent endings than the final chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Granted I figured the slimy hug from the ghost wasn't the end, even I was caught off guard by the actual ending. I thought I figured the end, I didn't it threw one curve after another, and in the end we had an uber confusing ending. Before the ending and through most of the movie it is more like "Ringu" as we have people trying to find out and trying to stop the mysterious killings as the victims are apparently getting calls from themselves just as they die. Some rather good kills in this one and a couple of creepy images, but the ending is just really a bit much, it almost seemed to be a happy ending, but then it sort of did not. Still worth a look see if you like Asian horror movies.</fullReview>

I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. But I could easily fill ten lines just citing Chakushin ari's (One Missed Call's) steals, allusions, and clichés. Others here will hit on most of them, though not perhaps Ochiai's Saimin (Hypnosis) for the sleazy telecast taunting things supernatural. Only once, when Yumi takes the zombie-like mother in her arms, did One Missed Call startle me a little.One other point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (looks like Christopher Walken) as the detective. Ishibashi in Audition's abusive back story, and as Dead or Alive's Boss Aoki of the vat of excrement drowning and more, may be the most convincingly evil character actor I've ever seen.

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, this was the first Takashi Miike film I saw, and... I was completely unaware he directed it (since I read so many great things about him). This movie was given as a recommendation by my hairdresser, who watches tons of foreign films (usually Asian films/dramas), and she said it was something along "ringu". The plot sounded kind of dumb, though, but anyways I decided to give it a try.It's been about 2 years since I've seen this movie, and I barely remember anything about it. I remember it started out well, with the first phone call, and then after that it was just boring and seemed to me like a "Scream" flick. I don't even remember what happens at the end. I can't even remember any scary moments! I've seen "Ringu" and "Ju-on" (this movie supposedly followed those), and while "Ju-on" I felt was very boring also (not as boring as this film however), "Ringu" did have a very genuinely intensely scary moment at the end....In conclusion, if you're going to start watching Takashi Miike films, don't watch this one first. You will be severely disappointed.</fullReview>

If you're not easily scared, try watch a scary movie with a scared friend, it does wonders!

Because of this I feel I have a pretty good idea of the genre. Myself I'm getting tired of little children with a strange walk with their long black hair in their face. Maybe it's scary the first couple of times, because admit it, children are really frightening, but it's getting old...

When her friends start receiving similar calls, Yumi tries to figure out what the heck is going on. At first, this seems derivative of other Japanese horror movies--especially the "bad mommy" films--but it has a nice dose of nastiness (although not as much gore and twistedness that most viewers are probably accustomed to from the director.) Miike also puts in a few interesting and unpredictable twists that make this one stand apart from its contemporaries. There are even some genuinely frightening sequences. However, as far as "killer cellphone" movies go, S. Korea's "Phone" is the superior film.</fullReview>

It has some genuinely scary moments, some additions to the scary woman/techno horror sub-genre such as the live TV exorcism and the occasional flourishes of Mikke's funny side, such as an invisible spirit taking a girls arm, breaking it, wrapping it around her neck and choking her with it till both head and arm come off.Why miike chose this project is beyond me.

		<fullReview>Yes "The Ring" was great, but the whole J-Horror thing is wearing very thin by the time you get to "One Missed Call". Miike made his name in the West with a string of films made around 1998 - 2001. They were sloppy - anyone that works as fast as him would be - but they had an undeniable loopiness that twisted genre conventions. "One Missed Call" is totally generic, if you've seen "The Ring" and "The Grudge" there is no reason to see this. Like "Imprint" (disturbing theme yes but so badly made as to be laughable) and "Box" (as bad as Parks' "Cut") it gives an impression that Miike is played out _ much like Asian Horror in general. I recommend the great French film "Them" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you've probably guess by now by the synopsis and after the first viewing, this film is a big rip-off of "Ringu". Everything's the same except for one thing: Instead of a killer tape, we're given a killer phone call. The tension is well-maintained and very atmospheric but fails to gives a really good story unlike The Ring. Takashi Miike didn't pull off a masterpiece here, neither a original scary movie. At some parts in the viewing you will probably be thinking to yourself : "This is going nowhere" and you're totally right. The plot is stuck after some times and doesn't seem to be going somewhere so you will continue watching hoping for something good to come but after waiting a bit you're given the end credits sadly. The film offers a resolution for the story but doesn't resolve it like it's suppose to do it. The end is left to the interpretation of the viewer but to me it's just that it was botched and they couldn't think of a good resolution.Now for the good points, the camera work is excellent and I loved the actors, they were excellent and gave well-acted characters. I liked the death-scenes too but the stupidity of the victims were no good to them. This movie could've been a excellent horror-thriller if it was made with a original story with something to clear up the path instead of fog to make it more difficult to understand.Average movie with good actors but no plot. If you've seen The Ring then you don't need to see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of friends are starting to get phone calls from their future selves calling from the time of their impending deaths. It's up to two people to figure out the cause of it all. Reasonably well acted, but too little too late it would seem, as the "J-Horror" fad was over just about when these films were labeled with such a burdensome title. It sadly just felt way too mainstream (oh no did I argue it being to mainstream and upset some snobby pseudo-intellectual holier than thou bohemian dunce?) and I haven't felt as unenthralled with a Takashi Miike film since Andoromedia.My Grade: C Media Blasters 2-Disc Set DVD Extras: Disc 1) Theatrical Trailer; and Trailers for "Visitor Q", "Ichi the Killer", "Deadly Outlaw Rekka", "Izo", "Fudoh", " Choking Hazard", "Hiruko the Goblin", &amp; Rojo Sangre" Disc 2) 57 minute Making of documentary; 20 minute interview with Takashi Miike; 14 minute &amp; 20 seconds of cast interviews; Alternate ending; 3 TV Spots; footage of 3 screenings; 'a day with the Mizunuma family' featurette; and TV show special</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miike goes mainstream...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard a lot of things about Miike's cinema, I've heard that his movies were so extreme, so radical, fast and furious, ultra violent... Well, those aren't my favorite characteristics in cinema but there's no doubt i was curious about this guy. So, what do I find in "Chakushin ari"? A new horror film that tries to follow the trail of "The Ring" and Hideo Nakata, with a pretty similar plot (this time instead of VHS there're cellular phones), the same look, and a little bit more of gore.It is not totally awful, but it's not the revelation of the season either. You'll have one or two good frights and nothing else.I guess I'll have to choose any other Miike's film that's more representative of his film-making because "Chakushin ari" doesn't look like something special to me.*My rate: 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe Takeshi Miikes most commercial movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>O.k., good things first: "One missed call" is scary as hell, most of the time. It has some great scares that take you on the edge of your seat and will sometimes make you jump out of it. The acting is quite good for most of the actors and the cinematography is quite impressing. Now for the bad part: the basic story is a pure rip-off of the original "Ringu". Even one or two complete scenes are "borrowed" nearly 1:1. That's why the solution to the mystery can be foretold quite early in the movie and the ending isn't much of a surprise after all... Overall "One missed call" is a good and enjoyable movie. And with it's lack of gore and it's easy to follow storyline it is for sure the most commercial movie Takeshi Miike has done so far...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lazy, derivative and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you'd never seen a movie before, Chakushin Ari (or One Missed Call) would be an astounding exercise in clever terror; but if you've ever seen a movie, or read a book about movies, or talked to anyone about movies, I can't help feeling you'd most likely see One Missed Call for what it was: an insultingly lazy, sloppy, cynical pastiche of bits shamelessly nicked from other movies.Many of which you just have to figure Miike knows you've seen and don't care. I mean, stealing half your chops from Hypnosis is one thing, cause lots of people haven't seen Hypnosis; but really, OK, you start off thinking, "no, this can't be just Ring with cellphones, nobody would be that lazy"; but more and more things happen, and the movie manages to incorporate every single stupid horror cliché from the past 20-odd years of white-person cinema, and pretty much anything you can think of that you're sick of seeing in Asian horror as well, and yet - this is almost admirable in its forthright laziness - never at any point does One Missed Call really do anything to suggest that it's NOT just trying to be Ring with cellphones.(And isn't "Ring with cellphones", really, just about the dumbest idea for a movie ever? I mean, that's like someone trying to make Psycho with a bathtub scene, isn't it?)Anyways, driving home, I realized that my initial judgment wasn't really the case anyway, as One Missed Call is also an insultingly lazy, sloppy, cynical pastiche of all the most overdone bits from horror videogames (not many of which are scary, and pretty much none of which are the least bit original anyway) and horror writing (I'm sure if you took every book with a predominantly black cover off the shelf of an airport bookstore, threw them in a blender, and tried to read the contents, they'd be either as good as or a little bit better than the script to One Missed Call).However - this is the embarrassing thing - it's still rather skillful at maintaining a palpable sense of dread. I spent most of the movie wanting to tear my hair out at the astoundingly inept/lazy/just plain useless regurgitation of every horror/thriller element ever, and yet still drove home with the lights on in the car because it'd given me the heebie-jeebies. Throughout most of the movie, I was torn between wanting things to just quit being useless already, groaning when long-haired Japanese women appeared in the corner of frame or musical stabs heralded disembodied hands popping out of nowhere to grab at the heroes (because, alright, shock and surprise me, but be aware that I, like most people, have already seen Carrie, for goodness' sake); and trying to think of the last time I'd been this unsettled and edge-of-set-being-on in a movie made by a white person. (Or, ahem, an Indian-American).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad, Sad, Sad. Go watch Juon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***** SPOILER ALERT - You have been warned!!! ***** . . . . . . . I've gotta say it. For those obsessed with Miike, they'll like the movie. But if you've seen most Japanese horror, you'll get rather miffed.1. OMC is strangely similar to Juon in style of haunting. In fact, some scenes I can see were directly ripped off from that series of films. The elevator was almost exactly the same as in Juon 1, and the closet scene was straight from the TV movie(s). As well, the haunting was a chain-of-victims instead of isolation within a certain group (leading me away from my original guess that this was a Phone remake). 2. Darkwater ripoff. BIG ripoff. The girl making the ghost peaceful by accepting fate and joining with it to be 'family'. True, this was daughter to undead ghost mom instead of the other way around. And yes, it didn't really do anything as it did with DW, but it's way too close.3. Ringu ripoff. If anyone doesn't see the ending Ringu ripoff with discovery coming late, they're blind. Don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't bad, but it was worse of a ripoff than most Ringu clones. Cinematic ally this was brilliant, but Miike sadly falls flat with this one. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as bad as expected...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I listened to this film purely to study its dialogue as an exercise in my Japanese language studies (a hobby). I was somewhat edgy, expecting my dictionary to be scared out of my hands at any moment. Instead, I encountered nothing very startling, but found that the film developed a good sense of student ambiance, and the horror elements were carefully stylistic - use of shadows, characters unseen by our heroine lurking in backgrounds, subtle bridging to more sinister music to suggest dangers ahead.Then, still early on in the film, I awoke to comic elements - the serial use of gimmickry from other horror flicks. I haven't seen many, but the references to "The Birds" and (rather obliquely) to "Psycho" were obvious, as was the straining facial indentation on a door a la Ghostbusters - and parodies aside, the classroom scene with the heroine fiddling with her cellphone while the teacher lectures is comic enough. In fact, the exaggerated omnipresence of the cellphones, wherever our characters turn, makes them seem to flock around as comically as though they were Hitchcock's birds.I'll admit I can't think of "The Birds" without imagining myself with a baseball bat whacking the poor attackers as they swoop in - something of course the characters themselves couldn't be permitted to do. And in this flick, the all too obvious mystery for the viewer is "how the director and script writer can possibly explain to us how cellphones can attack and kill..." It's a great joke! Well, given the level of absurdity, the denouement was bound to be messy. Personally, as I watched and replayed lines and looked up words and phrases, I gradually expected an "Alice"-like ending - in the style of American McGee's Alice, the fantastic PC game - i.e., our girl would wake up from her nightmares, freed from inner anguishes, and we'd learn no one but her inner demons had actually died.Well, that's not quite the ending, but for those who're interested in this genre, I'll not spoil it. All in all, it wasn't bad - pretty well made - and as said, I found myself interested in some of the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not all that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WellAn friend had comment wit me about one missed call 2, i checked the trailer seemed pretty go so i decide go for the 1 first. Since people that are reading this have read the other posts, i won't go on the "it's an Japanese horror movie so it have an grudge " and " it's not then an copy " point.This movie is pretty different and amusing cause it built psychological issues for the characters, including who kills, this give more consistency to it's story and makes it real.The story have an real nice development, and so goes on till the last minutes were it gets screwed.My only advice is "stop watching when there's 5 minutes to the end", but it's still an great movie. ^^'</fullReview>
