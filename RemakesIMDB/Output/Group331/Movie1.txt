		<shortDescription>Oh God, the horror...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awful, absolutely awful. Had free tickets, but still, I knew better. Of course, all the clichés you'd expect, dumb young adults, scares that come from someone jumping into the screen and sound effects that go "boom" simultaneously, and the build up to when suddenly the main character is the one in eminent danger. Quick cuts of "scary" images. Did I mention the "creepy" music that lets you know when the mood should be tense? Now, add to that a premise that goes beyond the bad premises of other movies in the genre. Possessed cell phones? Or is it possessed ghosts that have to travel through cell lines? Oh man. The crowd I saw it with erupted with laughter numerous times at crucial plot points. Download that game "snake" for your cellphone, it's a lot scarier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Please, if you have not seen this movie don't vote no on it just because its a bad review.This movie was so bad. It makes OK movies like The Grudge look like masterpieces. First, the one and only good thing about this movie was it built decent suspense in some parts. That being said, the pay off was horrible. We would always get some bad CGI, a copy off of something that was in another movie(1408 is a clue), or an average death that is filmed horribly just so that the movie won't be R. The character development is THE WORST I have seen in any movie, and thats including all the very low budget horror movies. The detective doesn't have a personality, he's just kind of a machine that spits out dialog. The main character is so stupid, its unbelievable. There have been unintentionally stupid characters throughout time, but none have been so stupid that I had to shake my head at them. The side characters are worse. You just remember them as hot Latin chick, guy friend, and the other friend. Of course, that means you don't care for their deaths. The plot was pretty stupid, they just shove some random crap in their so they could have an ending. When the film ends, it made me mad because they took too long to show credits, so you think something else will happen, but then the credits just roll. And if the screenwriter had a brain, he would know that cell phones aren't scary, its the idea of hearing your own death. But of course, we just have to have a cell phone in every scene, and this ruins what could be some good scares. On one last note, there was a really embarrassing scene that we're supposed to take serious, but you just laugh your head off at the stupidity. Overall, a 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this film I thought "Oh great, another 'When a stranger calls' movie". I had nothing to do so I saw it with some friends. After I watched it I probably had the biggest headache in my entire life. The dialog was hilariously awful, The characters are very unlikable, the "Jump" moments didn't even phase me. And I hated how they tried so hard to make the whole feel of the film creepy and scary(Hence the 'Scary music').It takes brains to make a good horror movie, and this one has no brains at all. It looks like were not going to be able to fight off any stupid remakes or boring horror movies anytime soon... If your looking for a good laugh or a bad headache, this film might be the one for you.2/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just one of those films based on a good film (the original is wicked), that Hollywood sees as an opportunity to remake and make a load of money off. Please do not help accomplish this ! The Japanese version was based on "what you can't see is scarier than what you can see !", and played out as a highly decent scary movie. But then came along the Americans (no offense, i'm one) which bases a movie nowadays on "how much money can we inject into explosions, shattered glass,blowing up cars,... that we won't have to pay to get decent actors ?". And voil? you get this turd of a remake. Get the Japanese version and stick to it, in it the actors at least look like teenagers, in the American version they all look over thirty. I mean come on, how dumb are we ? (or how many years in a row have they flunked class)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Positive Review (ok, middle of the road)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Facts: As of 4.27.08 the rating for this movie is 2.9 Nearly EVERY review is negative. The accusations leveled over and over are: worst movie ever, terrible, trash, stupid and the like. Here's my sad story about One Missed Call:It was a rainy Sunday afternoon (I live in Seattle) so I went to the local video store looking for a mindless movie to watch while laying about. While perusing the selections I saw IT ? not the Stephen King movie but the most vilified movie in recent memory: One Missed Call, staring at me from the shelf. I almost felt it call to me and for a fraction of a second my hand, with a mind of its own, started to reach out for it. Needless to say, I retrieved my composure and hurried away. Having read the reviews on IMDb, and so KNOWING it was something to avoid at all costs, I felt shameful and dirty at having let my guard down as I did. As I walked a little further down the aisle I spotted another movie: Reservation Road. Thank goodness! Redemption!, I thought as I picked up a copy; feeling once again like sensible individual. As I headed for the front counter, reading the back of the box, it said Reservation Road was something to the effect of being a deep, emotional story. Not exactly the mindless fare for a rainy Sunday! So, completely loosing my mind and throwing caution to the wind, I snuck back and returned the copy of Reservation Road. Then, making certain no one else was around, grabbed a copy One Missed Call. I quickly tucked THE movie under my arm so that no passers-by could read the title and know the poor decision I had just made. As I made my way to the counter, I made sure no line of happy movie renters were there so as to avoid their judging eyes. Safely at the counter, to throw-off some of my guilt, I made a joke with the clerk about how I was going to regret my selection but am a die-hard horror fan and therefore excused. He looked completely unaffected. I hurriedly paid and headed out the door with my guilty secret. Once home, I popped the disc in, settled onto my couch and readied myself for disappointment. Funny thing though: About half way through the feature I started thinking about how similar this movie was to another movie I had seen - The Ring. The Ring, when it hit the theaters and ultimately DVD, got huge, rave reviews. Strangely though, once I, personally, saw The Ring - and after all the hype - was ultimately disappointed. The Ring wasn't a bad movie, in my opinion, but it also was not deserving of all the accolades either ? again, in my opinion. So, here I am watching One Missed Call, comparing it to The Ring and now thinking the end has got to be the reason everyone is calling this a stinker. Well, I got to the end and was sitting there with furrowed brow thinking: What did I miss? Where is the movie that everyone hates so much? I don't feel ripped-off or violated. I don't even feel as if I was condescended to. What happened? I suspect this was a case of jumping on the proverbial bandwagon. I thought we had are OWN opinions and shared them, here on IMDb, honestly. I have a very hard time believing that the same demographic gave The Ring 7.3, AVP: Requiem 5.1 (which SUUUUCKED) and One Missed Call 2.9. There is a serious disturbance in the force here. I used to trust the opinions and ratings on here. Ultimately this single incident has shaken my confidence in IMDb and the people casting their votes (much like the general elections of 2000 &amp; 2004).I hope one day I will once again be able to enter IMDb with the belief that I will be able to take away from it the knowledge needed to make a sensible movie renting choice. Until then, I will have to stumble through the video store alone, unarmed and destined to fall into the crags of bad movie selections. A sad story indeed. I fear I will run out of room soon so, I'll end here. Cheers! Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm dying for a good horror movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the atrocities I've seen on the big screen, this flick just might be the worst. Combining poor story-telling, bad characters, and laughable special effects, One Missed Call is pure crap. As much as I hate to slam something with the lovely Shannyn Sossamon in it, I can't stop myself with this. Poor choice, Ms. Sossamon.The only thing the film does decently is building up suspense, and there are some intense moments. But then the pay-off is so cheesy I found myself laughing. And the story doesn't even make sense, especially with an ending that kills any possibility of reality.Horror has really seen a downfall in recent years, but this film is the worst. It seems that intelligent thrillers/horror films have completely left the market. With torture porn films like the Saw franchise taking over the marketplace, wonderful movies like 2006's The Descent are rare triumphs. I want more of those. 2/10 stars.Jay Addison</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One missed call, one stupid movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some tips on how to write a horror movie...All you need is a young hero or heroine who discovers some kind of cursed device is killing off all of their friends. The device may be anything, just as long as it's something we use everyday like a computer or something. After a group of the hero's faceless and underdeveloped friends die (The depiction of said deaths will depend on whether or not your film is PG-13 or R.), the hero must then team up with a second hero, and try to discover what's going on. After going through old files and visiting creepy old buildings that hold secrets of the past, the lead characters must discover that the cursed object is tied into some tragic past event, usually revolving around a spooky little girl. As the clock ticks down to the hero's own death, they must race to right the wrongs of the past. After the past has seemingly been corrected, the characters breathe a sigh of relief, only to discover that they were wrong, and that someone or something else is responsible for the evil.It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films, many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter, right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue, and many times the hero of the story - a college student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see, all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone, and when you play it back, you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight, until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of "accident" that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films, as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings, but you have to remember, the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG-13 rating, so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.Now, let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone, wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces, but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not, but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it, I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path, and introduces our second hero, a police detective named Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message, because his sister was a victim of it, too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse, and the clues fall right into place, leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and the like happens, and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions, and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path, I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similar-themed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake, so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a pre-determined path, and what's worse, they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in, but they're forced to act like idiots, because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here, but should you see this movie (not that I'm recommending you do), ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on, when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her, but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release, a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend, and actually consider this movie, please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom, it only causes it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, you are telling me not to receive my voice mails!! Still liked it though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge horror genre fan and this was coming on TV the other day and I thought it wouldn't hurt to give this a try, not knowing it had a rating of 3.5 here on IMDb. After watching it, I felt it was an OK movie and the plot was very interesting. This is a remake of a Japanese film. I think it would have been even more wonderful to see it in the original version. Also, seeing this film in a crowd makes it into a comedy. So, watch it alone in the dark and get creeped out.The story begins by the accidental burning up of a hospital and a little girl, along with her teddy bear, is staring forlornly towards the raging inferno. She has been rescued by the firefighters, but she doesn't say a word to them. Many people are dead due to that fire and the girl's sister is also a victim. After that, a girl drowns in her own backyard pool along with her cat. But the thing is, she didn't commit suicide as everybody thinks. Something dragged her into the water and killed her. Her cellphone starts acting weirdly then. Then the director introduces us to the main character in the film, Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon) and her friend Leann Cole (Azura Skye) who gets a weird phone call in her own future voice and the date of the call is also in the future. In that she finds out the exact time of her death and a free treat to her own freaked out voice during the death. She thinks nothing of it until she sees ghosts, ghouls, weird insects on other people and reapers all around her. Beth starts to believe in this weird 'miss call - death time' theory after she watches Leann die in front of her and phone is dialling another number in Leann's contacts after Leann is dead. She notifies the authorities about this enigma, but they dismiss her theory. Detective Jack Andrews (Edward Burns) is in homicide and his sister had also died under strange circumstances (see the drowning girl). They team up together after similarly ominous deaths happen to Beth's friends. They find a common factor among the dead and it was that they all were in the phone contacts of each other and they all had an orange candy in their mouth after their deaths. Somehow, all this is connected to the mother of the girl who was saved from the burning hospital. Can Beth save herself from the 'phone curse'? I am frankly quite shocked at this rating. Sure the film isn't great, but it isn't trash as many of you are making it out to be. Other than the fact that most of the actors who played college kids in the movie looked way older, I actually enjoyed this. And also the ending kind of bummed me out. You will see what I mean after you watch the movie. The background score was overbearing sometimes and it was like, 'here comes a scary moment, jump out of your seats!' The reason for the hauntings of the phone is quite scary actually. This film reminded me a lot of Final Destination movies, without all the cool deaths and much more fleshed out story. The acting for the most part is OK, not too great nor dumb. They could have just thrown out the mobile or not picked up the call when it rang. But, that wouldn't have made it a movie, would it? So, don't hate it for that and don't watch this with a gang of friends and you will probably enjoy this.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not deserving of such a low rating - Worth a watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that many people have given this a low rating but I believe that is mostly because many people had preconceptions before watching the movie because of the original Japanese version/origin and the fact that it was a remake. O.k granted it isn't the best movie of all time but far from the worst if you watch it as I did with an open mind and give it a chance under it's own merits. There were several parts in the movie where it does get you guessing and thinking that you know who is behind it but you may guess wrong - I know that I did, o.k it wasn't overly scary but a few moments where it does make you think now that would be freaky, you can see a few holes in the plot but then again you can with most movies.All in all worth a watch with an open mind if you don't really expect anything from it and give the movie a chance!My rating 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not very good, but it isn't nearly as bad as some reviewers here are making out. Personally i found it far more entertaining than drek like Stay Alive and Cry-Wolf, whilst tagging it the worst film of the year when the likes of Untraceable are on the market, beggars belief. Remaking Japanese horror is getting stale, if it was ever really fresh that is, so with that in mind i feel the hatred and backlash for this latest American remake has a touch of "stop remaking already". One Missed Call {Japanese original Chakushin Ari} is creepy enough, from little eerie dolls and grotesque figures to a seriously unnerving ring tone, it works as the most basic of chillers when watched alone in the dark. You will find that Final Destination and The Ring will come springing to mind as you watch this one unfold, so no great prizes for originality for sure. The acting of course is sub-standard, even Ray Wise seems to be the bread part of a camp and ham sandwich, the directing is sloppy and the ending frustrates as much as it intrigues, but the picture is creepy, and for that alone it's far more entertaining than the ream of gorno slashers that dumb the screens every other week. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes I know it's supposed to be a horror but it isn't. There are some parts that had me rolling around on the floor. Seriously, there are so many clichés and parts that make absolutely no sense. There's also parts where you think "why are they doing that?" or "why don't they just do this?" Then there's the ending which seems to think that it makes the rest of the film make perfect sense when it's just stupid. Nothing in the film adds up at all and it's just generally very inconsistent. I haven't seen the Japanese version but I heard that it's a lot better if you actually want a horror film. Otherwise, be on the look out for a guy with an umbrella at the end - priceless!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'One Missed Call' missed the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan or horror movies. I get scared by almost anything, and I will admit that once I read the plot summary for 'One Missed Call' I was intrigued. My friend and I both thought it had potential. Than I saw the trailer, and was almost as disappointed as I was I saw 'The Land Before Time 16'. I went to see this movie expecting it to be comically ridiculous, and I wasn't disappointed. If you want a good laugh, go see it. If you are frightened by a missed call on your cell phone than you may want to sleep with the lights on, otherwise you should be fine. The worst part about this movie is that it isn't quite corny enough to be considered entertaining. It simply leaves you constantly turning to the person next to you to say "What was that?" because of how childish the plot becomes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake with unsettling images, horror, tension and eerie murders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts with the strange death of Shelley(Meagan Good) after a phone call. Her friend named Cole(Azura Skye) receives a missed call with a horrible shout which sounds like her voice. Posteriorly she's attacked by a supernatural entity . Beth(Shannyn Sossamon) encounters Cole's sweetheart, Brian(Johnny Lewis) who also receives a weird call. A strange calls are causing a criminal rampage among young people. Beth befriends Det. Jack(Edward Burns) when is investigating the death her roommate(Ana Claudia Talancon), he tells her that his sister was also murdered by a call. Meanwhile a magician named Purvis (Jason Beghe)is practicing magic shows to discover the rare events , being shot by a filmmaker(Ray Wise). Beth and Jack investigate the deeds which lead to Marie Layton(Rhoda Giffiths) who allegedly abused her children.This spooky picture contains terror,shocks, suspense, grisly killings and numerous creepy scenes. The film packs terrifying and hair-raising frames and a little bit of blood and gore. Dark and shaded cinematography by Glen McPerson(Rambo, 16 blocks). The movie is regularly directed by Eric Valette(Malefique)though displays a sinister and mysterious atmosphere. While the look is suitable eerie and frightening, the argument spreads to the breaking point and the ending turns out to be a little frustrating.This is an inferior version of the classic Japanese based on novel by Akimoto and filmed in 1993 by cult director Takashi Miike. And is followed by ¨One missed call 2(2005)¨by Tsukamoto and ¨One missed call final(2006)¨ by Manabu Abou and TV series(2005).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Its Moments, But Overall A Very Poor Horror Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One Missed Call" follows a college coed named Beth (Shannyn Sossamon), whose friend, Leann (Azura Skye) dies in a freak accident after receiving a strange phone message that seems to be a recording of her death that followed two days after it was received. Not only that, but another one of Leann's friends, Shelley (Meagan Good) had a similar incident before her bizarre death. When Beth meets detective Andrews (Edward Burns), who believes there is truth to the strange events, the two team up to try and discover the source of the murderous chain of phone messages. And when Beth receives one herself, it becomes a race against time before she meets her predetermined fate as well.To get things clear in the beginning, I have not seen the original Japanese version of this film, so I cannot make a comparison between the two. However, I can say that this remake was quite a mess of a movie, regardless of whether or not the original was a good film. For one, the writing is pretty lousy. The story begins kind of all over the place before focusing on one central character, and that initial opening scare scene was flat-out ridiculous. There are dozens of plot holes scattered throughout the film, and many things that simply do not add up. It's pretty clichéd as well, relying on a never ending slew of "jump" scares to get a reaction from the audience - problem is, most of them are so much expected that few are even minorly effective. There is little to no suspense as well, and I felt this could have been a fairly suspenseful movie.The second area where the script fails is in the characters. We get their names, but that's about all. They have no depth, little personality, and are really overall bland, even the protagonists that we are supposed to be caring about. The acting was average, but I have a feeling the reason some of the performances lack is because the script was poorly written to begin with, and the performers had little to go on. Shannyn Sossamon leads the cast and does decent with what she has, as does Edward Burns, but neither are anything remarkable. The rest of the more minor characters are even more bland, and have even less to go on. Azura Skye is notable in her performance as Sossamon's friend, but she suffers from a poorly-written character as well. I also had a bit of a problem with the chemistry between the characters/the actors, because sometimes things just did not feel 'right'. There is some good to be found in this movie though, however little it may be. While some may bash it for it's PG-13 rating, I don't have a problem with that, because it's not a movie that needs to be gory to begin with. I also thought that the general premise was interesting, even though it is a remake. It's a neat idea, but the execution of it was horrible. I will give it the benefit of the doubt though when it comes to some of the visuals and images - there are a few creepy visuals in this movie, and the 'villians', for lack of a better term, were pretty spooky, as was the sinister "warning" ringtone. I thought the hospital sequence towards the end was fairly creepy - that is until we are shown a grinning monster-infant playing with a cell phone in a crib, which was not only ridiculous, but was supposed to be taken seriously. That bit ruined the good that I saw in that scene to say the least, even during that semi-scary attack by a reanimated corpse. The ending was a letdown as well, and I was really disappointed.Overall, "One Missed Call" is one of the worst horror films I've seen at the theater in awhile. The script is messy, the characters are bland, the scares are ineffective, there is little to no suspense - and the entire film felt like it was carelessly thrown together. It's a shame too, because the premise is interesting and this could have been a decent movie, but the filmmakers' execution of it was poor. Besides a few creepy visuals, I can't recommend much here. You'll probably want to skip this one, or wait till it comes to video. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bottom Has Been Scraped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many lousy horror films, the premise to "One Missed Call" isn't half bad, though perhaps a bit recycled. In this one, Leann Cole (Azura Skye) receives a strange voice-mail message: Her own voice, panicked, terrified, and screaming. Two days later, she dies in a freak accident, uttering the same words and screams that she heard on her cell phone.One by one, the members of Leann's circle of friends receive phone messages of themselves moments before death ? only to end up dying exactly as indicated. Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon) witnesses all this but can't explain it. And when her own phone rings, Beth hears her coming demise and has barely a day to discover who is placing the calls and why.Whether you liked "The Ring" or not, there was a certain novelty to it at the time. Then came "The Grudge", "Dark Water", "The Skeleton Key", and a dozen others. With "One Missed Call", Hollywood isn't just scraping the bottom of the barrel, they're turning the barrel over and seeing if any residue is clinging to the underside.Andrew Klavan wrote the screenplay, based on a Japanese novel and script. I can't speak for the quality of his source material, but Klavan does nothing to elevate the story to any level of class. If you thought the original Halloween was ridiculous for having Jamie Lee Curtis run upstairs(!) and hide in a closet(!) to escape her supernatural stalker, then Beth's foray into a hospital's air ducts will have you groaning in sheer disdain.The acting is decidedly poor. But it's not the kind of lousy acting that speaks ill of the performers. Instead, it feels like director Eric Valette actually requested the delivery we see on-screen. It may have something to do with the fact that Valette is a native Frenchman, that his last film job was six years before, and that "One Missed Call" is his American debut. He's reaching across cultural and linguistic borders for the first time, and it shows.But there's a bigger problem running through the entire film.Every film creates its own universe. Some are worlds just like ours, some are complete fantasies. But all of them must create rules of operation, including how the spiritual elements function. Even if the audience isn't aware of the rules, the writer and director must have them in mind."One Missed Call" creates rules, and then inexplicably ignores them at random. For example, as the victims each get closer to death, they begin seeing strange apparitions. These apparitions are the same every time, and are actually clues to what is going on. But when one character dies in a Catholic church, in addition to the apparitions she also sees the icons of Mary and the Apostles begin distorting into gruesome figures. It may be a cool visual effect, but it breaks the rules and has nothing to do with anything before or after.That same death illustrates another violation. All the previous deaths have been made to look like freak accidents, but the girl in the church is visibly strangled by a ghostly figure.I would suggest the rule-breaking is because the director cared more about cool shots, cheap scares, and phony tension. Our evil spirit moves quickly behind frightened characters, heard only because the sound crew puts in an overused "whhht!" to get us to jump. But the spirit proves that it does not need to materialize at all in order to stalk and kill, so why bother whhht-ing around the place? And if time and space are no obstacle, why travel through the cell phone at all? Why bother warning people they are about to die? And why do all of Beth's friends get two days' warning when Beth only gets one? Why drag the apparitions into it? Why list one of the stars as Ed Burns in the opening credits, and Edward Burns in the end credits? ? If they can't even get the credits congruent; what hope do we have of anything in between being any good? Instead of playing out the basic premise with care and consistency, Valette and Klavan mash various creepy ideas into the story until what's left horrifies us only because of its sheer stupidity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Unnecessary Remake of an Asian Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the death of their friend Shelley (Meagan Good), the teenager Leann Cole (Azura Skye) receives a voice mail from the future telling the date and time when she would die. On the scheduled day, Leann sees weird things and in the precise informed hour, Leann is attacked by a supernatural force on a footbridge over a train station while talking to her friend Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon) that witnesses her violent death. Beth meets Leann's boyfriend Brian (Johnny Lewis), who also received a call, and witnesses his death on the street. When her roommate Taylor Anthony (Ana Claudia Talancón) receives a call, Beth befriends Det. Jack Andrews (Ed Burns), who tells her that his sister was the first victim of the phone call. They decide to investigate the connections of Jack's sister and find the name of Marie Layton (Rhoda Griffis), who apparently abused of her daughters. Jack and Beth run against time trying to save Beth from her fate."One Missed Call" is another unnecessary remake of an Asian horror movie. However, like in the original "Chakushin Ari", this remake has a promising beginning and a disappointing conclusion. My expectation was that the screenplay writer could improve the confused conclusion of "Chakushin Ari", but he basically kept the same. Anyway this movie is not as bad as indicated in IMDb User Rating. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Uma Chamada Perdida" ("One Missed Call")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you and your friends enjoy insanely laughing your heads off at cheesy horror flicks, One Missed Call is your film.It is very hard to refrain from erupting with laughter during crucial plot points, yet the plot is so full of holes it is hard to help yourself.The back story to the main point of the "Killer Cell Phone" is even more ridiculous than the killer messages themselves.Also, one of the best lines that had the entire theatre (all 10 of us) rolling on the floor laughing was Beth's line of, "Maybe her spirit never left the hospital, what if she's still there traveling through the phones...(low whisper so the cab driver won't think she's nuts) attacking people!!!"I laughed so hard I cried.Awful movie, great laugh</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good horror movie rated PG-13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I had first gone to see One Missed Call I didn't think it would be that good. I didn't think it would be all that good because I don't like movies like The grudge and The Ring. I had also kept hearing bad things about it. It turned out to be a very good horror movie. I thought that it kept me on the edge of my seat. It also had some great sudden scares. Some of the faces and weird ghost looking people were also pretty scary as well. For a pg-13 movie this was actually pretty scary. I don't get why people keep making fun of this movie. It was 10 times better than any of those movies like grudge or the ring. This movies story line was a little bit stupid but found a way to make it's way up toward the end. You end up finding out a lot more at the end, and why people were getting phone calls from dead people. The ending to this movie was really bad though. I think that it kind of dragged on toward the end. The visuals in this movie were pretty cool as well. the movie could have easily been solved by just not picking up your cell phone to see your new voicemails or by throwing your cell phone away. I did like a couple of the actors in it which helped out the movie for me. One of the good actors in it was Edward Burns, he played a great role. He played a detective who is trying to save a girl and her friends from the things that are killing them. The other awesome actor was Shannyn Sossamon who played the girl that was trying to protect all of her friends and stop the phone calls. It was so intense every time you saw that someone had a new voicemail it makes you wonder right away can they fight it and survive. This was a remake of the old One Missed Call which was a japan movie. This was a good remake and should be checked out if you like creepy edge of your seat horror movies. Overall this movie would get a 8 out of 10 rating. Go see it I think that you will enjoy this one more than some of those other dumb movies that have been out. Such as The Grudge and The Ring which are just flat out not even worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the movie first started out, I thought it'd honestly be the dumbest movie I've ever seen. As I started watching, I had mixed feelings. It was rushed in the beginning (I mean, almost three people died within the first thirty minute time period), and then when it got to the middle, it was so slow and stretched out. Then, towards the ending, it was so fast I couldn't even blink without missing a very big piece of information. The ending had everyone in a fit. Is there going to be a second one was the most commonly thought question, I can bet you. Also, the movie seems so much like another movie I've seen before. I can't recall the name but it was so similar that I thought I'd already seen it before. All in all, however, it was a nice thriller, keeps you on the edge of your seat. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Missed Call does not deserve a 2.8 rating, - it just doesn't. I think most people had an opinion of this movie before they even seen it. Most likely because it was simply "another Japanese remake", but that's unfair. If One Missed Call had been released before, lets say "The Ring" - the movie would have had a higher rating - and better reviews. But because we have had "The Ring", "The Ring 2 ", "The Grudge", "The Grudge 2", "Pulse", etc.. (to name a few) people think they know what the're already gonna get from the film. I mean, I'm not gonna lie and say One Missed Call is really a lot different from those movies - cause it's not. But that doesn't mean to say it's not good or entertaining. I think If you get passed the whole Japanese thing - you will enjoy the movie for sure. The thing I like about these certain movies is, there is a lot of great suspense. There's no heads, legs, arms flying everywhere - it's better than that. These so called Hollywood "creators" now think a horror film can only be a horror if there is blood &amp; guts splattered everywhere. That's not true. A great horror has great suspense, and One Missed Call delivers just that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prior to going to see this movie, my aunt and I had read several reviews bashing it. So, we went into the movie with considerably low expectations, which may be the reason why it managed to exceed them. Yes, the acting was mediocre, the effects were somewhat cheesy and we were left confused at times. But for what it was, it was actually pretty good. The nice thing about the movie is that aside from 5 or 6 inappropriate words, it is surprisingly fairly decent for pre-teens. There was no nudity or sex, just a little kissing. Another plus is that the detective is very pleasant to look at ;) Hardcore horror flick lovers probably wouldn't enjoy One Missed Call, but if you're just looking for a fun one to squeal through, this is it. It'd be great at a pre-teen/teenage(or older) Halloween sleepover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense, Atmospheric Chiller About Haunted Cell Phones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, cell phones don't kill people in the creepy new supernatural nail-biter "One Missed Call." Instead, a vengeful ghost with a cell phone kills people. French director Eric Valette, who helmed the 2002 occult chiller "Maléfique," makes his English-language film debut and shows strong visual flair with otherwise formulaic subject matter. Teaming up with scenarist Andrew Klavan, who penned the 1990 black comedy "A Shock to the System," Valette and he conjure up a veritable buffet of chills in their atmospheric, above-average rendition of Takashi Mike's scary 2003 Japanese ghoulfest "Chakushin Ari." The original Asian horror film?tame by Takashi Mike standards--ranks only a notch or two above Valette's sturdy remake. Valette's remake wraps things up about 30 minutes faster than Mike's original. A chilling cinematic experience in its own right, "One Missed Call" (*** out of ****) will give you more than enough goose bumps and make you dread the prospect of checking your cell phone voice-mail. Essentially, "One Missed Call" amounts to another of those damsels-in-distress epics, with Angelina Jolie look-a-like Shannyn Sossamon cringing as cell phones chime the same ringtone of death and the corpses stack up. "One Missed Call" opens with a great 'gotcha' moment. African-American babe Shelly (Meagan Good of "D.E.B.S.") and her pet cat are relaxing in their backyard near a Japanese-style, goldfish pond when something stirs up the water. Inquisitive Shelly leans over the tranquil waters to see what is creating the disturbance. WHAM! She's toast! The kitty meows. WHAM! It's gone! Everything has to do with Shelly's cell phone. Like her friends Taylor (Ana Claudia Talancón of "Fast Food Nation"), Leann (Drew Barrymore look-a-like Azura Skye of "28 Days") and Brian (Johnny Lewis of "Underclassman"), Shelly received a voice-mail message that recorded the time of her impending death in the future. Grief-stricken Norton University psychology student Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon of "A Knight's Tale") finds herself up to her neck in dead bodies when she crosses paths with Detective Jack Andrews (Edward Burns of "Saving Private Ryan") who noses around the same crime scenes. Jack's sister, it seems, died under mysterious circumstances involving a cell phone. He discovered a red candy jaw-breaker in her mouth identical to similar candy extracted from the gullets of the other victims. Predictably, Beth demands that Jack let her accompany him on this occult outing. Things take a nasty turn in the last quarter-hour, and the conclusion leaves the film open to an inevitable sequel. Over the years, the cell phone has become the one virtually indispensable electronic gadget that everybody owns, so it was inevitable that horror movie makers would exploit this vulnerability with a haunted cell phone movie. In its weaker moments, "One Missed Call" imitates the "Final Destination" movies when the victims die. After a victim receives their voice-mail death message, they begin to hallucinate and see grey-face ghouls. "One Missed Call" qualifies as the kind of PG-13 rated suspense saga that scares the wits out of you rather than gross you out with gore.</fullReview>

Not helped by a bad child actor in a hoodie and a poorly written revelation.Margaret Cho must've been hard up for a job with her two lines of dialog.Rated PG13 but I wouldn't let any thirteen year old of mine watch it unless I was a sadist who enjoyed the thought of them having nightmares for the next six months. Then again, it's not gory enough to be adult horror. It just sort of falls between the cracks.It would be nice to see a non-formulaic, well scripted, well acted horror with a satisfactory ending but then we would be talking about another film.

		<fullReview>One Missed Call tells of scary cellphone messages which young people receive from themselves in the future, foretelling their own deaths: one potential victim and a police officer are engaged in a race against time to discover the hidden story which make raise the curse.This derivative story (huge chunks of Final Destination and The Ring) has come in for some criticism of the "worst film I have ever seen" variety - it isn't. There are some very, very bad films out there, and this is not one of them: it is competently and professionally made from a technical point of view.From an artistic point of view, there is not a single surprise in this derivative and somewhat risible tale, and what little horror there is has been dialled down for certification purposes. There is a tolerable sense of mounting menace, and some creepy bits in the background, but this film doesn't really do very much more than pass the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not THAT bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone is being really hard on this movie. I just finished watching it now and I thought it was actually pretty creepy. I was really into it until the ending, which... to say the least... I didn't really understand. I thought first that the curse was stopped because Jack was killed instead of Beth, and then I watched the mom save Beth from Ellie, but then the phone rings again... ??? So that definitely confuses me. That seems to be a fate for too many a movie: great story, good characters, and then a lackluster ending. It ends everything on a sour note. To my standards, the film was scary. I will admit that I am not a horror buff, but I still know creepy when I see it. I will say that the visual effects are amazing- they did SO well with the CGI. It is a good movie to watch with friends when you're searching for entertainment, but it's probably not a movie I will watch again for a long while. I didn't find it to be lame or "funny" at all, though I can see where the other critics are coming from, but I believe it's all based on your perspective and individual taste. All-in-all, this movie was creepy entertainment; a good thriller. I gave it 7/10 stars because it wasn't THAT bad at all. Watch it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Missed Call, Yeah..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts off with a clue to keep you interested the whole time, when i say interested i don't mean very eager..Throughout the film, young characters get a mysterious phone call that plays by a ringtone that isn't there's, the same ringtone that plays on each characters phone when they are going to die. The phone is yet never answered, and a voicemail is left. That voicemail is the audio of how each character dies, and it's left on the date and time that they die. Got to hand it to the writers, I don't think that's been done before.So by the end of the movie it's the main character that's the last one to die, and the only person that believes her is an investigator that is determined not to let the deaths continue, and the only way you'll find out what happens is by watching it ;) There isn't really much gore, in fact for some of the things that happen there's basically nothing. Don't watch this expecting an amazing horror because it really isn't, the suspense isn't much good and the story line isn't great. But there's still a pretty good plot twist that you never really saw coming.Enjoy :)</fullReview>

What was interesting is how they did the time,, like for instance when someone gets a call on their cell phone,it's like 2 days later and they are going to be dead, they hear their friends last screams and such,, then they have to go back and like try to save them,, something like that. Yeah the movie is kinda confusing,, there are some issues in the movie like child abuse,, which is a turnoff. this is better than some of the horror movies out there, but there are better ones than this,, i didn't find it too bad,, just a little weird i guess, you know ghosts that travel through you're cell phone,, a little hard to swallow if you ask me..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie hoping that it would be unlike other movies I've seen. Unfortunately, I was wrong. It's supposed to be a remake of a Japanese film called Chakusin Ari, but it was WAY too similar The Ring movies. Phone calls mysteriously lead to peoples deaths. A young woman investigates, gets one of these calls, yet she survives. Why? because she solves the mystery. Hoping not to give too much away, the end result for these phone calls is pretty much the same reason for the calls people received in The Ring, but with out the need for a video to watch. Being reminded so much of The Ring movies, I was disappointed by this movie, but was entertained by it none the less. The movie is decent, but it leaves much room for improvement. As long as you're not expecting a meaningful story line or deep insights into why what's happening is happening, it can be entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Asian remake almost gets it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Japanese version was somewhat of a classic. I was surprised with how well a lot of it translated over for the first half of the movie (though the opening scene was pretty worthless). The idea is simple - you get a phone call with a ring tone more annoying than the stock one you hear in the theaters, it comes from the future and you hear yourself die.There seem to be two camps of reviewers - purists who can't stand any deviation from the originals, and those who have never seen the originals and are not used to the complexities that J-Horror usually throws in.Many of the reviews have commented about jump scenes, etc. I'm not sure what they are expecting - this is a horror movie. The idea is to try and scare. They may be somewhat cliché, but they have been in the movies for 30+ years now. Perhaps we are too used to masked maniacs running around chasing people, or too used to the killer always ending up to be someone the main character knows.This is a Onry&#x14d; type J-horror story - ghosts out for revenge. So was The Ring and The Grudge...of course there will be similarities. It's all based on the centuries old source material, just with a twist here and there.The real problem with this is two-fold: First the acting was pretty much bland and (pardon this, but) phoned in :) To me, the girl playing Taylor did the best of the whole film. This made it kinda hard to watch...you just didn't seem to care too much about the characters.The other problem is how dumbed down the ending was compared to the original. The original ending wasn't that hard to follow, and this seemed that they had to show what cool fx they could do. Still, they did come up with a plausible ending that at least made sense - mostly.However, as a whole they did a fairly decent job translating the story over and kept most of the key elements. A little more emotion from the leads could have made this much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time I am writing this review, the score for the movie stands on 2.6. This fact made me almost not watch the movie. I'm glad I decided to do so anyway, since it is a pretty nice movie.Don't get me wrong, it's not gonna win any award anytime soon, and the original Japanese version is MUCH BETTER, but still it is pretty enjoyable. It features an almost generic new age horror Japanese remake plot, but so does a lot of other films (such as The Grudge, The ring and etc.), but delivers it nicely. A solid cast, good directing and a nicely evolving plot leads to a pretty standard horror/suspense movie, but one that doesn't fall in comparison to its rivals.To conclude, if you like the horror genre, then you should see this movie if only to mark it as seen. But if you're not a big fan of horror movies, feel free to skip this one.</fullReview>

The story had some flaws and clichés but still it kept me on the edge of my seat, it also had some gross scenes for example slimy bugs in a jar and and appearing on someones hand, they must know that gross is not scary. Some moments in the film made me jump but most of them left me disappointed. The story had suspense and nice mysteries.But when it comes to the acting, the main actors fail to deliver. (Edward Burns) Who is a good actor did not do well. (Shannyen Sossamen) , did better than Edrward Burns but not so great.Overall the film has some good moments and some horride moments so all I can say it's was a good popcorn flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything that was great in the original (Japanese) version is diminished in this remake. I have read in the trivia on this site that the director has not seen the original and that he even asked the actors not to watch. He better could have,because than he would have learned to make a good horror movie. What always has been great in Japanese horror movie is the atmosphere. And building up the tension slowly. It's not what you see that scares us,it is what we can't see that makes us shiver. The original was full of this ambiance and tension. And when you finally saw things you were really creeped out. This remake is full of flash,sounds and effects that are ultimately not creepy or scary. The background story to this remake in essence is the same. But Takashi made so much more sense of it that it even added to the creepiness. I don't know what the director of this remake was thinking but it is obvious that Eric Valette lacks the experience to deliver a decent horror movie. And why did he change the ringtone. It plays such an important part in the movie. So you better have a good reason to change it. I really wanted to give this movie a chance. But it is so bad that there is no way to support it. Go watch the original and see how it has to be done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie is gonna suck but it turns out OK. I saw the original by the way and i actually like both. This is not the first time an Hollywood remake of Asian Horror meeting harsh remake. I kinda think it is not because of the movie itself it is more of a culture difference that makes a plot so successful in eastern Asian sink in western theater. For example, most Asians likes to have a little believe or respect for the dead, we are more inclined to think some sort of supernatural phenomenon could exist and we are super buying the setting of lonely pretty girl in dark places hunted by supernatural monsters. Also, we like to be challenged by the plot, if you sit through the original, you would spend 1 hour nonstop guess what is going on and in the last 30 minuets all thread is picked out and arranged and the final hit came. It is amazing and we super love that. For western movie goers they would pretty a horror movie to be specified clear and easy to follow, they don't really want to guess and figure out what is it all about. Such plot would somehow pisses some of them off. I think if you are of the western taste, never go to theater for Asian remake or original cuz you are not going to enjoy it why spend money on something you cannot really appreciate.</fullReview>

That's right ? it makes no sense whatsoever."One Missed Call" is a perfect example of a cinematic experience that is essentially equivalent to eating a burger at Micky D's. It's low quality, stale, soggy, and loaded with unnecessary condiments. Yes, all of the clichés are here. Within 5 minutes we're introduced to a group of immature college kids talking about sex, which seems to be THE obligatory cliché in American horror films (going back decades). I think it's time to move on to different types of characters. There are also loads of "false" jump scares. Overuse of jump scares is bad enough (being an inherently cheap tactic), but overuse of "false" jump scares is even worse, because "false" jump scares are used when no real danger exists. That happens a lot in "One Missed Call", as Sossamon gets shocked by her friends throughout the entire film. At one point Ed Burns scares her stiff with an asthma inhaler ? I kid you not.Now, some badly made films are boring to watch, but this one has some gut-busting scenes that are totally laughable. It starts off with a funny cat killing (why would a ghost kill a cat?), but the most hilarious moment occurs when a television evangelist attempts to exorcise a cell phone. He even goes so far as to say, "Spiritual energy exists in the same electromagnetic spectrum as light or microwaves. It's no surprise it can travel through cellular phones. And it grows there." I was practically on the floor. Then there are the riotous ghouls that hang around the city and smile at the protagonists while going about their business with construction work or walking in the rain. This is the kind of unintentional comedy that Hollywood horror has produced consistently over the past few decades.Which brings me to the ultimate point of this review: this is the kind of movie you get when you restrict yourself solely to English language films. Sure, there are some really bad non-English horror movies out there, but the success percentages are way better outside of the western hemisphere. If you insist on ignoring all of these non-English movies, it's a simple fact that you're severely limiting your cinematic enjoyment. There's no logical reason whatsoever for torturing yourself with horror movies from Hollywood, unless you're a masochist.Even worse, you'll start deluding yourself into thinking that "horror is dead." Only in a world of illiterate lemmings can a statement this dreadfully wrong and ignorant be feigned. My friend, the horror genre is perhaps at its highest point in its entire history. In fact, it's at a higher point than any genre of film in the world. (See my user profile for a supporting list.) Then again, if you choose to be an ignorant xenophobe and refuse to watch films with subtitles, how the hell are you ever going to know that movies like "REC" (2007), "Kontroll" (2003), "Diary" (2006), and "Noroi: The Curse" (2005) exist? That's right ? you won't. What a miserable cinematic existence you must have.If that weren't pathetic enough, you'll eventually lower your standards to the point where badly made tripe like "Hostel" (2005), "The Hills Have Eyes" (2006), and "Rob Zombie's Halloween" (2007) no longer seem so awful. In fact, you might become so hopelessly desperate and disillusioned that you may begin to actually enjoy them. Welcome to the horrific world of xenoglossophobia (the fear of foreign languages), where American horror movies don't seem all that bad because there's really nothing of adequate quality to compare them to. Heck, a Wendy's hamburger looks great compared to a Big Mac, but neither is even remotely close to a tenderloin. You'll never know any better if you're scared of utensils.So let me get this straight. You flock like a sheep to see this movie instead of renting a DVD of "High Tension" (2003) or "In A Glass Cage" (1987) because you "read books, not movies"? Ooh, how clever of you. Let me guess, you'll end up watching "Quarantine", the "Shutter" remake, and "The Eye" remake to spare yourself all of that additional "effort." Would you like a bib and a change of diapers too? Listen, it's incredibly easy to read subtitles. All you need to do is find a few enjoyable movies and you won't even notice that you're reading subs anymore because it becomes a natural reflex (like breathing). I'm so sick and tired of hearing people trash horror movies just because they've self-imposed completely illogical limitations on their viewing experiences. You poor souls. I fear when thinking that the future of planet Earth is in the hands of closed-minded people like yourselves.Ask yourself this: Why live by the motto "I read books, not movies" when it's so much more rewarding to live by the motto "I watch good movies, not bad ones"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be exciting and thrilling. I like the fact that it wasn't real violent or gory, but at the same time some of the killings were horrifying. It has a great story line that keeps the characters wrapped up in a mystery until the end. It about a spirit that moves through the phone line and causes a group of college students to die in bizarre accidents. The main girl teams up with a detective to uncover the truth behind her friends deaths. It did remind of a few movies that compare to it, such as The Ring and Fear Dot Com. The actors Shannyn Sossamon, Edward Burns, Ana Claudia Talancon and Meagan Good made this film worth watching, so definitely check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Wasn't THAT Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, this movie wasn't as bad as everyone seems to say it is. I mean it's definitely not going to win any Oscars or be remembered as a landmark horror film, but at the same time, it doesn't deserve the 3.0 rating that it's gotten. I thought it was an average yet enjoyable j-horror flick. Like most of them, there were a few jumps, a modern technology that transmitted evil, and a back-story with a twist that the main characters have to try to work out.I think it really comes down to both a) what scares you and b) how much you want a movie to scare you. Some people are scared more by serial killer/slasher pics while other by supernatural ones. Also, some people want to be really scared and gored out while others just want a few thrills but not be scared so bad that they can't sleep for the next three days.True, there's not a lot of gore and isn't very explicit, but what do you expect? It's PG-13. I mean you knew that going in, right?Even though in general, I liked the film, there was one scene, I have to say, that was very unfortunate and cheesy. It's the one with the baby and cell phone in the hospital. It's too bad the director had that in the movie at all, since I don't think it worked out the way he had intended. Other than that go see it if you liked "Grudge" or "Pulse".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know what is scary. It's an instinct, secured within our psyche, as much a part of being human as conversing with your peers or having the ability to walk erect. Fear is not something you can easily turn off, and not something you can control. So it is beyond me how so many horror movies are not scary. It is simply a matter of showing us what we fear on screen. The Blair Witch Project showed us nothing and it was terrifying. The occasional misfire is expected in cinema, and it is to be forgiven. But no other genre has so many dead ends as does that of horror. And the only thing worse than an un-scary horror film is a remake that results in one.There is not much more pedestrian than a remake and today they are too many to count. I'm sure it's possible but such drudgeries are not worthy of my time. Even more disturbing is the endless stream of Asian horror remakes starting, to my recollection at least, with The Ring, which is a moody and effective film and not since then has its success been matched. It seems Asian horror cinema has a thing for terror spawning from technology. I suppose that this movement as a whole could be an allusion to the hatred and destruction spawned by modern machinery and how, one day mankind will fall victim to their own creations. Unfortunately for the viewer, One Missed Call offers us nothing nearly as deep and subversive as that, it instead descends into pure camp; and not the good kind.The premise is simple enough; you receive a voicemail message that turns out to be that of your own death and then within a few days you die; the curse then spreads to the next unsuspecting technological patron. We join a group of twenty-something's living their life, going to school and work, totally unsuspecting of the cell phone signal from hell that is about to befall them!!! It all begins when one of the young women drowns and people naturally suspect suicide as prior to her accident she was becoming increasingly psychotic. After her death, the phenomenon begins to spread throughout the group, until Beth played by the beautiful Shannon Sossamon, who unfortunately takes this role nowhere, decides to investigate before she becomes next. She teams up with a detective (Edward Burns) whose sister is a victim of the same sinister event and together the two try to track down the truth.The movie up to this point is adequate, and director Eric Valette gives us some frightening images to ponder as the plot grows thicker. In fact, thicker is a huge understatement. Towards the end of the film, there are so many confusing elements and unnecessary and lame twists it simply collapses on itself. The climax is so unbelievable dumb and devoid of tension, you can't help but laugh. (Especially at the sight of a ghostly baby holding a cell phone) There is absolutely no continuity to the spirits power and absolutely no insight into why or how it is doing what it is doing. A simple explanation, instead of the packed in subplots and "big-reveals" would have made this movie much more tolerable.Another glaring folly this movie heaps onto the already large stack, is the fact that after about the third death in the group, you would think somebody other then Beth and Det. Andrews would be proactive. Instead they cry and whimper and wait around to die, making sure they say the exact same things they heard themselves say in the voicemail as they perish. I hate to keep saying, "oh and another thing" but this is the type of movie where it is warranted; thusly another thing is that at some point, it would be intelligent to assume someone might suggest tossing away their phones and taking a vacation in a cabin or the like, instead of just hoping it would not ring. The cops are as smart as a bag of wet doorknobs and take no interest of the sharp spike in grisly teenage deaths amounting throughout the week. You half except J.W. Pepper from Live and Let Die to waltz in, throw down his spittoon and start cracking wise.One has to wonder, honestly, if this fad of remakes and sequels will ever stop. If at one point they will all just sit down and ask themselves, what are they are doing to cinema? All I really have left to say about this movie is that although I have already had to bath in its disastrous glow, it was one missed opportunity, one missed mark and one you should miss yourself.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this with the missus tonight, even after i saw the 2.6/10 on here i thought id give the film a shot, and I'm glad i did.2.6 for this film is really harsh. Granted it does have a few moments with poorly acted dialogue and its very predictable. But the atmosphere in my opinion is very good, even when you know something is coming with the music build up, it still made me jump a few times and there's some pretty creepy stuff happening throughout. It's similar to the jumps and scares in the Grudge and other Japanese horrors.In the end it is a typical jump scare movies with a different approach. It is predictable, it has poor moments, the haunted phone thing really isn't as bad as it seems and the ringtone is awesome.Overall 7/10 "Good". Worth the watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was and odd movie. It seems like movie makers think that the weirder they make a movie, the more you will like it. If this were the case, then you will LOVE this movie. It contains elements of such films as The Grudge and Final Destination. The movie basically consists of people getting a phone call. When they check it, they find it dated from a little bit in the future, and they hear themselves say something right before they die. Sure enough, it comes true. When other characters start investigating it, they find some kind of ghostly and other-worldly explanation.I thought the movie was fairly suspenseful and good considering the subject material and storyline/plot. It will please you if you like this sort of movie. Fortunately, it had a minimal amount of blood and gore in it. Too much of that (which I'm sure they were tempted to use and rely on) could have ruined it. I'm glad they didn't.** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: One Missed Call</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Missed Call gets filed amongst Hollywood Remakes of Japanese Horror that shouldn't have been green lighted in the first place. I suppose with the likes of so many of such remakes, the supposed winning formula would be to adopt the story, slap some relatively known actors in it, and employ every trick in the Hollywood horror book, and expect the box offices to go ka-ching! Wrong! One Missed Call happens to be One Big Bore!I am beginning to affirm that horror remakes by Hollywood are a waste of time. What made the Asian ones work, is because of a certain X-factor appeal in them, pertaining to the building of atmospheric mood, which plays a key role in maintaining tension, and some really ingenious and innovative ways of exposing the ghoul for a good scare. Hollywood instead dives straight into such scenes with so much noise, even the ghoul would have run away. It doesn't mean that with a bigger budget and better special effects, it's an automatic triumphing over the relatively lower key originals. They work for a reason, and more money being thrown at it, is just not the answer.I am curious to know how Edward Burns would have truly thought about his role here, as well as the storyline. A filmmaker himself, I guess he needed to pay the bills and perhaps fund his own projects too. I had enjoyed his performance in 15 Minutes and Confidence, not masterpieces but at least a tad enjoyable, and while he has the occasional dud like A Sound of Thunder, I thought his role here as a generic cop, really took the cake. It's just so lazy a character, he got slapped into the thick of things in pure coincidental fashion, and not to mention just going through the motions of it all, looking concerned most of the time, and being cut out of the action for the most parts too conveniently.Shannyn Sossamon probably had everyone take notice with her lead female role in A Knight's Tale, alongside Heath Ledger and Paul Bettany. While her male co-stars went on to bigger and better roles, she got perpetually stuck with unremarkable ones, and with turkeys such as this. In true Final Destination style, her friends around her start dying after she hears their missed call/voice messages, which contains their last utterances on Earth, before their untimely demise, the exact moment all coldly printed on the LCD screen of their mobile phone. Even the deaths too seem uninventive, and so bad I would've settled for a simple knife stabbing just to get over it.And the supporting characters? Don't bother. Too many one dimensional roles here which calls for half exposed cleavage to spice things up a little and hold the attention of pimply boys it hopes to target in the audience. I tell you, one more of this demonic kid nonsense, and that's it, it get a stamp of rejection. What's with demonic kids? Can we get over this group already? Can we move on from crazed children who probably needed a good spanking to slap the devil out of them? And move on too from the creaking doors, insipid light and shadow play, sudden crescendos in the soundtrack, and cheap shots passing off as "ingenious" ways to scare the audience. It's boring when it doesn't get done right, and comes off as lackadaisical.But what's truly scary, would be you downloading from somewhere, the ring tone that is featured in the movie, and into your friends mobile phone. It's now synonymous with impeding doom and death, so if you want to wish someone ill-will, then this is your ringtone of choice. If I can create a ringtone and make money out of it, then this is the one to create, right now before the fad dies off.One missed call? Don't return the call please, and delete it from your phone records. For good. Skip it and don't bother with the rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay so, first of all, I don't get the hate for this movie. It wasn't awful and it wasn't perfect. Everyone knew what to expect from a movie like this, especially if they've seen The Ring or The Grudge. To me, One Missed Call was far better than Pulse, I didn't like The Ring and The Grudge just got boring.The atmosphere of this movie was great, though the CGI and special effects of this film could use some touch up work. The centipedes looked far too fake to even be considered real. The ghosts, such as the mouth eye ghost seen above, were well done and most of all creepy.The characters aren't all too memorable in a way this is Final Destination meets The Ring or The Grudge. Only change the Premonition plane crash or the watch the video and die in seven days to a creepy cell phone call(with a creepy, yet satisfyingly catchy tune) and you've got One Missed Call. Beth was a pretty good character though at times you didn't really know what to expect of her. At some times she's the calm heroic female and other times she's a bitchy "Don't mess with me!" girl.Edward Burns played a good character and definitely one of the more memorable one from the group. Though his character's profession seems to make you think he has a lack of business going around the office.The other characters aren't too mentionable, like I said, it's a lot like Final Destination so only certain characters get the special attention they deserve. The deaths aren't all that exciting nor would I expect them to be with a PG-13 rating. Though with the lack of bloody or memorable deaths or really good dialogue in between them, there are incredible tension and suspense leading up to them that makes this film get the attention it deserves.So in the end, the movie was great and I got what I wanted and expected from it. Entertainment. The movie has great entertainer for a night with friends and will probably one of the funnest popcorn flicks you'll have in a while.8/10</fullReview>

Speaking of Asian films if Hollywood tries to redo Battle Royale, I quit. They'll ruin a good film. Luckily I used to work at a movie theater so I was able to see this for free and didn't waste ten bucks on it, I did however, waste two hours of my time I could have spent watching something good. Who puts together a film like this? Honestly!

		<shortDescription>Average Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never knew this was a remake to begin when I first picked it up. It was only until I found &amp; bought One Missed Call 2, (Thinking it was the sequel to this remake) I realised that this was a remake of the Japanese film except for it's sequels.I read that this remake borrowed elements from other films like The Ring &amp; Final Destination. Which is what this remake was heavily criticised for. Though me, I actually liked it as it combines a good couple of my favourite films together.The films story is about a group of teens who are haunted by creepy voices from a mobile phone ring tone which apparently fore shadows their deaths once it calls them. They then get killed off 1 by 1 as the main heroine &amp; a police detective (whose sister suffered the same fate by drowning in a garden pond years before) try to piece together the mystery. I personally didn't think the film was that bad being honest. I don't think it to be one of the worst films ever made as I myself have seen a lot lot worse! I even don't think this justifies a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes either. But then it wasn't the best or the greatest I'd seen. It had some unique kills &amp; a creepy gloomy atmosphere about it &amp; I did like the nods to other films like Final Destination (which I think is ace!) &amp; The Ring (which is creepy as!). It was sort of bloody here &amp; there. Not to my standards but the film wasn't a disappointment &amp; sort of made up for that. It was like I said above, creepy &amp; had an unnerving vibe as you started to watch.I did however get a bit lost at points as I was getting confused with what was going on. There were a few points I noticed this in the film especially the end which wasn't all that a great of a finale, but it was crap &amp; isn't as bad as a lot of easily disappointed people make out to be. I would overall give this a average 6/10. I did like the borrowed elements from other films which to me is a great technique in film making as you combine lots of great film concepts into 1. Though I did get lot at points &amp; a good couple of scenes did leave me with wondering what was going on, but it wasn't a bad film &amp; not a disappointment either.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1h27m of pure cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone related horror movie? Where have we seen this before? In order of theatrical release: Halloween (1978), When a Stranger Calls (1979), 976-Evil (1988), Scream (1996), When a Stranger Calls (again) (2006), End Call (2008), etc. Also, Stephen King's Cell, which had not yet been released as a film when One Missed Call had come out, but had existed as a novel for a few years prior.This movie is just one big, walking cliché. Not only did it piece together its very well overdone plot line from elements of all of the aforementioned films, but it also took pieces from semi-supernatural movies like any of the Final Destination movies. The acting of all of the teens in the movie was ridiculous and their dialogue sounded like it was coming from a high schooler's drama class presentation. All of the sound effects and music were supposed to add to the "creepy vibe" that the director was so clearly trying to shove down the viewers' throats, but failed at doing so because of the obvious lack of funds (or lack of effort) put into making them even slightly eerie. Despite all this, the movie looked really nice. The cinematography, settings, staging, and the appearance of the actors were all really well done. This isn't exactly super realistic, so it seems that that's part of the reason why the whole movie was entirely lacking in immersion, but at least it was nice to look at. Movies like this are often overlooked. This movie is awful, but don't let that stop you from watching it. Although it's unintentional, this film absolutely hilarious.</fullReview>

I haven't seen the original (first version), so I can't compare it. It isn't the best horror movie of all time, but is not that bad as other says. The only critic I have is the end part, it could be better. The problem with the movie is that the ending doesn't match with the first part, and this is because it starts getting to fanciful.

		<shortDescription>A Call To Hang Up On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess Hollywood would like to dumb us down by assuming that if you take a bunch of horror remakes and roll it into one film, we would never know the difference. Long gone are the days when horror films were made in the tradition of originality and creativity of George Romero and Stuart Gordon. But I digress, "One Missed Call" falls into the Hollywood rehashing of other horrors like "Ringu", "The Grudge" and "The Eye" only this was based on Japanese remake of Takashe Miike's 2003 horror film about strange phone calls from below the grave.A young psychology student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon) has been put in an unflattering disposition after a series of eerie unfortunate events as she's become a witness of her friends' deaths as she herself has been internally and eternally scarred from abuse as a child. Before her friends deaths, they all receive chilling messages about their future from their cellphones accompanied by an unorthodox ringtone. The final words come into their own voice and a terrifying scream. After two days their message about their fate comes true and the victims fall to their death.The only person who understands Beth's situation is Det. Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He knows about this because his sister was one of those victims this mysterious caller has killed. There's very little to do in this situation other then scan through their phones, destroy them and investigate an old hospital that caught on fire a short time ago before Beth gets her own death message. A television program believes that the calls are made by the devil himself and the host of the show made a promise to exorcise one of the victims. Ted Summers (Ray Wise) has invited Beth's friend Taylor Anthony (Ana Claudia Talancon) on his show to be cleansed of any evil inside of her. Once that scene is over, it quickly becomes forgotten. And then it's back to more generic phone records and breaking cellphones.Granted, this movie has its share of frightening moments, but I felt like I've this one many times before with really nothing new to offer. The unlimited images of shadows and and hands materializing through dark areas and bodies twitching with eerie facial expressions before they disappear are quite impressive. The only real scene that stands out above the rest was a the baby with the cellphone and even that scene alone is purely unjustified. All this movie contains are nothing more than just creepy imagery like the ethereal figures that come up near the end of the movie.The performances in the movie really offer very little to the credibility to the movie. With the exception of Sossamon and Burns who provided passable performances, it's a pity what happens in the end to one of them, and overall we cannot provide any care to most of the characters if they did not lighten our hearts. It's like I brought my ticket to the theatre and now I have to sit through not expecting very much.</fullReview>

The CGI is weak. It would be much better to use real effects more. Instead of CGI bugs, they should use try and true real bugs. There is a general lack of horror atmosphere. The movie shows all of its tricks rather early with Leann's death. It doesn't leave much for the rest. It basically grinds on and on with a boring investigation. Sossamon tries her jumpy best, but the movie never really ramps up the thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Missed Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Margaret Cho stars in this comedy/horror film about an Asian-American female cop who can't convince her fellow police officers that "Cell Phones Don't Kill People, People Kill People". Her skepticism and apathy unleash a malevolent spirit that torments and kills everyone around her. Cho is not mis-cast in this role. The problem is that all the funny lines are given to her co-stars and she is never even allowed to make one joke about her mother. What saves the film (almost) is the Oscar-worthy performance of the young blond mute girl who says more with her eyes and the way she holds her teddy bear than her older and more experienced co-stars say with their shouts and screams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it's because the book based in, or the script, but the idea reminds me The Ring, most of all an imitation of Scream, but the thing is I realize it could be better, as life! Just kidding, I mean important things had left behind, like could explore more logical calls that links the people involved. Expectators want to interact with movies and characters, human beings like to see each other in others.Well, maybe, the creepiest song of the decade, yeye. But really, I think it was the best thing in the entire movie, besides, of course the appearance of both, Shannyn Sossamon, natural beauty (at least is what it seems)as we rarely see at the industry and Edward Burns, good actor that has something to add, the kind that doesn't care with nothing, never succumbs, go down; in the other hand, increases with the confidence. Nice, I like and appreciate his acting.That's all..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnescessarily maligned, enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One Missed Call" is a really enjoyable and effective ghost film.**SPOILERS**Following a friend's death, Beth Raymond, (Shannon Sossamon) tries to make sure friends Taylor Anthony, (Ana Claudia Talancon) Leann Cole, (Azura Skye) and Brian Souza, (Johnny Lewis) aren't letting it get to them, as they all claim to be harassed by strange phone calls that are traced to a phone from a deceased friend. Trying to get to the bottom of the mystery, Det. Jack Andrews, (Edward Burns) decides to take an interest in the case and finds that their events are true and that something is going on with the phone calls. Unable to do anything to stop her friends from being attacked, they discover a link between a former friend of theirs that had died years earlier who had been involved in an accident that managed to touch each of them individually and is now returning for vengeance, forcing them into a race to find a way to stop it before they're killed off.The Good News: There was a lot of good stuff here that makes this one really enjoyable. One of the better elements to this one is the fact that this one has some really good ghost attacks. The set-ups here are just absolutely brilliant, with a lot of fantastic moments derived from them. The opening attacks are really great, with the odd noises and off-screen banging around into great settings allows for the perfect place for something like that to happen, and when mixed in well with the utterly extreme visions of the ghosts hanging around mix together into fantastic moments. They're just off-beat enough to be remarkable while being jolting enough to either score the jump or just add a little more to the atmosphere of the scene, and are greatly appreciated. Even better with them is the fact that they're incredibly creepy-looking ghosts as well, making for some good scares here and there. With the distorted faces, completely hollowed-out orifices or just demonic-like features coupled with an unnatural hue and a normal humanoid shape allows for some fantastic ghosts that are completely freaky-looking. They get better as the film goes on, with it's more human-like creatures that are more adequate representations of what a ghost would be like, just severely burnt and featuring the wounds that would be found there, resulting in grossly misshapen, out-and-out fantastic-style creatures that serve well in here. That makes the scenes at the end all the freakier, since other elements already working well for the scenes are mixed in with a protagonist that is just as creepy makes the scenes work even better. This one even mixes in several incredibly well-done and sure-fire jump scenes, including one of the best ones to open a film where, after a disturbing noise is heard in a nearby pond, one wanders over to check before a hand erupts out-of-nowhere and drags them down inside before a repeat of it occurs moments later. Others, such as the banging noises or just others appearing out-of-nowhere are just plain fantastic and deserve a lot credit here for making this one enjoyable. The story here is just a lot of fun as well, with it being entertaining enough to allow for the slam-bang opening and then the investigative middle-segments to get everything caught up before getting the energy back for an action-packed conclusion that never once loses it's steam or just derails off into boredom, keeping itself up and just becomes somewhat noticeable for the lack of scares but not entertainment as it's spelled out nicely, the mystery is incredibly engaging and actually feels somewhat creepy on it's own as well. The last plus here is the film's big action scenes, which are better than expected and more common than figured. The exorcism on the TV show set is fantastic, with the ghosts appearing in the smoke of the ruined equipment, the general panic and chaos of the situation and the dread of what's going on make for a standout sequence, although the encounters at the hospital, from the stalking in the ducts to the chases throughout the rooms and the big scare tactics used throughout make for some just flat-out fun and end the film on a super-high note. Other fun elements are spread throughout the film as well, making for even more good stuff to be found.The Bad News: There really wasn't a whole lot wrong here. One of the main flaws here is the film's reveling of it's tamer rating. Despite the intensity of the scenes, this one could've almost been even lower rated, as there's a serious dearth of blood and violence on display, nearly a criminal lack of it and easily could've used at least some. The few kills we get are either non-violent in the first place or edited to be at the wrong angle to get any kind of satisfactory thrill from them. Had it put in something, or even some overall, it would've been a lot better and definitely would've scored better had it did. The only other flaw to this one is the film's rather action-less middle section. While it's not filled with anything remotely objectionable, the fact that it starts off so hot and then cools down does have an effect on the pacing of this one and is noticeable at times. Otherwise, the tameness of the film is the biggest problem.The Final Verdict: Way better than initially appears to be, with only minor flaws to distract from and a lot of good parts to help it out. Really give this one a chance if looking for toned-down fare, enjoyed the original or a ghost-genre completist, otherwise those who dislike remakes or soft genre entries should ignore.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit when i rented this movie with a buddy, we were expecting a remake of Yogen/Premenition that i've seen. He didn't so we thought why don't look at the (American) remake? It turned out it didn't, but what the heck, we both enjoy scary movies. Boy, were we in a horrified surprise...I must admit, the Japanese are masters in giving you a creepy and nasty feeling during the movies, but most remakes i find most of the time better, because they are made with the western state of mind instead of the Asian state of mind. True aficionado's would probably find this thought horrifying. Well i promise you, although i don't claim to have any account of taste and i have seen my share of hack &amp; slash-, zombie- and other gore movies, so i will probably have a thicker skin then most, but this movie isn't scary. Sure it has it's moments, mostly due to the B-movie tactics of hard sounds and such which would have worked better in the cinemas.The most scary parts are in the last part of the movie, but then the movie already has lost it's appeal and my directors cut (under the name of Alan Smithee...) would have been without the last 20 minutes or so. These 20 minutes seemed to have been dragged in by their hairs and gave a more (in afterthought) a lesser satisfaction then if the movie ended 20 minutes earlier.This movie was really a copy-cat of movies like the Ring and Final Destination, but it turned out to be a fluffy kitten and if it had a runny eye and a couple of scars. No, if you want a good scar i hope you are one with a feint of heart. 2 out of 5.GertjanPs. The real scariest moment are seeing the dolls in the child room, who would give such dolls to their 5 to 8 year olds?...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of this horror movie was nothing unique. The movie didn't even have any of those make you jump in your seat moments. The idea is someone gets a phone call from a friend that just died and the date and time of the call is from the future. It's actually the exact time they will die. Beth figures all this out as her friends die and asks for help from Dective Jack Andrews. Jack's sister was actually one of the victims and the connection is a children's hospital that recently burned. They think the spirit of an abusive mother may be traveling through the phone killing people. Sounds like a great idea right. And of course, they are slightly wrong because there is a little more to the story. And the ending really doesn't have a conclusion.FINAL VERDICT: Nothing new, not scary, plot just too dull.</fullReview>

The lead actress; Shannyn Sossamon did a good job with her character, though Edward Burns didn't show any emotion playing along side her.The story just didn't gel or make any sense ? you'll still be asking the question 'why' after the film is over. To briefly sum up the plot - one by one people are being called on their mobile phones (by their future selves) shortly before they die.Our leads have to figure out the cause and to stop it before it's too late. This is where it becomes difficult; the story doesn't give you any real reason to care what happens to the characters. It went through the motions of trying to be scary?I think I really should have watched the original version first!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In its never-ending quest to deliver something different, Hollywood plunders another country's back-catalogue once again but still manages to come up with a mediocre dud. The idea is intriguing: youngsters receive voice messages from their future selves pinpointing their exact moment of death and their final words. In the hands of a more confident writer and director it could have been a chilling viewing experience, but everything here is too rushed, as if they know the material is thin and want to barge you towards the exit before you see the holes in the fabric that barely holds it all together. The film has an 87-minute running time, but I guess 10 minutes must be credits. Despite this, I was still wondering when it was going to be over ? especially after a false ending inserted about 15 minutes before the real one.The one thing this film does have going for it is some striking imagery with regards to the creepy demonic apparitions glimpsed by the victims between receiving their warning call and meeting their pre-ordained fate. The trouble is nobody really bothers trying to explain who or what they are or why they are stalking the hapless victims. Similarly, only scant regard is given to any character development leaving us unmoved by the perilous situations the hero and heroine find themselves in. Beth, the central character, has obviously never seen a horror movie in her life because she copies every stupid move ever made by a horror movie heroine since silent days. There's no corridor too dark and no claustrophobic tunnel too small for her to venture into. So instead of fearing for her safety you find yourself dispassionately reflecting on what a stupid b!tch she is.The ending is as void of imagination as most of what goes before, cruelly leaving the way open for a sequel which hopefully will never be green-lighted.. Other than the imagery mentioned earlier, the only other thing it has going for it is an appropriately creepy ring tone?</fullReview>

No. However, it has a unique plot and two strong leads with Shannyn Sossamon and Edward Burns. Too many people rate horror movies based on how bloody or action-packed they are. I am one of those viewers that does not want to see bloody arms and legs everywhere. This is a good, solid horror film that does not need a lot of gore to remain interesting. I think that this movie will find its audience and end up being a cult favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So it's clear to see there's a lot of bashing of this film. A lot of the reviews are from 2008 or so, which I guess are from people who were tired of films like "The Ring" and "The Grudge" churning out at the time. Having watched this in 2015, unimpressed by the horror films on offer today, it's exactly the type of film I wanted: An American "hollywood" remake of a Japanese horror film. One that doesn't rely on too much shaky cam and zooming in, and with decent CGI and SFX which don't look like a video game cutscene!That said, the special effects and CG are impressive in this film for its age. Although the technology is somewhat dated now, the effects definitely hold up and make this a great watch in 1080p.The acting is solid and on par with that of The Ring &amp; The Grudge.All in all, it was entertaining start to finish. Don't let the reviews have you dissecting the film, just enjoy yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How does this have only 4 stars? I love Japanese film remakes, like "The Ring" and "the Grudge", and this is no different. Spoilers - The movie is about college students who get eerie phone calls from the near future. The creepy thing is, on the voicemail, it has the actual person who got the call saying their last words. Beth, who is friends with a girl named LeeAnne hears the voicemail on LeeAnne's phone. And LeeAnne dies two days later, at the exact time the future voicemail said. After more of Beth's friends die, Detective Jack Andrews teams up with her to help solve the calls. This is a scary movie, like most all of Japanese remakes. Even the picture on the cover of the DVD case is frightening. Two uses of the s word, that's really it. Don't show children. This sort of links to child abuse at times. And frightening images. 15+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Missed Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One Missed Call" really is not the worst American remake I have ever seen, in fact I think that they've had a really good crack at it and tried to add a new spin on the story. Seriously, it is no where near as bad as "Shutter" or the even worse "Prom Night" (not Japanese I know but it was absolutely hideous!) "One Missed Call" obviously isn't a patch on the original but it's still a watchable, well-paced psychological horror.The beginning of it did leave me a bit on edge because it really wasn't done very well at all with the seriously unscary hand poking out the water and taking the woman and then a cat!? But, luckily after that the story did pick up quite nicely and although some of the dialogue was a bit stiff, it still managed to be quite suspenseful. I don't know why people keep banging on about it being a PG-13 or whatever you call it in America because why the heck would it be an 18? Or R as you call it. The original "One Missed Call" is not gory in the slightest. I'd go as far to say that this remake is gorier and the death scenes are better done than the original's as they seemed very confusingly executed.Although "One Missed Call" does have some slightly creepy moments, I didn't find it any where near as scary as the original (unsurprisingly) for example, the scariest moment in the original for me was the hospital scene with the ghost/zombie woman with her creepy slow movements and claustrophobic atmosphere. Here, they use speed for scares and it just looks more comical than frightening. Another example was the brilliant live exorcism in the original, which here seems extremely rushed and executed really badly in comparison with the original. but in a way I admire it for that because it didn't copy it shot by shot and it had a go and I suppose for those who haven't seen the original it would look OK.However. For those who haven't seen the original they might also find it very confusing because things are not as well explained as in the original. Questions are left unanswered and I don't think that the makers of the film actually got the essence of the mystery or the rules. Things were not well explained. Having said that, the mystery is still engaging and highly original (obviously not here because they've taken the story).So taking away from the original here, we have a remake that really does try very hard to be its own and in the end it does succeed if not always for the right reasons. Still, I really enjoyed it, I thought it was fun, entertaining and engaging with its pacing meaning that I didn't get bored, but maybe some of you will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm giving this movie the pass (5/5) grade, because it had some elements that I enjoyed.I'm overlooking at the fact that it's a remake, because remakes can be good movies in their own right.The idea on which it's based is already old, but it was once new and original: several people die unexpectedly after a friend gets an eerie voicemail from them, apparently uttering their final words at the moment of their death. The voicemail obviously comes from some point in the future, but even without that element, you can tell -since that's what you probably went looking for in this movie- that they're going to die more or less gruesome, untimely deaths. Well, only the first death (not counting the girl in the very first scene) is filmed with some sense of suspense, and the actress that plays that part, Azura Skye, is one of the only two actors in this movie who can actually act.From that moment on, it all goes downhill, and it gets really boring, and almost everyone on the screen gives performances that range from wooden to plastic. Some of the deaths are kind of nicely written and they remind a bit of the "Final destination" movies, though less original. However, the plot doesn't seem to make sense; it does, but it seems as though the film-makers don't really give a damn about creating any suspense at all, so they add scene after scene of pointlessness and boredom, with the scenes containing Edward Burns being especially insufferable and embarrassing to watch due to his limited acting ability, at least in this film.Now, the reason I thought this was not so bad is that I liked how all the seemingly random elements that have been spread out along the movie are each given meaning at the end, when we learn what's behind the deaths of these friends. And young Ariel Winter, though having a short-lasting part, gives the second above average performance in the movie.I would recommend this to die-hard fans of supernatural horror, but I would warn them not to expect anything very scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original version of one missed call was 100 times better than this remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original version of One missed call was my favorite J-Horror movie(Ranked Number 1) but this remake was just extremely disappointing. First of all, Since I loved the original version of One Missed Call so much. I wanted to watch the remake to see how it turns out. I watched it in the theater beside my house on 11.1.2008, and wasted 10 dollars on it. There are many many bad things about the film. First of all, the remake of One Missed Call isn't even scary. For the original version of this film, there was one scene in the movie which Yumi looks into the basin and saw visions of her dead friend. This was not even shown in the remake. The elevator scene in the original version of One missed call is really terrifying. However in the remake they changed the elevator scene into some silly pole piercing through a man's body. How can that be scary? The original version of one missed call just gets more and more frightening as the show proceeds, but the remake just gets less and less frightening. The maggots surrounding the cellphone scene in the original version has been changed to some silly alien creature in the remake. The original version has some touching scenes and almost every scene contributes to the plot of the story unlike the remake. In the remake, I wonder what the silly hallucinations of caterpillars climbing up a wall got to do with the story. The remake didn't just fail to be scary, but failed to be touching. The frightening twisting scene in the original version of one missed call was not even used in the remake. In the remake Statues becoming alive and try to "scare" people. I think this movie probably would only be able to scare young children. The ending of the movie in the original version was so well done unlike this film. The mirror scene in the original version was not used in the remake. Overall, this film is terribly done, with terrible GCI effects, the actors did an okay job but were chosen wrongly. The ghost in this show isn't even as scary as Mimiko in the original. Chakushin Ari 1, 2 and final (all of them) are much better than this film. I would prefer much younger actors and actresses to act in this film. In addition the creepy and extremely creative scene in the original where the ghost turn back the time in Yumi's clock was creepier than this film in which the ghost attacks the main character at a later time(11:00). (That is still okay) But the scene showing another man picking up her cellphone and listening to the message with that weird expression makes the scene bad. It would have been much scarier if she was the one who picked up her own cellphone. The scene where Yumi hugs the zombie in the original version wasn't even used here. The zombie in the original version is really terrifying but the zombie used here was just ridiculous and really silly.If I were really try to squeeze in something good about this film, is that the overhead bridge scene in this film in a little creepy, the atmosphere of the dilapidated hospital in this film is creepy. The music is OK. The storyline of the original version was done very well and hence the storyline of this remake was still good. Other than that this remake of one missed call was horrible. I do not recommend others to see this remake. If you want to watch a fantastically good film, watch the original, it is really terrifying. Score: One missed call (original version)- 10/10 One missed call 2 - 9.5/10 One missed call final - 9/10 The remake - 5.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ONE MISSED CALL follows the current American trend to "westernize" Japanese horror films. I have not seen the original Japanese version so I'm stuck with this one. For starters, ONE MISSED CALL is mildly entertaining and has some very effective creepiness to it. There are some genuine scares and the movie flows at a nice pace. Unfortunately (very much like in THE GRUDGE) we never know what drives the "bad guy" in this film and if what drives him/it/her is what is shown near the end, then I think it was a very lame excuse to all of the preceding action. Things happen for some reason and you finish watching the movie asking yourself what that reason was. You're left with some very important questions hanging and that's the film undoing. I'll say it again: stylistically speaking, it's a very well done picture, but the story doesn't hold any water. At times, it reminded me of the FINAL DESTINATION movies, only those were a bit more interesting (at least compared to this!). And watching fellow Mexican Ana Claudia Talancon (who looks totally hot!) was a plus for me.Nice movie, nice scares, nice creepy atmosphere but sucky plot!</fullReview>

It made my bro sit quietly for a change.What was the deal with that piece of rock candy that they found in the mouths of all the victims? i think it may perhaps reveal something a little bit disturbing about the makers of this movie. Jack Andrew is a dead ringer for a Ben Affleck look alike. they should do a remake of some other Japanese cellphones horror movies and have Ben play Jack's evil alter ego. That would be more original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always think a deer might jump out in front of me and I will swerve and drive off a cliff. As a truck driver, I am in a lot of dangerous areas. We know the best thing to do is just hit the deer, but I notice when they run in the road I panic and think I need to avoid hitting them. Because of so many hours of driving and getting in a zone, things like that make you jerk the wheel if you are not careful.So would you call yourself names? "You idiot, what were you thinking?" Will some of you call yourself to say how you died from playing WOW and not eating/drinking/sleeping/bathing for 3 days? "Stay away from the expansion pack!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with high expectations because I already saw the Japanese version and after an hour and a half I was so disappointed, its a movie that doesn't scare at all, in fact some situations are even funny. The story about a chain of people receive terrifying cell phone messages of their own final fatal moments was quite interesting but a poorly developed plot ruin everything. The cast is a mix of little known and unknown actors, everyone with lousy performances. Just a couple of things were good in this movie in my opinion, the makeup and the special effects,everything else was just bad. To conclude, watching this movie was a completely waste of time and money, if you wanna get scared with a good horror movie go and see the Japanese version of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect as horror movies goes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This decides it - I am going to stop checking votes and reviews for movies before I decide if to watch them or not. Because it was near I had missed this very good and really scary horror movie, because of all the bad marks and reviews! I cannot understand them! Of course this is not a "deep", high brow movie - but it is not supposed to be either! It is pure horror, with all the suspense and all the scares that you have the right to expect from such. I was VERY frightened several times - it was really creepy! This movie is the kind of horror that is perfect as a "dessert" after a long movie night (with deep and intellectual movies! ;-) ), around Midnight!As an afterthought, I should not say that the movie is not at all deep. It illustrates, for instance, such an important as well as unpleasant and taboo issue as child abuse. You can also see it as a both funny and disturbing satire of the younger generations' obsession of, and total dependency on, cell phones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was scary from beginning to end. Things were predictable, but still made you jump. This movie lived up to its name. One Missed Call was the perfect title for this movie. Kept you guessing the whole way through. It had a good plot line. It did not include much blood/gore parts. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. I was ready to get rid of my phone after seeing this movie! I do not understand why people do not like this movie. The movie was missing some things that could have made it better. You should have found out more about the main girl character's life so you could see more as to why she was the way she was. Also, her and the main guy character should have been closer. Lastly, it should have shown something about what she received in the mail because she receives two of them and they are in the movie but you never find out what they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what this film has done to receive such a slating but it's actually not that bad! It's not brilliant, but it's really not too bad.OK, so, you get a phone call and you hear how you're going to die, yes? Good idea for a story. Wasn't too badly executed either. My only gripe was with the poor graphics. Watch the film and you'll see what I mean.The film was not overly scary but I did manage to jump at one specific part, which I will leave for you to enjoy yourself :p So, the story follows a girl studying psychology at some uni. Her friends have all been dying after receiving calls from their dead mates. Lovely. Anywho, she realises everyone is linked together and attempts to trace it back to the source (as with all Japanese horrors) and try to stop the person once she finds the original culprit. Standard.This brings us to the scariest location of all: a burnt down hospital. With hours to live, the main character, Beth, decides to explore it by herself. This is the typical part of a horror film where the main character does something really stupid and you hate them for it.Anywho, she goes and gets locked in the hospital. She has, what, 30 minutes before she's meant to die and she's walking round a freakin deserted hospital. I shall say no more about this scene but I was brickin it! Anywho the ending basically illustrates there is no end to this cycle unless you delete all of your contacts from your phone book or all the contacts in your phone book are dead. Problem solved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give this call a miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a webmaster of a site called Kitty Safe I realized quickly that this movie was after my own heart. Of course the first thing you figure out is that every girl in this movie is going to be smoking hot. Not a problem for me per se, except that I like to immerse my self in a movie and when everyone is "perfect" it creates interpersonal distance that is anathema to a horror movie, at least a good one. As an American movie viewer I noticed this doesn't effect Asian horror because there is already enough cultural unknowns to keep things open.I had a feeling I was wasting my time on this one but I am withholding judgment, after all we're only 12 minutes into the movie.So, where angels fear tread I press on, even if I do see Takashi Miike in my mind's eye shaking his head.Now first of all I love scenes of hallucinatory madness in a high school classroom. The contrast between sheltered safety and that which goes against everything we are taught from a rational standpoint has made me horny ever since Heather Langenkamp fell asleep and was warned not to run in the halls in Nightmare on Elm Street (1984).One thing is for sure, special effects have always made huge strides. The visuals, eye candy of horror has truly excelled, but stories and direction have fallen far behind. That's why we get all these remakes, sequels and prequels and re hashed crap for the last ten years or longer even. I have found myself turning more and more to foreign films for my prescription of good horror. South Korea (A Tale of Two Sisters, Ghost House), Japan (The Ring, Dark Water), Thailand (Shutter) Hong Kong (Inner Senses, Re-Cycle) and more recently Mexico (El Orfanato).The biggest problem I have with this movie is it's complete lack of character development, intelligent writing, and character direction. No one in the movie acted with any believability. We have a cop jimmy a lock with a piece of paper, everyone doing something really suddenly behind a scared girl, whether it's setting off asthma medication, or handing someone a cell phone, the only thing this movie had going for it was decent special effects and amazing cleavage of the female actresses push-up bras. Also I'm fairly sure I have that aquarium screen saver used as the fish tank in the detective's office. Just kidding.Ever since I watched The Ring by Gore Verbinski, I've waited for a horror movie made in the USA that could match it's seamless and intense pacing, but nothing comes close. If only Richard Matheson were still alive.Also what was with all the different ghosts if it's just one woman, and how if she has all these powers like telekinesis and the ability to have ghostly arms go through doors to grab people do they then have to try to break a door down? There simply was no logic to this movie or cohesion in anything. It was as though Uwe Boll wrote the script. I mean the original was pretty bad but at least that had the decency to keep intangible provinces to themselves instead of dumbing them down into something completely mundane. The ending was so bad I wanted to strangle somebody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time to do this movie some justice. I really do not understand the harsh reviews toward this film, sure its a Japanese horror flick but what can you honestly hope to gain from watching this. I like to watch movies with an open mind, I suggest some people should really give this film another look. It starts off really without a decent explanation but you learn as the movie moves on which is good. The opening scene is just bold. That's all I can say. Maybe its the scene in which the cat is pulled under the water that irritated a lot of people. And rarely do you see animals die in a movie unless its one of those "Tale of a boy and his dog". *Old Yeller* But that's besides the point. This movie just goes balls out and kills this cat. Beautiful. Now after that the girl is killed, nothing special. But then the whole concept comes out, your phone rings but you get this weird ring tone and it freaks you out. Of course you don't answer it, but it doesn't matter because your still going to die. The deaths were very interesting, and you wouldn't even begin to see it unless you seen this movie before. Its one of those movies that you just have to appreciate. If you want a movie that has an original idea that deals with something that pretty much everyone has in this world, I'd definitely watch this. It freaks you out a little if something could actually posses your cellular phone. Check it out because its a decent film with decent acting and which earns this film a 90%</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"One Missed Call" confirms something that many of us have suspected for a good long time now: that voice mail is indeed a tool of the devil. In this film, an evil spirit sends death messages to a group of terrorized college students via a cell phone tree. Soon, the corpses are piling up almost as fast as the discarded calling devices, while Beth (Shannyn Sossamon), one of the targeted victims, and Jack (Edward Burns), the homicide detective who takes on the case, race around madly trying to bring an end to the horror.This mediocre, assembly-line product comes equipped with the requisite number of nubile young victims, phony leads, false scares and hyperventilating special effects. But, frankly, all you'll really be wondering is how many cell phones were harmed in the making of this film.</fullReview>

The part in the hospital was pretty scary. The ending was a little dull though. What was going to happen??Okay, I admit that the story was a little boring, since the classics are The Ring and The Grudge.

		<fullReview>This movie produces several opinions by me and I shall share them here: The dialog was a dialog. nothing impressive or outstanding just pretty mundane like.. The acting itself was pretty good, though something there did seem a little off from time to time when I think about it. The story line, well. suspense is there all the way to the end, but there is no point in having just suspense and almost nothing going around with it. I can't be too sure what was supposed to be accomplished by this movie. How the plot went down was pretty plain, leaving only the end having something in it, arising an "oh..short hmm, OK".. I noticed scene near the end that just didn't seem to belong, nothing was prior or leading to that moment, a try was produced to create intense emotion or whatever it was, and then it disappeared. The last death there was just didn't belong there.. And why the deaths even had to occur..what's up with that.. I can understand certain questions on life are never explained or answered, but it didn't feel right. Anyway.. The movie passed my time, but the first scenes made me expect much more that was not fulfilled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mind remakes - even though they are most of the time inferior i still find it interesting to see another 'take' on it. I had a feeling from the opening scene really that it was gonna be poor as the girls acting was awful. This set the tone for the rest of the cast (of which i include ed burns who i normally like) as the 'characters' started seeing strange bugs and people. However there are so many little glimpses of weird things like this that the film suffers and loses the creepy edge. Despite her friends dropping around her the main character's face never changes and you would think stuff like this happens to her all the time - also as the back story un folds you find yourself becoming less interested in why its all happening anyway. Even promising scenarios like the live TV show turn out rushed and un satisfying and this rushed feel is the ultimate downfall for the movie. There is one scene that did make me laugh with a bear - you'll know when you see it. Cracked the whole audience up. So bad i would rate it as low as when a stranger calls (remake) and the fog (also remake).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Japanese original and the American version, and the story lines are pretty much the same. There are very few changes between the movies. I liked the American ending better than the Japanese ending. However for the totality of the movie, I prefer the Japanese version because the characters were more likable and genuine. I think that had a lot to do with the dialogs. In the Japanese version, you didn't "see things" after you got the call. Where the hell did that come from? That did not add anything to the movie. I didn't like that adaptation. The Japanese version had more elaborate death scenes, I mean, a severed arm dials the phone number to the next victim. The movie is what it is. An okay attempt in a remake. I also saw the ORIGINAL "The Eye" and I see that America (with Jessica Alba) has remade that as well. The original was very eery. I hope that the American version will maintain the freshness that was preserved in the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So when I decided to go see this movie with a few friends, I was definitely on the edge of my seat, hoping it was going to be good. The previews spooked me a bit, with the crazy faces and images. A few minuets into the movie Meagan Good is instantly killed off. Personally, I respect her as an actress and not only does my boyfriend find her attractive, but I was shocked they would kill off the "pretty girl". First negative.As the movie progresses, there is barely any story line behind any of the characters. I personally found it to be funny that she was afraid of peep-holes, until we found out why. The movie was definitely a jumper, it did do well with having you thinking something was going to happen, then just before that moment scaring you.. but I just was not impressed with the ending. So, pretty much the entire movie we were suppose to be afraid of an inhaler and a cell phone. Inatamate objects, awesome. I was hoping this movie with the small hype it did receive it would for once follow through with a scary, on the edge of your seat movie. DENIED! So, pretty much this leaves me hoping that the next movie made from a foreign film, please be scary. PLEASE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I rather stick to Takashi Miike version than this.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the chance by shear luck to see both movies the American version in the theaters recently and the early Japanese version as soon as i got home (and would you believe the Japanese version started just as soon as i entered the door which was awesome in my favor). "One missed call" is another attempt at hacking a pretty decent and pretty damn nerve jolted J-horror movie and make it into another americanized, "one tree hill-ish" horror movie where the black chick dies within the first 5 minutes and the pretty white kids are left to figure out who is trying playing this dangerous game in telling the teens the date, time, and how they are going to die via voice mail...you can pretty much think of this version as, "Final destination 4: ONE MISSED CALL" which makes this movie an A-typical remake that doesn't really live up to Takashi Miike's version that was years before.The acting in this movie is pretty much what you would expect in any typical horror that is on American shores....bland, expecting, and somewhat off in most cases. Now don't get me wrong....some movies that were Japanese based that comes here most are pretty good...but then you have some like this...and it makes you wonder. I'm a big fan of Takashi Miike's works right down to Koroshiya 1 (aka. Ichi the killer) and Audition (another one of my favorites)He makes the viewers guess what's coming after them instead of using CGI to over blow the spectacle of the climax; there are some cases where as one critic on here says, "Not knowing is a lot better than already knowing" which is true sometimes its good to not know who your enemy is in certain movies therefore it gives off the element of surprise right till the climax which in the Japanese version that did it perfectly....this version....not so much. In the end, I had to give this movie a 4, nice attempt but when you have a director who has never seen the Japanese version and advised the actors to not see it to for research then you have all the makings of a nearly semi-bad movie and a semi-bad remake; my advice watch the Japanese version instead you might find that its version is slightly better and if you prefer the American version then to each it own...but it was just done poorly. sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>okay, this movie was honestly not AS awful as i had heard and expected. I've seen worse attempts at horror with "The Grudge", or "The Ring 2", "Pulse", "When a Stranger Calls" or the hilarious "The Wicker Man", but it is still embarrassing at how lame Hollywood "horror" movies have become. The only good ones are the independent films like "SAW" or the upcoming "Poughkeepsie Tapes", which by the way you know its sad when a trailer is actually scarier than the film you are presenting it before.So the movie actually begins pretty decent and just slowly declines from there. The scares are so obvious and pathetically done that the audience usually ends up laughing. The acting was pretty horrendous, but hey, its a horror movie. The pacing was one of the better parts of the film as the kills are spaced enough to keep just a little bit of interest, as does the so-called plot. The ending is what truly ruins the movie though, as it's just a typical PG-13 horror film ending, so it was virtually expected. Overall---4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The audience all breathed a sigh of relief when the credits rolled at the end, it is that gripping. I found the storyline somewhat ambiguous, the scenes are sometimes very David Lynch style, but the ending is left to your own interpretation. Read the user comments here for possible answers to your questions. The filming is excellent, close ups and meeky colours add to the atmosphere. I was reminded of the final scene in 'The Blair Witch Project,' some of the scenes stay in your head for days, I'm not going to write a review of this movie so much as tell you how it has affected me. I am and always have been a horror movie fanatic. I was raised on Puppet Master, Return of the Living Dead, Phantasm, Halloween, etc. I would say that I am pretty desensitized. I WOULD say that, but I won't because apparently I'm not. I watched this film last night with a few friends in my apartment. At the time, it seemed good and scary, just my type of movie. That was until everyone went home and my roommate went to sleep. I blame this on hormones plus it being late, but once I walked into my bedroom, my anxiety skyrocketed. I paced around the apartment for awhile before finally giving in to the possibility of some sleep at about 2 AM. Yeah, right. Radio on, door closed, no closet, lamp on and I still couldn't relax enough to get any shut eye. Every 15 minutes my eyes would fly open and I would peer around the room to get my barings. This is horrible. I have never lost sleep over a movie, and I've seen it all. All of these years I've never understood people who disliked horror films, but I think this one sleepless terrified night is all that it will take to sympathize forever. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skip This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Skip this, and just get the Japanese original. If you like Japanese and other Asian horror movies, just skip the American remakes, and go back to the original. The original was far more interesting, and with much less of a special effects budget. And it didn't substitute special effects for believable characters and storytelling technique.It says in the Trivia section that the director didn't see 'Chakushin Ari', and asked none of the actors to do see it as well. This shows. The original movie was a creepy story, in the feel of an urban legend, while this is yet another over the top blockbuster with pretty people dying horribly in fantastic and overly dramatic ways. 'Chakushin Ari' played with the concept of insanity as a chronic disease, one that can never truly be overcome, and the idea that a ghost could be just as ill as a person. 'One Missed Call' is just another in a line of movies like 'Final Destination' or 'Jeepers Creepers 2' where the villain is an explicable, unstoppable monster who must be battled so they stop killing the pretty young people.As one final gripe about the movie, in the original, the twist is actually that. A twist. One honestly feels like the movie has hit its denouement before the twist hits. In 'One Missed Call', the director obviously subscribes to the Uwe Boll school of storytelling, wherein the monster is shown early and often because "If they don't see the monster, how will they know what to be scared of?". The twist is not a twist at all, because only the characters are blind enough to believe in the immediately obvious. Any viewer (and nearly all the ones in the theater I saw this with, yes I asked several) knew what was coming because it wasn't foreshadowed, it was repeatedly pointed out by what was shown.In closing, I repeat... Go see the original. Leave this piece unwatched. While it is slightly better than 'Chakushin Ari 2', that is hardly praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is good as far as what it is. It is a decent horror movie in that it has some scenes that will genuinely make you jump and it will leave you guessing till near the very end. **spoilers** However certain aspects of it are hold overs from Friday the 13th, people being dragged into a lake, the main villain carrying a knife, teenage couple making out.Further more in this day and age post-Resident Evil and Final Destination? You've got to be smarter about your plotting and offer up at least a halfway decent explanation as to how certain things are feasible. I'm looking at you battery-less cellphone scene. I mean it was all well and good back then when Chucky was battery-less. But that was then this is now you should at least have considered taking full advantage of the college setting, have a science class lecture on the law of the conservation of energy, how energy can't be created nor destroyed? How it just changes form. As it is there's no explanation as to how the cellphones are feasibly possessed by said girl. One missed call? More like One Missed Chance to make another smart horror movie that gets under your skin and truly disturbs you the way the first Final Destination did with its creepy yet true to life philosophy.</fullReview>

I knew when I saw the commercials that it was going to be terrible. Another thing that turned me off about the movie is that all of the American remakes of the Japanese horror films suck! The Japanese versions aren't that bad, but the American versions are awful! Take The Grudge and The Ring for example. That should put it out in fine print for you. Just don't see this movie.

		<fullReview>Honestly...This movie made a complete and utter mockery of the original! If you have ever seen Chakushin Ari, I think you know exactly what I'm talking about. Let me elaborate...First off, One Missed Call was incredibly untrue to the original, not to mention completely ridiculous (i.e. the baby w/ the cell phone, the burned up body strangely located in an air duct...I could go on). The original was genuinely suspenseful, although this remake did have me on the edge of my seat a few times, when the scare actually came, I either found myself utterly disappointed or laughing at what was supposed to be frightening. Personally, I am a HUGE J-Horror fan and I hate seeing good movies like this wrecked by Americans, for example Ju-On. I was really hoping to see some of the ways the victims died in Chakushin Ari in its American counterpart, but unfortunately, I saw no one getting pulled into an elevator shaft.I saw this movie on opening night, and my theater was chocked full of jeering laugher. If you want a good chuckle, then I recommend this movie. If you really want to get scared, go see something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish this could have been, "One Missed Movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review may contain spoilers.This movie follows the 'standard' template of a lot of horror movies that have come out in the last few years: Main characters friends are dying/getting-killed by something creepy and supernatural. Main character teams up with another person that is also somehow involved in the events. They follow clues to the 'source' of the problem. The 'source' of the supernatural problem is related to some tragic event, usually tied to a young female character.If you have seen movies like; Fear Dot Com, The Ring, Dark Water, Phone, Pulse, The Eye, The Grudge then you have seen the formula that One Missed Call is based on.I also rated the movie low due to the following: 1) The plot is rather simple, but the movie is dragged out by long "5 minutes walking through a desolated building with nothing happening" scenes. 2) At least half of the 'scary moments' are traditional "fake scares", like when the scary music builds up and.... A CAT JUMPS OUT!! 3) Once you find out the "reason" behind all of the strange happenings it just opens up a crap load of new questions: If *that* is the answer, then why did *this* happen? How could *that* have happened? Why would this or that happen? The "answer" makes no sense overall and does not explain why the events you saw over the course of the movie happened.As for point #3, this seems to be a trend these days: movies that involve the "spirit" of a dead person that is wreaking havoc after-death. Why is the spook able to cause all this mayhem? Control technological devices? Appear anywhere in the world? Make living people hallucinate? Why is a corpse able to just animate itself? Is it just taken for granted these days, that "spirits" have all these wacky, superhero powers just because they are "spirits"?I rated the movie 3 out of 10. It was far from great, but definitely not entirely bad either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too good of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem I had with this movie of how cheesy and dumb everything was. There was a number of times when I debated if it was a kids movie because of the cheap, low budget thrills. The movie does do some good things because I did enjoy it and I was scared at a few times, but I was more scared watching the preview for the upcoming movie "The Eye". If you have not seen this yet, please do go watch it because I did not enjoy the grudge but it got good reviews and did gain a sequel but don't expect much. One of the scariest part of this movie was the acting. The first scene, was terrible. The only good actor, I thought, was the detective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was without doubt the worst and most disappointing movie I have ever seen in the cinema. I'm not a big horror fan, but I figured I'd try this out since the previews made it actually look like a movie. This movie deserves to be on the top of the WORST MOVIES list and can easily be one of the worst movies of 2008. I'm not going to get deep into the storyline, but let's just say it was a funny movie. If you're looking for a comedy see this, because this was the most pathetic piece of trash. This is not in the least scary and the storyline was beyond awful. They get a call hearing their death. They wander randomly around the street seeing weird faces. They die. Repeat. The ending will make you laugh the hardest. I think I lauged harder in this movie than in Superbad. Biggest waste of 10 bucks ever. Stay home and watch SAW.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, that's the last time I take a chance on a movie with that low a score.This might be the longest 87 minute movie I have ever seen. You know when you are just waiting for a movie to be over? Yeah, that's not a good thing, agree?This movie is absolutely not scary. It totally fails on creating tension. Someone is walking down the street and, oh, look! a creepy ass face.. Huh. Oh, there's another one! In the middle of the day - better just keep walking! Yes, the faces are kind of creepy, awfully CG-looking, but creepy, but they do not scare. And another thing, these people are seeing these creepy faces and stuff, and never do they ever react like a normal human being. Do they tell any one? Nope. A normal person would go: "whoah, I just saw a ghostly super creepy face in the window, what the hell"!? Instead they just, uhm, you know, keep totally quiet. Even when someone else is right there with them. The pacing is strange, the CG is poor, the story is.. it could have been cool, but it's wasted. The movie does slightly redeem it self towards the end, slightly though. It's still pretty darn crappy. The director could have gone for creepy, chose crappy.There are a couple of scenes that are, well, not terrible, I'll give the movie that, but that's not much though.Skip this one. I think I'll check out the original sometime. The director and actors never even saw it, so it's probably very different and much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Missed Call (2008): Dir: Eric Valette / Cast: Shannyn Sossamon, Edward Burns, Ray Wise, Ana Claudia Talancon, Azura Skye: Although the title can be a reference to death, perhaps it's the film's viewers that would be grateful to miss it when flipping through channels. Lame plot regards a bunch of missed cell phone calls where victims can hear their own deaths. Victims die then a small red candy rolls out of their mouths. This makes absolutely no sense but director Eric Valette goes for style while the screenwriter went for complete nonsense. Shannyn Sossamon tries hard to hold a straight faces within this nonsense of a plot. She holds her own after witnessing the deaths of a few friends. From there she attempts to solve the case thus rushes about trying to find answers. Edward Burns plays a cop who seemingly believes her because his sister was killed in a similar way. Intelligent viewers will see this character as nothing more than a potential romantic interest for Sossamon. Ray Wise, Azura Skye and Ana Claudia Talancon also appear although I sure hope they are not proud of it. The original When A Stranger Calls used the whole prank call theme to chilling extremes. It also provided strong characters and a villain that is beyond bogeyman standards. This however, is a pointless and nauseating wreck that should be stomped upon as done with cell phones in this stupid film. Score: 3 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It requires a special kind of stupid to make a movie this bad. This is without a doubt the worst horror movie I've ever seen, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There are countless plot holes and inconsistencies, and it borrows heavily from The Ring; the protagonist has a certain amount of time to solve the mystery behind an urban legend before she is killed. The explanations for what was going on in the movie were so lame. Some stuff wasn't explained at all. There is also an extremely high amount of jump scares, all of which make you roll your eyes. One was so bad that the loud noise didn't match up with the "scary image". You'd think there'd at least be a little bit of tension to compensate for the lame jump scares, but there's a shortage on that too. You don't care about any of the characters because they're introduced, then killed of in about 5 minutes. You definitely want to miss this call.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the original this was based off and I've heard its actually good.Do not mistake this film for good.The premise- You get a voice message from the future and that's when you die. (Yeah, you read that correctly...)So, the premise is a bit weak, but hey, maybe it'll be decently written, or acted, or directed?Not really. Stock B (or C) level horror folk populate the movie and you don't ever really grow to care about any of them. Edward Burns character doesn't really seem to have a personality either even as he gets wrapped deeper into the nonsense going on around him.The director feels the need to show a cell phone in almost every shot, as if the cellphone itself is what's terrifying. The cellphone is not, the call itself is as you're going to die whether or not you got around to listening to the voice message.The movie is pretty boring but the last 20 minute or so switch from boring to bizarre. As in "WTF is going on? This makes no sense." It starts to make sense, and then no, it doesn't make sense anymore. If you're really bored and desperate looking for a horror movie, this exists, but I can't recommend wasting any time on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something must have been lost in the translation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of college friends begin getting voice mails from 48 hours in advance where they hear themselves dying. Soon they begin seeing strange things and creepy creature/people tracking them and then it comes true. Based on the 2003 J-Horror film "Chakushin Ari" this American remake is a mess. It's hard to tell if something got lost in the translation but something must have. The premise is interesting enough but the execution here by Director Eric Valette leaves a lot to be desired. Like most J-Horror remakes or inspired from stories the general scares are of the creepy and eerie oriented. 'One Missed Call" wants to be like this but misses the mark most of the time. The digital effects range from decent to flat out crappy (Like most CGI does) with the creature/people the victims see before death being the only creepy things in the film and only some of these work. The rest is harmless stuff that wouldn't scare anyone over the age of 12.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't answer then....After the death of her friend Shelley, Leann receives a voice mail of the date and time when she would die. On the day, Leann sees things and in the informed hour, Leann is attacked by a supernatural force while talking to her friend Beth. When her roommate receives a call, Beth befriends Det. Jack Andrews, who tells her that his sister was the first victim of the phone call. They decide to investigate the connections of Jack's sister and find the name of Marie Layton, who apparently abused of her daughters.So according to another site, this is the worst reviewed film of the last ten years. While its a poor show, I'm sure there have been poorer film released in the same time span, say Babylon A.D?But there are so many flaws in the film, that you cannot help but laugh at the audacity of the plot points.Such as, why on earth is this group of people being targeted by an asthmatic ghost when they have nothing to do with anything? Who are these weird creatures stalking the teenagers.And the most fundamental question of all, why keep your phone, if you knew friends were getting calls from themselves, hearing themselves dying?Sossaman is okay, given the poor script, and Burns looks like he's still reeling from A sound of thunder.Moments make the film worthwhile though, Ray Wise turns up as a TV evangelist who gets some one to try and exorcise a phone (really, it's hilarious).And of course, the revaluation when Sossaman finds a corpse, and it gets a little bit too close to her and the timing of this makes if look like to corpse is getting fresh with her.It's bad, but bad in the sense that you can laugh at the film, and realise it wasn't that terrible, thanks to some dodgy direction, poor effects and a hilarious script.Don't watch to get scare, watch to get happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Missed Call</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title obviously says something about what the plot will involve, and when I read about it I was certainly interested because of the lead actress, and I was willing to chance it despite the low rating by the critics. Basically Shelley Baum (Meagan Good), has died in mysterious circumstances, and her friend Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon) listens to a missed call on the cell phone of her friend Leann Cole (Azura Skye). The call has apparently come from themselves on a day in the near future, sounding distressed, and soon enough when it comes to the date and time in question Leann is killed by a weird force that pushes her on some train tracks. Beth, who was on the phone to her friend when the incident happened, goes to see Leann's boyfriend Brian Sousa (Johnny Lewis), he has also received an eerie cell phone call message from himself, and he dies in front of her in just a few minutes. Next Beth's roommate Taylor Anthony (Ana Claudia Talancón) gets a phone call from herself, Beth decides something needs to be done and an investigation of some kind needs to be carried out. So she finds and befriends Det. Jack Andrews (Edward Burns), and he reveals the first victim of this weird supernatural force was his own sister, and in their search for answers they find the name Marie Layton (Rhoda Griffis). This woman was apparently abusing her children, and she died of an asthma attack, and they notice on all the victims they find dead that a piece of red hard candy was in their mouths, so these are the connections. Eventually it comes to the point when Beth receives her own phone call, and time is running out before the deadline of whatever is going to happen to her to kill her, but in the end the phenomenon is ended, but there is still doubt as to whether it is truly over. Also starring Ray Wise as Ted Summers, Jason Beghe as Ray Purvis, Margaret Cho as Det. Mickey Lee, Dawn Dininger as Monster Marie, Ariel Winter as Ellie Layton, Sarah Jean Kubik as Monster Ellie and Raegan Lamb as Laurel Layton. The acting, even from a gorgeous actress like Sossamon, isn't much to complain about, it is just what they are in that is, the story may be original in the concept, but it is handled in completely the wrong way, it is pretty ridiculous in fact with wasted special effects and silly ideas, based on the original Japanese version, all in all it is an awful watch horror thriller. Pretty poor!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this weak cross between "The Ring" and "Final Destination," Shannon S. finds her friends dying all around her after each of them receives a mysterious phone call, apparently from themselves! A remake of a Japanese flick, this malevolent ghost story simply moves from one victim to the next, and the deaths themselves are not in the same league with those in "Final Destination." Edward Burns and Ray Wise are wasted in secondary roles. If you've never seen an Asian ghost movie or its English-language remake, this is not the place to start. I'd recommend "The Ring" or "The Grudge" or even the considerably less powerful "Dark Water." Each of these films had a strong female lead. Shannon S., while attractive, does not begin to compare to any of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ring meets The Omen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLOT OUTLINE: A group of friends start receiving cell phone calls from themselves in the future, begging for help. Each person begins to see apparitions &amp; when the time of the call arrives, is killed in an 'accident'. Beth Raymond, the last remaining member of the group, along with the detective brother of one of the first victims, tries to solve the mystery before her time is up. The trail leads them to an abandoned hospital where a mother accused of child abuse is reported to have died there.One Missed Call is the latest in a long line of horror films to have been derived from Japanese horror flicks. This remake is directed by Eric Valette, a French director who made horror films in his home country.The best way to describe One Missed Call is as a cross between RING &amp; THE OMEN. The film is filled with people who receive warnings from their future selves before being killed in various ways. The film's plot centres around a curse involving technology ? in this case, cell phones.The problem with One Missed Call is that it is a poor remake of an even poorer Japanese horror film. The film features a lot of cheap CGI effects of some weird-looking ghosts, something that quickly becomes tiresome, not to mention failing to remain in the memory ? each effect can be forgotten the moment they are over. The goal of every horror film is to remain in the viewer's memory, which renders One Missed Call a failure. The other main problem is that the film has an anti-technology stance. This technophobia started in 1971 with the Charlton Heston flick THE OMEGA MAN (which was also a poorly done remake), &amp; seemed to reside in Japan since the moment Ring arrived. It is really stupid to centre a curse around cell phone calls ? the speed at which technology evolves will cause the film to date badly (something which has already started to happen to Ring).That said, the film is actually superior to the original in many ways. Many Japanese horror films employ a skewered narrative &amp; often don't bother explaining their plots sufficiently for the viewer to understand, a problem which befell the original film. This remake manages to explain the various plot points, but drops the ball with some of them ? why do the victims have red jawbreakers in their mouths? What's with the ghostly visions that the victims see before their deaths (not to mention the fact that those visions are nothing more than pop-up effects that Valette inserts in an attempt to drive the film's suspense, something that doesn't quite work)?As far as acting goes, Shannyn Sossamon seems to be just another young adult who clearly wants to extend her 15 minutes of fame, with no evidence of having an acting ability; while Edward Burns (who has had the misfortune of starring in some real turkeys in the past decade) does his best with a role that is too generic to suit his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ineffective horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you are getting a person to make an horror movie, you should at least be sure that that person understands the genre. This just didn't seemed the case with this movie, since it was being one ineffective and even quite boring one to watch.To be fair, the original Japanese movie horror series this movie got based on wasn't already anything to impressive to begin with. But it had a nice concept, so of course it got picked up by Hollywood. And this movie is not so much a remake of any of the Chakushin ari-movies but it's more a stand alone film, that got based on the same concept, of people getting a phone call and hearing their own death in their voice mail, a few days in advance. And really, I think it's nice that this movie is trying to be more than just an ordinary remake and try out some new stuff with its concept, also not in the at least because the Japanese movies were also far from great ones and seemed to have far more potential in it. But problem is that this movie does far too little good or interesting on its own with its concept, which is the most disappointing thing and is what making this movie an ineffective one.Seriously, as an horror movie this one is immensely lacking. I'm not exaggerating when saying that this movie is boring for most part. But this is not just due to the fact that there is not anything happening tension- or horror-wise but more because the movie throughout remains an incredibly flat one. It really made me loose interest in this movie and half way through I was already wishing it would end soon.You just don't care for any of its characters, not because the actors are bad but more because they are very poor writing and the movie has some serious bad dialog in it.As for its actual attempts on horror; It's just weak. It's one of those movies that relies mostly on its main characters looking scared, even though at times there isn't even anything happening. And when it comes to the supernatural, the characters suddenly don't seem to be impressed or shocked at all with what just happened or what hey saw. They go through some pretty traumatic experiences throughout this movie, like seeing some friends die gruesomely in front of their eyes and literally see some ghosts and other outlandish stuff but hey, life must go on they must have thought. The movie also has quite some CGI effects in it, which just never works out too well for any type of horror. No matter how nice it all looks, it just isn't anything scary.One ineffective, shallow, boring, unimaginative horror attempt.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was just looking for a budget DVD to satisfy my evening cinematic needs. This one was three pounds, so I thought 'why not?'. That's all I knew about the film going in, and sometimes such zero expectations can be a good thing. However, this film really was very poor. Was the acting bad? No. Was the direction weak? Not really. So why did it fail so spectacularly? Fundamentally, the script was just poor, unoriginal, and here's the cardinal sin of horror films: unsuspenseful and not in the least scary. The only "scares" came in the form of loud bangs and sudden movements. Really, everything about this film was half-decent, if not spectacular. But the story itself was really just a very very crap version of Final Destination. Final Destination, but with no imagination or thrills.Frankly, it was just boring. Too boring even for a Friday night in silly session. Give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I disagree with the rest of the critics. I kind of enjoyed this film. One problem was at that time when the two girls were in the room and her cell rung. As soon as it rung she instantly became scared. Mind you she was the first and knew nothing of the phone calls. So how could you be so alert so quick. Another problem was the ending. The near end ending sucked. The girl comes in the house and the mom pulls her back. That was pointless. Anyway I liked the very end. When she walks away and the phone rings. Another issue is it copied the ring and final destination a little too much. Phone calls, die in a certain amount of time and whose next pretty much is what this is about. But what saved this movie for me was I liked the ring and final destination.</fullReview>

Although, i must say, that the film did have a lot of potential, but the shoddy plot and story lines that we have seen in other films keep it from being good, and the only good thing about this film was the chilling music. and as for the fake TV show about miracles, what the hell! My advice to anyone watching this movie is that there are no actors worth seeing, the effects are not anything to write home about and the twist is whimsical and dull. NOTE: Everyone in the film seems to have the exact same phones, apart from its colour, which is completely unrealistic! On the plus, Ed Burns who plays the police officer is gorgeous!

Once you figure everything out your reaching and scraping to figure out that all purpose word, "WHY?" At the end of it all, I cant say the movie was a waist of the $1.07 it cost to rent it, but its not something I would ever purchase.

		<fullReview>I'm annoyed with how the movie was presented, even in the trailer. There was literally, nothing to scare me. Everything that could've freaked me out I had already seen in trailers. The closest it came were two sequences, one in an exorcism scene (that failed), and the other in the hospital, both of which fell short. The special effect in the final scene looked pretty, but it didn't scare, it didn't terrify. Some scenes I personally found (to be frank) baffling, and most of the tricks used to scare were the oldest ones in the book. Shannyn Sossamon is gorgeous, and I loved her in A KNIGHT'S TALE, but I hope she picks up something decent before her career plummets miles like the quality of the movie.As far as I'm concerned, the main poster is the scariest part of the movie, which is not saying a lot, to be honest, since it looks pretty laughable anyway. But since you heard it from me, you might as well avoid kidding yourself into thinking that it's anything than worthless clap. I would definitely say that this is a movie you shouldn't bother seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see - yet - the Japanese original film about an eerie string of cell phone related killings via the supernatural. Who knew that modern day telephone signals would/could be inhabited with the spirits of - oops! don't want to give anything away(not really but let's be kind at any rate - the real horror will be your investment of time watching this half-baked story filled with listless actors and a cheap special effects). One Missed Call isn't all bad as some might suggest. There are some somewhat effectively shot scenes. I particularly liked the opening one. The phone going through the names was well-executed as well. Even though none of the nameless - for the most part - parade of actors had much discernible talent. The girls were easy on the eyes. Not a recommendation to see the film but at least something is attracting your attention when you start to slide into the plot netherworld. The story is absurd. I'm still not sure I know what exactly happened, why it happened, and when I do think I understand I ask myself - really? Really? Really? I have heard the Japanese film is much better and will seek it out. This film, while bad for sure, was quick paced enough not to cause severe cases of lethargy. In fact I had no trouble watching what with all the unintended laughs and looks of amazement(unintended again).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The victims in this comedy...er...horror flick receive a phone call that tells when they will be killed, what color shoes they'll be wearing, the brand of their hair gel, who they last kissed, when their last bowel movement was, their grandmother's maiden name, their grandmother's social security number, the name of their favorite indie band, who killed Kennedy, and other startling facts. Once they've been marked, they see strange things like babies on fire, bugs crawling through people's skin, dolls wielding knives, men with pennies jammed up their noses, feet covered in bird feathers, dogs walking backwards, and other unsettling and fairly cliché horror shticks. When the victims finally die in gruesome but accidental ways, a hard candy is found in their mouth, a tattoo telling you where you left your bank card behind their ear..... okay, I'm getting a little bored with this. But honestly, it was just cram-packed with the dumbest, most unrelated visuals I've seen in any movie. The plot resolution isn't much more coherent either. I should have figured this is what I get for an early January release that sneak previews at 10PM on the evening before it opens, and your big name is Margaret Cho.I'm disappointed in this movie for a variety of reasons. Here's the rundown: Atlanta shot movie. I'd love to see good movies come out of Atlanta, but when this is what you associate with the film scene here, it's not much help. I will say the hospital set was absolutely beautiful. I didn't recognize it, but it has to be an abandonment in Atlanta.The trailer was actually pretty good. I usually don't care for horror trailers, but this one was appealing in some way. That's rare for me.It starred one of my new favorite actors, Shannyn Sossamon. She also starred in what was my favorite film of 2007 Wristcutters: A Love Story. She did as much as she could with it, so props Shannyn.Oh, and for once I'd like to see college students living in a dumpy apartment with 9 other people, and not in lavish mansions by themselves. Who are these people? I'd kill them too.One Missed Call is one painful ride. Save your time (thankfully my experience was free), and go see anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, the rules - there are none which means essentially, anything goes and thus the movie becomes more ridiculous because of it. The ghost personally, then only appears to freak people out while they die of apparently natural coincidences, then supposedly is scary enough to cause heart attacks, and so on.Secondly, both a cat (opening scene) &amp; eventually an unrelated character who never received any calls are killed. Why is uncertain.The ghost may be the first murderous spirit whose death was caused by a psychosomatic asthma attack. Any real asthma sufferers should know that inhalers are color-coded with brown inhalers being preventative, thus incapable of stopping an actual attack meaning the sufferer wouldn't have survived anyways.The characters are very bland meaning there isn't much reason for audiences to be interested in their survival. But that's only logical what with victims taking stupid actions like only offering friends to get their numbers deleted rather than wiping all numbers from their phones. They could also stay inside until their predicted death passes. Except then the spirit would attack them personally because the movie lacks consistency.Was it scary? Obviously not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your cell phone...warning of death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit there are a few chills and some pretty creepy situations, but that happens all in the last fifteen minutes of the movie. Otherwise an almost interesting story line and plenty of "eye candy". Beth Raymond(Shannyn Sossamon)witnesses the deaths of two of her friends and heard the eerie voice-mail messages on their cell phones. The haunting thing is that the messages allow victims to hear the last horrifying moments of their lives. The police thinks that Beth is crazy except for one detective Jack Andrews(Edward Burns), who actually has an imagination. Another and another answer the warning of their deaths. The psych student Beth and brave detective must scramble for answers. Are all of the victims connected somehow? Who is responsible for the succession of calls and why. Others in the cast: Ana Claudia Talancon, Johnny Lewis, Rhoda Griffis and Azura Skye. May be more appealing very late on a rainy night; but don't go out of your way.

		<fullReview>Earlier this evening, my friend and I watched this piece of "drek". There are so many typical moments from dialogue to settings, storyline, stock characters and even incidental music that I nearly caught indigestion.At the very first moment of seeing Ed Burns in this film, I said, "there is that actor who always plays a detective", and what do you know... not more than 10 seconds later, he gets a call and a woman refers to him as Detective Andrews.Oddly enough, prior to watching this film, a group of us were discussing films that are bad and 27 dresses came up as a film that was so unbelievably rotten that you could make entertaining jokes about it. After perusing IMDb.com just now to learn Mr. Burns name, we realized he was actually in 27 Dresses... coincidence or not?While it ranks in the top most horrible films, I must admit, we entertained ourselves by laughing and both the variety of inconsistencies and the poor story.I have never seen the original, however I am beginning to tired of these films that are remade for the English/ American audiences. I will NEVER see the demolition of THE EYE, which was originally an amazing film by PANG BROTHERS and dumbed down with the star heavy "acting" of Miss J. Alba.Please stop making these films...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Missed Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sad thing is, this could have been a good movie. It had echoes of the excellent Final Destination trilogy. It had a central plot that was reminiscent of The Ring and Ringu. But it simply failed to deliver in terms of a consistent and coherent plot.It would be wrong to blame the actors, because the acting is strong and credible throughout. It would be wrong to blame the direction because that had some genuinely shocking moments. But the script had more holes than the entire stock of a colander shop.If the movie had ended in the hospital, after about an hour's playing time, it would have been a decent (if somewhat shortish) film. Because they tried to spin it out for another thirty minutes, the plot just seemed to disappear from the face of the script, and the film seemed to be played out for shocks and thrills that had little to do with the plot that had originally been formulated.An intelligent horror movie will leave the audience asking questions. This wasn't an intelligent horror movie, but it still left me asking questions, such as: what the hell happened? and why did I waste my money renting this turkey? Recommend this title to someone you don't like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To call this "horror movie" hackneyed tripe would be complementary to its director and simultaneously detrimental to all the hackneyed tripe that i have choked down over the years.Once you get past the taste of "been there done that" which permeates every single solitary frame of film, you realize that this is a poorly constructed Boost Mobile ad at best and at worst it's an excuse for some unthinking producers and a director to replace "Creepy Zombie-Ghost" eyes with little mouths, because we all know how unnerving Eye-Mouths are.Every aspect of this movie from the pseudo-scary marionette dolls to the "You-will-die-in-XXX-amount-of-time-from-XXX-event-you-cant-control" has not only lost its effectiveness from overuse and abuse, it is insulting to its audience (meaning anyone who saw it, not its target audience of 12-16 year old girls and mongoloids, no offense to mongoloids). I am insulted as a human being that someone would present this as entertainment.Im still trying to find a happy safe haven in this miserably dark sea of sh*t.The shining light came to me at the end, primarily when it was ending. But something other than the fact that it was ending made me smile. I think it was the idea that after an hour and twenty minutes of tissue thin plot, story, characters and completely unsuccessful "Jump Scares", the movie decided, on its own mind you, that it would blow all the windows out of the house and end. Just like that. As if you missed a call...Ohhhhhhhh. Holy sh*t. That is mind-blowing. My mind just went down on itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune of investing 1.25 hours of my life in. I really can't say anything good about this -- not the plot, not the acting, not the direction, nothing. You are not invested in any of the characters (in fact the leading female role is someone I hoped died with the first ring-tone); the male cop breaks more laws than he enforces, and you really couldn't care about him either way. Two lead roles -- 2 people you want dead. One "baddie" you wish would act sooner, has no thrill or suspense value, and is utterly unconvincing as "evil".This movie is not good as a mindless way to waste time on a Saturday afternoon, it's not simple, mindless fun, it's not a thriller, it's nothing but a waste of time.Even watching it for free I feel as if I should demand a refund!PS - If you understand why a call would cost a dime -- you're over 25y/o! ;-)</fullReview>

Both of these movies have a similar plot where this must be some pattern that relates to the death of each character be it fate or a cell phone's contact list. I deem One Missed Call as one of the worst horror/thriller movies I have viewed in a very long time. In fact I cant remember one that falls below this one.

		<fullReview>Why? That is a question commonly asked these days regarding remakes of foreign horror movies. What is the point?? Really...a truly excellent remake is rare these days. This is no exception; One Missed Call is a bland, clichéd "horror" film with very little going for it.One Missed Call is a remake of Takahshi Miike's 2003 Japanese horror film Chakushin ari. Although it wasn't brilliant, it was still a worthy addition to the J-Horror sub-genre. This is just plain crap. Basically following the original, this focuses on a group of friends who receive ominous voice-mails from their future selves...at the time they die. Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon) and policeman Jack Andrews (Edward Burns) team up to find the source and stop it from killing anyone else.It confuses me that the director Eric Valette (who made the French horror Maléfique) could make such a bad movie. Aside from two somewhat creepy scenes this film is just not scary, relying on the formulaic "boo" scares accompanied by loud sound. No one could act, Edward Burns was especially wooden and it didn't help that there was not a shred of character development. Ray Wise was the only actor that gave a decent performance. There were a few neat additions to the story and the ending, although not as good as the originals, was good on its own right.Just do yourself a favour and skip this and watch the original. 1?/5</fullReview>

From that point on, the film relies on a series of loud bangs and faces flying at the camera to make you jump - there is little to no actual build up of tension and you're left with basically no empathy for the characters. To make sure you're aware when the scary bits are coming, the plastic soundtrack does it's best to warn you.The original film is indeed confusing in parts, but this has lost all of the originality along the way. Is the phone cursed? Is it the mother? Is is the child? Was it neither all along?

		<fullReview>I went into this expecting an awful movie. I've read the atrocious reviews--which were to the point of legendary status, and I figured this must be so bad it's entertaining. That's simply not the case.Everything about this movie is bad--everything. In fact, if I were to be teaching a class on what NOT to do in a horror film(or any film), I would show this film as an example. The director's usage of color and light leaves a confusing mood, because he doesn't seem to know what he's doing. The camera work is horrible, unoriginal, and cheesy--but not as bad as the soundtrack is. Direction in this film is unstable, chaotic, and incomplete. All this aside though, the worst aspect of this "film"(I have trouble even calling it that because it would fail a college film class) isn't the terrible acting nor the laughable "special effects." Nope, the worst part about this disaster is the "plot." Indeed, I don't think I've ever encountered a movie with more plot holes, unanswered questions, unrelated scenes, anti-climatic scenarios, or such a ridiculous ending(aside from Black Circle Boys).The "plot" has something to do with some girl who gets cut by her sister, and her mother caught her in the act. However, the mother "should have known" apparently and it never explains why, so you're left to assume she's just a little deviant. Oh, I should mention she(evil little girl) also has asthma and apparently carries it on into her murderous afterlife, because our emotionless main character "hears" this behind her throughout the movie. And the whole reason people hear their death is because this little girl died trying to call her mother, after running out retainer fuel in her locked room. However it's the mother that's been leaving candy in the victims because she's such a nice lady. LAME.The ending was just appalling. Mother comes to rescue the main character for some apparent reason, but "oh no," the ghost girl calls again at the end. Why? WHY? You never know why because these victims were chosen at random, but were "ironically" all friends of each other. You'd think they'd tie this in like they caught the hospital on fire or something, which wouldn't work because that whole scene was irrelevant. It's crap like this that's given horror films such a bad reputation in the modern cinema. Go spend money on pull-tabs or scratchers--you'll get much more excitement than seeing this.</fullReview>

The 70's had some good ones..then the 80's put out fun horror and not so great slasher movies but there was something campy and fun about them. Then SCREAM came out and made horror fun again.....Then movies started coming out like THE GRUDGE and THE RING....and they were crap. They were like a stretched out Marilyn Manson video.The film speeding up and slowing down and all the kids with their mouth wide open and the sucky, predictable jump parts all started to seem like a formula that all the movie companies were using. They were all overblown MTV videos.Here is my take. They get some pretty people, one from each race, and of course make the girl the lead, write a quick lame story with no real ending or plot, write a horrible script and sometimes get a bunch of big bands together and make a soundtrack and here's the big one, they get the best song and make a trailer showing the best parts, best effects, and they give u a trailer that is nothing more than a music video and the trailer is so hyped that the movie looks great, everyone runs to the movie opening weekend, it kills in the box office and by the 3rd week they made their money back and they don't care anymore...its a brilliant way to make money. But thats all its about...we don't want videos, we want movies with good stories, and good characters....stop letting music video directors do movies and get real movie directors in....I am tired of paying $10.00 to watch crap...This movie sucked...I enjoyed the trailer more...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this remake of the Japanese horror film "Chakushin Ari" (2003), several people start receiving voice-mails from their future selves -- messages which include the date, time, and some of the details of their deaths.I saw the trailer for this movie, and I actually found it creepy. Utterly creepy. I'm not kidding. I thought it was one of the best trailers ever made. That's the problem. The good things were in the trailer which gave me no surprises during the movie, with one exceptional twist.I usually like PG-13 J-horror remakes. This seems to be an exception. I don't know why. The movie screamed that it was meant to be rated R, but it didn't, so all of the deaths are off screen or cut quickly. This could have been a good rip-off of "Final Destination," "The Ring," and "The Grudge," but it was just another watered-down PG-13 movie for the teens.Of course, there are a lot of unintentional laughs. The dialog are bad and some performances were really bad. The character, we just don't care. However, probably the only good thing in here, except for the mentioned twist earlier, was the directing. I found it quite above-par. There were also some good CGI, or possibly make-up effect; I couldn't tell.Anyway, the movie was bad. Sure, some may find it good; most will find it bad. So the chance for you to not like it is above average so don't watch it. Don't even...well, don't mind that. A rent is okay.</fullReview>

The actor's in this movie did the best they could with a pretty bad and very pointless storyline (for this reason i reluctantly give them 2 stars for trying to polish a big turd of a movie). But i got the very noticeable feeling that they were flogging a dead horse and should never have agreed to appear in such a rubbish movie in the first place.The movie doesn't have any backbone storyline to it, so at no point did i feel myself getting involved in the the mesh of the movie and have the feeling of panic when something scary happens.In parts, the movie was pradictable, very VERY annoying in other parts - especially a mobile ringtone that is heard at numerous points during the movie to the point of excess - and i feel more annoying than crazy frog ringtone! At about an 1hr 1/2 into this monstrosity - i got my hopes up in the belief that the movie was finally coming to an end, and just as i was about to rush out of the cinema, like i had just been released from a long stint in the slammer - punishment finally over - i get pulled back into my seat to be told - "oh no", "there is another half an hour", "you cant miss the end of it". The last 1/2 hour of the movie just got more pointless and ridiculous by the second. Next time i have 2 hours to kill - i may have to consider hunting down the people who have had any involvement in this movie.2 hours of my life have been taken away and how do i get compensation for that???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What will it sound like when you die? A chain of people receive terrifying cell phone messages of their own final fatal moments. Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon) is traumatized when she witnesses the gruesome deaths of two friends just days apart. Even more disturbing, she knows that both of them had received chilling cell phone messages?actual recordings of their own horrifying last moments.Impossibly, the calls were received days before they died, but each death occurred precisely when and how the messages foretold. The police think Beth is delusional?except for Detective Jack Andrews (Edward Burns), whose own sister was killed in a freak accident that bears a strange similarity to the deaths of Beth's friends. Together, Jack and Beth work feverishly to unravel the mystery behind the ominous calls. But even as they get closer to the truth, Beth's cell phone begins to ring with an eerie tune, and the readout says One Missed Call... Did a drunk make this?! Awful. One Missed Call 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a friend dies after receiving a voice-mail from the future appearing to reveal their last moments, Beth begins an investigation to find out what is going. Teaming up with a detective, Jack Andrews, who's sister also seems to have got the same message, the trail leads back to a missing woman, and a fire at a hospital...Directed by Eric Valette with a screenplay by Andrew Klavan, this is based on a Japanese book and movie. So it's another in a long list of remakes. And while not the worst of them, it's not that good.Like most American horror movies, they seem to think making you jump in your seat is the same as scaring you. It's not. I saw The Orphanage, a Spanish horror movie the night before watching this, and it built up a scary atmosphere through-out without resorting to jumps. Here though, a jump often with a loud piece of music happening at the same time doesn't have the same effect.The cast led by Shannyn Sossamon and Edward Burns are okay, though the script doesn't help and has a lot of plot-holes through out. To be fair, the central story isn't the worst idea, but sadly it has been mishandled.American film companies have lost the plot. I've said it before and I'll say it again - MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND MORE IMPORTANTLY SCARY. STOP REMAKING EITHER OLD MOVIES OR FOREIGN ONES. Of the remakes they've done, a very small number have been at least as good as the original movies. Most have been poor at best. If they can't make something at least as good as the original movie was, then they should just give up.One Missed Call is yet another remake of an Asian movie. I've not seen the original, but I hope it's better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The days of the 'penny dreadful' are over. Now the dreadful costs about $10 on a cheap Tuesday. Laughter is a universal, and some things must be universally funny, because I saw this in German, and as reported in another review, there were giggles from even this foreign-language audience at key points.Having seen it in German does not imply that this reviewer's German is up to scratch. In fact, it's scheisse. I'm a beginner, and most of the dialogue went over my kopf. However, that doesn't mean that I didn't get the movie. Worryingly, I did, thoroughly, which points to the utter predictability of the whole thing.It's almost enough to make you believe that the marketing process of modifying the movie after test groups have seen it is an idea with some validity. Maybe it is, at least when you're looking at the bottom of the barrel - a height to which this flick can only aspire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why on earth did I have to watch this???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must have been one of the worst movie watching decisions I have ever made. At first I was going to watch "Cloverfield". "It is like "The Blair Witch Project. People complain it's confusing and dizzying. Don't waste your money," said the ticket girl. I surely did not want to relive that awful experience at "Blair Witch," when I was at the verge of throwing up despite the fact that I was not even looking directly at the screen for 75% of the running time. So that is why I wound up with this one. I never thought the ticket girl's last words would prove to be so ironic.I knew it was from a Japanese original. And knowing how it went in "The Ring", "The Grudge" and "Dark Water", the American remake would surely suck. I still went into this hoping to get a good scare, which I like once in a while.First the things I liked about it: The beginning was interesting for me. I liked the fact that the main characters were medical students (shades of European horror classic "Anatomy"). And, for their credit, they did get the creepy atmosphere down. They had some scary stuff in those scenes at the hospital when the lead female (Shannyn Sossamon) decided to crawl down an underground tunnel to face the ghost by herself (what horror movie does not have such a scene, really?)However, the silliness and "derivative"-ness of the storyline keeps getting in the way. You cannot help but groan that you have seen all this before. A series of people are getting killed by getting a mysterious voice mail on their cellphone. Then they rush against time in order to find out how to beat the curse before the heroine's time came. Wasn't this also how "The Ring" worked? To top it all off, they also stooped down to copying "Sadako"-like jerky movements (combined with the "Sadako" -like TV image static effect) for the main malevolent ghost at the end.OK, I had a good laugh with myself after watching this. Haha! See you at the Razzies next year, Edward Burns!</fullReview>

Watch the tape and die in 7 days is turned into answer your phone and die on a set time. Find out the mystery and end one's awful fate. Not as well directed, or acted, but the makers did well considering the script. A lot of cheese in One miss call, with the eye candy at the party, and the macho hero cop. The ending is totally like 'The Ring'. I hope this is not because of the writers's strike. I could write a better storyline. A date movie soon to be on pay-per-view. 5 out of 10. My wife likes these types of movies better. Maybe like the movie 'The Ring' instead of seven days something bad happens, one buys a ticket and two hours later something bad happens they see the ending to this cheese flick.</fullReview>

But when you go and see it, it is like crap, horrible, it stinks, and gives a bad feeling in your stomach. This movie had a good plot, but this director was on crack when he did this movie. The movie started good when the prediction was happening the deaths were, then we got to the school. The whole point of that was to waste time, the best he could come up with is a girl who dies and tries to call someone and the teddy bear's song gets recored. And the whole scene didn't make sense, I have never seen a bad movie in my life like this movie except are we done yet but...anyways. Then there was still more and it was finally getting good and then there was the ending, everyone booed. It ends with the cell phoning ringing and the girl is still alive, I could come up with 10 better endings then what the director put. Only three parts I liked, some deaths with a bit of scares, the teddy bear song( creepy music), and getting out of the movie theater. This movie was terrible put only some parts saved it to get 2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another disappointing J-horror retread</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another disappointing remake of another J-Horror film is yet another reason to stop pillaging other countries and their films and try to make something scary that hasn't been done before.The plot concerns people getting phone calls from the future which are messages of their impending death. Once that is established the cast then run about trying to find out why and to make it stop.Forgive me for being slightly snotty and sparse on the details but the film makers seem to have determined that speed is the way to scare people so events seem to happen in very rapid succession so that details are lost and tension is never built (its the cinematic version of this run on sentence). Its almost like watching the film on fast forward. Its a pity since the cast is for the most part pretty good in roles that mostly just ask them to run in lock step toward their appointed demise.The one thing the film gets right is its creepy imagery. Clearly the fleeting ghosts and goblins were loved by someone in the crew since we get to see all of their hideous features long enough to actually put a chill in your bones.If you must see it wait for cable.3 out of 10 for the ghostly images and the couple of deaths that actually manage to be creepy.</fullReview>

This was not scary, was boring and bad.I'm not from United States and in my country i wasted 15 bucks to watch this movie, it was so bad that was hilarious. The acting, really bad and poor, it's a lot of teenagers trying to act (Now you can imagine how bad the movie was). I'll admit, i like Shannyn Sossamon but not in this movie! Here she give the worst acting of her career. I think we can wait for a nominee of Worst Actress (Shannyn Sossamon) and/or Worst Movie on 2009/Razzie Awards.Plot: 'A group of people start receiving voice-mails from their futures selves, including date and time of their own deaths'. Well, they tried, but it didn't worked. I was expecting a good movie with scary moments but it's not. If you like bad horror movies, don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know a movie is bad when the commercials produce more scares than the actual film. It's too bad this came out in 2008, because it could've been said this was the least entertaining horror film of the year. Now this can be branded as the first awful film of '08.Some young adults begin getting calls from themselves giving the date of their soon-to-be death. After they get the call, they begin hallucinating, leading to their deaths. Everything about this is unoriginal. Any scary moment was built on horror clichés that were so obvious a baby could figure them out. The plot unwinding was pointless, because the movie was so dumb the audience doesn't care what the ending is, they just want it to end. There are many plot holes to go along with that. The Boost Mobile sponsorship was annoying and I'm sure they will lose business if anything. The weird looking creatures from the movie poster are terribly unscary and look really fake. The only mild positive is the acting is not terrible, but maybe the bad acting would've made the movie mildly entertaining, because watching this was just torture.Don't expect to scream, because you won't. Don't expect to jump, because you won't. Don't expect a refund, because you probably (unfortunately) won't get one.My rating: BOMB/****. 85 mins. PG-13 for terror violence.</fullReview>

Horror is not what it used to be, and most likely never will be the same. It's all about the money now and not at all about making a good movie.

I am absolutely astounded it was ever released.Looking at Eric Valette's previous directorial credits, it seems he has been quite some distance from mainstream cinema, and it shows. It takes intelligence to make a good horror movie and combine storyline, characterization, mood, and acting abilities to tell a good story.

The acting in this film made it better but for the most part it should not have been made, there is no point in making a film about dead people walking (made already) abused children(need i say more) and cell phones that play a childish ring tone when you get a phone call from yourself showing you how you will die. Although there are a few unknown faces the known actors have disappointed me,stepping down from their usual roles to play horrid static characters is ridiculous. Overall this movie is a waste of time but if you feel the need to waste seven fifty and an hour and forty five minutes to go see it, with nothing else in the world to do, go and see it.

		<fullReview>It's been a good few years since I saw the Japanese original on which this film is based, but as I sat through what is yet another American retread of an Asian horror flick the original kept coming back to me. I had a sense of déj? vu, not just that I'd seen this stuff play out before, but I'd seen it done BETTER. And, in the end, that's the problem with all these remakes: they may have flashes of their own inspiration here and there, they may inject a chill in certain places, but they've been done before. The law of diminishing returns states that the original will probably be better than the remake, and that's the case here.ONE MISSED CALL sticks extremely close to the original story, merely swapping Japan for America and filling the cast with poorer actors, with Ray Wise the only (albeit brief) exception. Edward Burns, as the whispering detective, is particularly bad. For some reason, the exceptionally eerie ringtone of the Japanese film has been replaced by a twee melody, while there's a lot more emphasis on computer-generated ghosts instead of the slow-burning atmosphere that makes the Japanese versions so superior. Each scene is telegraphed so far in advance and so familiar ? by now not just from Asia but from previous remakes like THE RING, DARK WATER, SHUTTER ? that this film ends up becoming entirely redundant and virtually unwatchable.</fullReview>

It was a stupid idea: not only did I still find One Missed Call pretty dreadful, but now it's going to be really hard to force myself to watch the original for fear of it being anywhere near as dumb.And dumb this film certainly is. From the opening scene in which a manky hand pulls a big breasted babe into a pond (quickly followed by her cat) to the predictable ending with yet another malevolent ghostly child wreaking havoc, nothing about One Missed Call makes much sense. An evil spirit that kills via voice-mail; supposedly creepy apparitions that have zero relevance to the story (but look cool, so what the heck...); a corpse that comes back to life to protect the heroine; a reality TV show that broadcasts a live exorcism: what utter twaddle!Maybe none of this nonsense would have seemed quite so bad if the characters in the film were a) likable, b) memorable, or c) had any sense. But they're not, they aren't and they haven't. Shannon Sossaman and pals are your typical vacuous, preening, over privileged, irritating twenty-somethings that regularly populate modern, mainstream American horror; if any of them had names, I didn't care enough about them to remember; and you can be certain that if I got a voice-mail predicting the time and date of my impending death, I would damn well make sure I was in as safe an environment as possible at the given moment, surrounded by my closest friends?not, I repeat, NOT standing in the middle of a road, running across a railway bridge, or partaking in an exorcism.

I liked the scene where she goes to the burnt building and starts searching for the burnt dead body of the mother. That was a good scene, had lots of horror and suspense.The overall idea of receiving a call which will tell you the exact time and date and way of your death , is a good idea in general and a strong foundation for a horror movie.I still think it's not a bad movie.

		<fullReview>I am a guy who knows how to enjoy the bulk of new horror movies that though weak in story, film making, and acting, can still sometimes be entertaining in an odd way. This film is far from that. It is poor and fails in almost every imaginable way.Take every horror cliché, from spooky dolls to hallucinations, mix them up in a bowl of crap, and you have One Missed Call. Some movies can pull off the suspenseful walk through an abandoned building (I love the Saw movies), but this is beyond laughable. It is just irritating how bad it is all put together.I was initially attracted to this because I felt that the premise was somewhat intriguing. Even though I knew it'd be one of those sub-par movies, I still decided to take a dip in the storyline. Good God. The story was not only ridiculously implausible even for horror standards, but it was fragmented and had terrible resolution. It was if they had "How to Write a Horror Film" class and a bunch of 6th graders came to the class and then put this thing together afterward.And Ed Burns. Man? You were in Saving Private Ryan! What happened...Just don't see this movie. Don't. I knew I should have kept to my rule that anything under a 6 on the IMDb rating isn't usually worth seeing. Let alone a 3.2.</fullReview>

Beth, with help from Jack, must race against time to stop herself from dying on the appointed day and time. This is another Japanese remake, much worse than others I've seen like the Grudge series. While the basic story isn't all that horrible, the way the movie is made is just too predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a good remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not think that this was a good remake of the Asian horror film. One Missed Call. After the death of their friend Shelley, Leann Cole receives a voice mail from the future of the date and time when she would die. On the scheduled day, Leann sees weird things and in the exact hour, Leann is attacked by a supernatural force on a footbridge over a train station while talking to her friend Beth Raymond. Beth meets Leann's boyfriend Brian, who also received a call, and sees him die on the street. When her roommate Taylor Anthony receives a call, Beth speaks to Jack Andrews, who tells her that his sister was the first victim of the phone call. This was not too bad a film in the end so i quite enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well...The Poster looked cool!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One day we and my girlfriend decided to got to the cinema about a year back, it was a random decision, and we thought it would be good fun. Upon entering the lobby of the theater, our eyes were cast upon the boards and T.V.'s alike about the movies showing. After being constantly nagged about going to see "27 Dresses", my answer was no all the way. Our final decision was made when we saw the poster of "One Missed Call". It was very appealing to me. We thought hey, its a modern horror movie about phones, Im sure we could get a few scares in there Im sure, how bad could it be? My answer is VERY.Half an hour into the movie, I knew this was going to be the biggest pile of garbage I've ever seen, another reason was that there was 2 other people in the theater, and that is no joke! and Im sure they were thinking the exact same thing. I mean, who starts performing an exorcism on a mobile phone??? I don't think I ever saw something so ridiculous, I loved how they made it look so serious. My girlfriend was laughing too especially with one of the final scenes where our 2 leads are talking and we finally know what exactly is going on in this movie, and I have to say its completely ridiculous.Upon leaving the theater, we were just smiling and saying "worst movie ever" as I glanced across the way and noticed the other young couple smiling, probably also trying to find a way of coping from the sheer embarrassment of watching this movie.Now i never knew there was an original Japanese movie of this, and only found out after looking this up. And after reading the ratings I might get a copy of it in the future, but not for a while yet, as I am still recovering from its pure 90 minutes of highly defined class A Rubbish.From its bad acting and bad script, there are absolutely no redeeming qualities to save this movie. The plot and ending didn't make a bit of sense. Very Poor Movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another boring remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one type of film that I really can't be bothered with, it's boring modern Asian ghost stories. But if there's one type of film that tends to be even worse; it's American remakes of boring Asian ghost stories. I haven't seen the original One Missed Call, and have no intention of doing so; I only sat through this garbage because someone I was with wanted to watch it. The film continues with the theme of the Japanese being scared of plastic objects (started in 1998 by Ringu, in which the lead villain was a videotape). This time it's mobile phones that are the scary baddies. The film begins with a sequence that sees a woman dragged throat first into a pond and dies, leaving behind a strange red jewel. After that, other people begin receiving voicemail messages on their mobile phones that consist of their own screams as they are brutally killed. After a few of her friends are killed, a young woman teams up with a copper in order to get the bottom of the silly mobile phone deaths mystery.Of course, the plot is really ridiculous and despite some attempt to explain why mobile phones are causing the deaths ("its quite possible for supernatural forces to travel through mobile phones" etc), the film never manages to get away from the ridiculousness of the plot and attempts to distract the audience from it mostly come in the form of dull death scenes which help only to make the whole thing feel like even more of a mess. The actual plot itself actually takes a backseat in favour of attempts to scare the audience on many occasions and that's definitely not a good thing considering that the film is already difficult to follow thanks to the fact that it's all so boring. The special effects mostly consist of centipedes and deformed people; both of which gets boring after being shown multiple times. When we finally do get to the end (after what seems like an eternity), few will be surprised to find that it's both stupid and doesn't make sense. Overall, One Missed Call is a rubbish horror film and one that I certainly would not recommend anyone wastes their time on!</fullReview>

This movie is also way to predictable I mean the so called twist at the end I seen that coming all the way. The actors in this are really bad you can that this was one of their first movies or all they had done before is direct-to-video movies. The special effect you just want to through up at. The storyline well all you can say about that is that it really sucks. So make sure you stay away from this movie and if you are thinking about buying it or renting it stay away.

		<fullReview>WTF? Ed Burns phoned in his part, the plot sucks, and it's not scary. The poster art for this movie was cool and it was out on Blu Ray so as a horror fan I was IN, although I had never heard of the movie, and I live in a major market. Now I know why. They grab clichés, exploit a thin plot, and generally this is a waste of time. I got this as a Netflix, so whatever, but what a waste of movie watching time. I can deal with mediocre horror movies - as a huge fan of the genre you expect that more often than not. But this doesn't hold up. I know this is a remake of a Japanese horror flick - but if you are into that grab The Grudge, Dark Water or others that at least have atmosphere. By the time the plot unfolds you will probably be doing something else. And you won't have missed much. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note to Hollywood film producers. Copying off the smart Asian kid might have gotten you by in High School Algebra, but it isn't a scheme for making movies.Once again, Hollywood, showing its total lack of original ideas, filches the plot from a Japanese Horror film, in this case, "Chakushin Ari". A group of college friends start getting phone calls from themselves in the future, at which point they die horrible deaths. Since this was made with a bigger budget, the kill shots are far more impressive, if you are into that kind of things.Obviously, they have to make cultural allowances, such as using a Christian reality TV show instead of a weird Japanese paranormal show, or having a dead father instead of a dead grandmother. However, as a remake, it is pretty faithful, with almost all the plot elements intact.The acting is adequate and the cinematography is okay, but really, you don't care about any of these characters any more than you do about any other dead teenager film.</fullReview>

She gets killed in a pond and I was sitting there waiting for the eyebrows to pop back up.I don't know what's worse: that the U.S. remade this ridiculously contrived Japanese movie or that the original was a big hit in Japan. The Japanese are not stupid, yet this completely forced and stupid idea for a movie made a lot of money over there. It's amazing.Haven't we had enough of these "your device that leads to your death" movies? This one is like "The Ring" for the cast of "Deliverance." Really dumb people get killed off by some really bad CGI and this isn't the first poor CGI film Ed Burns has been apart of. I guess his career has went in the toilet.I want to say "enough of these 'possessed electronic devices'" movies but I'm sure the "Killer Ipod" is only a year or two away.</fullReview>

I lost 87 minutes of my life + another 20 downloading this tripe. There's no character development whatsoever and the actors are horrendously bad and so is their dialogue. The plot gets very confusing towards the end and you find it hard to pay full attention 'cos you already know the outcome. I've never seen Chakushin ari, but I'm 99.9% sure it's better than this. It's not scary in the slightest and you can't help but burst out laughing during some of the scenes. That's the only form of entertainment there is in this movie. Unfortunately, I didn't watch it to laugh, I watched it to scream - and I didn't. Not once.Trust me, miss this movie.</fullReview>

The only time i was actually a bit creeped out was when i checked my phone and it said that i have One Missed Call(which later on i found out it was only my brother, no monsters with mouths instead of eyes.) The acting is awful, The plot is really bad and it does not make much sense. You get a voice message and you start to see weird things and two days later you die. Once again Hollywood steals a movie from Japan and remakes it. This movie is much like The Grudge (another horrible movie), and I'm sorry to say that there actually might be a sequel to this crap.

		<fullReview>OK so, what I am known for in my reviewing is the fact that I will not give away a single detail, nor will I even hype up the movie. I don't intend to do that for this film, simply state, go see this movie for a little fun. Yes thats what Ill say about the film. Although I cant give it a full 10 stars, I can give the move 7. This is pretty much THE first horror flick of 2008, and I have to say that it was a job well done. If anything, I feel that this movie was just a little bit too much of a copycat. Another thing that I am known for is my being a Saw movie fan ( and yes Im dying for 5! ), this film was just too obvious in its presentation at times using elements like the graphics and sound portrayal of the antagonist was obviously that of Sonora in The Ring. There was a lot of demonic and religious portrayal making it feel like a classic cult film. Finally the use of low-lighting and a theme song, was a little too much like my idol, Saw. The only thing that I really saw in this film was the unique ability to renew the fun sensations of being in fear and suspense for these elements. So by far not the best film, but its highly enjoyable, and also a good running start for the year 2008. Go out and have fun with it. I know I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, But Far From The Grudge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with most J-horror films, "One Missed Call" is more than just cheap scares and screaming, but thought provoking and insightful. However, unlike it's predecessors "The Grudge" and "The Ring" this movie wasn't truly terrifying. While "The Grudge" explored our safety zones and made them feared (e.g. the bed scene), "One Missed Call" fails in it's attempt to create a terror with a cell phone. The premise is scary, but the execution is not. While "The Ring" was thoroughly planned and every piece of the puzzle had a convincing explanation, this movie failed to give us satisfactory answers and some phenomena went unexplained entirely. Don't get me wrong, the film was scary and full of tense scenes that had me paying rapt attention to the film. But again, the film fell short with its acting power. The lead roll never displayed enough emotion or fear and that toned the terror down by too much. The movie wasn't the worst I've ever seen, but it definitely wasn't the best. See it only if you love Japanese horror as much as i do, otherwise, wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

Yes, there are just the simple pop-up scares, but some of the scenes were very nicely done... a bit cliché... but still. Death scenes were an upgrade compared to recent remakes -- yes, they were still tame, but however slickly and stylishly done. There is a lot of creepy visuals and creepy atmosphere. The actors and actresses play their roles pretty good. The only negative I can think about this movie is the pop-up scares-a-second.So all in all, the movie is pretty good. It is a lot better than some other Asian horror remakes and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Old Testament is a collection of thirty-nine books about the history and religion of the people of Israel. The authors of these books are unknown, and each book possesses a unique tone, style, and message. Individually, they include stories, laws, and sayings that are intended to function as models of religious and ethical conduct. Together?through hundreds of characters and detailed events?they represent a unified narrative about God and his attempt to relate to humankind by relating to a specific group of people.The Old Testament contains four main sections: the Pentateuch, the Former Prophets (or Historical Books), the Writings, and the Latter Prophets. This study guide covers books from the first three sections.The Pentateuch The Pentateuch comprises the first five books of the Old Testament. It depicts a series of beginnings?the beginning of the world, of humankind, and of God's promise to the Israelites.Genesis, the first book, opens with God's creation of the world. The perfect world falls into evil when humans disobey God, and the human population divides into separate nations and languages. After many generations, God speaks to a man named Abraham. God makes a promise, or covenant, with Abraham to make his descendants into a great nation and to give them a great land. Abraham shows strong faith in God, and God seals his promise with a number of signs and tests. This special covenant with God passes on to Abraham's son, Isaac, and to his grandson, Jacob. Together, they represent the patriarchs, or fathers, of the Israelite people. Jacob's twelve sons move to Egypt after the youngest brother, Joseph, miraculously becomes a high official in Egypt.In the Book of Exodus, the descendants of Jacob's children have become a vast people, but the Pharaoh of Egypt holds them in slavery. God chooses one man, Moses, to rescue the Israelites. God sends ten plagues to Egypt, and, with miraculous signs and wonders, Moses leads the people out of Egypt and across the Red Sea. They go to Mount Sinai, where God appears in a cloud of thunder over the mountain and affirms to the Israelites the promise he made to Abraham. God commands them to worship only himself, and he gives them various ethical and religious laws.The books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy continue the explanation of God's religious laws and his promises to the people. The people must keep these laws to enter and enjoy the promised land, toward which they are heading. Despite God's presence, the Israelites complain and disobey incessantly, inciting God's wrath. They wander the wilderness for forty years in search of the promised land. These books continue the period of Moses's legendary leadership and miracles, until his death at the end of Deuteronomy.The Former Prophets The Former Prophets, or the Historical Books, cover the history of the Israelites from Moses's death to the fall of the nation in 587 b.c. In the books of Joshua and Judges, the Israelites successfully conquer the land promised to them by God, but they disobey God by worshipping the deities of the surrounding peoples. Neighboring nations invade and oppress the Israelites. God saves the people of Israel by designating judges, or rulers, to lead the people in warding off their enemies.The two books of Samuel (First Samuel and Second Samuel) cover the rise of the united kingdom of Israel. Israel's religious leader, Samuel, appoints a king named Saul. Saul disobeys God, however, and God chooses another man, David, to be Israel's king. King Saul attempts to kill the young David, but fails. Saul's death closes the first book. In the second book, David establishes the great kingdom of Israel. He conquers Israel's surrounding enemies and establishes Jerusalem as the religious and political center of Israel.The books of Kings (called 1 Kings and 2 Kings) trace the decline of Israel's success. God blesses David's son, Solomon, with immense wisdom. As king, Solomon expands Israel into an empire and builds a great temple in Jerusalem. Solomon disobeys God by worshipping other deities, and, at his death, the kingdom splits into a northern kingdom, Israel, and a southern kingdom, Judah. A host of evil kings leads the two kingdoms away from worshipping God. Despite the attempts of the prophets Elijah and Elisha to halt Israel's wrongdoing, the two kingdoms fall to the Assyrian and Babylonian Empires. Jerusalem is destroyed, and the people are sent into exile.The Writings The Writings are placed after the historical books in the Christian Bible. Some of these are narratives covering the time of Israel's exile in other nations and its eventual return to the homeland. The Book of Esther, for example, tells the story of an unassuming Jewish girl who becomes the queen of Persia and boldly saves the Jewish people from genocide.Many of the Writings are books of poetry and wisdom, among the most important literature in the Old Testament. The Book of Job is a lengthy dialogue investigating God's justice and the problem of human suffering. The Psalms are lyrical poems and hymns?many attributed to King David?that express humankind's longing for God. The books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes?similarly attributed to the wise King Solomon?offer sayings and instructions about the meaning of life and ethical behavior. Lastly, the Song of Solomon (also attributed to Solomon) is a romantic, lyric dialogue between a young woman and her lover. Love you. Bye. -Two White Girls and Yen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never watched the French version of "One Missed Call" and I only watched this version because I had nothing better to do. At the end I came up with writing this review thinking that it was one of the funniest (should I say horror?) movies I have ever watched in my life. Nothing scares, there's too much fuzz about nothing and in the end you're gonna say "What's the whole point of this movie?" and if you're open minded you may think that Hollywood just made an entertaining and unintentionally laughable movie."One Missed Call" is a poor mix fruit salad between two great horror movies: "The Ring" and "Final Destination". Instead of a video tape that says people are going to die in seven days we have a cell phone that rings with an annoying ring tone and when people answer it a message replies with some strange sounds, and then people starts to see visions and weird stuff and then lately they die. Instead of seven days this was reduced here for two days. The "Final Destination" similarity comes from when the lead character discovers that there's a order to avoid her own death by tracking the original call. So what's the big deal? Beth (Shannyn Sossamon) and Detective Jack Andrews (Edward Burns) starts to investigate the reason behind of these non scary deaths involving Beth's friends, Jack's sister, the strange phone calls and the red candy that appears in the mouth's victims. It starts like a suspense film but quickly evolves to a horror film that is not scary, it's 95% pointless, and closer to the ending came up with one of the worst quotes I've ever listened in the whole history of cinema. When Beth discovered all what's happening she replies to Jack on the phone something about spirits. Later the cab driver who's taking her to the place she wants looks strangely to her. It's really funny this scene, not only because of what she says, is that because she studies Psychology at college and then she believes in ghosts and stuff? C'Mon this is ridiculous. Spirits through the cell phone could be a good idea if this spirits were scarier than an cannibal and if they a good "reason" for killing people. Example: The reason why "Poltergeist" worked was that the spirits on Carol Anne's house wanted her to guide them to the light (path to Heaven) and she was the only one who could do that. The reason of why "One Missed Call" missed a good chance to be a good movie is that people die just because an evil child girl stabbed her sister in the hand, the mother saw the action, later locking her in the bedroom and then she died of an asthma attack. That's why several people died in the whole movie? And what about the cute and poor cat drowned in the pool? POINTLESS AND UNNECESSARY FILM!Among the bad, funny and non scary moments are: Beth's brother death (he's too much annoying with that macho kind of behavior and I couldn't care much for him and for any other character in this travesty); the possession on Beth's friend in the church; the scene in the cab again. The only thing that makes this movie worth seeing is Ray Wise's presence as a TV show host specialized in fighting strange possessions. After playing the devil himself in "Reaper" and a strange monster hunter in "Jeepers Creepers", the irony in casting him as this senseless character was quite good. And because of him and Edward Burns this movie obtains a four star review plus it was easy to follow. If you enjoy the IMDb boards with the subject "100 Lessons I Learned Watching..." add this lesson to the list: I learned with this movie that a body can be totally burned in a arson and the cell phone can be intact, almost new. Failed! 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, let's just not go too fast... Probably you all know that this is the remake of the original Japanese version, known as "Chakushin ari". All of you that watched that movie must have got some impression about it. It's the way that the story is told, how an everyday life can suddenly turn into something beyond everyone's comprehension; an announcement of unimaginable death via your everyday and everyplace companion - your cell phone! Of course, if you retold the plot of the movie to someone with a-bit-less-imagination, he would be like: "Whoooa, dude, like, you mean, the cell phone kills you?" I believe that the same "dude" would crap his life out his nose if he just saw the trailer! Why? Because the people are scary and look like monsters? OMG!!! It's quite easy to stare at the screen and hopefully be knocked down by the horror provided by a seventy foot tall jellyfish with blades instead of tentacles spitting blood and human body parts all over the city! That is not supposed to be relevant. No! "One missed call" doesn't provide such experience. Although it's an American remake, it's still quite storytelling. Again, you face your own decadence at an exact time as shown before on the phone display and you speak the same words pronounced by you in the near future, hearing all that through your voice mail! Just go didactic! Think about what a phone could represent, why such connections, what does the plot tell you? Be objective and pay your attention to the details. I tells much more...

		<fullReview>This is the awful remake of a Japanese Horror flick. Actually, I don't even think that Hollywood should look Asia for Horror inspiration. Hollywood has given much better horror flicks. Barring "The Ring" none of the Asian Horror can match Hollywood's horror flicks. One missed Call is no different. It was boring, pretending to be creepy with confused ending. There are too many plot holes. The lead actors were poor in acting. The visual effects were complete crap. Funny looking ghosts were however fun to watch. Mobile phones in the movie shown were outdated models with external antenna. They could have shown other brands also.This missed call was meant to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Milking the Asian Horror cash-cow...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A spirit leaves a voice mail on a mobile with a recording of the owner's future last words and death; when that person dies, their telephone mysteriously dials someone else in their address book and the pattern continues ad nauseum. That's the basic premise of the movie, with the main character and her local police officer trying to find the original caller before her own time is up.The first thing that came to mind after leaving the cinema was 'How many more of these Asian horror remakes are they going to try to reproduce?'. We've already had 'The Ring' and 'The Ring 2', 'Dark Water' and 'The Grudge', with 'Shutter' and 'The Eye' due out in the U.K. within the next month. While the original versions probably had their good points - mostly that they were original - I couldn't help but feel U.S. studios were starting to milk this cash-cow a bit too much. The cinematography and tone of all the films are virtually identical, all with a similar ending of some malevolent troubled spirit tormenting people from beyond the grave. As such, the films is more than slow in parts - I sneaked out for the loo halfway through - came back and had missed nothing at all.There's no gore - it's a 15 rating in the UK - but very little suspense either, with the death scenes reminding me a little of those in the 'Final Destination' series, except that you can see them coming a mile off. As I said, the ending doesn't really make up for it either - with some irrelevant story of the spirit of an abusive sister responsible for the calls - and then some predictable 'twist' where, when you think the whole thing is over, the eerie ring tone starts again.As Saturday night, teenage horror fodder, you could do a lot worse - and it's all down to personal taste - but I'd have rather spent the six quid on something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and nowhere near as bad as people are saying it is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Missed Call has unfortunately been receiving a lot of terrible reviews. People have called it the worst movie ever, people have called it hilarious and bad and the critics have slaughtered the film from top to bottom, like they always do. I was excited to see the movie and wasn't put off by all of these negative remarks from a lot of people, and I have finally seen it and can easily say that people are definitely overreacting with their hate towards this movie. It's not the best, but one of the worst ever? Definitely not. It's almost shameful that "The Grudge 2" has had more praise thrown towards it.Beth (Shannyn Sossamon) and her friends find themselves being killed off in mysterious ways, when they receive mysterious phone-calls telling them details of their deaths as well as their last screams heard over the phone. Beth teams up with a detective (Ed Burns) and the two hope to solve this, and keep as many lives saved as possible. One Missed Call gets straight to the point and thats one of the things I really like about this movie - it's not what you'll expect with the whole time frame of the movie. The plot also gets more interesting and towards the end of the movie, they throw in a nice revelation as to who is behind everything and I loved this twist.You may go in expecting most of the characters to have lasted throughout most of the movie, but this isn't the case. Characters begin dying straight away, and I loved this as I didn't expect it. I mean, they killed off Meagan Good (and her cat) in the opening scene, which is shocking and surprising (yet funny when the cat gets it). Some characters could have been in the movie a little longer, but all the actors made an impact, developed their characters enough and made them likable. The actors all do great jobs and Shannyn Sossamon, having seen her as a lead before, does a great job again as a lead character. Ed Burns was good, and the supporting roles including Ana-Claudia Talancon, Johnny Lewis, Meagan Good and Azura Skye are also great. There's even a few cameos here and there, including Laura Harring which was nice to see.The movie isn't the most suspenseful as it could have been, but the death scenes are really entertaining, the ghostly images we are presented with are quite creepy and there is some suspense here and there. The deaths were almost like deaths from the "Final Destination" series and they were great fun, and if you are a cat lover you'll probably go nuts over the opening scene. I really don't know why this movie is getting bashed so much, as it really isn't that bad. I mean, people had it in for the movie before it was released and some people are saying they found the movie "Hilarious", yet they give the movie such a low rating? Well, the makers of the movie are aiming to entertain you...and if you find the movie funny, then you were entertained and should give it a better score than a 1/10! Seriously, this movie is not the "worst ever" like people are labeling it. It's far from it.Overall, I think One Missed Call is a great, fun flick which is having too many harsh things said towards it. It could have been better in parts, but the overall outcome is really good. The plot is entertaining, the movie has a range of great actors, the movie has it's fair share of creepiness, the death scenes were great and more. I'd say don't listen to the people bad mouthing the film, just watch and enjoy!7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie. Go see it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie was by far the best movie i have seen in theaters in a long time.. i saw it with my friends and i gave my friend a bruise i was squeezing her arm so hard from being scared. we screamed extremely loud when the corpse behind beth started to move close to the ending. however, parts of the movie were more funny than scary... such as when we see the monster child playing with a cell phone in a crib beneath the burnt down hospital. also, i didn't quite get the bit about the candy. i mean sure they said about it when they were discussing how Ellie was the one hurting laurel and then laurel said 'But she always gave me candy', but then why did all the victims wind up with the candy? what does it have to do with anything? and why was the corpse hidden down in the tunnels of the hospital anyway? and was it just me, or did it look like the corpse was going to try to kiss beth when it got on top of her? anyway, i recommend this to all people who enjoy thrillers..its not so much gory as it is suspenseful.. but very impressive to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really thought this movie was going to be just another stupid, confusing film, like The Grudge 2, but boy, was I wrong! When my dad and I went to see it, I was really skeptical at first. During the previews, I thought, "It's probably going to start out with some girl getting a call from someone, just like The Ring, saying, like, 'I'm gonna kill you tomorrow at 7:00 pm,' but when the movie started, I loved the mysterious beginning, when Shelley's cell phone automatically starts dialing Leann's number after she was pulled into the water and candy came out of her mouth, which is another mysterious connection. I loved how everything connected, and each time someone got a call, another connection was noticed. And I liked how they thought it was Marie Layton who killed her child and started the curse, but in the end, they figure out it was the daughter who was evil, and the mother didn't know that she died because she had an asthma attack and she was locked in her room for torturing her sister, so she had no way of hearing it. I also appreciated the setting of the foster home, and how Detective Andrews surprisingly found another earlier mentioned Nanny Camera, leading to more clues. Although this material was somewhat original, I thought it was much like The Ring and The Grudge. It was a Japanese horror film, relating to both of the movies. It related to The Grudge, because it is a curse passed on through two dead people, but in the end, the main character unexpectedly is saved from death. It's very similar to The Ring, because it's based on phone calls, a 'cycle' that passes on, and the main character and her accomplice do so much research, to find an unexpected loophole-type thing, and where the main character surprisingly is saved from death more than once. But it's still a great movie, and it almost made me cry at the end, when Marie saves Beth from Ellie again.This was a straight-up creepy movie, and I'd recommend it to any mild horror movie fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Save your money, skip this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Japanese movie was excellent, when i heard there was a remake i knew it was either going to be absolutely awful, or pretty awesome, unfortunately it was terrible. I found myself bored most of the movie and laughing during the "scary" parts because of how weak they were. The acting is pretty sub par, Ed Burns is the only decent actor in the whole movie. Every death scene cuts away instead of actually having to show any gore or any action at all, how it even got a pg-13 rating is beyond me, my 50 year old mother could definitely watch this movie without being scared. Do yourself a favor watch the Japanese movie, if you don't like subtitles it is dubbed in English too and well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Missed Opportunity to watch something better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slick, MTV-ish production and editing styles cannot save, or perhaps damn, this feature, another in a long line of remakes of Japanese films. Not only is there nothing new here, you can trace the plot to several different origins: Twilight Zone, Stephen King, The Ring, Sole Survivor(that 1983 flick that so many films today seem to be ripping off), and Final Destination.The film is insanely predictable, which is probably why it is so reviled. The acting is acceptable, the feel of the film overall is adequate, but there is no soul here. It's not even a fun good-BAD movie. It's just blah. I was counting the minutes until it was over so I could move onto a better movie. I didn't care about any of the characters because the film was so formulaic and drew from so many other well-known sources, I knew who would die and frankly, couldn't wait for them to go.Without giving away too much, although you'll hardly care, an asthmatic in a hoodie is stalking people through their cell phones! Ooooooo! There is even a "cell phone exorcism." Do I really need to expound on that? No, I don't. And if the one "entity" that was the good guy had showed up 5 seconds earlier, a key character could have lived. Lame! This isn't even a rainy day movie. There is no gore and no fun, just some PG violence. It has the typical shaky-faced baddie you've seen in countless movies over the last 5 years. There's a simple solution for the film's characters to avoid their fate: don't answer unknown calls and stay together in a group during the appointed "times." Also, since the phone records your last words, don't say anything! The characters are not fleshed out at all except for the final girl who throws a heap of childhood baggage on us 60 minutes into the movie.Watch The Grudge instead if you have a terrible itch to watch some American remakes of J-Horrors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highlight of the night was free popcorn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't remember when it was I saw this, but it was in an old movie theater 30 minutes from where I lived. Just the start of the night was eerie. A couple of my buddies wanted to go see this movie, I knew nothing about it but never turn down a movie trip. After paying for the ticket and passing the booth, the lobby was empty.. completely silent, no one walking around, no noise. The only break in the dead silence was the Wall-e promotion that talked as you walked by, except it was gurgling more or less. We enter the actual movie theater, with 5 minutes to spare before start of the movie.. no one.. not a single person in any of the seats. It remained this way for the entire movie, no late comers, not even an usher to look around. With such freedom, we picked top row and I found a bucket of popcorn nearly full. Snatched the f (because the f word is apparently banned from IMDb) out of that and enjoyed free 10 dollar popcorn. The intro started and we relaxed to what we thought was gonna be at least a C level movie.Now that I've bored you with a needless story, let me preface by saying that is the extent of the good times i had watching the movie (not to mention the only parts I remember of that portion of the night). That short story about someone you don't care about and have zero interest reading about was how One Missed Call's plot played out. It is a carbon copy of generic horror movies of it's time. Now, even if this came out before the likes of The Ring and The Grudge and so forth and so forth.. It was still terrible. The cgi was unnecessary, the character development was nonexistent, the twist was as creative as witch costumes on Halloween, and jump out scary parts were laughable at best. I rolled on the floor laughing when I saw the dead cgi baby dialing on the cellphone, it nearly put me in tears, and I'm the kind of person who is scared very easily by jumpy kinda movies. To this day I still state "dead baby dialing a phone" when ever it comes up in conversation.In general, I blocked this monstrosity of a movie from my mind. I literally don't remember any specific scenes other than that.Would I recommend this movie? For laughs, yes, maybe to some people I don't like, never to anyone I cared about or loved. This movie was stupid, boring, a joke of a horror movie, even worse than just about every crappy low budget horror films. I can honestly say I'd rather gouge my eyes out with cow dung and a dull, rusty spoon than watch this movie again. There are very few movies in my mind that I can say that about, a hypothetical action that was thought up while watching Epic Movie, the trash of a movie that was.Leaving the theater was like a breath of fresh air, and life. People were gathered around the theater that was previously abandoned, as well as employees actually maintaining upkeep. It was a completely different setting, I think the Wall-e promotion actually talked too. Leaving the once empty building, one of my buddy's phone began to ring. He looked down at it, and as soon as he did it stopped. The message one missed call shone proudly and brightly across his screen. We all looked at each other and laughed into the cool, breezy darkness.See, I can write a better horror than One Missed Call without even trying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Ring" meets "The Grudge"--Seriously...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was average at its best.Its premise is that there is a story of a women who has two children, both of whom are girls, and one is basically the quote, unquote "bad one" and the other is the good girl. The bad girl tries many ways to hurt her sister, thus making her mom to take sides and leaving the "bad girl" behind, in a closed room, to have an asthma attack.Both the mother and the "good daughter" were in a hospital, when it caught on fire and the mother died, yet the little girl survived. For the entire movie they are trying to trace the calls back to the source to see where they are coming from and how they started.So that is basically what it is about in a nutshell. The movie itself has so many other attributes to the plot, that it could take me awhile to explain. But as for the movie itself, my title explains it all. All of the so called "monsters" all look like the demons that we have seen in the ring. Also all the phone calls that the victems get with a future date and time of death is basically the premise that the Ring had.The movie overall, to put it simply, was pretty bad. It had the clichéd scary movie attributes about it. ie.(loud noises,"spooky faces" and a very predictable plot) Nothing here was very shocking or gut-wrenching, but it did have it's good moments. The movie basically starts off pretty slow, even though you witness your first death pretty soon into the movie. The middle of the film was pretty good, it kept you on the edge of your seat for a bit, and towards the end, it got back to its low points.Since the movie is PG-13 there is seriously very little blood, which is pretty upsetting. Most of these deaths would call for blood in real life, but very little is present. So that was a bummer. But other than that, if you have to pay for it, I wouldn't. But if you have a buddy that can get you in for free or something, do that instead.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. It was good from start to finish. There was about was about 1 slow part but it was quick. There wasn't to many intense scenes. They were mostly quick pop up scenes. This movie doesn't have that much blood in it. The acting was pretty good and the story was good. I don't know why people think this is like The Ring and The Grudge. I think it is more like Final Destination. I like these kind of movies. You might have a different opinion on this, but overall it was a good movie. I wouldn't give it 10/10 though. I would see this again if I had a chance to. Don't go see this if you hate scary movies of course. I rate movies pretty descent. The movie overall gets 9/10 for being such a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Chakushin ari Instead, trust me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay first off the story of the movie is good and before watching it I heard it was a remake of the film Japenese horror Chakushin ari. But I couldn't be bothered to see a Japanese movie and sit through reading subtitles my mate got me tickets to watch this and the film was okay, not too bad, basically mediocre. Eric Valette the director does a reasonable job of taking you to the edge of your seat but when you get to edge the whole scene is ruined by the terrible acting by Shannyn Sossamon, Azura Skye, however Burns kept my faith in the movie. The movies is about several people start receiving voice-mails from their future selves telling the time of their death. To be honest the film was quite nerve racking and did get my heart racing at times. Is it worth it for the pictures - no ( especially if your in college and you don't have 12 bucks then don't. Is it worth it for the DVD - no. Is it worth renting - yes.</fullReview>
