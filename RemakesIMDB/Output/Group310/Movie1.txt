		<shortDescription>Creepiest Movie That You Never Even Heard Of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one of those little movies that never got much in the line of studio promotion or advertising budget. You might have seen it, single copy on the bottom of the Video Rental Shelf. You probably passed it by, assuming it was some 'straight to video' D-Grade Horror, or maybe some embarrassing first film of Ewan McGregors being resurrected to cash in on his new fame?If you love creepy suspense thrillers than I bet you will be as surprised as i was. ITS GOOD!I might have a psychological bias since I have worked in a morgue, but the cold wet atmosphere, chilling lighting and downright suspense had me creeped out and twitching all the way through.Ewan McGregor is solid as always and a fantastic sympathetic character if there ever was one. I really have to say something about Josh Brolin here - what a great performance. A scene between him and Alix Koromzay (Joyce) was one of those amazing little scenes you cant forget! Let me also say something about Nick Nolte in this - FREAKY. Some might find his character 'too predictable' but I don't think you need to worry about finding out 'who done it' either, you just cringe and chill at how bloody creepy Nolte is!Yes, this is somewhat campy and occasionally wry and I loved it - Brad Dourif makes something of a 'Cameo' (not really but with him it feels like it heh) and you gotta smile at that. It doesn't abuse the tongue in cheekiness though.. It really does take itself just seriously enough to win.European to American Remakes often fall short but this time the same Director made both and well done! Direction was absolutely perfect for me and I found it clever enough and creepy enough to give it a very solid Seven out of Ten.Definitely one of those 'Under-rated but surprisingly good!' movies and its a shame most people never saw it come and go!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sporadically enjoyable thriller which can't live up to its premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Student Ewan McGregor gets himself a part time job in a morgue, he presumes this will give him some quiet time as he studies for his degree. However, in this morgue the dead don't rest easy- it would appear that a serial killer who also indulges in necrophilia is making occasional visits. Could this just be paranoia on McGregor's part? It would appear not as he soon becomes chief suspect...This promising premise is let down, in part, through the unsure direction of Ole Bornedal. The film begins in a vein not dissimilar to that of Se7en and seems to be setting up for a serial killer/thriller style. This soon changes to an approach more suited to teen slashers and then switches to a horror style before seeming to flick between them at will. This mix doesn't gel well at all and leaves the film feeling a little lost at times.Josh Brolin who plays Ewan McGregor's friend in the film plays a character you feel like you have seen a hundred times before in teen slashers: plays by his own rules, pretty unlikeable but has his good side and you have your suspicions about him by the first scene. Ewan McGregor gets the paranoia spot on but is by and large quite forgettable, the same could be aimed at Patricia Arquette.For its faults, there is still enough on offer to merit a watch. The scenes which take a more horror style approach work very well in the morgue and do give quite a tense atmosphere at times. Also, Nick Nolte turns in an eye-catching and enjoyable performance despite playing a role which you feel he could do in his sleep (he's playing a gruff detective). And Brad Dourif is perfectly cast as the creepy duty doctor, his knowing performance raises a smile.The film has enough to keep you watching to its conclusion but will leave you disappointed at not being able to fully deliver on what could've been a very affecting thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It´s a pretty long time ago since I have seen Ole Bornedal´s original from 1994, so I can´t remember several details, but I think he has done good work with his remake: the atmosphere is creepy and nightmarish, the cast featuring Ewan McGregor, Patricia Arquette, Josh Brolin and especially Nick Nolte does a solid job. My favorite performances however come from two supporting actors: the one is Brad Dourif playing a weird autopsy doctor, the other is the uncredited John C. Reilly, who is still one of the most underrated great actors in my opinion! All in all director Ole Bornedal has made a well done remake, which is probably no revolutionary film , but in comparison to Gus Van Sant´s awful "Psycho"-rip off a real masterpiece!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have you ever been killed before?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Nick Nolte for all intents and purposes looking like Boris Karloff as the Frankenstein monster but without the use of makeup is police inspector Thomas Cray who's in charge of a special police task force trying to find and capture, dead or alive, a serial killer. The killer for some weird reason has a habit of cutting out the eyes of his dead victims, all women, and then raping their corpses. It seems that the killer wants to quit the business of serial killing but at the same time wants the police and the law to leave him alone and stop hunting him down so he can enjoy his retirement. This sets up the story for young law student Martin Bell, Ewan McGeror, who just got a job at the local medical examiner building as a night watchman where all the recent murder victims of the killers are kept. The killer plans to frame young Martin as can then be free from being tracked down and arrested for the crimes that Martin will be jailed for. "Nightwatch" has it's share of cheap thrills and a number of twists and turns in it's story but their very unconvincing in how the killer, who you can spot almost as soon as you see him, is so hard for the police to find when his actions are so insane and weird just like those of the murderer.The film-makers put two people into roles that would make you think that their the real killer of the people in the movie. One is so obvious that you just know that he didn't do it and is just a red herring put into the movie to get you and the police off the track of the real killer. There's also a fact that he, the killer, once worked in the medical examiner's office some time ago and was dismissed for messing around with the corpses. All that is in the medical examiners record department which should have been a dead give away to everyone involved just too who he really is. There's also some scenes in the movie that focus on a photo of Lewis Paine, thats pinned to the wall in the night watchman's office one of the people executed for the murder of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865. This seems to indicate to the audience that he, or his ghost, may have something to do with the killings but in the end nothing ever comes of it and he's completely forgotten well before the movie is over. There's also a very mixed-up sub-plot in the movie between Martin's friend James, Josh Brolin, and a hooker he picked up at the local bus station Joyce, Alix Koromzay,who he's trying to get Martin to have an affair with her. This moronic attempt by James is to give him a high since it seems that the normal high he used to get with women by having sex is no longer there and even having the hell beat out of him to get high doesn't work either.Joyce's relations with Martin, which are almost next to nothing, has his girlfriend Kathy, Pat Arquette, leave him and in the end. Sure enough Joyce ends up being a victim of the on the loose serial killer and Martin, becomes the prime suspect just like the killer wanted in the crime. The ending of "Nightwatch" had the usual damsel as well as good guy both in distress with the crazed killer having them both tied down on a table in the mortuary and about to cut both their skulls open with an electric slicer. It's then when the person who was made to look like the killer during the entire movie coming to their rescue, minus a thumb, blasting the real killer away and sending him to his just reward. "Nightwatch" is a watchable horror/suspense movie but it's hard to take seriously at all due it it's very predictable and unconvincing story and the killer is so obvious that you can easily spot him well before the movie reveals his true identity.</fullReview>

I can honestly say this is the first film in a LONG time that, well it scared the crap out of me. Amazingly written, cast, and filmed, I felt it achieved an ingenious atmosphere similar to that in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, which is imperative to the effect of a good suspense/thriller/horror film.

		<shortDescription>Flawed but entertaining suspense thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>College student Martin Bells (Ewan McGregor) is hopefully to make some money for himself by taking a job at the old city morgue. Which Martin thinks it's easy money until his graveyard shift turned into something else. A mysterious serial killer is been murdering unsuspected prostitutes but before he murders them... he makes them play dead. Now this murderer is been stalking Martin on his night shifts by playing sick mind games with the dead corpses.Directed by Ole Bornedal made an predictable but fairly intriguing suspense-thriller. Which Bornedal remade his own film "Nattevagten" for Dimension Films. McGregor's American accent comes and goes but he is surrounded by a sharp supporting cast like Patricia Arquette as his worried girlfriend, Josh Brolin as Martin's daredevil buddy, Brad Dourif as a doctor and Nick Notle as a police detective. "Nightwatch" was set to release in the fall of 1996 but released instead limited in the spring of 1998. Which the film critics were not kind to it, since the identity of the villain was too easy to guess but the movie is oddly irresistible thanks to some suspense, Bornedal's stylish creepy mood and some light touches of humour. The look on McGregor's face, when his buddy scares him nearly to death in the morgue is priceless. Despite all it's flaws, this is worth a look. Written by the director and Oscar-Winner Steven Soderbergh (The Ocean Trilogy, Erin Brockovich, Solaris "2002"). John C. Reilly appears uncredited. Super 35. (*** 1/2 out of *****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an English language remake of the same director's excellent 1994 Danish original.Apart from two rather graphic sex scenes, which appear in the original but are omitted from this version, this follows the original plot scene-for-scene. Even the incidental music is the same. It makes you wonder why they bothered really.The film is just about worth watching, but mainly for comparison purposes with the original. Otherwise, it's distinctly B movie standard.Rating: 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dire thriller which thinks black bin liners create atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any great expectations you may have for this film begin to fade after 20 minutes. The director succeeds in creating a fine eerie atmosphere with shots that linger just long enough to make you expect something to happen, and does nothing with it. The film soon throws away any attempt at a decent plot and unravels under it's own pseudo intellectualism. Ewan McGregor smirks so much (probably at his attempt at an american accent, Sean Connery anyone?) you think he's just walked off the set of Trainspotting with a stash of drugs. Nick Nolte hams his way through every scene looking like a part time drag queen and Josh Brolin seems to be lost in his characters confusing mood swings. As for the women in the film, they seem to lack any substance at all and are very one dimensional. The film fails in sustaining any interest, it skips over all of it's gaping plot holes and has an ending which is very unfulfilling.</fullReview>

This movie was one of the best ever, in the Danish version. But someone bought the rights to this movie, and tried to make a Hollywood version. But dear "Hollywood", you can't make a box-office hit if you first of all take the Danish humor away, and then take out some scenes from the movie, just because (my own opinion)you think it doesn't suits the American people.

		<shortDescription>Another idiotic thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as serial- killer films and thrillers are concerned this one's right down there with the worst of 'em. Only "Copycat" and "Sisters" manage to be more annoying in their absurdity, and only "Saw" is worse. And it's a pity because the first hour is genuinely eerie, with a fittingly claustrophobic mortuary as the ideal setting. I am a very jaded viewer, but some of those early mortuary scenes really get under your skin. However, after an hour it all goes downhill, and I mean steeply. The relentlessly stupid plot twists rob you of all patience and the movie just keeps sinking to new lows. All logic is thrown into the wind, and the viewer's intelligence is insulted and pounded upon repeatedly with more force than that baseball bat could ever have generated - the one used by Nolte and McGregor. (I'd be the first to sign up if they were looking for volunteers to take that baseball bat and bash the heads of the writers of this nonsense.) Nothing here adds up. Absolutely nothing. Nolte was molesting corpses decades earlier and the writers of this film would have us believe that this man could years later become the city's chief police investigator! Making him the killer is as absurd as giving Thomas Edison credit for inventing the wheel, as laughable as a conspiracy-theory plot from the "X-Files", and as stupid as Kim Basinger's book on how to solve all of world's problems (if she'd ever write one). The very notion that a man - so disturbed that he indulges in necrophilia in mortuaries - would have the sanity, interest, patience, and willingness to climb all the way to chief investigator in a police department only to start a savage murder spree is simply a mind-bogglingly dumb, far-fetched concept to me.And how the hell did he even start with the framing of McGregor? This is an essential piece of the puzzle that is badly missing here; McGregor JUST HAPPENS to get a job where he meets Nolte. And McGregor's best friend, Brolin, JUST HAPPENS to know a prostitute who is Nolte's play toy (and later victim). It can sure be a small, small world in a Hollywood stinker! And to add some silliness, Brolin is some kind of a deranged thrill-seeker who acts like a total lunatic all the time. Obviously, he is the decoy for the viewer; we are meant to treat him as the suspect. But how dumb do they think we are? And how the hell did Brolin get into the mortuary when he carried out his "practical joke"? And how the hell did Nolte manage to drag out a body of one of his victims within seconds of McGregor entering the room, without McGregor noticing it (the fact that he had his walkman on and/or was singing and/or talking doesn't make it any more believable)? And what's with this annoying scene where Arquette JUST HAPPENS to walk into the mortuary at exactly the moment when McGregor is hitting Nolte with a baseball bat and predictably starts thinking her boyfriend is the killer??! More annoyances came from the scene in which Brolin's reaction to McGregor's telling him that the latter is been suspected of murder is to laugh! Or the one in which he cuts off his own thumb in order to free himself and save the others. Sure,... why not?? ("I am being hand-cuffed to this metal pole, and as a result can neither save my friends nor myself... What do I do...? I know!... I'll cut my thumb off! How come I didn't think of that before!?...") Nolte makes the best out of his role, but due to the bitchingly silly script he appears to be hamming it up too much at the end - but what choice did he have? McGregor is solid, too, apart from his on-and-off accent (which was it now? American or English?).</fullReview>

The nightwatch (Ewan McGregor, pretending to be American) does an OK job as the poor guy who gets far too involved in a necrophiliac killer's scheme (OK, so it's gross, but hey - movie goers need more and more nowadays). The original Danish film, Nattevagten is a masterpiece, and even though the remake follows the original closely, the feel and plot seems to have become Americanized and flat. (I won't even mention Patricia Arquette's abysmal performance).Still, as a stand-alone film, I would rate it 8 out of 10 for atmosphere and, believe it or not, the script. Yes, the script isn't as bad as most say. Give it a look...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Thriller - Highly Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nightwatch" is a fascinating cinematic exercise in atmosphere and tension. The film has a swift pace, prodigious sense of style, and near-perfect balance of thrills and entertainment.I have seen "Nattevagten," the Danish picture on which this is based, and am unsure why fans of the original despise this American remake. Writer/director Ole Bornedal's second outing with the creepy source material is highly faithful and admittedly more satisfying. It retains all of the right elements while subtracting only several minor scenes of excess. "Nightwatch" develops its characters, exposition, and scares much faster and more effectively. It blends its humor and horror in a graceful manner, and wisely picks the precise moments to flesh-out the details of its protagonists and antagonist. The cast is incredibly likeable as well. Well-respected talent such as Ewan McGregor, Nick Nolte, and a surprisingly impeccable Josh Brolin add a richer, deeper subtext to performances that could have easily been automitized.The premise of the feature and how it plays out is not about sheer originality. The script is written with enough intelligence to distinguish between excitement and absurdity. It provides the filmmaker with the opportunity to place viewers in the shoes of a horrified protagonist. Bornedal presents the confinement of the morgue in a manner both elegant and creepy. He succeeds in his goal to provide a satisfying mystery with "Nightwatch," one of the best and most underrated thrillers in more recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I saw this movie in a marathon, at 3 in the morning... Maybe it's that I just hate Nick Nolte... but sorry folks, this movie SUCKS. Period. It's a flimsy story (at best), ripped from a much better cinematographical accomplishment (Nagtevagten,1994). Please don't watch it.What it's about? No clue. And that's saying something. OK, it has something to do with a nightwatch getting framed for something gruesome that occurred on his shift. I think. I fell into an uneasy sleep while my friends went for popcorn and beer. The only (minor) point of interest was Ewan McGregor, who is actually the only gifted actor in this flick. Nolte... don't get me started. The man was, and still is over the top of his, shall we say, "career", but was never fantastic to begin with. And that's the score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Routine Fright Night Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A college guy (Ewan McGregor) takes a nighttime job at a morgue, at just the time that a murderer happens to be on the loose. It's a standard serial killer film, and it's populated with photogenic college students and predictably weird-looking morgue workers. The film contains the usual, and tiresome, cinematic clichés and hackneyed plot devices. It also contains lots of plot holes. The killer is revealed to the audience way before the conclusion, resulting in a finale that is anticlimactic. None of the characters are particularly interesting. They struck me as being stereotypes. If the film contains a theme or "message", I certainly did not pick up on it.Acting is average, to slightly below average. McGregor looks like he's having a good time with the script. The music, the lighting, and the sound effects all try to manipulate the audience into a sense of fright. Production design is adequate, if unremarkable."Nightwatch" might appeal to kids who have not seen many horror films. For everyone else, the film has little to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love movies, and I am very forgiving of most of them. (I usually like thriller/suspense movies.) But Nightwatch I gave a 1. I never give movies a 1. It's especially odd in this case as I usually LOVE Ewan McGregor. But even he (and all of it's other big-name stars) could not save this poorly written, badly executed, gross, retarded-plot movie.A law student has a whacked out, bored best friend, a really nice but under-defined girlfriend, some sort of poorly outlined, difficult childhood past and then gets a job as a nightwatchman in a morgue to pay for school. (This involves checking to make sure that the bodies are okay each night.) The plot just gets worse from there. I won't go into details, but realize that it's set in a morgue (just go with that image for a second), involves really icky mental disorders, hookers, bored twenty-somethings and a serial killer.Perhaps Nick Nolte's worst role EVER. Ewan McGregor just looks embarrassed, as do Josh Brolin and Patricia Arquette. Filled with gratuitous nastiness and gross-out violence, this movie, rather than being redeemed by such a good cast, serves only to add a black mark to their career resumes.As I said, I love movies and rarely, rarely, rarely diss them this hard, but I honestly believe that this is the worst movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inventive low budget serial killer thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another American remake of a successful European thriller in the line of THE VANISHING, this is a taught and at times suspenseful serial-killer chiller with an intriguing premise: a series of sickening murders surrounding a new, young security guard working night duty at the local morgue. The movie plays its cards straight away with strong themes of sex, death, necrophilia, and insanity and manages to be fairly graphic in approach without actually showing much.The serial killer trappings are old hat and so is the central premise of "innocent suspect must clear his own name" and, although the film is episodic, it does work at times. The morgue setting is very eerie and makes for some very suspenseful moments which sent a few tingles down my spine. Despite a rather badly-edited and confusing middle, things pick up towards the end of the film. The whole finale is very gripping, slightly clichéd but nonetheless impossible not to get excited about, thanks to some very scary acting on the part of the actor playing the villain. Thanks go in part to director Ole Bornedal, who also directed the original version of the tale so had a fair amount of experience and couldn't go wrong.Ewan McGregor just about passes through in the part of a vain, shallow, enjoyment-seeking young man; thankfully he isn't awarded too much screen time all things considered and so doesn't become too grating. I do think McGregor is a good actor when given the right part but his role here just seems to be a victim of miscasting. Patricia Arquette gets to emote for all her worth but never seems to be anything more than mundane, although Josh Brolin is rather good as the obnoxious friend of McGregor's who becomes a suspect in the slayings. Acting awards go to Nick Nolte as the investigating cop; another excellent performance from the veteran actor who doesn't pull any punches. Watch out for Brad Dourif in a stereotyped 'weirdo' role as a doctor addicted to his own medicine cabinet. I haven't seen the original version of this tale as yet but I hear it's far superior, in which case I'm expecting something good because this film largely succeeds more than it fails.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nightwatch (1997): Dir: Ole Barnadal / Cast: Ewan McGregor, Patricia Arquette, Nick Nolte, Josh Brolin, Brad Dourif: Thriller suggesting a sense of alertness with many clichés and no originality but it does draw us within its dark setting. The setting is a morgue with silent corridors and entrapped moths fluttering aimlessly in the confines of a light bulb. There is a red alarm on the wall that will sound if anything goes wrong. If that is the case then it should have sounded during the first draft of the script. Anyway, the bottom floor contains sheet covered bodies awaiting examination. The new security guard investigates and finds a female corpse that seemingly disappears when he calls for help. This leads to a violent climax of mindless mayhem. Director Ole Barnadal is backed with an ominous setting that outperforms everything else. Ewan McGregor plays the security guard who brings headphones to block out the silence. He takes the job to pay for college but the excitement doesn't stop there. Patricia Arquette plays the love interest and the role has all the personality of one of the sheet covered corpses. Nick Nolte plays the crooked investigator, as if that is a big surprise. Josh Brolin plays his bar fighting friend. Having Brad Dourif in this is no surprise since his appearance has become a staple in these films. The result is a pointless and flat gore fest to the extremes of nothing. Score: 4 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely a film that deserves a nightwatch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NightWatch is an absorbingly refreshing film, that does have some real nasty moments, even at the end with Josh Brolin, having to sacrifice a finger in a life and death moment. Mcgregor who doesn't slip that well into an American accent, is an uni student, who gets a job as a nightwatchman at a morgue, where there some funny goings on, as it appears a serial killer is lurking about, and is setting our protagonist, Martin (Mcgregor) up, as a prime suspect. Nolte is strong as always as a cop, who befriends Martin, where Arquette seems wasted as Mcgregor's girlfriend as is John C Reilly as Nolte's partner. Nightwatch is a strong taut and entertaining thriller, with an memorably impactful start. Josh Brolin who's Martin's best friend here, unlike our quiet Martin, plays a real big mouth, di..head, which has us believe heavily like they do in other thrillers, he is the killing hand, as by his behavior, which at times, is unsettling to watch, with some of his psycho traits, like that bar scene where he really lets these bad dudes have it, (one of whom you've seen in many other short, bad dude roles from Renegades to One Tough Bastard) before they have him. Though Nightwatch does have it's shortcomings, what it manages to do is make for a quiet tense and unnerving ride, one like I said is refreshingly original. One standout scene in a restaurant, has a hooker, who's there for Brolin's amusement. Mcgregor is very good here as is Brolin, before he became well known, while character actor, Brad Douff is again great as another of the morgue's workers. An obscure film that needs more exposure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ewan McGregor's night watchman job entangles him with a serial killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nightwatch" (1997) is a nicely-done neo-noir thriller whose setting mimics a horror picture at times. Predominantly, however, it's in the serial killer sub-genre. The acting in this film is first rate. Ewan McGregor, who plays the lead, is particularly good at getting into his character very believably. Nick Nolte plays a detective and adds another highly watchable portrayal to his list of notable performances.McGregor is a law student. He takes a job as a night watchman at the medical examiner's building, which houses a morgue and associated facilities as for doing autopsies. Lonny Chapman, the outgoing watchman, shows him the rounds, and that's already a very creepy sequence.The city has been unnerved by a series of killings of young women. Nolte is the detective in charge of the investigation. McGregor has a close friend in Josh Brolin, who likes to joke around and have fun. Brolin is good in this role. Although McGregor has a girl friend (Patricia Arquette), very smooth in her role, Brolin gets him a bit involved with a prostitute (Alix Koromzay). Between what McGregor learns from her and some strange goings on at his job, he soon gets entangled with the serial killing case.The story is developed nicely, although somewhat predictably, with plenty of tense scenes. Still, the acting and execution of it make it stand out somewhat from the crowd.This movie is definitely not for children. In addition to some nudity of corpses, there are some scenes of bloodshed. In one, I preferred not to look at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nonsensical Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but this film just doesn't make any sense. There's a serial killer on the loose, killing women and cutting their eyes out. The bodies are taken to the morgue where there's a new night watchman, a man scared of his own shadow. Over the course of the film, the night watchmen is framed to be the serial killer, and then we get the happy ending.So where does it all go wrong? The protagonist, Martin, the night watchman is supposed to be studying law, which presupposes and above-average intelligence and yet Martin acts like a complete moron throughout the film. When he realises he's being framed, he's totally unable to work out who the only possibility is to be the real killer. Sadly, Martin isn't the only idiot in the film. His girlfriend is also a moron, as is the deputy chief detective. Really, where were they all when the brains were being handed out.Then there's the problem that the lead detective IS the serial killer, so he's investigating his own crimes. So why hasn't he been taken off the case for being so incompetent? And, if he's so good at hiding his crimes, why does he suddenly make mistake after mistake.And then there's the incredible coincidences. Martin's friend, an obvious red herring, just happens to sleep with a prostitute who just happens to sleep with the killer, allowing the killer to set up Martin, who just happens to work in the morgue, giving him access to the victims. And the prostitute just happens to be a friend of the last victim, and she just happens to tell Martin and his friend that she has a client who likes her to pretend she's dead and in the morgue. It's just far too contrived.And then there's the miscasting. Patricia Arquette just isn't suitable as Martin's girlfriend, or anybody's girlfriend really; there's nothing attractive about her, her looks, her acting, her intelligence. But that could be the mistake of the writers and costume design. Ewan McGregor is OK as Martin, although his accent drifts around the world. Josh Brolin as Martin's friend is just too weird, and looks too old compared to McGregor. And Nick Nolte, as good as he is, is just too obviously the killer from the first moment he appears on screen. Sure, Nolte is very believable as the killer, but that's the problem, he's too believable.Considering that this is a remake of a film the director made several years before, I can only believe that the studio and/or producers intervened to make a complete dog's breakfast of this film.A missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Creepy, suspenseful, but fairly formulaic whodunit murder-slasher flick. The fact that it's about a young law school student, decently played by Ewan McGregor, who moonlights as a night watchman in a morgue, giving the audience frequent views of the recently brought-in cadavers, some of whom are victims of an on-the-loose serial killer, adds a nice touch of scariness here. Generally good acting by just about everyone, similarly good cinematography, with a script to die for, npi. I first saw this film shortly after its release in 1997. I watch a lot of this sort: What really made NIGHTWATCH stand out to the point where I still remembered it years later was the fine performance and script of one of the supporting characters, Brad Dourif as the unnamed "Duty Doctor," who is darkly hilarious here. Sample script from the Doctor: "Can I offer you something?. . . . Have you ever spent any time with the 'Zine' family? Thorazine? Stellazine? Compazine? They're really very nice! They will make you sing hymns while you watch a baby fall under a train!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a law student who works in the local morgue to make some extra cash. He is unfortunately involved in a series of murder."Nightwatch" has a very good story. Initially it is a little slow as it provides the background to the jigsaw, and the constant reference to mortality was a little too much and too contrived. After the jigsaw was laid out, the twists and turns were quite engaging. There were so may clues pointing at one direction, but you will have to watch the film to see what happens at the end. The final scenes were filled with urgency and thrill, making the ending so memorable and engaging. I liked "Nightwatch" because it is very unexpectedly scary in the end!</fullReview>

Must admit the fact that I haven't seen the original but based on the reviews on IMDb, the original must be too scary and better. This remade Hollywood version is not that scary but will keep you in pulse with the movie till the last scene. Some good performance from the lead casts. The movie features brutal murder scenes and nudity so strictly not for the underage or faint-hearted. Imo, the screenplay could have been made much scarier for a movie with such a storyline and the director could have held suspense a bit longer. The bottom line is -- "Not too scary still good to Night-watch"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A law student takes a job as the night-watch in a morgue, thinking that he will have much time to study, with his biggest problem being his paranoia. But in the history of this morgue was once a man raping female corpses, but has history really gone......A remake of a film I've never seen, Nightwatch was supposed to be Macgregors big break into Hollywood, but 1997 was Ewan's Anu Horribilus....The man was hot stuff after Trainspotting, Brassed Off, and Shallow Grave, but this bombed, and Hodge, Boyle, and Ewan couldn't recapture the magic with a Life Less Ordinary.So to be fair, not counting a certain pillage of a franchise, Macgregor never really got noticed in Hollywood until 2005 with The Island.Despite this films flaws, is still enjoyable, despite the fact that Brolins character should have been called Red Herring, and Arquette does very little. Macgregor plays a fresh faced student, who has it all, girlfriend, apartment, strange friend, and even stranger job.But he soon becomes prime suspect for all the murders that are happening, because dastardly Nick Nolte is setting him up, as Nolte has a history, which is heavily hinted on many occasion.Brolin is way too over the top to make you suspect him, as is Dourif, so you know from the upstart that Nolte will be the killer, which spoils the rest of the film.So apart from one very good scene involving Arquette finding a body (the whole scene is very early eighties De Palma), its all pretty generic stuff, which is a shame as now I've no interest in seeing the original, which may sound ignorant, but what's the point if you know who the killer is.....</fullReview>

The plot concerns a young man who takes the job as the night watchman at a spooky morgue. Things start to play on his mind, and as they do the bodies begin to rack up as a serial killer is on the loose. Is it McGregor?

		<fullReview>I am not into horror movies where terrible events happen in someone's mind or imagination, when nothing is going on in reality (with very few exceptions like The Others); it may be interesting to watch and share the feelings, but by the end of the film you feel betrayed and disappointed. In Nightwatch, horror film elements are combined with committed crimes, and the result is not bad. McGregor, Nolte and Brolin perform especially well, female characters seem mediocre, even Arquette, but perhaps her part was not elaborated. I would have shortened the ending: when the doer becomes known, the subsequent scenes are too protracted and the horror-crime film remains a crime feature film only. But still recommended, the film is not too long and the venue (hospital morgue) has been exploited well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Co-writer / director Ole Bornedal's English language remake of his earlier Danish hit "Nattevagten" is pretty good stuff, a substantially atmospheric and creepy thriller that milks the ambiance of its locations for everything that they're worth. Ewan McGregor, doing a superb American accent, is law student Martin Bells, who takes a part time job as night watchman at the city morgue. His best friend James (Josh Brolin) is bored with their humdrum lives and goes about doing some reckless things, while a serial killer is haunting the city and taking the eyeballs from his victims. The movie can boast some solid suspense sequences, and is also beautifully lit (by Dan Laustsen) and scored (by Joachim Holbek). It's got some decent gore going for it, but mostly it's all about the mood with "Nightwatch". The cast is excellent all the way down the line, with McGregor highly likable in the lead. Patricia Arquette plays his girlfriend, and figures in what is one of the best moments in the film, as she comes very close to encountering the killer. Brolin is fun as the risk taking friend, and Nick Nolte offers an interesting and entertaining performance as the police inspector on the trail of the killer. Brad Dourif has a great supporting part as the grumpy duty doctor who suggests McGregor get acquainted with drugs from the "zine" family when the latter cries wolf, Alix Koromzay is memorable as a prostitute, and Lonny Chapman has a great little bit as the veteran night watchman who trains McGregor. John C. Reilly appears uncredited in the key supporting role of Deputy Inspector Davis. The build up to the finale is so strong that the ultimate confrontation &amp; action can't quite measure up (intriguingly, our killer is identified sooner than we'd expect), but Bornedal still does an impressive job of marrying soundtrack and image throughout his film. It gets off to a great start with its opening credits, and is fundamentally a neat little story, well told and well paced with no filler to have to deal with. It's an enjoyable film that deserves another look from genre fans. Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good enough in its own way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, lets just start of by saying this movie is no way near as good as the original movie "Nattevagten", of which this movie is a remake but it's still being a pretty good and fun whodunit to have a good time with.Kind of weird to notice how different this movie is in atmosphere and approach, since it actually got directed by the same director who made the original, 3 years prior to this American remake. And it's not just different but also most definitely less effective. There is not as much tension and mystery in this one, also due to some pacing issues (it's too fast paced at times) and a poor buildup to things.And all while this movie in essence is still being just like the original. Not much had been changed in its story really and I was therefore also quite surprised to find out Steven Soderbergh was involved with the writing. Guess it was an easy paycheck for him, since really not all that much had been changed or added to the movie, when compared to the original movie.While the original was being a whole lot of different things, this movie is just being a more simple and more straightforward thriller, or rather said whodunit. So really, don't expect this movie to provide you with any horror but as a mystery/thriller, I can still see this movie entertaining a whole bunch of people out there, of course especially those who aren't familiar with the original movie already.And really, the movie on its own is really being quite good and entertaining for what it is. It really doesn't handle everything well, mainly stuff concerning the earlier mentioned pacing and buildup to things but as a whole it's still being a better movie than just the average genre attempt. There are plenty of thrills and surprises in it, that help to keep you invested in the movie.It also has a cast to die for. Really an all-star cast, of which some actors are better known now days as back then. Ewan McGregor plays the main lead, while the movie further more stars Patricia Arquette, Nick Nolte, a still very young looking Josh Brolin, Brad Dourif and John C. Reilly. Not that this movie features any of their best or most interesting and challenging performances but still, it's always good to see so many talented people together on screen.A definitely good enough movie as a straightforward thriller.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is a bit of a thriller cliché, unfortunately: nice guy protagonist gets mixed up in a noir-ish murder mystery, with his asshole best friend's increasingly creepy behavior triggering all sort of paranoia. However, whereas this movie ends up using a lot of clichéd tropes from the genre, I still enjoyed it a lot. For one thing, the acting is really great, and the cast is full of actors I really love. While the story is pretty straightforward, if you're a fan of the genre, you're probably pretty forgiving. What some people saw as brutal, mean-spirited, and violent, I saw as a memorably dark movie. Sure, sometimes the atmosphere comes off as a Se7en clone, but it was well-done, despite that.How much you like this movie probably depends on how tired you are of these clichés. I can totally understand why someone would give this movie a 5/10, but I'm a bit of a junkie when it comes to thrillers. If you're looking for something new and original, you might be better off avoiding this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though somewhat flawed, "Nightwatch" delivers the suspense and blood, although in the end logic flies out the window. Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as a law student with the bizarre job of guarding dead bodies in the medical examiners office. Nick Nolte plays a police detective very well, and John C. Reilly is his sidekick. In addition there is Josh Brolin as McGregor's eccentric friend, Patricia Arquette as a bewildered girlfriend, and Brad Dourif as an ultra strange doctor. The film is very creepy, unpredictable, with at least a bunch of "red herrings", and builds tension nicely. Only the somewhat rushed conclusion fails to convince.

		<shortDescription>Stop Asking for the How and Why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhat messy thriller with regard to plot but what it suffers from logic is buttressed well with suspense and atmosphere and acting. The story concerns two friends who come to a crossroads in life and what life has to offer and what defines living. This part of the story is subtly woven into another story of Martin taking a job at a school morgue that is one creepy place. Add to this mix a series of serial killing going on investigated by Inspector Nick Nolte and you have an intriguing blend that does basically captivate and satisfy. Ewan McGregor plays Martin and is more than adequate as he learns what life is like in this atmospherically eerie morgue is like. The scene where he picks up tips from the night watchman who he is replacing is one of the best in the film as the director pulls no stops in creating mood and character actor Lonny Chapman does a phenomenal job in his small but significant role. Well, the story quickly moves to tying all the film's plot threads together in a less than believable fashion. But director Ole Bornedal has skills making plot take a backseat to suspense. Helping along the way are good, solid performances from the likes of Josh Brolin as his reckless friend James, beautiful if less than wonderful Patricia Arquette as his girlfriend, Brad Dourif playing a snooty doctor(doesn't he thrive in films like these?), and Nick Nolte as Inspector Cray - a more than solid effort from Nolte in a very strong performance. Thomas C Reilly also has a small role as another inspector. All these actors take a backseat though to the creepy settings of this morgue with its empty corridors, red-tinted embalming room, and large body room - not to mention the 1950's look for the filer room and office. The setting pieces are really eye-catching - just like the serial killer himself. I had never heard of the film before as it seems to have flown under the radar. Shame as it is pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nightwatch (1997)Director: Ole Bornedal (Nattevagten)**1/2out of****Review"Nightwatch" is the virtual remake of the Danish film "Nattevagten", helmed by the same Danish director as well (this was also done with the ring and grudge movies). I haven't seen the Danish version yet, but from some research this north American version is basically a shot by shot remake, with more conventional actors. The movie wants to come off as an intelligent, dreary, nihilistic thriller in hopes of obtaining the "Seven" visceral experiences. The plot consists of a man named Martin (Ewen McGregor) who is hired as the new security guard for the graveyard shift at some depressing morgue. He then realizes that someone is watching, waiting, plotting and scheming to eventually frame Martin for his murderous crimes. That's basically it. The movie succeeds in creating a sense of foreboding doom early in the movie. This is some morgue. With dimly lit hallways, main entrance blocked by blowing garbage bag covered trees, creaky doors, moth filled lights, etc. The movie works more with more simple methods of chills; I was surprised how effective some work. There's a certain photo posted on the wall in the office of the morgue, quite simple, very effective, something about that photo just gave me the freaking creeps. The suspense is high the first 45 minutes or so. Then the movie began to lose its grasp. For starters, the characters are never fully developed, actually who the hell are these people? The movie tries to make some red herrings, but if you have the minimal of brain cells it shouldn't be too hard to guess this IS NOT the killer. The Brolin character is also a bit shaky. He's going through some mid life crisis but it made little sense to me. It certainly didn't make me think he was the killer. We never get to fully know Patricia Arquettes character either, she's just there.The killer's motivations are bit weak as well, and I found his reasons very far fetched. For a thriller about a serial killer, I found the kills and killer quite tame. It was not only too predictable who it was, but also quite boring, the killer was too ho hum. The movie is a "Dimensions" production, and I think it hurt the movies nihilistic demeanor. It seems to hold back a lot of the times, and seems very Scream oriented. Yes, we have another movie trying to suck of the fame of Scream (made one year prior). The movie appears to be smart, but once you stand back you realize its just a front. The movie works when using simple effective tools, they have been done before, but I was surprised how effective they were. It's when the movie settles into basic hero in peril type flick that has been done better (and more memorable) before. The movie has a decent soundtrack and the directing is polished. The actors all do fine with the thin material and the three or so kills were quite vicious if not cut short. Though, the movie loses steam, and eventually you seem to feel a bit under whelmed? Un phased? The movie wants to be a genre classic, but its substance never fully measures up.So then we have a movie as an experience in chilling, but quickly fading nightmare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I actually began watching this movie without knowing anything about it besides a short two-sentence summary that's placed on Comcast's "On Demand" feature. I had never even heard of this movie before, and honestly, I was expecting a low tier cheese-fest with little to no real acting talent or character development. I'm glad to say that I was quite surprised. Within the first 15 or so minutes it was clear that the acting was at least on par. It also had a very eerie setting (it's a morgue, so yeah..) as well as some dramatic and suspenseful buildups. The character development, especially on Ewan McGregor's character wasn't really as good as it could have been.. But it certainly was present. Even the Prostitute - Joyce, had a fair bit of character development. The actual plot itself was very good, and did a wonderful job of leading on several times. 3/4's through the movie I had at least 3 different suspects for the actual murder, however none of them turned out to be the actual murderer.. I won't give away who the killer actually is, but I think the way the killer was revealed was rather poor.. I will say that I think it's highly unlikely to those who watch this movie, that you'll guess the correct killer before they're revealed. I give it 8/10 for the good setting, suspense, and a wonderful plot that actually confuses you as to who the killer is rather than just setting it out for everyone to see.</fullReview>

That's a pity, because though it isn't exactly Hitchcock, it has more suspense than Saw, Saw II, Scream and Hostel, combined. I'm talking real 'what's down that dark corridor' suspense, not what happens when a carefully placed cat jumps out of a closet at a precise moment. The camera angles, darkened sets, and dead-on (no pun) direction put you right in Ewan McGregor's shoes as he creeps down corridors of the coroner's office, fearing that he'll see a corpse moved to a new spot -on its own. Catch this one on cable or DVD if you can!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike a lot of films of this genre, 'Nightwatch' delivers what it promises. My only criticism is there was too much "spooky" stuff (mainly: when we see Martin reflected in the glass and the plastic flapping). As this is a thriller rather than a horror film, I felt these interludes were unnecessary and somewhat insulted the viewer.The relationship between Martin and James is a little hard to fathom. As James turns hero at the end (making a significant sacrifice rather than merely miraculously escaping to thwart the killer, as is typical with such movies) I have to forgive him for being an asshole in the first half, particularly the stunt with Martin and Joyce in the restaurant.James starts out as an annoying character but redeems himself later. I was impressed with Josh Brolin in this role, although I haven't seen him in anything else that I can recall. I was also impressed by Alix Korozmay (Joyce), although I now realise I have also seen her in 'Mimic'.Nolte (Cray) is weird in this film. He seems like a sympathetic character, someone who will help Martin, but doesn't ultimately do so. Dourif (doctor) on the other hand, so often the deranged baddie in films like this, is creepy, but not actually the culprit. The white coat the killer wears throws suspicion on the doctor, a touch that is somewhat clichéd but, I feel, worked out well.I rather expected Patricia Arquette's character to turn up in the morgue to shock Martin. I'm glad she turned out to be strong, resourceful, and ultimately loyal to Martin.The suspense was handled well (apart from the spooky bits as mentioned above) and the length was just right, although I have a niggling feeling that the entire opening part involving James trying to make Martin be more "adventurous" could have been done away with so we could focus on the real action.I have new respect for Nolte as a result of seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only saw this film because I'm a big Ewan McGregor fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not a horror fan, but thrillers I like. I only say that because Nightwatch is drifting between these two categories. There's always a very tricky element with who-dunnit's, if it's easy to guess, it's automatically branded as shite. But when it turns out to be someone who didn't actually feature in the film, I think that is worse, simple cowardice on the writer/directors part. They're too worried we might guess. I have watched this film with three people, and only one guessed it was Cray. the rest of us had either the doctor or James on our minds. The guesser said it was because of the two speeches Cray made, about 'there is no how or why, they are long past the need to justify what they do, he wants the killing to stop.' But I thought those fitted well with him being an experienced homicide policeman. I'm glad i didn't guess.What I thought stank was the James thing. for almost the whole film you think it' s him, then when I watched it again, there is no way to explain his behaviour. In the laundromat for example. The director was so caught up in steering us away from Cray and towards James, that he didn't stop to think 'if he's innocent, why would he do that?' Someone said it's because he's nervous, but it still doesn't mesh. There is also some genuinely cringey dialogue; 'You know I can't be alone.' 'The wrong guy I guess. I guess they got the wrong guy.' 'I'm sworn to secrecy.' I was always wondering why they were saying it. My last nit-pick is the scene where Martin discovers the prostitutes body is gone. Firstly, there is NO way he could have missed it when he first came in. Then, how could Cray get in, move the body, move it back and clean up the blood? Unless martin was dreaming, but it doesn't feel like it. I know it sounds like I hated it, but what bugs me are flawed masterpieces. This had the potential to be a huge blockbuster hit, but the combination of bad script and... I was going to say directing but no, only script. The directing was excellent actually. I loved the bit where he forgets to turn off the lights, then reaches an arm back in and it looks like something's coming to get him. If someone had re-wrought a lot of the dialogue and smoothed over the big pot-holes in the story, this could have been a huge hit. The actors are to be congratulated, doing a stellar job with some dire stuff. Patricia Arquette in particular. Just a facial expression turned an awful scene around. James as well, the least-likable character in history, with his crossed-the-line jokes and creepy fascinations. He then redeems himself by cutting his thumb off (vile) to escape handcuffs and save Kathrine and Martin. Finally our leading man. What I loved about this character was he is the polar opposite of the Hollywood He-man Hunk. An ordinary bloke. When this rarity stumbles onto the silver screen we have a tendency to be snickering 'wimp' between scenes. Ridiculous. Secret Window for example. Mort sees a guy with a screw-driver in his head, vomits and collapses. Is there a human on the planet who would not do exactly that? But when you get down to it, Martin is spineless by anyones standards. Twenty-two is too old to be giving in to peer-pressure! It really is.Apparently Danny Boyle (director of Ewan films Trainspotting, Shallow grave and A Life Less Ordinary) thought the accent was awful and that is why his character in A Life Less Ordinary was changed from American to Scottish. I like his American accent. it's not the one you always hear, but Star-spangled none-the-less. Though in Velvet Goldmine it's very much improved. All in all, this is a great film. Not in plot perhaps, but the spirit, acting and camera work are consistently tense and involving. Pretty important to any Ewan fan, this being his first American exploit. 8/10 At least!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A couple of far-fetched moments, but otherwise good!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILAGE!!!This film centers around a young student named Martin (Ewan McGregor) who takes a job at the local morgue to bring in some badly needed money for bills, books and other necessities. Before too long, strange things start happening at the morgue, and Martin becomes the suspect of all the foul play.The cast is great. The superb Nick Nolte stars as a cop who is investigating the events. Patricia Arquette (why does her hair always have to be so stringy!!!) as Katherine the girlfriend of Martin is very good. Josh Brolin as Martin's pal James is very creepy!!! The plot is pretty intriguing, although it would have been cool to give the killer a MOTIVE for why he did what he did...except that a lack of motive makes it even creepier, so that's okay. Good twists and turns. A hooker with crooked lipstick thrown in. I can't see myself sawing off my own thumb...not even to save someone's life. The shock and the pain would be too much. I didn't find that bit very realistic at all.Still, a good, creepy suspense thriller. I'd give it a B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor spoilers.I don't scare easily, but I had trouble sleeping after this one.....The film begins with some of the creepiest scenes I have ever seen in a film. Super! I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to my kids sing 'This Old Man, he played one......' again.Ewan MacGregor is Martin, who takes a job as a nightwatchman in a morgue. Nick Nolte is excellent as Inspector Cray, the policeman in charge of finding the necrophiliac serial killer responsible for murdering prostitutes and taking out their eyes. Yeuk! When bodies are tampered with at the morgue, Martin becomes chief suspect, and I was totally fooled by the red-herrings given to disguise who the killer really was.It's a shame about the fairly standard ending once the killer was revealed, but when I say 'fairly standard' it was still good, just not as good as the rest of the movie.Gaping plot-hole for me was how the killer engineered Alex's involvement with Martin??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nightwatch starts off brilliantly. Ewan McGreggors take on a nightwatchmans job at the local morgue to fund himself at law school. On his first night the elderly nightwatchman he is replacing shows him the ropes and Mcgreggor is horrified to see that above each body is an alarm cord should they 'revive'.McGreggor has trouble adjusting to his lonely job and gets caught up in an investigation into a serial killer who has a thing about dead prostitutes.The first hour is great, but the film quickly turns into a standard 'whodunnit'. The killer is disclosed too soon which leads to a rather obvious 'by the numbers' end.Definitely worth watching for the creepy atmosphere the film achieves at the start, let down by the last 30 mins though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A college student, played by a young Ewan McGregor, takes on the night shift at a local mortuary, and odd things begin to happen. A serial killer is loose, and somehow tied into the mortuary. Lots of scares, creepy atmosphere and a real bang-up if slightly formulaic ending. The killer's identity turns out to be a bit of a letdown, and telegraphed a little too early. Ewen McGregor was basically an unknown at the time, and he is fun to watch. Nick Nolte as an obsessed detective who looks and acts decidedly odd throughout. This is an English remake of the same director's NIGHTWATCH, a Scandanavian flick from 1994. Josh Brolin plays McGregor's buddy who attempts to come to the rescue at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another letdown *Spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had great potential and it scared me like no other movie has ever done after the 1st hour. But like "A Perfect Murder" failed to do, was to end strong and have a suitable and more creative ending. Nightwatch was typical like most killer movies- he's about to kill the main character... NOOOOOO! Then gets shot at the last second. Nightwatch could've been a classic horror movie if it was written better and had a better plot. I mean, the part with a guy *doing* dead people is quite scary and unique, but the part with the killer once working there and such, is just so old and outdated. I think Hollywood, in broader terms (directors, producers, writers), need to know how to be more creative, because this movie was killed by that. Other than these problems, this movie had no flaws. Great acting by Ewan McGregor... I LOVE THIS GUY. He brings so much to the table. I think this movie might've been the movie that brought Ewan to the top of Hollywood's elite, not that drug movie "Trainspotting".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hokey, but interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic plot is that Martin (McGregor) takes a job at a mortuary night watchman (security guard). Soon he gets framed for the murders of a bunch of prostitutes, and has to convince his friends, girlfriends, and the cops that he is not guilty. At least, that's what happens towards the end: the majority of the movie just tells the story up to this.I rather liked it, though the plot seemed pretty hokey. In the words of one IMDB user, "it tried too hard". The music is wonderfully creepy and the acting is not terrible--it's just the rather cliched plot that bored me. I knew from the beginning that Martin would be framed, I figured it would be somebody he trusted, and I knew who would die and who wouldn't.The parts intended to gross you out--the eyeball removal, the blood, Martin's arm getting scraped--really did gross me out. They did a good job there. And the revelation of who it was (as well as the nice continuity) interested me. But altogether this is just another horror flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the start I will say Nightwatch is not for everyone. Written by Ole Bornedal and Steven Soderbergh of Sex Lies and Videotape this is a dark movie. However if you like dark movies about serial killers then you may just want to rent this one. Martin Bells, Ewan McGregor, takes a job as a Night Watchman at a morgue. He figures he needs to have time to study for his final semester in law school and what better place could he be and still make money? Unfortunately someone is out there killing prostitutes in a most gruesome manner and Inspector Thomas Cray, Nick Nolte, is starting to suspect Martin. Especially when strange things begin to happen at the morgue. The movie is definitely a tense thriller. Some of the scenes in it are a bit obvious but others had me guessing. McGegor, soon to be seen as the young Ben Kenobi, does a good job of trying to figure out who is setting him up and Nolte gives his usual fine performance. The supporting cast of Josh Brolin, Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky) and Patricia Arquette all do a good job moving the film along. This movie is tense at times, dark, and bloody. If the previous three things don't bother you in a movie then I strongly suggest checking out Nightwatch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had promise, but tried way too hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(((SPOILER ALERT)))"Nightwatch" starts off promising enough, the beginning intriguing, the setting foreboding. But by the end of the movie, assuming you watch it through to the end, the only thing you still have respect for is the haunting soundtrack. Everything else drowns in as sea of Hollywood conventions.Another thing this movie suffers from is overenthusiasm for it's purpose. One of the things I detest most when waching movies is when they awaken my awareness of what lies behind the scenes. When suspension of my disbelief is hopelessly shattered by the irreversible realization that the characters are not in a paricular situation because it is plausible or interesting viewing, but because the filmmaker is giving it all he's got to manipulate your emotions in a certain direction. Typically, this particular cinematic faux pas is dubbed "preachiness", but in a movie like "Nightwatch", which is aiming for shocks and scares instead of something (it thinks would be) intelligent to say, the best words to describe it are "heedlessly gratuitous"."Nightwatch" throws scene after gratuitous scene at the viewer in a breathless effort to be the scariest, bloodiest, thrilliest thriller it can be. Consider the scene where an almost-hogtied Patricia Arquette creeps along the floor towards the fire alarm on her stomach -- the camera's view sinks to bring the countless shards of glass in her path into the foreground and elicit cringing from the audience. Or the scene where McGregor beats in the small viewing port in a door so he can reach through and unlock it from the other side, after which the camerawork makes it an all-too clear point that he had badly cut up his arm in the process to elicit more cringing from the audience. Or the scene where Nolte explains the motivations of a serial killer -- or more accurately, the lack thereof -- it, too, jumping on the bandwagon of movies claiming, sheerly for the audience's "benefit", that serial killers don't have any real reason or cause for their behaviour, they just do it (which I and anyone else with even the slightest background in psychology knows for a fact to be untrue).Each scene like this might as well be footage of the director yelling at the audience "BE SCARED! YOU'RE WATCHING A THRILLER! IT'S A THRILLER, GODDAMMIT! LOOK AT ALL THAT NASTY SH-T THAT'S HAPPENNING! BE THRILLED!" and I don't find that entertaining viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw Nightwatch I was alone at night curled up in a ball. This movie is not scary in the bloody style of typical horror films. Instead it is full of suspense and creepy music. The music was actually the scariest part of the movie. It makes you sit on edge expecting something terrible to happen next and nothing happens. Then when you are sure that everything is okay the unexpected occurs. The cast is spectacular. Ewan McGregor emotes better than anyone in the business and Josh Brolin keeps you guessing. Nick Nolte has the best role in the movie tough. He steals the show in one scene where you watch him carry on a conversation with himself in his head. His face is very expressive and he can be scary and funny at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danish director Ole Bornedal´s debut feature "Nattevagten" scared hordes of Scandinavian moviegoers in 1994/1995, and it was more than welcome to it, being the first Danish horror-movie in decades. Miramax honchos Bob &amp; Harvey Weinstein invited Bornedal to remake his hit movie in the US with a star cast and a bigger budget. Big mistake... The cast: Ewan McGregor is miscast as an American with his accent slipping several times and was even told to play the role EXACTLY as Nikolaj Coster Waldau in the original, Josh Brolin doesn´t have an iota of Kim Bodnia´s talent, Nick Nolte plays the role as the inspector with respectful awe of Ulf Pilgaard´s astonishing performance, and Patricia Arquette (once again) gives on of her dullest performances ever. Key elements and scenes were excised from the remake, allegedly because an American audience wouldn´t grasp the Danish humor, but most likely so as not to offend the puritan part of the US audience. Cinematographer Dan Laustsen, who worked on the original as well, creates some spooky images, but the film suffers from a bad case of "The Vanishing"-syndrome (as in George Sluizer´s unfortunate remake of his own superior movie). The release date was delayed again and again, and a frustrated Bornedal left the US disgruntled and fatigued, with mixed emotions towards his US debut. It shows in the final film that it could have been so much better... ** (of ****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake (of a Danish movie I haven't seen) is a riveting chiller that overcomes it's somewhat contrived story thanks the terrific visual flair of director Ole Bornedal.The night time sequences in the Medical Examiners are truly fascinating and chilling, giving this movie a more unnerving atmosphere than most hardcore horror movies you'll see. The long corridors, with it's flickering lights and unsettling dead quiet are masterfully creepy. Its easy to believe that Ewan McGregor's character is on edge in such surroundings.The cast is good, with Josh Brolin a standout as McGregor's live wire friend. Nick Nolte brings his usual gruff, grizzled toughness to the part of the cop investigating the murders. Patricia Arquette doesn't get to do much however, and her character is undeveloped.Other than that, Nightwatch is a terrific movie to watch with the lights out. It'll probably make you want to stay away from morgues in the dead of night too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching Nightwatch and was extremely pleased. Ewan McGreggor continues his bright future with yet another wonderfully portrayed character as the aspiring law student who befalls tragedy in a grotesque homicidal/necropheliac serial killer's plot. Every other character in the movie was well portrayed with many great, however under-rated actors such as josh brolin, brad dourif (one of my favorite's in the movie) who plays a cynical doctor, and john c. reily who is recently known to tag along in most of paul thomas anderson's recent epic masterpieces which include boogie nights and magnolia.The actors aren't what makes the movie, but the surrealism and dark atmosphere that the director produces for the viewers. Most of the film was shot in horrifying solitude in the medical examiner's building and left one's imagination run wild to what heart-stopping event could arrive.This was a magnificent element that helped Nightwatch achieve it's superior 'scariness'.I had picked up this movie merely because it looked violent and while i was watching the credits roll in the intro to the movie, i was intrigued to why academy award winning producers would make a lame B-movie. However, not even into half the movie, it was shown to me that i was gravely mistaken. For those who love an extremely suspenseful thriller, you shall definitely enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A necessary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that Gus Van Sant's version of "Psycho" has been considered an embarrassment by all, people question what merits there could be in a director doing a shot-by-shot reworking of an earlier film. However, Ole Bornedal's American remake of his own European thriller, "Nattevagten", does manage to demonstrate that there is a good reason for doing such a thing. I have unfortunately never seen Bornedal's original film, and to do so would probably require a visit to the bootleggers for me. Those who have had the privilege of seeing it have labelled it a real masterpiece, and the report from them is that the American remake is almost the exact same movie, as Bornedal practically copies his original film shot-by-shot. He has taken the opposite approach that Georges Sluizer took with his disastrous "Vanishing" remake and ensured that his new version comes as close as possible to capturing what made the original so effective.Some may call Bornedal's decision a lazy one, but it works well for me. It's one thing to copy a film like "Psycho", which virtually everyone in the Western world has seen, but when an acclaimed film like "Nattevagten" is so inaccessible to North American audiences, a shot-by-shot remake is the next best thing. I really enjoyed "Nightwatch" and take comfort in knowing that Bornedal has done his very best to make his remake work as well as his original. He has done a successful job of translating his talent to audiences over here, and turns "Nightwatch" into one of the most creepy and atmospheric American horror films of the 90s. The plot, involving a law student named Martin who takes a job as a night watchman at a morgue where the victims of a vicious serial killer are always turning up, has a number of holes, with a couple of scenes that don't hold up in the overall scheme of things, but Bornedal makes up for that by providing a number of eerie moments (the way the killer plays "This Old Man" while performing his deeds is especially effective) and gets solid work from his cast (though, being that he made this film before any of his other American efforts, Ewan MacGregor has trouble maintaining his new accent). There's also a surprisingly effective undercurrent of black humour throughout the story, most of it coming from the always-reliable Brad Dourif as a duty doctor who thinks that Martin's reports of corpses suddenly appearing in the morgues are complete lunacy (he cynically tells Martin that a nice visit with the "zeen family" might help calm him down). The identity of the plot's "mystery killer" is not impossible to guess, but Bornedal keeps you hooked all the way to the hair-raising climax that contains a moment involving handcuffs that's one of the most startling things I've seen in any recent horror film.When all is said and done, I probably won't have any need to acknowledge this film's existence if I ever score a copy of "Nattevagten". Those who have seen Bornedal's original are unlikely to find much here to justify the need for a remake. However, considering how little attention this film received when it was released, I doubt that there will be much push to get "Nattevagten" an official video release. Until that actually does occur, "Nightwatch" will more than do just fine.</fullReview>

All of the plot 'twists' are broadcast well before they happen so that nothing comes as a surprise. It's a shame when such a collection of talent is wasted like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Ewan McGregor's Better Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just love Ewan McGregor and he shows his acting talent in NIGHTWATCH and that's about all he shows for once. :) It's good to see Ewan in a leading role in an American flick, but its not good to see him without his natural speaking voice which is just a small flaw with the movie. The movie is really morbid and such, but it keeps you guessing and it has a wonderful ending that no one ever suspects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been so much more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the mystery/serial killer genre, and I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately it did not come anywhere close to my expectations. While the storyline was good (it would have worked MUCH better as a novel), the directing and poor acting (except in Nolte's case) turned me off. There were so many things that could have been followed up on (i.e., "This Old Man, he played one...")and details that could have been added to make this movie a more complete package. A couple parts were very suspensful, but the movie could not keep that momentum. A 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I don´t quite understand those who think this movie is badly written and badly executed and someone wrote it lacked good dialogue? But then most of them were americans and as most americans they were surely brought up on cheap television and Hollywood movies. And who can blame them. USA is the land of trashcinema. Well, this movie is quite different for the ordinary Hollywood thriller but then it´s a remake of an excellent Danish film. Watched the remake after the original so all the surprises were spoiled for me but I enjoyed every minute of it ´cause it´s excecuted excellenty. The photo was superb, made me think of the thrillmaestro Hitchcook´s work. As for the revelation of the killer, well I thought they could have stretched it out a bit so that we the viewers realized who it is at the same time as Martin does. And then there was the barscene wich they could have dropped. But all in all it´s a great movie but the original is better. 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good set design and creative lighting and camera work carry this film from bad to ordinary. The plot is an amalgam of re-hashed stories with no really original elements to lift it out of the mediocre. Nick Nolte (probably under the director's influence) puts in a melodramatic performance reminiscent of amateurs doing Shakespeare. Ewan McGregor does carry the film along, but, despite performing well, Josh Brolin can't make an incredible character believable. One thing I can't understand is why film makers when doing a corridor chase (yawn) still have to have the obligatory scene in a basement with stark lighting and pipes everywhere. In all other respects, the sets and locations were fine. If you want to give your girlfriend the creeps, you could get it out on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie scared me half to death the first time I saw it! Unfortunately, it was the script that was terrifyingly terrible. I watched this movie only with the thought of seeing Ewan McGregor. He gave a wonderful performance, but I was saddened to see him in this movie. After watching almost every other movie he's made (especially Trainspotting and Velvet Goldmine) I didn't think that he would stoop to a B-ish Hollywoodized horror flick. I have since read that he is ashamed of doing the movie as well and I am relieved! His talents were wasted.The rest of the cast was appalling. Nick Nolte just made me sick in his role. He oozed everywhere and when was finally got to see him being really evil I was just repulsed. Patricia Arquette was not at her best either. I haven't seen any of her other films, but I'm sure that they were better then the role of simpering girlfriend/victim. The final word on this movie was that everyone wasted their time and should have avoided this sloppy attempt at classic horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nightwatch, which was apparently an English-language remake of the Dutch film Nattevagen, both from director Ole Bornedal, was a dark horror murder mystery. It has a great cast in Ewan McGregor, who has a good American accent, Patricia Arquette, John C. Reilly, and Nick Nolte. It's sad that they weren't asked to do anything impressive. There was a very existential tint to it, but it was too little, too late to add any depth. It did make me think, though. Still, it was nicely shot, and the gross parts are enough to make you shiver without making you sick, and they were done quite effectively. Nothing was unnecessary. The soundtrack was a good mix of rock, classical, and spooky "atmosphere" music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sordid, violent and excellent film, an in- Alfred- Hytchcok's-thriller- style masterpiece!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most violent, frightening and distressing films ever done by Hollywood, "Nightwatch" is a surprising work, a crime-drama that involves and scares!Ole Bornedal filmed the remake of his original film, the 1994's "Nattevagen", and, even "Nightwatch" have been filmed in 1996, it was only thrown commercially in 1998. The real thing that Bornedal got to accomplish was a Hitchcock style kind of movie, for its excellent performances, the different angles of filmings, for the script well built and developed carefully, and for a picture that accentuates the oppressive climate of the film. In spite of excessively violent (as in a scene in which a prostitute is stabbed in the belly), the film seduces, although by its feeble tone,what makes "Nightwatch" remembers "Hellraiser". The story is cruel and depressing: Martin (Ewan McGregor) is a young law student, who accepts an employment as nightwatch man,taking care of a place where people put the bodies of the dead ones,a mortuary, and in spite of his girlfriend (Patricia Arquette) dislikes the idea, Martin decides to work hard there. At the same time, a murderer begins to kill prostitutes with details filled with cruelty ,he rapes them and pulls up their eyes. The victims are sent to the mortuary in which Martin works. The things become to acquire dangerous and sordid contours when the bodies are found abused inside the mortuary, and to the eyes of the police, Martin becomes the main suspect! This touching and thrilling intrigue gets to maintain the agile rhythm of the film and it guarantees a projection time full of excitement and tension, allies to memorable performances. Ewan McGregor is great, Josh Brolin (who interprets Martin's friend, a man who is obsessed with survival and danger) and Nick Nolte, excellent, in one of his best actings,frightening and lowering! "Nightwatch" has a duration's time that balances the terror and the drama, and with certainty is not a good show for sensitive people, this is a great film for people who like innovative works loaded with tension!watch"Nightwatch" and savor one of the best crime-drama films of 1998, check the acting of the star Nick Nolte, in one of his most inspired performances,which deserved an Academy Award Best Supporting Actor Nomination, as the cruel Policeman Thomas Cray !"Nightwatch" is an innovative and memorable horror movie!</fullReview>

And what's with Ewan McGregor's accent? It was worse than Kevin Costner in "Robin Hood!" I think Nick Nolte phoned this one in, but, once again, John C. Reilly was great, albeit uncredited.

		<fullReview>I wanted to love it. I really did. I saw it because Ewan is in it, and I was hoping for the best. I'm usually not a big fan of thrillers because, let's face it, they're so rarely thrilling anymore. The cast, with the exception of the cringe-inducing Patricia Arquette, tries to do what they can with characters that have all the depth of a kiddie pool. Ewan runs around trying to convince himself he's in charge of his life and to convince me he could actually love Patricia's character, who has to be one of the most irritating heroines ever. He is, however, very good at conveying the creepiness of working in a morgue and how hard a person would have to try to get over it. Nick Nolte isn't bad; neither is the "best friend", although I'm still wondering exactly why he seems to be going off the deep end most of the movie. Also weird: the whole Martin, James, killer triangle. I was never sure how involved or uninvolved they were. Anyway, not too bad if you're a big McGregor fan, but otherwise not too great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing this movie, I came away convinced that three teams of writers/editors/directors/composers/actors worked on this film. The first team believed NIGHTWATCH was supposed to be a grim, dark thriller -- a wrenching journey into the human abyss, a la SE7EN. The second team believed it was supposed to be a self-conscious, tongue-in-cheek take-off of the thriller-horror genre, a la SCREAM. And the third team believed it was supposed to be a cutting-edge, hipper-than-thou dark tragi-comedy, a la TRAINSPOTTING with corpses instead of heroin. Once the teams were assembled, they were all randomly assigned the scenes for which they were responsible, and then not allowed to communicate with each other.The result: NIGHTWATCH -- at turns creepy, grisly, intentionally hilarious, Unintentionally hilarious, ridiculous, insulting and downright embarrassing. Good scenes alternate with dreadful scenes; great bits of dialogue intermingle with cringe-inducing lines that even the actors look ashamed to utter; fantastic visual motifs are undermined by cheap schlock. The only scenes in which I covered my eyes were the ones in which I was mortified for the actors themselves (the dinner scene with the prostitute comes -- ahem -- to mind). The scary "jump" scenes, on the other hand, are telegraphed so clumsily that you can set your watch by them. And the final, obligatory "everyone meets in the parking lot after being stiched up by the paramedics" scene contains one gaping logical flaw: wouldn't the guy who has just sawed his own thumb off (!!!) to free himself from handcuffs be rushed to the nearest emergency room to have emergency surgery to re-attach his thumb, rather than sitting around in a bandage, chatting?Most damning is the fact that it's a good 50/50 bet that you'll figure out who the real killer is during the opening credits (which themselves happen to be overly-long, self-conssciously stylized, and downright irritating). As a result, the red herring character may as well be wandering around the film with a sandwich board on his body, declaring RED HERRING.No one's character is explored in depth; their motivations are paper thin, when they are explained at all. That leaves the actors with very little to work with. McGregor just looks baffled most of the time, tho' he does invoke the heebie-jeebies of working in the morgue really well. Nick Nolte (who seems to be melting, facially-wise) doesn't "sell" his character from the outset -- as a result, you know intuitively that things are not what they seem. Josh Brolin chews the scenery as the inexplicably unhinged best friend. And Patricia Arquette -- let's be blunt -- can't act. I don't care how minimal the role is. She just can't act.Finally, sad to say, the movie is so choppy, ugly and weirdly paced that the sight of Ewan McGregor butt-nekkid in the bathtub isn't even erotic (for those of us who find that sort of thing thrilling).But those plastic-encased trees and the moths in the light fixtures are good 'n' creepy, though!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not unforgettable, but it's effective anyway. It can be divided in two parts: In the first one it takes the shape of an old terror movie and in the second it goes the way of a common thriller. But it surprised me, because, usually, the films made to scare us are all the same and not scaring at all. This one, specially in the first half, achieves its aim.The editing in the very beginning, while the credits are being presented, gets you inside the nightmare feeling that will regulate the next scenes, it's very insidious. Then you know that Ewan McGregor is just starting to work at some kind of morgue and you're forceful invited to share with him the same claustrophobic fears of being alone in such a dreadful place. You know there are only dead bodies there, but what the movie does, and that's the great thing about it, is to terrorize you with the creepy air that fills the rooms and corridors. The villains here are not zombies, vampires or monsters. The fear is not made out of frantic cuts and sudden frights, at least, there's no abuse about it, but it's a slow, lazy and hidden kind of threat.When the psychopath takes place, the plot is driven to an usual thriller with all the clichés, and although the best part is already gone, it still works.The film has a lot of weak points - Nick Nolte, for instance, is risible -; Ewan McGregor, Patricia Arquette and Josh Brollin are doing their jobs cause there's nothing more to do with charachters like that. And, yet, this one's far better than all the recent others in the genre.</fullReview>

Quite possibly one of the worst films ever; Ewan McGregor nonwithstanding. Not recommended if you aren't an Ewan McGregor fan, otherwise you may die of boredom.

		<fullReview>If it made more sense, NIGHTWATCH could have been a thriller with class. Instead, the director has opted for cheap slasher type of thrills and a script which is never quite believable, especially when the actual killer turns out to be someone we were not led to suspect and whose revelation as the demented serial killer is too hard to accept as anything but a major plot contrivance.EWAN McGREGOR is the night watchmen at the morgue who is framed for a series of grisly crimes. After awhile, even his girlfriend (PATRICIA ARQUETTE) begins to think he may have committed them and his foolish so-called "friend" (JAMES BROLIN) is a practical joker who might just know a lot more than he reveals. NICK NOLTE is the tough looking cop on the beat who at first seems to think McGregor may not be guilty and appears to be serious about solving the crimes. BRAD DOURIF is a creepy doctor who has no doubts about McGregor's guilt.The suspense does build up nicely, especially for the last twenty minutes when things get really feverish and we know who the killer is. But when it's over, you're left with so many loopholes in plot construction that none of it really stands close scrutiny.It does work on the level of a creepy thriller with lots of gore and quirky characters but I can't honestly say I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nightwatch is the remake of the Danish hit 'Nattevagten' by the same director. It's almost identical to the original (camera shots etc.) but some (unnecessary?) scenes are left out.Ewan McGregor has to carry this movie almost all on his own and does a splendid job as always. He's really the right man for the part. The other actors did an OK job too, although I'm not sure about Nolte's performance.The atmosphere throughout the movie ( especially the first twenty minutes) can be described as asphyxiating and intensely claustrophobic. Add this up with the great filming locations and the very well-chosen music and you've got a great but strange movie. I can honestly say it's hard to classify Nightwatch...it's not a horror film nor is it a pure thriller. It's got it's very own style. I was pleasantly surprised by it because I didn't have any expectations( contrary to people who saw the original) but I feel it could've been a masterpiece instead of just a solid film. Can't really explain the details but some scenes felt like scenes from a B-film and some of the acting felt like that too.The film genuinely gave me the creeps (not through cheap scares but through the atmosphere). It has one of the greatest build-ups of a horror(like) film I've ever seen. It reminded me about the well-constructed atmosphere in 1408. That movie wasn't as creepy as this one is but it made you feel uncomfortable before he even entered the room. And in a way Nightwatch is similar: I was very creep-ed out before anything had actually happened.Recommended if you like alternative stuff. People who already thought Vacancy was scary should avoid this, or they'll probably suffer a heart-attack.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nightwatch", the 1997 remake of "Nattevagten", is a reasonably effective thriller and a great way to spend a few hours in-front of the screen. Like the original, "Nightwatch" is directed by Denmark's Ole Bornedal and tells the story of a night watchman who is plunged into a dark mystery of dead prostitutes and strange goings-on in the morgue. The watchman, Ewan McGregor, becomes entangled in events and things hurtle towards a dramatic conclusion.The film has an impressive cast. Nick Nolte plays the cop who is intent on tracking down the serial killer; Patricia Arquette is McGregor's love-interest; and Brad Dourif plays the duty doctor. Josh Brolin is excellent as McGregor's slightly unhinged friend, James Gallman.Although the film is a bit clunky at times, it's a decent thriller and worthy of an 8. The original, I recall, is the superior film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A law-student decides to get a part-time job because he and his girlfriend need the money. So, he's hired as a night watchman for a creepy city morgue, in which he'll be spending all night by his lonesome and certainly after a while some weird things start occurring. But also there's a serial killer on the loose in the city performing sickening acts on young woman. While, the police are struggling to get any leads, somehow, the evidence all starts pointing to the student and everyone but one police officer believes he's innocent.The first time I saw the film I didn't realise that it was a remake, but the second time around while watching it I couldn't stop thinking how does it compare to the original Danish flick. Well, bugger shall I know, as haven't come across it yet to decipher. Basically this is a glossed up, trashy Hollywood remake that feels rather hollow inside, though saying that it does have its moments and its very high on mood. The director of the original flick 'Nattevagten (1994)' Ole Bornedal heads to America to direct it and his helped out by Steven Sodebergh in the writing component. It's hard to put my finger on it, but something seems to be missing. It starts of compelling enough were we learn a bit about the characters, also we get huge amount of black humour and gags thrown in too. Some of it just doesn't work and slows the whole thing down. Well, you can say too many jokes drown proceedings. While, the mid-section is incredibly intense in which our protagonist's world is turned upside down and he finds himself embroiled in the horror of this serial killer. But sadly that all came too a sudden stop towards the back-end of the story. The plot was going oh so well then it self-destructs. The tension and creepy spell that was illustrated to begin with has totally vanished. We're given the killer's identity, which doesn't come as too much of a surprise. Then it gets all a bit too conveniently silly and looses its dreaded edge by going over-the-top, because it sported a psychological grip to start off with and then falls into cheap scares. Really, it goes all downhill from then onwards! Even there's a certain sub-plot about the two students daring each other to do out-there pranks just to get a rush, and one of them complains that it just doesn't come off like it use to. Bingo! The context of this film should be more disturbing and daring then it is and sadly there's no rush or tantalizing feel to proceedings. Yeah, there are some sequences, which are worked up rather well, but they don't leave a lasting impression or take your breath away.The plot might not set it apart from the usual mechanical, dark and seedy thriller, but the film looks top-notch. The setting of the morgue has touches of Gothic tones that create a spooky shade and when you got the howling wind outside, the grand statue of the Hospital plays on the nerves by making you see and hear things that you can only detect. The atmosphere was a high-note here and the cinematography translates the isolation and panic considerably well. It maintained a great rhythm throughout and pans across the screen fluidly. It boasts an established score and radical rock soundtrack too, which added to the chilling but also careless vibe we felt from our protagonist. Also the children song 'Nick knack, patty whack' is used rather eerily in one scene. By giving it fast cutting treatment it feels a bit shallow and rushed in certain scenes, but hey sometimes it felt like a drag. Although I lean more towards the mostly deadpan performances making it feel like I'm slowly sinking in quicksand. Nick Nolte would be the main offender here, but heck he didn't look very well. Was he in character as a burned up cop or maybe not? He just looked dumbfounded! Ewan McGregor is the star here, although his performance doesn't evoke applause, but he has a likable screen presence that makes you feel for his character. Other recognisable faces are Patricia Arquette, Josh Brolin, John C.Reilly and Brad Dourif as an uptight Duty Doctor. The latter two were sorely under-used. The script didn't do much either as it laboured along with the most effectively compelling moments being when there was little or no dialog to be heard. Sometimes lapses of logic flooded the script too. The overdone flick entertains, but not too soon you'll forgot all about it.Very much a so-so thriller, well maybe more a black comedy that tries to be horrific. Anyway, it gets all the 5 star treatment, but that doesn't mean it will all eventuate on screen and the story, performances and script show up that problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Like in the movies" (the characters were constantly saying)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a murder, there's a cop (Nick Nolte) talking about what happened with the murderer and some guys talking. These are two friends with two girlfriends. James (Josh Brolin) and his girlfriend Marie (Lauren Graham), her friend Katherine (Patricia Arquette) and her boyfriend Martin (Ewan McGregor). Martin and James are law students, and friends, but they are different in the bottom-line. The thing is the film needs a plot, so Martin starts working as a Night Watch Man in a Medical Center. An old man that worked there gives him a spooky, and very well written introduction to the place, just to scare Martin. There is darkness, creepy rooms and of course, the morgue (which has the bodies of the persons being killed in the murderers). The rest is what you expect, or not probably; but nothing from the other world.This is an American version, of a Danish movie, with the same name, and from the same director. I am worried if the original would be as bad as this one is, because I haven't seen it. But I doubt that. It should be a very good movie, because when American versions are realized, is usually a failure, if not, worse than the original. I'm just saying this because "Nightwatch" is a nicely shot film, and it's very well directed, and it has a very intelligent script (Steven Soderbergh put his magic hand there). Ole Bornedal is not a stupid man. He knows how to create suspense in the right times. He has a good editor, and a good production designer. Don't blame him for the environment he has to create. The man is doing his job. The movie is full of intelligent lines spoken by intelligent characters. Nick Nolte, as Inspector Cray, has the best lines. He plays the character with a mood that's interesting as it is mysterious. He knows too much; a lot of experience. Lauren Graham can't be remembered in any frame. She could have done better; but her character was just an element for the plot. Patricia Arquette takes a shot in the last minutes, but she doesn't spread much talent. Ewan McGregor is an actor I like very much. Here he couldn't surpass the limits, as he usually does. Anyway, Josh Brolin steals the show as James, with his crazy faces and thought-provoking lines. He wasn't afraid to reach the extremes. While you're watching the movie, you will try to find out who the killer is. It doesn't matter if you can't, although it really matters who did everything (that's basically what the movie presents). The thing is the film deals with some other issues, inside the good script. Issues like being dead while you're alive and waiting to die. I'll leave all those things for you to see.Almost at the end, a person is standing behind the killer, and explains a murder theory. "It's an interesting theory", the killer says. In that moment you should look at the killer's face. His master plan has been figured out. He has failed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts off with a good pace and perplexing characters. The tension builds and causes you to watch with the feeling of a spider climbing up your spine. Your judgment is then tested as to who you think the killer may be, however it soon becomes obvious who it really is, even before they reveal the killer. After which point much of the film succumbs to cliche plot lines and stupid characters. You know that point in the scary movie where all the intelligent characters suddenly lose 30 IQ points in ten minutes. Sadly this film falls to that annoying characteristic of the slasher film. What could have been a much better film as indicated by the actors, Ewan McGregor and Nick Nolte, is nothing more than a re-hashed telling of a scary story with a very mild twist at best.If your in the mood for a scary movie with Ewan skip Nightwatch. For something that Ewan actually did well in and is a pretty interesting film, complete with scary moments and plot twist that aren't obvious take a look at "Shallow Grave."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nightwatch (1998) Ewan McGregor, Nick Nolte, Patricia Arquette, Josh Brolin, Lauren Graham, John C. Reilly, Brad Dourif, Alix Koromzay, D: Ole Bornedal. McGregor's Scottish accent slips in and out as he plays a law student taking pay at a morgue as the night watchman. He soon gets implicated as the suspect to a chain of grisly murders (all prostitutes) orchestrated by a serial killer. With Nolte as the disbelieving detective, Arquette as the concerned girlfriend, and Brolin as the daredevil chum. Aside from the great tension and mood, this who-dun-it chiller has (surprisingly) a few too many red herrings and the material becomes awfully unpleasant in the last fifteen minutes. Remade from Bornedal's other film, NATTEVAGTEN. Running Time: 105 minutes and rated R for strong morbid violence, language, sexuality, and some drug content. ** ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another weak Dimension Films thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* 1/2 out of ****Nightwatch boasts a nugget of a decent premise, a mostly excellent cast, and occasionally stylish direction from Ole Bornedal, who presumably based much of the film off his own Danish thriller, Nattevagten. Unfortunately, the story makes an astonishing amount of wrong turns, making what should have been a merely average horror/thriller into almost a complete misfire.Ewan McGregor stars as Martin Bells, a law student who takes up a job as the nightwatchman of a morgue. It's a creepy place to work, much to the chagrin of his girlfriend, Katherine (Patricia Arquette), though this new job apparently amuses his best friend James (Josh Brolin). Anyway, a string of recent murders involving prostitutes becomes involved, as Martin believes the real killer may be trying to frame him.Nightwatch is, for the most part, a pretty boring movie. Though the set-up in the morgue may be initially creepy, the realization that no harm is going to come to McGregor (at least not until the end) sort of kills the suspense. Thus, to build tension, the film tries to work as a whodunnit. It fails miserably.This is one of those movies where everyone around our hero acts as guilty as possible, meant to arouse our suspicions with their "evil eye" looks and cryptic dialogue. Josh Brolin keeps talking about craving excitement and having sex with hookers, Brad Dourif is the pain-in-the-ass doctor with the creepy facial expressions, and Nick Nolte is the somewhat quiet cop who talks about the killer as if though he knows him. Hmm, wonder who it could be. There's also that old nightwatchman who shows McGregor around the morgue, he's one of those cringe-inducing attempts at crafting a "weirdo" character who has no viable reason to the plot to act the way he does except to function as a suspect.The killer's identity is actually revealed with a half-hour left (and yes, it's exactly who I thought it would be), and from that point on, starts acting like a total idiot who sloppily covers up his/her crimes without much thought or logic. Hard to believe this person could have committed this many murders without getting caught, incompetent as he/she is. Anyway, the film ends in a routinely predictable fashion, with the psycho killer babbling while slowly approaching his/her intended victims with a sharp implement. If their stories are even halfway similar, I can't imagine Nattevagten being much good, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make sure you lock your doors and windows and close the curtains before you watch this video. Perhaps it's best not to watch it alone too. It's really spooky as one might expect. After all it's the night shift and it's the morgue.... Martin (Ewan McGregor)is newly appointed as security officer at the morgue. Working all through the night he has to do the rounds every hour. I'm not sure why. Dark passageways, flickering fluorescent tubes, moths fluttering in light shades....add to this the anatomical specimens, the formaldehyde baths, the cadavers under white sheets....this is Martin's world. Not to mention a previous nightwatchman who was expelled. Why? Because he "did it with them" This idea of necrophilia horrifies and astonishes Martin."And very soon", he is told "You'll smell the morgue in your breath"The atmosphere of the morgue is well developed and nearly all the characters are suspicious looking individuals. When a muder is committed the murderer arranges the evidence which tends to incriminate Martin. As the horror mounts anatomical surgical tools are introduced with the possibility of dismembering Martin and his girl friend. If taken seriously this is real edge of the seat viewing reminiscent of the old chain saw movies. Ewan McGregor as the central character manages to maintain his character to the end while his buddy a mischievous prankster adds some comic relief. The medical staff are an unhappy looking lot, perhaps understandably so. It's probably not a film you would want to see twice, but as a thriller it's worth a look.WARNING: Don't open the windows until morning!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Some very very very very mild spoilers might be ahead)Unlike most people who have commented on 'Nightwatch' here, I have actually seen the Original movie Nattevagten (made in 1994 by the same director). Nightwatch is a remake of this film in almost any sense of the word. Much like the recent Psycho-remake, the director simply tried to recreate his original film. In this perspective, McGregor was very well casted, because he looks a lot like the original Norwegian actor who played the role of Martin. A lot of scenes in the movie I might say almost all of them!) are exact copies of scenes in the original movie. It's almost scary, sometimes it even looks like they used the sets and props all over again. (Joyce's apartment, the 'bathtub room', Martin's little office, etc) This goes very much into every detail. The mysterious photograph in martin's office is THE SAME as in the original film. (Rumour goes it's an early picture of the director himself). Little things like that are all through this remake (the moths in the lamp, the flickering light in the hallway).So did the crew succeed in making an exact copy of the original film? NO WAY! It might look the same, but this version lacks any form of tension. Everything that works so well in the original film just seems silly or stupid in this version. I still can't put my finger on it...I don't know what it is, it just doesn't work!Even though the movies have more than one thing in common, there are also a lot of differences. For instance, the sick little game going on between Martin and his best friend isn't really worked into Nightwatch well. In Nattevagten, this goes much further. This 'game' is much more important in the original film. (Mind you, something I found rather strange, is the scene in the bar when the girls get harrassed. In Nightwatch, the two bullies are a black guy and a latino. In the original film however, both guys are WHITE! What's up with that???). Nattevagten ends with a real funny epilogue like wedding scene, totally cut out of Nightwatch.Watching Nightwatch after you've seen Nattevagten is like watching your local high school's drama club perform Shakespeare. Sure, the words are right, the actors look the way they should, but it just doesn't work the way it was supposed to be. If you haven't seen Nightwatch, do yourself a favour: go rent the original movie Nattevagten!!! Sure, the weird Norwegian language takes a little getting used to, but you'll get into it eventually. If you have seen Nightwatch and hated it, go get Nattevagten as well. You won't be disappointed. If you have seen Nightwatch and LIKED IT, go rent NATTEVAGTEN NOW and be in for the movie experience of a lifetime!!!</fullReview>

We're both big Ewan McGregor fans, and I swear I was about to cry when I heard his beautiful Scottish voice masked with an American accent. But I think that he probably looks better in this film than any others..But back to the film, it's great how even when you think you know who the killer is, another twist arises... It makes you fear the morgues more than you fear cemetaries or haunted houses. I guess that is understandable, though.. Creepy performances by Nick Nolte and Josh Brolin. I was unimpressed by Patricia Arquette. I thought she looked horrible and acted horribly. Ewan was fabulous.. though the movie script didn't give him much to do. His scenes in the morgue can make your hair stand up, and all of his false alarms are believable.. I mean, what would you do if you were stuck alone in a morgue all night. Agh!I still gave it 10/10 because of the creepiness and the shocking ending.. and I was shocked.</fullReview>

The movie is essentially one big plot hole that is held together by some decent performances and a few well shot set pieces. Josh Brolin was the best performance, but the writing negated that for reasons I won't go into so as not to spoil this for anyone who feels they have an hour and a half to burn.Evidently my review isn't long enough so I will go on to say that the writers have clearly had no experience at all with police procedures or are hoping that the viewers are oblivious.

		<shortDescription>Inferior remake of a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to start this review by briefly mentioning two films I saw recently. The first was a film titled Nattevagten, the brilliant Danish thriller of which Nightwatch is a remake of, and the second is a film called Diabolique; the 1995 remake of classic French thriller Les Diaboliques, which showed that remaking classic foreign films for an American audience is never a good idea. Nightwatch is directed by the same man that brought us Nattevagten three years earlier, Ole Bornedal, but the problem is that he's taken the plot that made his original film so great and changed the tone for an American audience; thus making it not so great. The plot is pretty much the same as it was in the Danish version, and we focus on Martin; a student given the task of watching the morgue at night. This happens around the same time that someone is going round bumping off prostitutes and gouging out their eyes. Naturally, the bodies are delivered to the morgue where Martin works, and it's not long before Martin begins getting involved in the investigation.The opening scene pretty much sums up why this film isn't going to work; while the original focused on the night watchman and the murders were almost a subplot, here we get a graphic murder right from the off. Most of the film is similar to the original, but with this different tone from the outset; it would seem that Bornedal didn't really know what to do, so he just re-directed the key scenes from the Danish version and the result is messy. The original had a lot of scenes that stand out in the memory, and this one features all those scenes; except unlike the original which flowed from one scene to the next, this time the scenes just basically come after one another and I would imagine it could get confusing for anyone who hasn't seen the original - not good considering that most people who see this probably wont have seen the original. The film features a few cult stars such as Brad Dourif, Nick Nolte and John C. Reilly (uncredited, apparently), and the lead is taken by Ewan McGregor; who is OK except for his American accent. Josh Brolin is not sleazy enough for the role he is given. I guess I might have liked this film more if I had not seen the original and thus already knew what was coming at the end; it's still a great finale even if the rest of the film isn't up to much. All in all, I really can't recommend anyone sees this - see the original if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a proof that all the Hollywood stars and money cant remake a movie and make it better. This movie is a remake of a Danish movie with the name nattevagten(nightwatch). The Danish version was very big in Denmark and still is because it started off the great Danish movie tradition. So if ppl. really want see this movie they should see the danish version, watching this Us. is a waist of time. Also I read another comment saying something about the name nightwatch, that name is a rippoff the Danish name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn´t like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not like Nightwatch, because it was not as frightening as it wanted to be. The actors were quite bad, and it was just a remake. I did not like Nattevagten, too, but that one has been at least a bit interesting.I rated both movies 4/10, because they are almost the same. Same story, and so on...It is maybe two years ago that I have seen Nightwatch, so I cannot tell you much about it. But I will watch it again when it is on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystery Thriller Minus The Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reasonable attempt at the genre, unfortunately mired down with unexciting scenes and tedious screenplay. The plot evolves around a student who picks up a job as a night watchman, to make some extra swag.The major problem here is that the characters we're supposed to feel something for, have rather rancid personalities. Hence, they never capture our sympathy. The viewer is left in an ambiguous hole, being detached from getting caught up in the story. That being, yet another prostitute killing looney on the loose. Phew...At least the writers stayed away from cliches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Josh Brolin is riveting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this creepy thriller once at the cinema (where I really got into it) and once on video (where I started to see the flaws in some of the characterizations). The film is sick in parts (the thumb thing, the semen on the leg) and sickly funny too. It's quite sexist and some of the performances are lousy (especially Ewan and Nick Nolte who under-act and over-act respectively). Josh Brolin is very effective in his support role. I think he saves the film with his amazing skills. He is certainly an actor to watch out for. Without him, the identity of the killer would have been ludicrously straightforward (although I doubt there's anyone who won't figure it out before the end.) Some of the other support characters are effective but Patricia Arquette's role is too small to judge. The film looks great and it's an original concept, music is used to good effect e.g. "This old man, he played six". All in all, it's an OK film but only stands up to one viewing and is not for the faint-hearted because the whole thing leaves you feeling rather ill but at least it provokes some kind of reaction (unlike most films these days). I'll be sure to check out the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>remake without teeth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nightwatch (1998) is a very tame remake of Nattevagten (Nightwatch, 1994) and has lost most of its original wit and suspense. It seems like the typical softened version for the American audiences. I'm disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's up with English-speaking audiences' refusal to read subtitles?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the late 80s, Dutch director George Sluizer had a critical and financial hit on his hands with the eerie and unforgettable SPOORLOOS. For some reason, instead of giving him a new project to work on, American producers decided instead to have him just remake the film in English as THE VANISHING and gave him a bankable cast that included Kiefer Sutherland, Jeff Bridges and Sandra Bullock. This resulted in a tamer, more "polished" and much less effective film that had nowhere near the eerie, gritty impact of the original. In other words, it was both misguided and completely pointless. When I found out the same fate had befallen director Ole Bornedal, I cringed. Bornedal scored a 1994 hit with the Dutch horror-thriller NATTEVAGTEN, and instead of giving that film a decent U.S. release, the director instead was hired to do yet another remake. Why? My only guess is that producers saw money in this concept, yet knew that the majority of moviegoers in this country will flat out refuse to watch any film that's subtitles. It's sad but true. While the curse of the remake lives on here (it's not nearly as good as the original), this thankfully isn't too bad. It's much better than the redo of THE VANISHING, at least.Chain-smoking law student Martin (Ewan McGregor) lands a job as night watchman at a creepy big city morgue where the bodies of slain prostitutes are filling up the joint. A serial killer, who likes to play out his necrophilia fantasies with hookers before killing them and removing their eyes, is on the loose and has been sneaking into the morgue for late-night romps with the corpses. Even worse, the psycho hatches a plan to frame Martin for the crimes. Although the story doesn't hold up to close scrutiny, it's entertaining, witty, creepy and has some surprisingly sick content for a major release with name stars. Excellent cast, with special mention to Brad Dourif (a real hoot as a sarcastic doctor) and Alix Koromzay (nice job as a junkie/hooker who holds the key to the crimes).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had no idea just how I was going to enjoy this film and I found myself completely glued to the TV set and I was horrified by all the blood and gore and secret surprises through out the entire picture. Ewan McGregor, (Martin Bells) plays a guy who is on vacation and decides to be a watchman for the morgue and encounters things you would never believe and I won't tell either. Nick Nolte,(Inspector Thomas Albert Cray) gave an outstanding performance trying to help Martin Bells get out of a rough jam he got himself into on the job. Patricia Arquette, (Katherine) gave a great supporting role along with the entire cast. If you haven't seen this film, you simply must see this, it is truly a thriller of a picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin (Ewan McGregor who looks like a little kid) takes a job as a night watchman at a Medical Eximanors building--with a morgue in the basement--while a serial killer is on the loose. Strange things begin happening--and it looks like the killer might be after Martin. Patricia Arquette (given nothing to work with) is his girlfriend; Josh Brolin is his seriously disturbed best friend and Nick Nolte plays a police inspector trying to find the killer.Pretty good suspense thriller--not really a horror film. It's stylishly directed, never dull and has some really spooky sets and pieces. But the film has a very sick quality to it (when they threw in necrophilia and Brolins' character is VERY cruel) that sometimes makes this unpleasant to watch. I also figured out who the killer was before they tell us. But the acting is good (Brolin is excellent) and it kept me interested for its running time.This was originally supposed to be released in 1995 or 1996--but Miramax kept pushing the release date ahead until it came out in 1997. That usually means the movie is terrible--but not in this case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard video thriller despite many nice touches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A straight-laced law student takes a job as a night watchman in the mortuary wing of the hospital. While his friend James tries to show Martin how to experience new ways of getting kicks, a necrophiliac serial killer is killing prostitutes. However when things start happening with the bodies in the morgue the clues begin to point to Martin.Although I don't mind remakes if they're good, I dislike the way something's are copied frame for frame. This isn't quite that bad but it's pretty much a copy of Bornedal's original film. The plot is quite good and there is some creepy bits but really it's only a standard mystery film.The films hands you several red herrings that are off putting but happily reveals the killer a good half an hour before the end - so that it's not building to that at least. However I must say I enjoyed the red herring and the stuff about James more than I enjoyed the rest. The film is still OK but it has the feel of a video thriller despite the glossy production. I guess that's the problem with a copy - it lacks it's own energy.McGregor is actually very good despite having to have an American accent. Brolin is also good as James but Arquette can't be more than a squeaky woman. Nolte, Brad Doriff and John C Reilly are also all good in their roles. However you can't help feel like they are wearing someone else's shoes.Overall this is worth a watch once - but why not watch the original instead? This has plenty of nice moments but seldom manages to risk above the standard of many video serial killer films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Did It? Who Cares?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with so many "mysteries" of today is that the genre has been used up. In order to keep things fresh, mysteries (or as they're now FRESHLY called, thrillers) pick implausible murderers and/or set up ridiculous scenarios to throw you off track. Scream 2, while not technically a "mystery," is a prime example. Nightwatch follows in a similar, ridiculous vein. Is the point to entertain or to screw you over?It's worth mentioning that Nightwatch has the longest shelf-life of any film at Dimension (and possibly ANY studio!) to my knowledge (although the Winona Ryder vehicle Lost Souls is sneaking up quickly). More than a year after seeing a trailer, the film was finally released to a handful of theatres and dumped quickly onto video.The setup is good: law student Martin Bells (McGregor) gets a job as a night watchman at a hospital/morgue. Surrounded by dead bodies and an immoral, creepy friend (Brolin), Bells gets increasingly paranoid as he does his nightly rounds. Eventually local serial killings play their way into his life and he finds that he may be hunted.It's not SO bad; director Ole Bornedal creates alot of good atmosphere and uses some great lighting and sets. And Nick Nolte is at first unrecognizable as Inspector Cray, physically and vocally. He seems to be the only actor mixing it up and having a bit of fun.But the bad outweighs the good. Ewen McGregor annoyingly tries out an American accent (and slips more times than kids at a pool). Patricia Arquette's overbearing shortness and Josh Brolin's huge cranium are not hidden well (things that aren't apparent from decent camera work in True Romance and The Goonies, respectively). More than anything, the script is atrocious. Terrible dialogue (I actually turned red a few times) and silly plot points (I actually turned red a few times) leading nowhere bog the film down. I started reading a week-old newspaper during a dinner sequence! I've never seen the 1994 Danish version, but it appears that Bornedal's original script (which is highly praised) was glossed over in Hollywood by...Steve Soderbergh?! I'm surprised that such an accomplished director didn't have his name removed. I can only hope that the original version gives good reason for the killer picking on Bells.Poorly acted, poorly concocted, and not directed well enough to contain attention, Nightwatch falls flat on its face. I would only recommend this film to people, such as myself, who recall seeing the same trailer for over a year in theatres and missed the actual release. Please forgive all involved if you are fans. If you are unfamiliar with any of the cast or crew, please give them a second chance! If you simply think that this looks like a good thriller, rent something else. Or watch three episodes of The Simpsons. Or read a bloody book. Or scratch your inner-thigh with a cheese grater for an hour and a half; anything to stay away from the mind-boggling boredom created by Nightwatch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch You Don`t Fall Down The Plot Holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the original version of NIGHTWATCH but the only thing I can remember about it was being unimpressed . It was very much a slow moody European movie so I was wondering how Ole Borneal was going to improve it for a mainstream transatlantic audience!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!If truth be told I don`t think he`s improved it all , in fact I think he`s made a complete mess adapting it . For example at the very start of the movie it`s revealed the killer has a fetish for dead bodies and later on prostitute Joyce reveals one of her customers likes her to pretend she`s dead which pricks the interest of Martin . This supposedly ties in with the plot but it doesn`t because Martin was absent in the opening scene which means this revelation would have no meaning to him . I did manage to work out who the murderer was before it`s revealed just over two thirds of the way through mainly down to the fact it`s obvious there`s something completely wrong with the cop`s operating methods . A semen sample , yeah right ! It`s also ridiculous that despite stabbing Joyce to death the murderer doesn`t get a single drop of blood on his clothes . Oh and is it ever pointed out what the murderer`s motives are ?There are some good points . Ewan McGregor is far better than what I expected and Nick Nolte is every bit as good as I did expect , and the film does have a moody atmosphere , but it`s not a very good film down to the simple reason of too many plot holes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High expectations ... but a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nightwatch is a movie with an interesting premise, but it all falls apart in the end. Which is too bad because I couldn't think of a better setup for an urban tale of paranoia and suspense. Especially given that before I was born, my father was a night watch man (we call them security guards) stationed at a mental hospital/detox's and had to walk the grounds, do rounds, etc. It was not his favorite job. Eventually something better came along (we call that a career) and he was out of there.So as me and my father sat down for this - a tale about a night watch man in an eerie place - just ripe for creepy vibes - we were quite interesting in seeing where this story would go. There was so many possibilities, but that's where our interest left because soon this movie was settling into the comfortable groove of predictability with the cliché formula of 'people dying and the main character is the chief suspect'. Sigh. Then we meet this guy's best friend. He's semi-wacko at least from my perspective. He's wild, weird, unpredictable and gross. So naturally he's either a huge red herring or he just got my early vote for the perverted sexual killer.Things progress, we're given little snippets of factual information that pass as sly attempts at clues and then suddenly this best friend is mature, calm and in other words completely different than forty minutes ago. So he takes a back seat in the race for the perverted sexual killer and we're left with waiting to figure out who the killer is when at this point I don't care. The movie has already become stale, it slides even further before the end, and I'm left trying to believe this could have been a whole lot better.</fullReview>
