		<shortDescription>What's the Deal? Need more NEIL!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay... all these submissions below? Ignore them. Here's the real scoop.The biggest problem most folks have with this film is that they're comparing the two male leads' acting ability. BIG MISTAKE.One is Neil Diamond-- one of the greatest singers of all time. The other is Sir Laurence Olivier-- one of the greatest ACTORS of all time. Think of it this way: if Sir Larry accompanied Neil in a recording of "Cherry, Cherry"-- people would rave about Neil's performance, but then spend an hour going on about how much Olivier sucks.The fact is this: neither of them suck. Everything is great! Neil Diamond is a fine actor. (Not an AMAZING actor, mind you... but a fine actor.) He'd even beaten out Dustin Hoffman for the role of Lenny Bruce in "Lenny", but turned it down... leaving the door open for Hoffman.I made the mistake of reading all of the below jeers and whines about Neil Diamond's "terrible acting performance" in this movie. I then watched it over at my girlfriend's house with very low expectations. But I was very impressed, and greatly enjoyed the film. Granted, there are some times when Neil's performance isn't exactly as dramatic as it should be... (i.e., when his father shrieks "I HAVE NO SON!!", Neil doesn't exactly seem to be heartbroken.) But then, there are times when he manifests a great deal of emotional power... especially in the scenes where he gets angry.Okay, so I'm a huge Neil Diamond fan, yes. I love his music, and I think it's cool that he's had a lead in a major motion picture. BUT-- from an acting perspective, he has my respect. From one actor to another. (YES, I consider him an "actor" too... and so does the IMDb.) I only have two complaints: one is that this is the only movie he's been in until Saving Silverman-- where he had just a cameo. That sucks. I want to see Neil in more movies. The other complaint is what everyone else doesn't like: "The Jazz Singer". AL JOLSON sung Jazz. NEIL DIAMOND sings Pop. Soooooo... couldn't it have been called "The Pop Singer", and had an addition in the credits that read, "Based on 'The Jazz Singer' by Al Jolson" or something?Anyway... the music is great, (even "Love on the Rocks"-- and I'm not a big ballad fan... as they depress me. But I can't dislike a Neil song.) the movie is a great story, and the acting is FINE. Watch it. If you're a fan of Neil's, or even just a fan of 20+ year old movies that have good stories.... check out "The Jazz Singer".--and by the way.... neil diamond rules. thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great score applied to a great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I try to go into a movie uncolored with opinions, and thankfully hadn't heard any negative reviews on this one prior to seeing it for the first time in 1980. That allowed me to view it with an open mind.The score is superb. It's what makes the movie what it is. The songs fit the mood in every scene, and are all well-placed. The acting, while not the best I've ever seen, isn't nearly as bad as made out to be by critics. Let's face it. Neil Diamond is not an actor. He is a singer, a performer. In this movie he does that very well. And yet, he manages to pull off his character, Yussel Rabinovich, without a hitch. His scenes with Sir Lawrence Olivier are touching and believable. They are indeed a good match as father and son cantors. But for Yussel, his heritage isn't enough. His music roots drive him, and that's what he sets out to discover. Against the will of his father, and over the protest of his wife Rivka, he leaves his home in New York for L.A. and seeks his destiny.Lucie Arnaz turns in a good performance as Molly Bell, a "retired" music promoter who sees potential in Yussel and takes him under her wing. What follows is a tug-of-war, a battle of values?old and new?as Neil's character, now Jess Robin, climbs the charts professionally, yet never really forgets where he came from.Watching Neil perform in this movie is like seeing one of his concerts. He's all-show, and not a bit shy. When he picks up a guitar, you know you're in for a treat, and he does music as only he can. It's a great story, well-told and, on the whole, well-acted. Neil gives emotions where called for. But in this movie, the music's the star. That's where Neil really delivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Between his duties and responsibilities, and his dreams and love. For those who want to pick the movie apart, without looking inside the story it tells, skip this comment.Given the choice between one's responsibility to family, parents, religion, tradition, and duty, or choosing love, dreams, goals, and the pursuit of happiness through following our heart, which choice would we make?The movie tells a story of strength through failure, of living versus wasting away in a life spent pleasing others, and of giving our heart and our dreams sway over the path we take in life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neil Diamond - still number one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jazz Singer with Neil Diamond is one of my favorite movies. How can anyone say he can't act? Every time I suggest to my husband that we watch it, he usually doesn't want to because he reckons it is one of the saddest movies of all time. I keep saying "They are only acting and it does work out in the end after all" but I still have trouble getting him to watch it and I usually have to agree to watch 'Going my Way" first!!!! Neil Diamond in concert is fabulous. Neil Diamond acting is nearly as good. I also can't understand why Lucy Arnez didn't make it as an actress, having famous parents must be a disadvantage in some cases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Neil Diamond. I had always heard of this film, but never knew what it was about, what type of reviews it got... anything. So I Netflixed it this weekend, and I loved it. There were even times where I got choked up in parts.So I came on here, saw the negative overall reviews, and was SHOCKED when I learned Neil won the Razzie Award for Worst Actor for this. I thought he did a very fine job. The story unfolded very nicely, the love story was genuine... I would say this film was even better than the "music" genre film Dreamgirls.Sure it had it's glitches here and there, but for the most part I was very pleased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jazz Singer-When Accommodations Were Made ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wonderful version of a cantor's son in conflict over his orthodox Jewish beliefs and his desire to be a singing star.The only major flaw that I had with this film is that by the orthodox Jewish people, there is no accommodation made whatsoever in the field of intermarriage. If it occurs, the person intermarrying is regarded as dead as depicted in the film.Caitlin Adams, who portrayed Jesse's wife Rivka, is true to life since she chose to break with her husband due to her orthodox beliefs. Others might argue that their marriage was headed towards a downward spiral anyway.Laurence Olivier is absolutely mesmerizing as Diamond's father. His authentic Jewish accent and tearing his clothes are memorable.Diamond's voice is superb and is acting is on par for the role. "Love on the Rocks," as well as "Acapulco," and "Coming to America" are wonderfully staged.In the world of today, we need understanding and accommodation and that's exactly what we get in this fine film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like to see remakes, because in many cases you experience two films at once: the film you are watching of course, and the one you recall. Usually that prior one is pretty good. In this case, it IS pretty good, and historically important too.It was the first popular talkie, and not all talkie either. It was pretty amazing in depicting New York Jewry in a way gathered from the reality of the era, and on that score alone is fascinating. It was perhaps overly melodramatic, but suitably severe. And its "message" though simple wasn't quite dumb: that "jazz" music can be sacred work if delivered so. Along the way, we got (still!) entertaining songs. Now this. I do not know what prompted the remake. It seems that they simply had Neil Diamond and saw a fit. He is Jewish. He has a fantastic portfolio of songs, some of which seem written for the project, and he is at least a credible actor. So they tromped through the old script, modernizing as they went. They shifted the focus to the music and the self- discovery of the musician. The rift with the father is recast as upset over sex rather than jazz, something I think is a big mistake.And the script and production values (other than the songs) is horrible, Laurence Olivier embarrasses himself and us all every thing he speaks with some sort of faux stage accent. he is truly dreadful. Everyone is, save one, but he is the worst. The only good actor is on screen only a few times: he is the booker, played by Sully Boyar, and every time he shows up to speak, the sun shines. Doesn't kill the mold though.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Infamous flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreadful piece of tripe was a career low point for all involved. Although I heard she is good on stage, a medium whose best performers often can not transition to pictures, Lucie Arnaz just did not possess the magnetism to be a film star. She's bland and uninteresting but even with that she still gives the best performance in the movie! Neil Diamond is a fine singer but as this movie proved his gifts did not reach to acting competency. The great Laurence Olivier sinks right along with the rest by giving a ham-hock of a performance, perhaps his worst ever. Badly directed and antiquated even when shot originally in the twenties this is a total miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest mistake that Neil Diamond made in doing this film was calling it "The jazz singer",because it is not a remake of the classic Jolson film. That said, let me say that i really enjoyed this film.Diamond does and admirable job as the young would be cantor caught between his love of music and his love for his father, and he doesn't seem to be intmidated by the fact that Laurence Olivier plays his father. The film moves fairly well once Yussel decides to follow his dream and pursue a career in music. It probably isn't the best movie ev er made, but it is certainly worth a look. And the music score is wonderful. "America" (coming to America) became an anthem for immigrants at the time the movie was made.Definitely worth a look</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Jazz, but still a great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie even though there was no jazz, because I thought the story worked. The theme of whether to follow one's dream or stick with wife and family is significant and was treated well. Neil Diamond may not be a great actor, but he made me believe in his role and he made up for his acting limitations with his music, which I found appropriate to the larger context of the film. When his father disowns him because he has left his wife for a gentile woman I found Lawrence Olivier's performance quite dramatic and effective. I also saw genuine character development in Neil Diamond's character and thought the issues he was wrestling with were familiar and helpful to any musician trying to balance career and family.The tension between father and son is real throughout the movie and I liked the way Neil Diamond and Lawrence Olivier portrayed that tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an updated version of the old Al Jolson film by the same name. In this version, a young potential pop star (Neil Diamond) strikes out on his own, turning his back on his father (Sir Lawrence Olivier), his religion (Judaism) and his supposed profession (Cantor) to seek his fame and fortune. The story is OK, a bit lame, but OK still. There is some fantastic music in this film, with (who else?) Neil Diamond singing "Love on the Rocks" and "America". Diamond is not a great actor, for certain, but he actually held his own. The performance by Olivier was also a little bit weak. Lucy Arnaz also stars in the show and I believe her acting was the best of all. There is one scene in the film in the Temple. A Cantor is singing (quite badly) and all of a sudden, Diamond takes over. The abrupt change actually brought goose bumps to my skin! Other than that, the film is merely pretty entertaining. I won't say this is a great film, but I think it's worth a look if the video store doesn't have the one you REALLY went in there for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saccharine fun that achieves what its supposed to!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, this movie has its fair share of saccharine moments and heavy dollops of schmaltz but it also works remarkably well as a tale of following one's dream and the sacrifices that litter the path towards achieving it. Neil Diamond is no Lawrence Olivier and it is a bit surreal to see his name billed above the late great actor but he's credible and he certainly doesn't embarrass himself. Olivier is the acting highlight here and imbues every scene he is in with passion and heartwrenching grace. There are several highly emotional moments to be found here in some well constructed and directed scenes designed to bring out the tears--and they do! Fans of Diamond's music will also find much to enjoy here as such schmaltz classics as "Love On The Rocks" and "Hello Again" compliment the drama remarkably well. Supporting actors Lucie Arnaz and Franklyn Ajaye are also game and put in solid performances. Also, if your looking for jazz look elsewhere as the only jazz reference is the name of a particular baby!! All in all this is old fashioned fun that should reward the viewer. Saccharine yes, but a movie that achieves its goal admirably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's be honest, it could have been much worse!!.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been trying to find words to describe this movie and remain standing on complete neutral ground for a while, and I think I've finally managed to find them. While I'm not this planet's No. 1 Neil Diamond fan, I have to admit his music does reach a level in me that few others do. The man is a gifted songwriter and singer... You read right. Songwriter and singer. So why waste precious time in knocking him for his first acting stint? For a guy who had never done it before, I was actually impressed by his performance. Now, I am a drama student myself and I can see where Diamond could have done better, but I also think that for a guy that had never tried acting before he could have also been a lot worse. And when you have to act beside a guy like Lawrence Olivier, it's hard to look good even when you're a pro.Diamond plays the part of Yussel Rabinowitz, a Jewish son of a temple Cantor who feels compelled to leave his traditionalist home behind and pursue his true calling: Pop Music. On the way he has to try and find a way to get there without losing his father's love and approval, and things only get more complicated when Yussel, a married man, meets Molly Bell, a promoter who has complete faith in his talent and is willing to not just push him all the way but also to be there by his side on his rise to super-stardom.In my opinion, it's painfully clear that Neil tried his very best and managed to come through. So he's no Academy Award winning Actor... But just get into the plot of the film. Put yourself in Jesse Rabinowitz shoes and you won't be able to deny that it's a touching story that many can relate to. You'll find that if you just sit back and watch this film from a non-critical point of view, you'll not only enjoy it, but you might learn a thing or two about life yourself!And when you're done, do yourself a favour: Put on your jacket, get some money out of your purse or wallet and go out to buy the soundtrack. It's 25 years old and still sounds as god today as it did then!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I keep reading all these poor reviews and comments people make about this movie and I just don't understand it!.The Jazz singer is a wonder film.OK, OK, so the acting and cinematography are not Oscar quality, but who cares? Have we become so jaded by modern movie making that we can't enjoy a little road trip, a Sunday drive so to speak? And that's what this movie is. A break in the day to listen to great music, get a couple of laughs, and drool over Neil. You don't have to think, just watch and enjoy.The story is cute. The music is moving. And the one liners are artful. "Would you settle for a pizza?" I was truly moved by Jessie's conflict between his obligation towards the culture he was reared in and his desire to sing the songs he loves and share them with the world. My heart gave a sad flip when his father tore his clothes. And tears really welled up in my eyes when he returns to the beach house. I will admit though that this film has more appeal, in general, to women than to men. I discovered this movie as a young adult and it now one of my "comfort foods" So pop some pop-corn or grab a bottle of wine, sit down, and prepare to enjoy your evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Hef No Son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Jazz Singer" was a bomb dropped on the movie world at Christmas in 1980. It's a needless remake to an original movie that has already been remade and wasn't that great in the first place. Had it not been the first movie with sound I don't think many people would remember it.The storyline has been updated so the cantor's son is now off to the music field, particularly rock. Now I ask you if you could get an actor to star in your big Christmas movie which is a remake of a famous film, would Neil Diamond head the list? Or perhaps every actor with a brain read the script and turned it down. Let's face it folks - Diamond is a terrible actor. Yes he has a great voice and the songs are the only worthy thing in it. You know things are going to go all wrong from the first scene when Diamond dons black face. Was this an ode to the Al Jolson scene from the original or a stupid, misplaced piece of humor? Either way the scene goes terribly wrong and you end up feeling uncomfortable watching it.The great Laurence Olivier reached a career low as the role of Diamond's distressed father. As he did in "Marathon Man" and "Dracula" and "The Boys From Brazil" Olivier over emphasizes a bad accent and spends most of his time yelling. When he cries "I Hef No Son" the result is unintended laughter. It's a bad performance by a great actor. Surprisingly it is Lucie Arnaz (Desi and Lucy's daughter) who gives the one good performance as Diamond's tough but tortured love interest.My suggestion to those Neil Diamond fans is to buy the soundtrack and forget the movie. It's silly and stupid and not worth a minute of your time. It was a bomb for a reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Critics are too hard on this film. Yes, for a remake of a classic, this is nothing terrific. Still, the 1980 remake of the Jazz Singer has as many moments as the original did. The opening montage alone is worth renting this movie. A 2 minute music video / opening shows the real streets of New York City and the people that live there. Opening with the statue of liberty, the camera showcases all the different colors, faces and cultures that New York City is made of. Yes Neil Diamond is not a terrific actor....HE'S A SINGER! The amazing talent of Laurence Olivier helps cancel out the bad acting from Neil Diamond. Still, for a singer, Diamond does a good job in this role. For fans of Neil Diamond, this is worth watching for the music alone. Still, I was hoping, out of respect for the original Jazz Singer, have some of the remake made into a silent film. All in all, a nice little movie with good music, even for 1980.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrible movie. Neil Diamond can't act... Laurence Olivier was just looking to make a quick buck... The plot is just too predictable and trite... But worst of all, the music doesn't work. How can we believe this Yussuf character has any talent at all (let alone reaches stardom) when the songs are all so... BLEAH? Don't get me wrong. I love a lot of Diamond's '70s classics. But the songs in this movie don't even come close. It would have been a far more interesting movie as a true-life biopic of Diamond's own story (with himself in the starring role if we must), and with songs such as 'I am, I Said' and 'Daydream Believer' on the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife loves this film.She thinks an Oedipus Complex is a Greek Shopping Centre.(NB this is satire - I have nothing against wives,greeks or shopping centres).You don't have to be Jewish to hate this movie but I am a little concerned that "The Jazz Singer" is so inextricably bound up in that faith that to give it a bad crit might be considered somehow anti-semitic.In fact you could transpose the plot into a Muslim musical or a Jehovah's Witness musical without too much effort,so I hope I am not going to offend too many faiths by saying that I found it very,very bad. So bad that it was not even so bad it was good,if you follow me. I have no feelings one way or the other (well,not the other,actually) about Neil Diamond who is obviously very popular.Popular singers make movies - who's to blame them?Blame their agents if you like.They don't often make good movies.Some kind person ought to have told Mr Diamond that if you don't learn from the mistakes of history you are doomed to repeat them.They didn't and he did. Laurence Olivier was cast as Mr Diamond's father.Presumably he was unavoidably detained elsewhere and the producers scoured the Old Folks Homes of west L.A. until they found some geezer who looked a bit like him and offered him 3 hots and a cot for the duration.I hope he didn't give up his day job. The other possibility,that Olivier actually turned up,does not bear thinking about. It wouldn't be fair for me to comment on the songs,but a lot of people like them apparently. The original "Jazz Singer" was pretty dire,but at least it was innovatory."Sonny Boy",originally written as a joke for Al Jolson,is ommitted from this remake.Pity,it would have added a bit of class.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good soundtrack, forget the rest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit it, I like Neil Diamond. He's a great songwriter (he's probably written a lot of your favourite songs too, you're just not aware of the fact), a great showman, a fine and distinctive singer and he's unfairly maligned by people who should know better. But this film should never have been made.The soundtrack is great, of course - you get Love On The Rocks, you get Hello Again, you get America (which is stirring and emotional even for a dyed-in-the-wool Brit who's never even been to the States), you get Hello Again...it's like a greatest hits package. But Neil's acting leaves a lot to be desired. Olivier, clearly going through his "any old crap as long as the money's right" phase, is hilarious for all the wrong reasons as his father. The black-face scenes are just plain wrong - it's funny when Bill Oddie does black-face in The Goodies because his character's a child at heart and it's a surreal show anyway, but the idea of a Jewish rock wannabe blacking up to swindle a club crowd - only to have the ruse tumbled by a genuine black man shouting "that ain't no brother!" or some-such nonsense - should have been spiked at the screenplay's first draft stage. This is Neil Diamond's GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROAD STREET, a vanity project that's an ordeal for non-believers and not much fun for fans either. Buy the CD, yes. Forget the film even exists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and not much of a movie either. Pointless remake of the 1927 "talkie"--the plot was old then; the plot was still old in the 1950s Danny Thomas remake; it was laughable in 1980. If Neil Diamond really wanted to do a movie, why not do a concert film?Diamond plays a Jewish man who wants to sing rock music--his father (Laurence Olivier!!!!! Why Larry?) wants him to perform only traditional Jewish songs. Also he falls in love with a non-Jewish woman (Lucie Arnaz giving the only good performance) which he knows his dad would never approve. Yawn--what a lousy script. The acting is beyond belief--Diamond is a great singer but he's no actor--he was very bad; Olivier is a howl as his father--he hams it up mercilessly and just gives an unbelievable (I don't mean that in a good way) jaw-dropping performance. Olivier was one of the most respected actors around--why did he do this? Didn't he read the script? It's obvious he's hating every moment--I guess he was really hard up for the money. Arnaz is actually very good despite everything--she also has the film's second best line (after Olivier's "no son" line). She tells Diamond seriously, "You're too talented to waste everything on singing". Sheesh! What saves this movie from total disaster is the singing--Diamond was (and is) a good singer and some of the songs are great. When he's singing the movie is OK--when he's not it's a laugh a minute. ALMOST bad/good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know how some people read "Playboy" for the articles? This is one movie you'll only want to watch for the music. Especially if you're a Neil Diamond fan."The Jazz Singer" is supposed to be an update of the Al Jolson chestnut (replete with Diamond appearing in black-face at one point!!) but the only connection between these two films is that a cantor's son wants to break into show business. Other than that, they're about as similar as Chardonnay and Kool-Aid.Diamond is a singer. Period. He can't act, he can't even look at people when he talks to them and he certainly doesn't have the charisma to carry a film. Olivier was a good actor... a looooong time ago. Here, he's just well-aged ham with an accent.Like I said, the best part of this movie is the soundtrack. Heck, I have the CD and I love it. What Diamond fan doesn't know and/or love "America", "Hello Again", "Love on the Rocks" and even "On the Robert E. Lee"? I even liked where Diamond auditions for a spot as a country bar singer and breaks into "You are My Sunshine". It's not on CD, though. Bummer.To sum up - all the dramatic highlights are really low-lights; the so-called actors involved with this should all turn in their SAG cards; and it's small wonder Fleischer has been regulated to directing films like "Honey, I Blew Up the Kid" and "Amityville 3: The Demon" after this disaster.But at least it's a disaster you can dance to.Three stars. For the music. Ignore all the rest of that "Jazz".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Jewish cantor follows his dreams against his families wishes.Starring Neil Diamond and Laurence Olivier.Written by Samson Raphaelson (Play), Herbert Baker (Screenplay) and Stephen H Foreman (Adaptation).Directed by Richard Fleischer. I can't belief how lowly rated this is on IMDb,I love this film!Okay so it's as cheesy as a packet of Wotsits and there are a few movie clichés here and there but I enjoyed every second of this. I love the story. I love the acting. I loved all the cheesy romantic stuff.There's nothing not to like about The Jazz Singer. It's just good solid escapism. I'm also guessing that it was quite controversial in it's day.Did I tell you that I love this film? Now I need to go on Spotify to listen to more Neil Diamond!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It takes more than great music to make a great musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the classic film "The Jazz Singer" from 1927 (or for that matter the fifties remake) so cannot say how this version compares to it. It tells the story of Yussel Rabinovitch, a Cantor at a New York Orthodox Jewish synagogue, who finds success as a singer, but only at the cost of estrangement from his traditionalist father (also a Cantor) and his equally traditionalist wife. It keeps the same title as the original, but in this version Yussel is a pop star, not a jazz singer. Yussel uses the stage name "Jess Robin", but to avoid confusion I will refer to him by his original name throughout. I must admit that I did not really have any high hopes for the film when I recently saw it for the first time. I was aware that it had been a critical flop when first released in 1980 and that Neil Diamond (as Yussel) and Laurence Olivier (as his father) were the first two winners of the "Worst Actor" and "Worst Supporting Actor" Razzies. I had even heard it described as a classic of badness. So is it as bad as its reputation in some quarters might have you believe? Well, insofar as the acting is concerned, it is not very good. You can see why Neil Diamond has concentrated on his singing career rather than on acting. He tries hard, but it is clear he is no Laurence Olivier. (To be fair, however, I should point out that my view was not shared by everyone. Diamond was actually nominated for a "Best Actor - Musical/Comedy" at the Golden Globes). As for Laurence Olivier, well, in this film he is no Laurence Olivier either. Towards the end of his life, in the seventies and eighties, Olivier occasionally ended up in films that were not worthy of his status and talents, although I have noticed that even in earlier in his career he was not always at his best playing characters who were not British, or at least Anglo-Saxon. In films like "The Prince and the Showgirl" or "Khartoum" he tended to fall back on stereotype, even caricature, to portray foreigners, and does the same here, making the elder Cantor Rabinovitch a neurotic Yiddisher Poppa with an exaggerated stage accent. (Cantor Rabinovitch's country of origin is never specified, but he is obviously an immigrant to America from somewhere in Europe). The female members of the cast are no better; Catlin Adams as Yussel's selfish, controlling wife Rivka is a one-dimensional figure and Lucie Arnaz, the daughter of two famous parents, is just bland as Molly, the girl with whom Yussel falls in love after his divorce from Rivka. In some respects there is plenty of material for a good film here. At the heart of the story is the clash between the classic "Old World" values of Yussel's father, faith, family, community and tradition, and the "New World" values of Yussel himself, freedom and self-fulfilment. Unfortunately the dramatic potential of this clash is negated by the fact that the representatives of the "Old World" values, old Cantor Rabinovitch and Rivka, are so unsympathetic. Rivka is totally unable to appreciate or sympathise with her husband's talent or ambitions; the old man is seen at his worst, and comes uncomfortably close to bigotry, in the scene where he ritually tears his clothes to indicate that his son is "dead to him". (What has really upset him is Yussel's love for the Gentile Molly). Director Richard Fleischer could turn his hand to virtually any genre, and had earlier been responsible for some good films ("20,000 Leagues under the Sea", "The Vikings"), and at least one excellent one ("Ten Rillington Place"). His creative powers, however, seemed to go into a decline towards the end of his career in the eighties. (A similar phenomenon afflicted some of his contemporaries; Stanley Donen and J. Lee Thompson are two others who come to mind. "The Jazz Singer" is by no means his worst film- that must be the dreadful "Red Sonja"- but it is a long way below the standard of his best work. It would, however, be unfair to blame him too much; he was only drafted in to direct at the last minute after the original director, Sidney J. Furie, was sacked from the production. The music featured here was a success, and the soundtrack album became one of Diamond's biggest-sellers. It actually made more money than the film itself and provided him with three hit songs, "America", "Love on the Rocks" and "Hello Again". Anyone who likes Diamond's music, as I do, will enjoy this aspect of the film. Good music, however, is not generally enough to make a good film. A successful musical needs to be more than a succession of great songs; it also needs good acting, a good story and good direction as much as any other successful film, and in all these aspects "The Jazz Singer" does not have much to offer. 5/10 (4/10 for the film itself, with a bonus point for the music).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neil Diamond in the Rough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orthodox Jewish singer Neil Diamond (as Yussel Rabinovitch aka Jess Robin) moonlights as a "Soul" singer. After synagogue, he performs in "Blackface" make-up and wears an "Afro" wig. These wigs were plentiful on New York City street corners when this film was being made. Possibly, they still are. During the opening performance, some men in the audience notice Mr. Diamond's hands are "White" and beat him up. Oddly enough, Diamond is thrown in jail. He is bailed out by his father, Rabbi-rousing Laurence Olivier (as Cantor Rabinovitch). Their conflict is now in the open. Diamond wants to sing pop music, but Mr. Olivier thinks it's sinful...Diamond decides to pursue his singer/songwriter dreams in Los Angeles. He meets perky music agent Lucie Arnaz (as Molly Bell). She is impressed with Diamond's musical skills and agrees to manage him...This update of 1920s classic "The Jazz Singer" has a timeless conflict, but director Richard Fleischer and the producers have no luck in managing the movie. Diamond is never convincing as a young man leaving home to become a jazz singer. He's an accomplished adult pop star and always seems out of place in this story. Given a career due to her famous parents, Ms. Arnaz was largely dismissed during the 1970s; herein, she steals the show with a lovely, appealing and surprisingly natural performance. Unfortunately, there wasn't much of a show to steal and Arnaz' contribution went unnoticed. Still, she can always say she outperformed Olivier.**** The Jazz Singer (12/17/80) Richard Fleischer ~ Neil Diamond, Laurence Olivier, Lucie Arnaz, Catlin Adams</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neil Diamond in black face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charter cable's on-demand service usually provides films airing on FLIX and those titles are separated by decade. Last night I selected the menu for the 80s, and I came across the Neil Diamond version of THE JAZZ SINGER, from 1980. Since Dr. Goldman had recently screened the 1927 and 1952 versions on TCM as part of the Projected Image Series without even mentioning this later, more modern one-- I decided to watch it. I had never seen it before.Early in the picture, after Diamond's character starts to go off on his own and sing pop music, he is traveling with his band to a club. On the way there, he finds out it's a black club (which is what he says in the movie). All the guys in his band are black, except for him. When they get to the club and go backstage to get ready, someone has the idea of putting him in black face so he will blend in with the rest of them. We cut to them performing on stage and Diamond is indeed in black face for that number. The camera pans to the crowd and all the patrons are black and they are digging the music. At some point, a guy in the audience realizes Diamond is Jewish, not black, and he is exposed for being 'different.'Personally, I did not find this scene to be offensive-- and I thought it was a rather clever way for the writers to come up with keeping that portion of the Jolson version in the story. I can't remember if Danny Thomas appeared in black face in the second film, but I don't think he did. Neil Diamond's THE JAZZ SINGER was not a huge commercial hit, but it made $27 million at the time of its release ($78 million dollars today using an inflation calculator) and it earned another $4 million with domestic television broadcasts. Obviously a lot of people at the time saw Diamond in black face, and it wasn't enough for the project to fail. The soundtrack went multi-platinum, too. So in a way, this version did have a significant cultural impact, long after the days of Martin Luther King and the civil rights era-- but of course, before our current stranglehold of political correctness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I separate the very good songs from this God-awful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like was mentioned in another commentary, Diamond should have made a concert film and I add or a documentary on his life laced with these new songs. Or narrate a documentary of Jewish musicians in America. But why am I frittering my time crying over spilt milk what could've been done instead? Somebody put this crap together, Diamond's in it and to sum it up minus the music &amp; (too little of) Lucy Arnaz (sp), Jazz Singer 1980 cringe-worthy.I was incensed with the black face thing above everything else--Remake or modernization that should not have been in the film; maybe it tinged my feeling for the rest of this cinematic drivel. But wait, black face scene out it's still a nauseating flick without songs and Lucy's daughter. It's not the least bit funny or charming. The makers of this should've taken a peek at the the Beatles films--They were both funny and cute and the Fab 4 could act. Sting (Dune 1984) and David Bowie are good average actors, Manilow was somewhat tolerable in his film 5 yrs later but the story was nice. Jazz Singer 1980 is boring and Diamond is so gut turning bad even Larry O, laughable in his role, couldn't make me forget how this remake sucked. Somebody ever coming across this review get a hold of what Roger Ebert said about this when it firs came out. It sums up everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartwarming story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a cast that includes Neil Diamond, Laurence Olivier, Lucie Arnaz, Catlin Adams, and Franklyn Ajaye, "The Jazz Singer" is quite an enjoyable movie, in my opinion. The story is about a young Jewish cantor named Jess Robin (Diamond), who tries to live up to his Robinovitch family tradition of singing in the synagogue, but he ultimately dreams of becoming a rock star. This understandably causes friction not only with his staunch father (Olivier), who has been cantor of the synagogue for the past twenty-five years, but also with Jess' caring wife Rivka (Adams), who teaches at the synagogue. But Jess is a risk-taker who knows the importance of "paying his dues," which he certainly does over the course of this film.My favorite highlights from "The Jazz Singer" include the following. Jess disguises himself with an afro when he and three of his African-American friends perform at an African-American nightclub, but before too long, one of the patrons sees through Jess' disguise. Just before Jess flies to Los Angeles, he, Rivka, and the entire Jewish community celebrate Jess' father's twenty-fifth anniversary as cantor with a lively dance. At the L.A. recording studio, Jess sings his classic ballad "Love on the Rocks" for the young, arrogant rock star Keith Lennox (Paul Nicholas), but he doesn't buy it. After Jess and his four backup singers get fired from the studio, they have a party at a beach house belonging to Jess' new agent Molly (Arnaz), where Jess and company do a lively version of "On the Robert E. Lee." At Jess' debut opening for comedian Zany Gray, he performs a nice rendition of "Summerlove." After Jess puts his entire life and superstardom behind him, he joins up with a country band and, for a nice comic twist, performs "You Are My Sunshine." And finally, near the end of the film after Jess and his father have not spoken for a year, they reunite at the synagogue and, in a private moment outside a hallway, hug each other with tears in their eyes.Film critic Leonard Maltin referred to "The Jazz Singer" as a bomb, claiming that Jess Robin "becomes a rock star in about as much time as it takes to get a haircut." I don't quite agree with this assessment, but I do surmise that the filming of this movie was not a most pleasant experience. I believe Laurence Olivier in particular was quoted as saying some rather derogatory remarks about the film during production. Nevertheless, "The Jazz Singer" boasts a wonderful story, and if nothing else, it widely showcases the musical gifts of Neil Diamond.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a Neil Diamond fan forever. When his movie first came out, I had to see it right away, and right then and there, seeing him on the big screen...I was hooked. He did a good job, and Lucie Arnaz was a very good match for him. I just recently bought the CD of the "Jazz Singer", and play it constantly. My 10 year old daughter is now starting to know the words by heart. He has brought so much joy to music. There really isn't anyone quite like him. I have seen him in concert three times, and look forward to seeing him again.This is a movie to be enjoyed over and over, and doesn't seem at all that it will go out of style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Please Don't Take My Sunshine Away"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Speaking of self-evident comedy: Neil Diamond as a Jewish cantor's son whose father, played by Olivier, objects to his dreams of pop-rock stardom (there's regrettably no jazz to be found). The chief pleasure, if you can call it that, is in observing the clash of acting styles between neophyte Diamond, who can't project emotion, and Olivier, whose mailed-in performance uses bathos as its emotion of choice. Fortunately, Fleischer is a no-nonsense director, so he backs up this risible melodrama with convincingly grubby Brooklyn locations and an interesting glimpse into religion-based lives. If nothing else, the scenes detailing synagogue rituals and bar mitzvah celebrations are a window into an alien world (to me), and Diamond's songs are fairly good. Favorite moment: the dejected, bearded Diamond walking away from the studio and ending up in a honky-tonk bar in Laredo, singing a country-western arrangement of "Please Don't Take My Sunshine Away" for the appreciative owner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the music written for this was the best he ever wrote The song Love on the Rocks was perfect for the movie and America was an outstanding ending to the movie. Lucy Arnez and Neil Diamond make a perfect pair. The music went along with the theme. I think this was better then the earlier version but still stayed with the theme from that version. The song Hello, I think is great when they got back together. The costume, I will say was a little flashy but OK. He showed that his faith would not interfere with his love of music and his career. Over all I think it was a great movie. Everyone should see it. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

I personally am not a movie critic, but I see nothing wrong with it. Have you seen other 20+ year old movies? They all have that kind of hokie-ness to them if you ask me. My basic reaction or question or comment is: If this movie gets the kind of bad ratings that I am seeing, why is the DVD almost 100.00? I looked on e-bay and it is going fo 70.00$ and over 20 people have bid on it. Now, one of the descriptions is RARE dvd. If it is so bad isn't that a good thing? If no one should see it and it is sooooo horrible why do people think that someone is going to pay that much to buy it? Obviously it isn't that bad!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one question you'll ask yourself after watching this movie is, "why don't I see more of Neil on the big screen?" Well, you might also ask yourself why Lawrence Olivier, a man who looks about as much like Neil Diamond as he does a baseball diamond, would be playing his father, but more importantly, you would want to see more Neil.Although the script meanders occasionally, Diamond holds your interest with his charisma, unabashed sincerity, and, of course, excellent music. Here's to seeing more of him in the movies (you can't tell, but I've just made some sort of dramatic toasting gesture); Neil, if you ever read this, your fans want more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is like Rocky except that it is focussed on the music world. And let's face it, breaking into any entertainment form, whether it is sports or movies or music, is tough. The Jazz Singer does a pretty good job of showing that. While Neil Diamond may not ne a great actor, he is respectable. He shows that he has good range from joy to anger and sadness. I particularly enjoyed the scene at the end with his dad. When he tells him that he is a grandfather and his dad succumbs and then shows a little compassion, it was a great scene.Although I am not a huge Diamond fan, musically that is, I have to admit that the soundtrack to this film is enjoyable. And even though I am not American, I felt a sense of pride when he sings Coming To America in this film. It jump starts your sense of being and it makes you want to succeed at whatever long lost ambition you once had. I guess this song is similar to Born In The USA. They are different themes but they ultimately say the same thing. Pride.The Jazz Singer is a pretty good film and even though I don't think it is anywhere on video, if it ever comes on TV one night, take a look at it. It is a good musical and not a bad film. And in a way, it is on the same level as Karate Kid and Rocky. It's about not giving up on your dream, it's about hope and it's about pride. Those elements alone make it worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although one cannot escape their past, one can always dream, what if? And like an itch if you don't scratch it it just keeps growing and growing till you have to. I don't know how historically "The Jazz Singer" is but every time I watch it I believe that there was that itch that Mr. Diamond had to scratch, regardless of whatever the future brought. My brother was hired as a junior at University of Kentucky to play 1st chair in the production "Hair" in 1969. A 5 1/2 octive range and four wifes later he always played 1st chair trumpet in Vegas for 25 plus years. He burned out some and became a broker in real estate there but the itch came back. Now he moved to South Carolina on climate and is working hard playing again. His first wife said it was his horn or her, well we know who won, just like the itch. Mr. Diamond has the ability to bring up my soul and in the movie juggle the singer verses his religious role. To quit premed 6 month before graduation says that "I will do it or bust". The movie is a great role model for todays youth. Like the movie had in it a line "One musician can always find another". I know with my brother it is true, from coast to coast. His instructors at UK became his students. I one time saw him talking to Charlie Dianels and said are you going to see him? He said no, why should he, he worked for me. My mother always called him poor little rich boy. Riches are in the heart and are not always confined to money. Mr. Diamond is indeed rich beyond words in my humble opinion. students over time. Good show Mr. Diamond!</fullReview>

Besides, in view of star Neil Diamond's pop repertoire, the title doesn't make any sense - and, while the new songs in themselves aren't too bad, there's no comparable number to the original's show-stopping and heart-rending "Mammy" (actually, the protagonist's mother here doesn't come into the picture at all!). The rest is glossy but also unintentionally funny: there's Diamond singing in blackface, a punk rendition of a typical Diamond ballad, Laurence Olivier's embarrassing performance (especially the scene where he disowns his son), Diamond's period in the 'wilderness', etc. Not surprisingly, the film - and Olivier - emerged a winner at that year's Razzie Awards: could it be that the great English thespian accepted such an obviously demeaning role solely for the purpose of adding this unenviable tribute to his long list of accolades?</fullReview>

The movie is very slow and you can imaging the end after first half and hour. Lawrence Oliver is very good as always but his role is so exaggerated and that he can not do any more with it. A remake made for the glory of Neil Diamond and another waste of time and resources for the American industry. Sometimes very funny when its trying to be dramatic and stupid when is trying to be funny. I recommend if you see it and like it, drink a bottle of wine and watch it another time.</fullReview>

The scenes where Jesse is roaming around the country after leaving Molly are well done. He gradually grows a beard and in the end he looks really good! His 'You Are My Sunshine' number in the last club he plays in is a real rocker! I do not know why this film was trashed because it is a clean (one 's' word) family movie.

Diamond has great talent and he throws himself into the "Jolson" type role. The movie starts with a man who gets married and feels uncomfortable with his Life.He hits the road to California to record songs. Neil Diamond is Asa,and like every artist who finds rejection,you keep playing until someone listens to you. The conflict in the movie is with Olivier, who is the religiously strict Cantor.Though Asa follows his heart to be a musician,he forgets the family and even changes his name.Through the struggles of being a musician,and "finding himself",Diamond meets up with Lucie Arnaz,the talented daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.She is great as the new love in Asa's life. The songs are great in this film and my favorite is America ,which tells the main theme of finding your place in our Country.I enjoy this film and like it because it deals with Family Strength,Reconciliation and Individuality.

This journey of despair has Lawrence Olivier hamming it up as a Jewish cantor, (what was he thinking of?) and meister-crooner Neil Diamond, (was he thinking at all?), as father and son at loggerheads because Diamond's character wants to pursue a career in - horror of horrors - Manilow-esque easy listening music!Well, what happens next is a schmaltz-fest of cringesome clichés - note how "What happened to the groove?" elicits nothing but sniggers and derision when watched with friends - bad acting, bad accents, a weird bit with our Neil in the wilderness trying to discover himself...but hey, it all comes right for him in the end, and he and his father are conveniently reconciled during one of Neil's concerts. Larry may now like his son's music, but he sure seems to be having some problems clapping in time to it.The only thing this movie has going for it is Diamond's music - I'm not a fan, but the man certainly has a talent for singing, if not acting. This still fails to redeem this unwatchable dross however, so you're better off buying the soundtrack album. Maybe you'll buy it on the web to save yourself the embarrassment of asking for it in-store. Enough already!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch For Arnez, The Music &amp; Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the rare movie to watch for the music alone (although Lucie Arnez as Molly Bell was good). The ending with Neil Diamond singing "America" with Arnez and Laurence Olivier in the audience is the best scene in the film. There is a lot of discussion Neil Diamond's portrayal of Jess Robin / Yussel Rabinovitch and Lawrence Olivier as Cantor Rabinovitch (most of not too good (such as Diamond "Winning" a Razzie)). No one in their right mind would identify the Olivier of "The Jazz Singer" with his performances in "Hamlet", "Rebecca", "Wuthering Heights, or "Richard III." But I have seen worse performances....... A LOT worse. What disturbs me is the reviews of this film, who give it zero or one star, while praising the music. What makes a film warrant zero or one star is a film that has nothing redeeming about it (the last film, I reviewed "Damsels In Distress" is an example of that). I am a notorious hater of musicals (this film is probably in my top three musicals ever, and it still only gets five/ten stars from me, that is how much I dislike them). The formula is simple: 1 Star for Arnez, 1 star for the Music and 3 for the incredible ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strange that I would recommend a "remake"albeit,updated significantly but I guess its because I never saw the legendary 1927 original film that's famous as the screens first"talky"and infamous for its star Al Jolson singing in"black face". This version has the lead,Neil Diamond,in black face early in one scene and given the context,I'm sure you'll agree its not condescending or insulting at all.In fact,its vital to the story on a level showing how he writes music for a all black group he grew up knowing as kids,who in turn,get him his first break as a singer to perform what he has written.So much for historical political correctness.The movie has a wrap around song called" Coming to America"that is still for me,to this very day,a immigration anthem for all to this country of immigrants.Mr Diamond musical strength has always been performing and in this movie that talent carries through when ever he sings,even Hebrew songs of faith.What is not fair is to rate his acting against his co-star the legendary Laurence Olivier.In fact,I actually thought the understated performance of Catlin Adams as Rivka Rabinovitch ,Diamonds characters wife,is almost Shakespearian tragic.The rest of the cast is good enough for a film that is really a story between father and son that all of us men have suffered through in one way or another. Now to the story,update or not.Besides the conflict between father and son,it does show the urban link of the times,blacks and Jew's friends because the wasps of the time would have nether.Perhaps poorly shown,but at least attempted,the music group gets a break in a all black uptown nightclub.Finally they succeed but ONLY as Diamonds backups,not on theirown.Diamond shortens his name as a songwriter from Rabinovitch to Robin.Too often these things happened and for someone who grew up back in the 60's it rings sadly true.My only complaint with the story is how it glosses over the eventual split between Diamond and his wife,or should I say,what happened to her after wards.Diamond fares well enough because there is another waiting to take fair Rivka's place and thats sad.Lucie Arnaz fills that roll but is no Rivka. Still its a strong story and a worthy film experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy remake of a cinema icon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1980 movie became a hit for Neil Diamond, largely due to his rendition of the songs "Love on the Rocks" and "America." As for Laurence Olivier's performance as a Jewish cantor in the 1980 movie, watch the movie and decide for yourself what you think of his performance. The 1980 movie also features Neil Diamond performing in black face, just like Jolson did fifty-three years earlier. Question: Have things really changed? Although the movie is rife with cheesy acting and dialog that makes one wonder if the script was perhaps improvised, nevertheless in its own inimitable way it succeeds in telling a story about America, which is something. Now if the movie only had a decent screenplay to go along with movie's underlying theme, then maybe the movie could be taken more seriously. But such improvement will have to wait till the next remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It isn't as bad as some might suggest....though it still sucks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently, the Razzie people thought this movie was so bad that it belonged in their top 100 list of worst movies. They were especially critical of Neil Diamond's performance. However, after seeing the film, I think this is a bit too harsh. Now I am not saying the movie was good. It does, clearly, suck. However, it isn't bad enough to merit all the hype about the film and it's abysmal awfulness. I see it as the Ivory Soap of films...it's only 99.44% bad! First, let's talk about Neil Diamond. He has a very pleasant voice and while I've never particularly liked his style of music, most of the songs are bouncy and enjoyable. Most. A few, such as the party song and seeing and hearing Neil dressed as a cowboy and singing "You Are My Sunshine" are truly craptastic. As for his acting, it isn't bad for a non-professional actor--which is exactly what he was. This is perhaps why they really didn't give him all that much acting to do--having him sing again and again and again to cover up this deficiency. His acting was not good, sure, but also not that bad. I say give the guy a break...except for that scene with the cowboy hat! Second, while Neil Diamond can't be faulted too much, I certainly can fault Sir Laurence Olivier! At times, he's not bad. But, at other times it's like he's on something....some drug that makes him either THINK he's playing the same guy he played in THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL or that prevents him from recognizing that he was awful. While this might offend a lot of Olivier fans, however, it must be said that late in his career he appeared in anything...provided the check cleared. And his acting, to put it bluntly, was terrible and hammy (an apropos word for this film).However, despite these two major deficits, the biggest problem actually isn't with any of the actors. The writing, to put it nicely, is poo. Yes, folks...poo. The film is laced with clichés and dialog that couldn't help but make the actors look like dopes. My theory is that the producer's cat wrote the screenplay...a very, very dumb cat at that.But, although I've said a lot of harsh things about this film, I must add that the songs were not bad and made the film passable...at times. Painful but not abysmally bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Olivier and Neil Diamond fans only...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Worth seeing for Laurence Olivier, who in my opinion had a very limited acting range (he tended to play a lot of parts similar to this) but was really a genius within his relatively narrow range -- this is just about the ideal role for him, inspired casting here. Fans of Neil Diamond's music will enjoy this movie as well -- everyone else might as well skip it completely. Silly, cliched story and some very poor acting by most of the cast... there are worse things to do on a slow, rainy Sunday than watch something like this, though. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neil Diamond: A Man After His Own Shoes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For afficiandos of bad rocker-as-actor films (I know, it's a redundancy) "The Jazz Singer" should not be missed. While certainly not nearly as leaden a screen presence as the King of Bad Rocker-as-Actors, Elvis (nobody is as bad as him) Neil does add his own peculiarities to the genre.Chief among them is his inability to look anyone -- not his father, not his wife, not his girlfriend, not his bandmembers -- in the eye when he's talking with them. For most of the film he is looking down at his shoes. This is probably a real-life affliction of Neil's, but in a movie it makes him look incredibly embarassed -- or stoned out of his mind. Second is his speaking voice, which is a clenched-tooth grumble evocative of 1988 presidential hopeful (and failure) Michael Dukakis. In fact, ol' Neil looks quite a bit like the Duke, just with bigger hair. Then there is Neil's complete indifference to everyone around him, particularly women. Even Elvis emoted a little excitement at the touch of one of his starlets. Here we have a couple of women (admittedly, not great looking but attractive neough) throwing themselves at him -- and his only reaction is to shrug his shoulders and say "I'd rather have a pizza." Finally, we have a wonderful wardrobe consisting of glittery button-down shirts and black polyester pants that do justice to the one part of Himself that can truly act -- his big, hairy, quivering ass.As lackluster as Neil is, he at least acquits himself better than Larry Olivier, who is truly pathetic as he practically goes into convulsions over every little outrage sonny boy commits to the faith. Clearly, this was one of those movies -- along with "Inchon", "The Betsy" and a million others in the 70's and 80's -- Larry was getting a big paycheck for to provide for his extensive family upon his death. A noble gesture, to be sure -- but he definitely paid a price for it!The film, as ridiculous and half-assed as it is, does have a few -- very few -- good points. Lucy Arnaz, who was the only person connected with this thing to receive any accolades, shows herself to be an ingratiating comic actress. Problem is, she dropped off the face of the earth after this film. While I'm definitely not a fan of Neil's music, most of the production numbers (except for that assanine party at Lucy's place involving the banjos) are acceptable pop-spiritual fare. And even the ode to Al Jolson's minstrel routine comes off fairly well -- if not exactly correctly -- as an affectionate spoof that the filmmakers were at pains to acknowledge and get out of the way early on.All in all, a film that is not nearly as bad as "Glitter" "The Bodyguard" "Cool As Ice", "Ned Kelly" and other rock-star-on-the-big-screen flicks, but something that is a must for fans of Idiot Cinema. Now, if Mark Wahlberg does a version of this, I wonder where the yarmulke would belong!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Neil Diamond's tour-de-force. Need I elaborate?OK, fine -- cantor Laurence Olivier wants son Neil Diamond to follow in his traditional Jewish footsteps, but Diamond's just GOT to ROCK, man! The scene of Neil noodling on the piano to compose "Love On The Rocks" is laugh-out-loud bad. And who doesn't get into a giggle-fit at the sight and sound of "Coming To America" and Neil shouting "My country tis of thee ..." etc.Still, I don't advise watching this. Love interest Lucie Arnaz is completely off the charts on the annoying-meter. Then again, you DOget to watch that weird Western part of the movie where Neil grows a beard and discovers himself on the long, tough road back to superstardom. Uggh!I blame this movie for ruining Franklin Ajaye's career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie disappointing but does have great music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see the 1927 cinematic version so have no means of comparison. However, I was very disappointed in this movie about a young man named Yussel, who defies his father, a Jewish cantor, and goes off to California to pursue his dreams of becoming a pop singer. I had expected better, given the combination of Lawrence Olivier's acting prowess and Neil Diamond's music, as I am quite a fan of both.This is definitely not Olivier's best role or his best performance either as the disapproving, disowning father, though he is a magnificent actor so viewer's expectations are high. True, Neil Diamond isn't a great actor himself by any means, though I found he comes across better than some reviewers seem to indicate. As for Lucie Arnaz, who plays the woman sharing his musical dreams, it's been awhile since I saw the movie and I cannot recall anything whatsoever about her role. I'm sure she was suitably charming and talented but for me, this story is all about the father / son relationship, the importance in the father's eyes of the son's faithfulness to Jewish traditions and using his musical talents within the synagogue.The only aspect of this film that failed to disappoint was of course, the music. Neil Diamond is a great musician here as always, with songs such as Hello Again and Love on the Rocks. As for the America finale, it was without question, the best part of the picture...impressive, stirring, and emotional. As others have also noted, it's a film only for dyed in the wool fans of Neil Diamond and Lawrence Olivier. While I am definitely both, other than its rousing finale, The Jazz Singer certainly failed to live up to my expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What.......no Mammy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the fine old plot of The Jazz Singer was dusted off for the fifth and last time of the last century, it might do well to remember that it wasn't really that great a play to begin with. It was a mediocre piece of writing that Georgie Jessel starred on Broadway with and was made into a film to exhibit that new invention of sound with the singing talents of Al Jolson.Jolson was America's greatest entertainer and he got to reprise some of the great standards that he made famous, most particularly that climax of getting down on one knee and singing to his Mammy in the audience. That's what the first film version of The Jazz Singer is famous for, nothing else.Poor Neil Diamond also got a great showcase for some wonderful songs he introduced and little else. I did enjoy Love on the Rocks, Coming to America and Hello Again, great songs by a great singer. But in making his screen debut he was overshadowed by the 20th century's greatest English speaking actor who played his cantor father.Sir Laurence Olivier dusted off that patented middle-Europa accent that had served well on so many occasions. At that point in his career Olivier was doing many things strictly for the paycheck to build a nice estate to leave his kids. That trend started with The Betsy for him. Certainly he had nothing left to prove as an actor.Someone else mentioned that Olivier would look ridiculous trying Neil Diamond's art. Actually he did on screen and maybe one day The Beggar's Opera will be available on DVD and VHS or shown on TV so we can all judge.I count five versions of The Jazz Singer. Jessel on stage, the Jolson and Diamond versions and another in between with Eduard Franz as the cantor and Danny Thomas as his son. And a fifth done for television by Jerry Lewis which is supposed to make this one look good.For Fans of Neil Diamond only and don't expect him singing to Mammy in the climax. The plot has Olivier as a widower.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film of contradictions. Neil Diamond, award-winning singer and composer, appears in his only acting role in this remake of the Al Jolson classic. An actor he isn't, but the music is superb - two of his best songs, 'Love on the Rocks' and 'Hello Again', and more.Also in the cast are Lucie Arnaz (daughter of Desi and Lucille Ball) who doesn't do much, but she's decorative and reasonably ok; and Laurence Olivier. Now, this is one of Olivier's worst performances - in the role of Diamond's cantor father he is awful! And look out for Paul Nicholas as an obnoxious rock star.This film could almost be likened to pulling teeth if you really have to sit through it. I wouldn't particularly recommend it above once (if you must) but the soundtrack in its own right is well worth a listen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neil Diamond is best at singing, not acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1980 movie version of The Jazz Singer is an entertaining movie, but the (acting) standout lead role is not Neil Diamond, although he sings some great songs in this movie, but the good acting comes from Laurence Olivier in this movie.Neil Diamond's acting, in this movie, was better than some acting by other singers who tried acting themselves, like: Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Joan Jett, etc...I liked this movie because the story (which is about a man, who tries to get into the singing business, gets famous, breaks a few laws as far as being Jewish is concerned, breaks down due to problems with his dad, and the ending is something you'll have to figure out cuz I can't tell you...according to IMDB.COM rules of commenting :)) has heart, warmth and great music. So go to your video store &amp; rent The Jazz Singer! One last comment...The only part I don't get is why they even called the movie, The Jazz Singer, he doesn't even sing jazz in this movie, as compared to Al Jolsen in the original version of The Jazz Singer, but I give Diamond &amp; the cast &amp; crew thumbs up for a decent job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Balladeering "rock" singer Neil Diamond's puerile brand of romantic pop certainly has its followers, yet his soggy uplift is an uncomfortable match in this modern-day story of a Jewish cantor's son chucking the synagogue for a chance at mass stardom. The film is a big bogus cliché embalmed in Hollywood-ized Saran-Wrap, and Diamond's acting debut consists of a series of glowering poses. Remake of the 1927 and 1953 films does try to be clever (such as an early scene with Diamond singing in an all-black nightclub), but the minute the love story with Lucie Arnaz is interjected, any energy the movie has worked up goes right out the window (it's just a plot-device, though Arnaz keeps her dignity). Laurence Olivier overacts as Diamond's father, mincing and spitting out his lines in what results as a Jewish parody, and the finale is a laughably cheap artifice. If you really must hear "America" or "Love On The Rocks", you'd be better off with the CD. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neil Diamond in black face and an afro wig.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am admirer of Neil Diamond's music (schmaltz pop and all) so I finally saw the movie "Jazz Singer". My expectations was that the movie was based on Neil Diamond's life, instead we have a pop music version of "Fiddler on the Roof". Should Neil Diamond character follow "tradition" as a cantor or go into a career as a pop musician. The funniest scene, i.m.h.o., is when the movies Neil Diamond's band playing at all African American club. Diamond's character pretends to be black by wearing black face and and an afro wig. Overall 3 stars for the music of Neil Diamond and 2 stars for the performance of Laurence Oliver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Neil Diamond is a songwriter of some significance who draws nothing but criticism from the rock intelligentsia (an oxymoron if ever I heard one).Here he demonstrates, for anyone who doubted it that he combines a natural inability to act with a musical stage presence of considerable power. The storyline is twee and outdated, Laurence Olivier hams it up for all he is worth, Diamond the actor is wooden and dramatic tension is conspicuous by its absence.In the midst of all this dross we have the magical moments of music with "America", "Love on the rocks", "Hello again", "Summerlove" and many more. We also get an engaging performance from the very talented Lucie Arnaz.Minus the music this would rate 1 star: the music elevates it to a 5!</fullReview>

High points: New wave version of "Love on the Rocks", and Neil shouting "What happened to the groove?" as he storms out of the studio.Seriously, though, if you want to know how the music industry really works, this is an excellent, gritty tutorial.</fullReview>
