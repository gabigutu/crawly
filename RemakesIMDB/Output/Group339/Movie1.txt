		<shortDescription>A Tale of Two Orphans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Orphans of the Storm" (United Artists, 1921), directed by D.W. Griffith, is a grand scale silent melodrama, by 1920s standards anyway, with the central characters being two young sisters (Lillian and Dorothy Gish) in a story that is divided into two parts. The first half, set prior to the French Revolution, is taken from the old play, "The Two Orphans" by Adolphe Dennery. The second half, lifted from Charles Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities," takes place during the French Revolution, given the added excitement to a suspenseful climax in the Griffith tradition.Part I of the story opens with the killing of a commoner. The slain man's wife is revealed to be the daughter of an aristocratic family who feel she was injudiciously married. They decide to take the infant child from her and leave it on the steps of Notre Dame Cathedral in the dead of winter where she might get picked up and adopted by some kind-hearted soul, with a note attached that reads, "Her name is Louise. Save Her." Later, as the snow continues to fall, a poverty-stricken father named Jean Girard, arrives to leave his own baby, Henriette, to the cathedral steps. After noticing the shivering infant Louise, Girard realizes that he cannot bring himself to do the same for his own child, so he decides to bring home both babies. After returning home to his wife with the babies, Girard encounters a purse full of money left with Louise. With this money, the Girard's rise above their poverty-stricken background and raise the two girls happily in a northern providence. Years pass. A plague comes, killing both parents, and blinding Louise (Dorothy Gish). Henriette (Lillian Gish), her sister and guide, accompanies her blind sister to Paris in the hope of locating a famous doctor who may be able to restore her sight. On their way, they attract the attention of Marquis de Praille (Morgan Wallace), a nobleman, who becomes so interested in Henriette that he arranges to have her kidnapped upon the arrival in Paris and brought to a lavish party given that night at his great estate, thus, leaving the blind Louise to roam the streets of Paris alone, until she is taken in by Pierre (Frank Puglia). But as fate would have it, Pierre has an old hag of a mother, Frochard (Lucille LaVerne), who decides to use the blind girl by having her sing and beg in the streets for money. At first Louise refuses, but after being left alone in a room surrounded by rats, she agrees to do her bidding. As for Henriette, she escapes the estate of De Praille with the aide of Chevalier de Vaudrey (Josef Schildkraut), an aristocrat who not only pities her, but agrees to help her search for Louise. During the search, Henriette falls in love with Chevalier, who, in turn, happens to be the nephew of Louise's birth mother (Catherine Emmett), still mourning for the loss of her child of long ago, now the wife of the famous count, who is unaware of his wife's secret past. PART II of the story continues to focus on Henriette's search for Louise and her encounter with Chevalier. After learning of Louise's whereabouts and being victim of the evil Mother Frochard, she locates the old hag who tells her that her sister has "died." But as Henriette gets closer to learning the truth and finding Louise, something always intervenes to prevent their reunion, especially the riot and outbreak of the French Revolution, having the aristocrats arrested, sentenced and executed by the one and only guillotine, with the innocent Henriette taken in to become one of those tortured victims."Orphans of the Storm" ranks one of the best of the DW Griffith silents, and one that should still hold interest throughout, particularly its story that plays liked a chaptered serial. Of all the supporting players, which range from Monte Blue, Sheldon Lewis, Creighton Hale, Louis Wolheim and Kate Bruce, Lucille LaVerne as the mean old hag named Mother Frochard, old clothes, uncombed hair and some missing front teeth, is the most memorable because of her natural meanness. One scene comes to mind is the one when, after forcing the blind Louise to beg on the streets as the snow falls around her, Mother Frochard decides to take the shawl away from her, feeling that the more she shivers, the more money she will collect. LaVerne would play a similar character in appearance in the 1935 MGM version of "A Tale of Two Cities" starring Ronald Colman. LaVerne leaves a lasting legacy playing old hags, especially during French Revolutionary times. Another memorable performance given in this production is by Leslie King (who sometimes resembles Boris Karloff), playing a character named Jacques Forget-Not, an unforgiving sort who avenges those aristocrats who tortured his poor father by sending them to their execution. In spite of some flaws, and there are several, particularly a couple of unrelated scenes and unnecessary added comedy relief that distract from a viewer's attention, whose main focal point is on the two orphans, there are memorable scenes along with lavish background scenery and costumes that are an added bonus in capturing the flavor of 18th century Paris."Orphans of the Storm" was one of 13 silent features shown on public television's 1971 presentation of THE SILENT YEARS, as hosted by Orson Welles, with an original and excellent piano score accompanied by William Perry, the print that was formerly used in the BLACKHAWK VIDEO collection back in the 1980s, and the one currently seen when aired on Turner Classic Movie's SILENT Sunday NIGHTS. A new copy, available by KINO video, features a new (but very unsatisfying) music score, clearer picture and a longer length of 150 minutes. In spite of which version to see, "Orphans of the Storm" still ranks one of the best silents produced by the Griffith company shortly before the great director's decline. (****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sometimes feel that people who are not sympathetic to the silent era and its genre should not view or comment on them.As a long-time maven of silent films, I have no problem placing myself in that era and enjoying these movies on their own terms. Much has changed since those days, and most folks simply cannot appreciate the simplicity AND complexity of photoplays without words.This film is magnificent and entertaining. I am not a fan of most "period pieces", but this transcends the typical fare. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two ORPHANS OF THE STORM caused by the French Revolution desperately search for each other in the violent chaos of Paris.History's sweeping drama comes alive in this powerful epic film from legendary silent movie genius D. W. Griffith. Although much happens on a broad canvas, the director never loses sight of the intimate details of the heroines' pitiful plight. In denouncing tyranny, Griffith always manages to keep the viewer engrossed in how the State's insidious evil affects the individual.Much of the film's success is due to the remarkable acting of the Gish Sisters, Lillian &amp; Dorothy. Acclaimed for her comedic talents, Dorothy here gives an almost completely serious performance, portraying a blind girl cruelly separated from her beloved sister and forced to beg in the streets. Lillian, her classic face mirroring a myriad of emotions, plays the sibling persecuted by both lecherous aristocrats and rapacious revolutionaries. The scene in which Lillian, in an upper chamber, hears Dorothy singing in the alley below but is unable to reach her, is almost unbearable in its emotional intensity.A young Joseph Schildkraut plays Lillian's blue-blooded suitor, giving the viewer an intimation of the very fine character actor he would become with the advent of talking pictures. Lucille LaVerne steals more than a few scenes as the filthy harridan who enslaves and terrorizes Dorothy. Frank Puglia makes a poignant mark as Miss LaVerne's pathetic, downtrodden son. Comic actor Creighton Hale gives a lively performance in a small role as a mischievous, periwiged servant.A fascinating aspect of the film is its vivid rendering of two historical characters of great significance in the history of France. Georges Danton was probably not as noble as he is portrayed by Monte Blue, nor was Maximilien Robespierre necessarily as evil as Sidney Herbert depicts him. What is certain is that both men were responsible for the deaths of thousands of individuals during the Reign of Terror. Fittingly, each man had his own rendezvous with Madame Le Guillotine in 1794.Movie mavens will recognize an unbilled Louis Wolheim as the executioner awaiting Miss Lillian on the scaffold.Griffith handles the sequences involving surging masses of extras with admirable dexterity. He also freely borrows a few plot elements from Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. In fact Miss LaVerne, with scarcely a costume change, would play the role of The Vengeance in MGM's 1935 version of that classic, violent novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lavish Epic Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D.W. Griffith loved epic stories full of dangerous situations and damsels in distress. With the beautiful and talented Gish sisters, he got two damsels for the price of one. "Orphans of the Storm" is probably the most beautiful of all Griffith features. The lavish detailing of the sets is much better than "Intolerance" or "Broken Blossoms" and the costumes are magnificent. By this time in Griffith's career, his direction was already beginning to become stale and his plots too old-fashioned, but somehow he makes "Orphans" work to his advantage.Lillian Gish is Henriette Girard and her sister Dorothy plays her "Sister" Louise. The amazing Joseph Schildkraut plays de Vaudrey, a nobleman who truly is noble. The "storm" in the title refers to the French Revolution, which is the background this story of family and romantic love plays itself upon.As usual, Lillian Gish is wonderful in her role as the devoted sister Henriette; but it is Dorothy Gish as blind sister Louise who is truly the star of the film. Her performance drips with the pathos, pain, and longing that most people associate with her older sister. Schildkraut shines in this, his first Hollywood film role.The frequent ridiculous scenes (Danton running to save Henriette from the executioner's blade?) and length of the film will turn most modern viewers off; but those who have a love of history, epic spectacle, and the timeless beauty of the Gish sisters will enjoy "Orphans of the Storm".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DW Griffith storyteller extraordinaire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adolphe D'Ennery's novel was one of those countless melodramatic maudlin stories which were thriving in France of the 19th century. DW Griffith decided to transpose the action just before and after French revolution.The novel was rather reactionary and its historical background was thin and vague.But Griffith's vision of the French Revolution is naive,to put it mildly.He was not apparently aware that the 1789 events were mainly a bourgeois move,and the poor were only a tool.The dichotomy Good Danton/Wicked Robespierre should make people who are looking for a sort of historical accuracy have a look at Wajda"s "Danton"(with G.Depardieu,in the eighties).Forget history and you have a two-hour and a half silent movie with never a dull moment.Griffith is a wonderful storyteller,who had a great respect for his audience.Some sequences are still impressive today:the aristocratic orgy,when the Poor are starving at the gates of the palace is far from D'Ennery's timid depiction of the scene in the book;Lillian Gish,a wonderful actress who 'd been part of the cinema till the eighties,is so powerful in her part of the abducted maiden Henriette we can almost hear her when she screams out of despair:"is there a man of honor among you?Louise and the shrew who got her under her thumb begging in front of the cathedral as the snow is falling is a splendid picture,recalling a painter's work;even if Danton's coming to the rescue of a soon-to-be guillotined Henriette is thoroughly implausible,we cannot help but admire the director's maestria.Few silent movies have stood the test of time as well as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece from one of the great innovators of early cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I find it desperately necessary to remind the viewer of silent movies of the danger of analyzing these pieces under the lens of the modern cinemagoer. The aesthetic values of silent cinema are incommensurable with the values of modern cinema. Aside from the obvious difference that one relies purely on image while the other has the benefit of sound, we must also not forget that the cinema of the silent era is cinema in its infancy, in a constant state of the most early self-discovery (which is not to say that cinema has necessarily "grown up" or "progressed" into our modern era; our cinema today is only different than the cinema of the silent era, neither better nor worse.) Basically, we should check ourselves before we ridicule these films on the basis of irising, masking, et cetera and ESPECIALLY the exaggerated emotion and overblown gesturing of the actors. The conventions of the art of acting have, of course, their basis in that of the theatre, which preceded film, and where emphatic gesturing and stressed emotion was conventional in conveying story even to those seated in the back row.All editorializing aside, Griffith's _Orphans of the Storm_ is a shining example of the director's masterful grasp of narrative cinema. The story is almost Dickensian in its feel, from its very beginning alternating between no less than five separate subplots, all of which become inextricably intertwined before the backdrop of the larger plot of the impending revolution in France. The acting performances are not, in fact, excessively overplayed, but are actually quite subtle and touching, especially those of the two orphans, the Gish sisters.The visuals are stunning: the costumes and decor are lush and the recreation of late 18th century Paris is excellent. Most impressive to me is Griffith's expert command of montage, primarily through intercutting, in creating a engrossing story that, while complex in structure, is easily grasped. The film starts out on wobbly legs, but soon breaks into a steady gallop, raging through the glorious revolution to an admittedly predictable, yet satisfying conclusion. A grand achievement for one of the titans of early cinema: I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually impressive melodrama is wildly overacted but still compelling to watch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ORPHANS OF THE STORM is quite an impressive looking silent film from D.W. Griffith, who was obviously the Cecil B. DeMille of his day. He has an instinct for showing surging crowd scenes involving all the unrest during the French Revolution and these scenes are highly detailed and very arresting visually. All the sets and costumes look as though a lavish budget was spent on this story of two sisters who survive the French Revolution after many melodramatic twists and turns of their fortune.DOROTHY GISH and LILLIAN GISH are the sisters, with Dorothy as the blind waif who is separated from her sister when an overly amorous nobleman orders Lillian to be brought to his orgy. From there on, the Dickensian plot becomes thicker and thicker as the girls suffer one indignity after another in order to survive.LUCILLE LaVERNE is the old hag (she later was the model for Disney's Wicked Witch in "Snow White"), a harridan who makes Dorothy a beggar in the streets. "You'll shiver better without a shawl," is one of her immortal lines.Joseph SCHILDKRAUT is very impressive in an early American screen role, demonstrating charm and skill of the kind that would land him important parts in future costume films like "Marie Antoinette." MONTE BLUE is Danton, a man who meets LILLIAN GISH early in the story and later becomes the defender who saves her and Schildkraut from the guillotine.It's all very melodramatic, the acting ranging from overdone to wildly overdone. Griffith was never subtle in asking his performers to give it their all. Excessive wringing of hands, eye-rolling to show anguish, fierce looks to show hatred, etc. may cause unintended chuckles when viewed by today's audiences, but there is never any letdown in the telling of a compelling story using the French Revolution as rich background material for a tale of villainy and heroism.A fascinating silent film with an appropriate film score added to give the story even more force and flavor.Summing up: Overlong drama, but compelling from the start to the feverishly melodramatic end.Exquisite close-ups of Lillian Gish are touching and lend poignant charm to her performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The French Revolution for Ninnies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Lillian Gish and I enjoy silent pictures, but this movie is just plain silly. It's two stories in one and each manages to cancel out the other. I'm a sucker for a good weepy, sentimental potboiler. This one starts off good but it takes forever to come to its inevitable sappy ending because the French Revolution keeps butting in and spoiling everything. The effect is quite comical. It seems criminal to go to such lengths to re-create a great event in history only to burlesque it in the service of a contrived melodrama. (The same crime was repeated by the makers of TITANIC many decades later.) The last minute race to the gallows is more of the same hokum that cheapened INTOLERANCE. The movie leaves you with the feeling that the entire Revolution just sort of blew over and the cleansing spirit of DEMOCRACY made everyone live happily ever after. What about Napoleon?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DW Griffith's fall from grace during the 1920s wasn't just because his technique began to look old fashioned. It was that his stories got worse. His narrative structures were inspired by great works of literature, particularly that of Charles Dickens, but his plots were often sourced from obscure novels or trashy stage melodramas. These stories were often implausible and simplistic, shortcomings he could only make up for with his sensitive cinematic technique and the reliability of his actors.Orphans of the Storm is rather lazily-written, full of one-dimensional characters, predictable situations, and sudden coincidences leaping over gaps in the plot, as two sisters, one of them blind, lose each other, find each other, then lose each other again amid the chaos of the French Revolution. However, it's (just about) possible to overlook a bad story so long as it's well told. Unfortunately, Griffith appears to be following the trend of having more and longer title cards, explaining every point and feeding us superficial lines of dialogue, where the action alone should tell us what is going on. In some scenes, such as those where Dorothy Gish's blindness is brought up, we get the worst of both worlds, having not only the point-labouring title cards, but also exaggerated pantomiming, with characters pointing emphatically at both eyes.Griffith should have known that all his best moments were wordless and understated. Thankfully, he has not forgotten how to direct a good love scene, and those between Joseph Schildkraut and Lillian Gish are particularly effective, framed plainly in a series of close-ups, barely moving their faces but conveying a world of emotion. This was Schildkraut's first American picture, and he is one of the most pleasingly natural and convincing lead men Griffith had worked with thus far. With his fine, sharp features he was also appropriately handsome, although a few films later he would play Judas in King of Kings, and subsequently became a bit typecast. As for Gish, she is far more satisfying here in one of her serene and sensible roles, as opposed to the hysterical girly parts she was increasingly given. The other standout in this cast is Monte Blue as Danton, whipping a crowd into a frenzy without once resorting to hamminess.It was a long-established rule that every major Griffith picture had to feature a battle somewhere in the middle, and end with a climactic ride-to-the-rescue. By 1921 these action sequences were becoming a trifle uninspired. The battle between revolutionaries and soldiers has a great build-up, but then resorts to bland god-shots, making the moment suddenly seem very cold. The finale is one of Griffith's least engaging, I think because while the ride itself is excitingly shot and edited, the business at the guillotine is just a lot of faffing around, a far cry from Bobby Haron's haunting walk to the scaffold in Intolerance.In spite of all this, Orphans of the Storm ? like every Griffith feature I have seen ? does have its absolutely divine moments. There's a very dynamic sense of rhythm to the scene at the ball and the later celebration of the victorious revolutionaries. The reunion of Schildkraut and Lillian Gish is both powerful and sensitive. Griffith may have been beginning to slip, but at least he was failing beautifully.</fullReview>

D.W Griffith was known for his bold faced way at voicing his opinions through films. I have never seen such a great show of emotions than with the Gish Sisters. I don't think anyone has ever been able to match Lillian's facial expressions and the way she uses the absence of sound to her advantage. A tremendous story unfolds before the viewer that leads to a riveting conclusion that will etch this film into your mind and heart forever.

		<shortDescription>Often Exciting, Often Moving, &amp; A Triumph For the Gish Sisters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is often exciting and often moving, yet the chance to see Lillian and Dorothy Gish together might be the best reason of all to watch Griffith's silent classic, "Orphans of the Storm". The story combines the tumultuous backdrop of the French Revolution with a worthwhile melodrama involving the ordeals of two sisters who are practically alone in the world.The French Revolution used to be a frequent setting for some fine films - between the ideas involved and the upheavals that it brought, it's almost ready-made for cinema. Here, as the two sisters, Lillian and Dorothy are struggling to help each other when they are caught up in the turmoil around them, and they find themselves involved with everyone from the lowest classes of society up to some of the best-known personalities of the Revolution.The historical background is often stylized, and it is mainly there to lend drama to the story about the sisters, rather than to provide an accurate look at history. The characterizations of some of the revolutionary leaders are interesting, but they are not always accurate. Yet from a purely dramatic viewpoint it works well. The involved story, along with the personal appeal of Gish sisters, combine to win the audience's sympathy quickly, and to heighten the tension as the story plays out. It's a well-acted and memorable melodrama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Griffith Spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Orphans of the Storm" is another of D.W. Griffith's historical spectacles, but stands out somewhat as more of a lavish costume drama, and it's based in French history rather than American history. The small interpersonal dramas of his films, whether or not they were set against a backdrop of historical grandeur, tended to be the same melodramatic fluff every time. This film is no exception. Additionally, aside from the Gish sisters, the acting was often overdone or very stiff. The costumes and sets were extravagant, though, for whatever that's worth.As usual, Griffith painted history and his characters in black and white--diverting even the French Revolution to fit into a contrived happy ending complete with a luscious garden. His notions of the French Revolution weren't found in historical fact or the play "The Two Orphans", but are from Charles Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities". There's another predictable last-minute rescue climax, too, which Griffith had been returning to since his Biograph shorts, and which doesn't compare favorably with its better incarnations in "The Birth of a Nation", "Intolerance" or "Way Down East". Furthermore, the dancing mobs are overdone, and the comic relief is again detracting and unnecessary, although minor compared to that which spoiled "Way Down East".In comparison to Griffith's other melodramas, although it's overlong, convoluted and has many other faults, it lies somewhere in the mediocre. I think the major weakness of "Orphans of the Storm" and, indeed, most of Griffith's films from around this time and hereon, were their lack of technical innovation, which was what made Griffith's earlier work important. Every decent filmmaker had by then copied the techniques he'd helped invent, and so when Griffith continued into 1921 making the same kind of picture he made in 1915, the films lack the importance and novelty; instead, they sometimes appear derivative and unpolished.One very technical example of Griffith's lack of continued innovation to look for are that several cuts in the film are temporal replays from a different perspective, such as Gish turning towards her lover with arms spread open in a medium shot and then doing so again for a long shot. It doesn't matter whether it's sloppy film-making or an intentional revival of a jarring transitional effect that had been supplanted by more seamless transitions (simple cuts, crosscuts and such) before Griffith even began making movies; my point is: he's not inventing cinema here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Griffith at the outer edge of his genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film demonstrates Griffith's genius in creating a massive scale and in linking disparate plot elements. By 1921, however, some of Griffith's innovations had become mere mannerisms, particularly the cross-cutting that leads to his climax, as introduced in "Birth of a Nation" and used, with powerful effect, in "Hearts of the World." The cross-cutting at the end of "Orphans" goes on much too long. Lillian Gish must have grown old staring down into the basket. Some techniques -- a blank screen followed by a face (memory) and a narrow focus on a face (point of view), for example, are still effective. I know that over-elaboration is a staple of the silent screen, but at times, it is over-the-top here. Constrast, for example, the more subtle approach of an actor like Alice Terry. Danton did argue for moderation, once he believed that the Revolution had succeeded. His oration in this film is, like much of it, simply unbelievable. The idyllic ending also strains credulity. How did this particular group of aristocrats escape the blade and retire to a country estate?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful production, tedious story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphans of the Storm (1921) was DW Griffith's last major hit before his rather old-fashioned style became out of fashion with the progression of the Roaring Twenties. It is a beautifully shot film, with lovely costuming and sets. The action sequences with the peasants storming the Bastille and the rescue of Lillian Gish from "the gates of death" are rendered with the usual Griffith excitement and masterful control of crowds; however, I confess I find this movie to be a major slog, way too long for its slight story. Half an hour could have easily been cut without damage to the plot. I'm with critic and Griffith biographer Richard Schikel: the movie is over-busy and not as emotionally engaging as it needs to be in order to be memorable. There's plenty of spectacle and excellent editing, but when I don't care about the cardboard characters, and the story is overstuffed and unengaging, then to what effect is it?And then there's the acting, which is the overripe sort that most sadly associate with all silent film. Joseph Schildkraut, one of the finest actors of this period who would be relegated to character parts later on, is a little stiff, but he does manage some good moments as Lillian's love interest and looks gorgeous in his 18th century getup. Lucille La Verne is great fun as the hag who kidnaps and exploits Dorothy Gish. Everyone else is woefully overdone. Dorothy Gish could easily steal the show when playing comedic roles or spunky young women as she did in Hearts of the World (1918), but here, as the blind damsel in distress, she just fades into the background, even when overacting as she tends to do in the big emotional scenes. Lillian Gish is the worst offender, all hand wringing and hopping and shrieking and mugging, mugging, mugging. She's a great actress, one of the finest of the silent era and of all time, but she did need to be reigned in some times and Griffith just had her go nuts. After this film, she'd be free of Griffith and go on to do much superior work with other directors, like King Vidor and Victor Sjostrom.I know it has its fans, but I have a hard time mustering up much enthusiasm for it. As far as Griffith's feature work goes, I much prefer Intolerance, Broken Blossoms, and Way Down East; however, the film is certainly superior to America, Griffith's clunky 1924 epic of the American Revolution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movies, Mr. Griffith, And Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If pushed to the wall I think that most film historians will agree that the first great director/player team in American film is that of D.W. Griffith and Lillian Gish. The last collaboration of that team is Orphans Of The Storm in which sister Dorothy had a prominent role as another orphan.The source for this film is a story of French origin, the kind of material it would be impossible to do today, it would date so. Lillian and Dorothy are a pair of adopted sisters, Dorothy is in fact of noble birth, but as an infant she was abandoned because her mother had married a commoner and such was not done in Bourbon France. The story of Orphans Of The Storm is how Lillian and Dorothy raised together, get separated through time and circumstance and in between when they reunite, France undergoes a revolution. Although Griffith's source of the story was French, he relied heavily on Thomas Carlyle and Charles Dickens. Carlyle's history and A Tale Of Two Cities by Dickens became the picture that the average person in the English speaking world had of those times in France it would have been what the movie-going public expected. As history Orphans Of The Storm falls way short.As entertainment to this day the Gish sisters will tear your heart out with their troubles and turmoil. Playing the part of an aristocrat with a conscience like Charles Darnay in A Tale Of Two Cities is a young Joseph Schildkraut. It was clear he would have a long career ahead of him and his speaking voice enhanced his employment opportunities when sound came in.Lillian Gish when she wrote her memoirs in the 1970s and who knew she still had a substantial career ahead of her, entitled the book, The Movies, Mr. Griffith, and Me. Reading that book and hearing interviews with her while she was alive, I don't think I ever heard any player convey more love for her art and her mentor than Ms. Gish did. From The Birth Of A Nation until The Whales Of August no one ever had a longer or more fruitful career in film than Lillian Gish.I don't want to shortchange Dorothy either. Her part called for her to lose her sight and you will rarely see innocence portrayed quite as touchingly as she does in Orphans Of The Storm. An unseen hand of Providence protects those like Dorothy Gish. Doesn't hurt to have a caring sister.If you're a silent movie fan, this film is an absolute must as well as a fan of the Gish sisters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great French Revolution story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I just love Griffith when he's big. This French Revolution film is flawed, certainly, but I also think it's very good. The narrative has such an excellent flow. Dorothy Gish plays the daughter of aristocrats, abandoned as a baby at the Notre Dame cathedral when her father is assassinated. A poor man wanders to the cathedral intending to abandon his newborn daughter, too, but when he sees the other bundle in the snow, he decides not only to keep his own daughter, but take up the other child as well. When she is an adult, she has lost her sight (and her adoptive parents) to a plague. The poor man's real daughter (played by Lillian Gish) takes care of her. There is an operation she can get in Paris which will reverse her blindness, and Lillian swears that she will get it for her. She also vows to remain unmarried until her sister can see once again. Unfortunately, as soon as they get to Paris, they become separated. An immoral aristocrat fancies Lillian and orders her kidnapped and brought to his midnight orgy. Poor, blind Dorothy is left alone, and a beggar woman (Morgan Wallace) and her two rapscallion sons (Sheldon Lewis and Frank Puglia) take her back to their hole in the wall, planning to use her affliction to their advantage. Everyone who passes by will have such pity on the blind girl and give them lots of their spare change. Thus the story splits into two halves (though definitely favoring Lillian), following both the rich and the poor at the beginning of the Revolution. There are several exceptional sequences, including the revelries of Bastille Day and Lillian's frightful approach to the guillotine. There are some very weird connections that Griffith makes between the French Revolution and American history and present. One character he tells us (in a footnote, no less) is the "Abraham Lincoln of France." The film's introductory title tells us that the French Revolution was begun by Anarchists and Bolsheviks, although they did, in fact, overthrow a [i]bad[/i] government. He also adds that we in America should never overthrow our own government, which sounds very odd. Perhaps he was so overly wary of the societal impact he had with Birth of a Nation that he thought, quite arrogantly, that his French Revolution film might stir up a revolution at home. Or perhaps he was responding to the scandals surrounding the current president, Warren G. Harding. I don't really know, but it's very interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sisters Gish try to weather the French Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the French Revolution as backdrop DW Griffith exposes his constant heroine Lillian Gish to depraved aristocrats and blood thirsty revolutionaries in Orphans of the Storm. Made during the Red Scare in America Griffith takes the opportunity to promote democracy and denigrate runaway Bolshevism in this silent epic filled with his signature montage and grand compositions.Louise (Dorothy Gish) the abandoned daughter of an aristocrat is taken in by the destitute Girards. Raised as a sister with Henriette she loses her sight but has a fierce protector in her sibling who travels with her to Paris on the eve of full revolt led by Danton and Robespierre. Through the diabolical machinations of of an aristo she is separated from her sister and spends most of the film attempting to re-unite with her and avoid the guillotine. In her search she is assisted by the aristocrat DeVaudry (Joseph Schildkraut) as well as Danton (Monte Blue) who can find time from overthrowing the country to rescue Henriette from the blade. Griffith straddles the fence in this history piece with praise for individuals but condemnation for both sides. Most of the aristocrats are degenerates, the revolutionaries blood lusting and depraved and Griffith fills his canvases with scenes of bacchanalian reverie and sadistic cruelty to drive the point home. Danton may be a champion of the people but Robespierre and Jaques "Never Forget" seem bent on revenge and blood letting while the decent side of the aristos is represented by Henriette's compassionate pursuer DeVaudry.Politics aside Storm is filled with sumptuous sets and crowd scenes that convey the frenzy of the moment and the accompanying delirium of be headings and dancing in the street. Lillian Gish is both delicate and determined and in scenes with Dorothy the two are quite touching to watch. Monte Blue's Danton is a bit over the top but the sharp venal features of Robespierre and Jaques Never Forget seething with hatred express themselves perfectly with a mere look. While it may not be the mega epic that Intolerance and Birth of a Nation are Orphans of the Storm proves that size isn't everything and it remains one of Griffith's best efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The drama of two sisters in the midst of the French revolution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basiscly in essence this movie is a very original and pleasant take on the French revolution, when the monarchy got replaced by the republic. The story is told through the viewpoint of two sister, of which one is also blind, who get separated, during the events that lead up to the eventual French revolution and its aftermath. It's a great and original way to tell the story, without ever becoming too 'historical', with that I'm meaning that it doesn't turn into a dull history-class lesson.It's an amazing looking and crafted costume drama that above all is also really well told. Leave it up to D.W. Griffith to tell a grand epic story. Of course the movie is mostly melodramatic, like basically every other genre movie from the same time period. And melodramatic or not, the movie and its emotions work really well. It makes this a really effective movie to watch, though it's definitely not only just drama but the movie in its overall style is quite light (especially compared to other D.W. Griffith movies) and even leaves room for plenty of humor, despite it's heavy and dramatic undertone.D.W. Griffith movies have always contained humor, mostly of the small and subtle sort, that often worked refreshing from its more heavy and dramatic elements. This movie is no exception and even has a comical relief in it, in the form of Creighton Hale, as the servant Chevalier de Vaudrey. The movie actually features quite a lot slapstick humor, especially in its second halve. It proofs that D.W. Griffith had a great sense for timing.The movie is filled with many characters and also features many developing plot lines. The movie is however definitely not as tiresome and overlong as with other D.W. Griffith movies sometimes is the case. This movie knows to keep your interested because of its fantastic story and the well it's told and made to look in the eventual end movie. The movie is also not as hard to follow as with many other silent movies often is the case. I think this is also due to the more 'light' way of storytelling. It's obvious that the movie makers wanted to entertain its viewers.The many characters are being played by some fine actors, although of course their performances are definitely over-the-top all by todays standards. The real life sisters Lillian and Dorothy Gish play also the two sisters in this movie, in their last movie role together. Lillian is of course the best known of the two, definitely thanks to D.W. Griffith's other movies but Dorothy in this movie shows that she is just as talented. The two also have a really great chemistry together on the screen which definitely helps the movie and its story. Joseph Schildkraut plays a great. pretty looking, noble and heroic character. But especially great in this movie are the 'villains'. The movie has a wide variety of villainous characters, from many different classes. The aristocratic villains are great, mainly also because of their looks and style of acting but also the characters from the lower classes such as Jacques-Forget-Not and the vile Mother Frochard are great. All of the characters are really powerful and the movie manages to give each of them a defining personality.The movie gives a good and detailed look into the Parisian aristocratic lifestyle of the 18th century. It also perfectly explains how and why the French revolution occurred, without ever loosing its main focus on the dramatic story lines of the two sisters, who in essence don't really have anything to do with the revolution. They're just at the wrong place and the wrong time with the wrong people. The French revolution merely serves as a backdrop for the movie.The movie has a great look, with impressive looking sets and especially costumes. You can definitely describe this movie as a costume-drama in my opinion. There also are some great mass sequences and battles, all of course part of the D.W. Griffith trademark style of film-making.The race against the clock sort of ending is totally fantastic. It's tense and extremely well build up and executed. The eventual end of the movie is also really great, in which everything reach a satisfying conclusion. It suits the genre and especially this movie, really well. The movie left me with a great happy feeling and the overall movie made a big impression on me.Not even D.W. Griffith's best (that really says something about his other movies!) but certainly his most pleasant to watch- and entertaining one.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential Griffith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two orphaned sisters (Lillian and Dorothy Gish) are caught up in the turmoil of the French Revolution, encountering misery and love along the way.The last Griffith film to feature Lillian and Dorothy Gish, it is often considered Griffith's last major commercial success, after box-office hits such as The Birth of a Nation, Intolerance, and Broken Blossoms. Like his earlier films, Griffith used historical events to comment on contemporary events, in this case the French Revolution to warn about the rise of Bolshevism. The film is about class conflict and a plea for inter-class understanding and against destructive hatred.For me, the best Griffith will always be "Broken Blossoms", but his whole method is interesting. Making such epic films to make a political point... it's admirable, and even more admirable considered how much time must have went into making such long films at that point in time. I can only imagine how much film he had to burn through to get what he ended up with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Drama of the French Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D.W. Griffith was essentially the father of epic cinema. While there were some epic films before his landmark achievement "The Birth of a Nation" (most notably "Cabiria" and "The Last Days of Pompeii"), epic cinema wasn't really all too popular notable before Griffith came along.As influential and innovative as it may be D.W. Griffith's "The Birth of a Nation" certainly isn't for everyone, because of the harsh racism and glorification of the dreaded Ku Klux Klan. However, even if you are highly against THAT film, I still think that some of his other epics are worth a look!His best is probably "Intolerance", but another great one that comes to mind is this film, "Orphans of the Storm"!Set during French Revolution, this grand historical epic, to put it simply, mainly centers on the loving bond of two sisters (played by two actual sisters, Lilian and Dorothy Gish) and their tragic separation and attempt to find each other again. Along the way, there's action, adventure, and some true melodrama as well as some truly innovative filmmaking.The editing and filmmaking techniques used here are truly influential and are still used to this day. Griffith's lens really manages to capture the intensity of certain moments thanks to his genius editing and cinematic eye.However, I must warn you, the film is LONG! In fact, the only problem I have with it is its length. It really dragged at times and I'm sure that if you cut out a couple of scenes the film would still work just fine.That being said, "Orphans of the Storm" is a true epic masterpiece. There's many shots here that deserve to be framed and hung in a museum somewhere!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimate Masterpiece of Epic Melodramas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Orphans of the Storm' is one of the last very successful films by D.W. Griffith, and it stays as one of his all times best. Again using lot of visual effects and great battle scenes with hundreds of extras. Still no one hasn't surpass Griffith as the master of epic melodramas mixed with historical events.Again Griffith uses his favorite themes - injustice, violence, doomed love, and tragic characters. Set at the times of French Revolution, Lillian (Henriette) and Dorothy Gish (Louise) stars as orphaned sisters (last time they both appeared together in Griffith's film). When Louise loses her eyesight her sister Henriette decides to take her to the doctor in Paris where they get mixed in the plans of immoral aristocrat de Praille, a beggar Mother Frochard, and turmoil of the Revolution. That would be the story short. But like Griffith's previous epics, 'Orphans of the Storm' is quite fast paced and filled with edge on your seat moments until the dramatic conclusion. Griffith masterfully uses every device of delay to heighten the suspense, thus proving he was the 'master of suspense' before The Master of Suspense Alfred Hithcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A storm is brewing. Through the eye of the storm, Griffith metaphoric shows us the violent twist and turns of life during the French Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphans of the Storm is a controversial silent film from a very controversial director about a controversial topic. Set during the events of the French Revolution, the movie tells the story of two orphan sisters Henriette Girard (Lillian Gish) &amp; Louise Girard (Dorothy Gish), who struggle to survive in extreme poverty France. As the events of the French Revolution, unfold, Louise goes blind from malnutrition, while Henriette is kidnapped by a lustful aristocrat. Could the two sisters find a way to reunite or would the trouble nation separate their love of each other, forever? Watch the movie to find out. Griffith often use the family theme in most of his major works. Families are often threatened, torn apart, reunited, destroyed, and created in his films. One can only guess at the motivations for this obsession with family from a man whose father died when he was ten, and who was never able to create a strong family relationship in his real life. D.W Griffith has often dealt with extreme depression, and abandoning issues with drinking. In many ways, the insolation from people in his own life, made D.W Griffith work harder to connect his films with the audience. You really do see it, here in this film. One of the greatest things, he did, was to set the events during the French Revolution rather than the pre-revolution Ancien Rgime settlings of the original source material, the novel, 'The Two Orphans' written by Adolphe Philippe d'Ennery and Eugene Cormon. The events portray in the film really does mirror, what happens in Charles Dicken's novel, 'A Tale of Two Cities' and 'History of the French Revolution' by Thomas Carlyle in which D.W Griffith use as research. Still, there were some historical inaccurate, like how they portray revolution leader, George Danton. Widely disputed amongst many historians, Danton is a controversial figure that was often portray as an Abraham Lincoln type character. In truth, George Danton was not much a benevolent aristocrat, but a power hungry ruthless politician. In many ways, he was just as bad as Maximilien de Robespierre. Danton voted for the death of King Louis XVI and often agree with the tactics of the Reign of Terror which is clearly facts. It's twisted and distorted almost beyond recognition from honest truth. D.W Griffith often use the French Revolution as a metaphor of the Bolshevism Red October Revolution of 1917. On that note: While one could make a very broad connection, in terms of Bolsheviks being primarily of working-class membership and Robespierre being portray like a Stalin like figure. Still, there are huge different between the First French Republic and early Soviet Union. Both can be viewed as communism doctrine nations, but its modern form, communism grew out of the socialist movement of 19th-century Europe due to Industrial Revolution advanced technology. Socialist critics blamed capitalism for the misery of the proletariat?a new class of urban factory workers who labored under often-hazardous conditions. In a way, it's nice to see D.W Griffith tackle an issue like that, at the same time, show the early paranoia of America has toward Communism. Another thing that Griffith did well is create a narrative film; when most films of the time had little to no direction. The acting under his direction is amazing for the most part. Lillian Gish and Dorothy Gish are just beautiful. You see the emotional and physical suffering, both were able to portray during all the great close ups in the film. They do overdone the whole love thing, as it seem more incestuous lesbians than sisterhood. The supporting cast was just as good, with the rumbustious performance of Lucille La Verne as the female Fagan, and the strong portrayal of Danton by Monte Blue. Seeing how it's a silent film, they do kinda over act a bit, by overdoing their body language. It's get kinda goofy at times. Trying to outshine the German films being import at the time, the production values of this movie was epic in scale. The sets, the costumes, and film value were great. Lots of violent scenes like a child getting run over. Also it did had a lot of sex for a silent film. In many ways, some people believe Orphans of the Storm was the last great success that D.W Griffith had. Orphans of the Storm did turned a modest profit, but nothing as spectacular as his previous film, 1920's Way Down East. Griffith needed a success of those proportions to sustain his production costs and the expense of maintaining his own studio, and sadly, it didn't. It got worst for D.W Griffith, as his love affair with his top star Lillian Gish got sour. Gish sick of the continuing rivalry with movie starlet, Carol Dempster for Griffith's affections, left him. The aftermath of the movie cause D.W Griffith to drink even more heavily in alcohol to the point that it cause him, his life in 1948 due to cerebral hemorrhage. A lot of critics love to hate this movie do to the fact that the director is D.W Griffith. People describe him as a drunken, self-pitying, racist escapist, who egomania try to get his way. A lot of modern people love to hate his films, due to the change in attitude toward race. In 1915, D.W Griffith directed a film that would forever taint entire oeuvre and prevents any kind of objective analysis of his films with 'Birth of a Nation'. It got so bad, that in 1999, the Screen Directors' Guild removed his name from their lifetime achievement award. While, I don't agree with all of D.W Griffith's opinions. He's a very ignorant man who happened to be good at directing. He deserve more credit. Overall: While, the movie is indeed aged with some bad editing and dirt. It's watchable. This film is in the public domain and may be viewed in its entirety at YouTube. It's not hard to find. Check it out if you want to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic silent drama set at the time of the French Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set at the time of the French Revolution this film follows two women, Henriette and Louise who have been raised as sisters. A plague has killed their parents and left Louise blind so the head to Paris hoping to find a doctor who may cure her. Unfortunately things don't go according to plan; Henriette is snatched by people working for a lecherous aristocrat then Louise falls into the clutches of a spiteful hag who forces her to beg on the streets. Luckily for Henriette she is saved by the kind aristocrat Chevalier de Vaudrey; they set off to find Louise but they have made powerful enemies. When the revolution comes it looks as though life in France will get better but it isn't long before the callous aristocracy has been replaced by a new more brutal regime and it looks as if Henriette and Chevalier may fall victim to the guillotine!This film by G. W. Griffiths probably won't be watched by too many people as it is both monochromatic and silent; which is a pity as it really is rather good. I say monochromatic rather than black and white as the scenes are shown through different coloured filters; this serves to emphasise the atmosphere of each scene. I was surprised just how quickly I got used to the fact that I couldn't hear what the characters were saying; occasional inter-titles explained key points and the casts emoting was good enough to convey the meaning of what was being said.The way the story is told may seem a little melodramatic to modern viewers and it isn't subtle about telling us just who is good and who is bad? in one scene an aristocrats carriage runs over and kills a peasant and he is more concerned about his horses and Robespierre couldn't have been more villainous if he'd t been depicted stroking a white cat like Blofeld in a Bond film! This wasn't a problem though as the story moves along at a cracking pace. There is plenty of drama as well as a romantic subplot involving Henriette and Chevalier all of which leads to a fine ending; right up until the last moment I wasn't sure whether or not that couple would survive. The cast did a fine job; especially real life sisters Lillian and Dorothy Gish who play Henriette and Louise.Overall I'd certainly recommend this and not just to people fascinated by early cinema; the two and a half hour run time goes by faster than plenty of modern films!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterwork in storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D.W. Griffith's monumental epic about two sisters swept up in 18th Century Paris before, during and after the French Revolution is a masterwork in storytelling, direction and social comment, with Griffith attacking both the nature of 'mob' and aristocratic rule. On both sides of the revolution there are unpleasant, greedy individuals bent on destruction. The story is touching, Griffith's use of colour filters a welcome touch to the atmosphere and scenes, which are crafted and composed to perfection. Costumes, sets and setpieces all look beautiful. There are dozens of characters, some real life figures, such as Robespierre or Danton, each one with a uniquely crafted personality and well performed. Lillian Gish is truly astounding. The story may indeed be riddled with clichs and dramatic coincidences, but Griffith edits the film so well that you admire these moments, rather than cringe at them. I know Griffith is essentially notorious for only one film, which has no doubt swiped a gaping scar across the rest of his career, but he truly was a master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orphans of the Storm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director D.W. Griffith (The Birth of a Nation), this silent film featured near the beginning of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I was looking forward to seeing what it was about. Basically stepsisters Henriette Girard (Lillian Gish) and Louise Girard (Dorothy Gish) were less alone after the loss of the parents who looked after them, Louise being abandoned by her true birth mother and found on a staircase, and the sisters have grown up as orphans. It is the time before the French Revolution, and Louise has become blind, Henriette vows to take care of her, until the possibility that somewhere in Paris there may be a cure. Marquis De Praille (Morgan Wallace) is the lusting aristocrat, who kills the child of Jacques-Forget-Not (Leslie King), and he has Henriette abducted as he is besotted with her virginal beauty. While Louise is left helpless and alone, she is kidnapped by Mother Frochard (Lucille La Verne) and forced to help make the old hag the money that she lusts for, the old woman is using her blindness and vulnerability for profit. Chevalier De Vaudrey (Joseph Schildkraut) is the honourable aristocrat who helps Henriette escape her abduction, and he kills De Praille in a duel, but together the two of them cannot seem to find her stepsister. While renting in the house of the aristocrat, she meets Danton (Monte Blue), a politician she allows to stay with her after he got away from an attack by Royalist spies, and he falls for her, which his revolutionary friend Robespierre (Sidney Herbert) isn't approving of. While Louise continues having to beg, Henriette is proposed to by De Vaudrey, which she turns down, but he promises her that her sister will be found, and when King Louis XVI (Lee Kohlmar) finds out about his choice of wife, he orders that she be arrested. While Chevalier is sent away, and before the police come for her, Henriette is visited by Cheavalier's Aunt, who remembers from Henriette's discussion of her missing sister that she is the baby that she abandoned on a staircase. At the same moment Louise is singing and begging blindly down the street near the house, with Frochard nearby, and Henriette overhears and calls from the balcony to her sister, and that is when the blind sister is dragged away, and the other is arrested. At the same time as Louise being forced to continue begging, The French Revolution starts, with cannons firing and men charging with swords, with many people dying in the battle, and prisoners, including Henriette, being freed from captivity. Henriette and Chevalier, with Louise listening, are sentenced to be executed on the guillotine by Robespierre and Forget-not, but they are saved by Danton after getting them a pardon, saying that only Louise's sister can look after her. In the end the two orphans are finally reunited, Louise is happy to have her eye sight restored and see her sister Henriette, and the France has a better Republic formed. Also starring Frank Losee as Count De Linieres, Katherine Emmet as Countess De Linieres, Sheldon Lewis as Jacques Frochard and Frank Puglia as Pierre Frochard. Having seen The Artist I was keen to see many more great silent films, and I don't know why this film isn't considered more of a masterpiece, i.e. five stars out of five, because it does really draw you in with its absorbing material and a magnificently emotional story, it is a fantastic silent period melodrama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Griffith's Perchance Greatest Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bigwig is the patriarch of narrative. With "Those Awful Hats" 1909, "Corner in Wheat", "The Painted Lady" and many of his biographs, you can sense that this is a man who understands the lexicon of cinema (though did not pioneer it in the same sense that George Albert Smith made the close-up or how Louis Lumiere showed the first train interacting with an American audience), he is still responsible for crosscutting and this is evident in "What Shall we Do with our Old", "Birth of a Nation", "The Muskateers from Pig Alley" and onwards.Intolerance ranks as one of the most potent films ever made by a one trick pony. Many say Welles was the greatest innovator - well, he did do something of fresh sinew, but he himself also quoted Griffith's intolerance as an influence to his illustrious debut. Kubrick as well says that he was like Ikurus, when he flew too close to the sun and melted, but regardless he was ambitious at changing film from a novelty to a revered art.So enter "Orphans of the Storm" his period film (similar to that of an older french film he done "The Sealed Room"), which is in essence, topping with Amadeus and Barry Lyndon as the great period drama. And it's this because of the enlightening irrevocable effect of the films doctrines. The french revolutionists are selfish people and Maximilien Robespierre is the one that fostered it. The film chronicles the tragedy of Jean Picard's decision to allow his Daughters to live in luxury. With this judicious, yet regretful decision, Louise (Dorothy Griffith) and Henriette (Lillian Gish) are born. Later in life, Louise is blind and Henriette, her consolable sister, finds word about a cure for it. When they travel away they're separated into the darkness - Louise is lost and Henriette is taken away only to be saved by an anti-french revolutionist Chevalier De Vaudrey, who as one person in the film puts it "I wish more aristocrats were like you" and Louise then falls into the trap of Frochard, which in sequence we see one of the best dolly shots pulled away as she gets manipulated as she is used as a singer in order to get money. Where the reign takes its toll against the Bolshevism, Jacques-Forget-Not subverts the system periodically and this is so powerful because of how character driven it really is, you can empathise with these peoples struggle. However with certain scenes, such as the one where a Man sits on the back of a French Revolutionist, it seems ridiculous, to me it shows how the place has been rendered to many dolorous people. The movie is probably Griffith's least melodramatic film. Its interplay with appropriate characters, offset by a poignant time and ornate setting. The movie is mesmerising - the swordsmanship, the guillotine, the carts, the costume - it all feels authentic and Griffith really wanted to adapt the book faithfully, and that was conducive to the manifestation of a bulb that is replete with such melancholy, ambivalence and escapism.No matter what, the napoleonic scale (as with his prior films) never ceases to spellbind me. I find Griffith entertaining because he's the illusionist that creates totalitarians and characters who we strive for in their victory, and it's all in quick succession. A time well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henriette (Lillian Gish) and her sort-of adoptive sister Louise (Dorothy Gish) must travel to Paris on the eve of the French revolution so that Louise can have an operation to reverse the blindness she suffered as a result of the plague (which also claimed her adoptive parents). However, they soon become separated once in Paris: while Louise is left at the mercy of an unscrupulous beggar woman, Henriette finds herself the target of a salacious nobleman with plans to ravish her at his midnight orgy.How's that for bodice-ripping melodrama? D. W. Griffith, who could still just about do no wrong back in 1921, produced yet another drama on an epic scale, little realising he was on the cusp of an irreversible decline that would see him unable to win work of any kind within a decade. There's little sign of his powers waning here as he delivers a big, ambitious spectacle that sets the intimate relationship of two half-sisters against the broad canvas of the French revolution. Judging from the inter-titles, Griffith's prime motivation was to highlight the similarities between the manipulation of the revolution by such men as Robespierre with the then-recent revolution in Russia and the dangers of such an event occurring in (gasp!) America. Of course, we all now know that D. needn't have worried himself, but his sincerity is certainly evident in the attention to detail, and the lavish sets and costumes of the film. The debauched midnight party is something to behold, and put me in mind of all those modern day films and videos in which young and edgy directors think they're doing something special by adding a kitsch glamour to the frocks and wigs of the noble women in their period films. The fact is Griffith was eighty years ahead of them.Sadly, as with most of Griffith's films when viewed today, there's a down-side due to the horrendous over-acting of some of his players. Lillian Gish is OK most of the time ? she always seemed to exercise an admirable restraint in her performances no matter who she was working under ? but her little sister Dorothy goes over the top a little too often. Even she is outplayed by Monte Blue, who plays Danton, in his big climactic scene; clutching one hand to his chest, he holds his other aloft as if tightly grasping a half-inflated balloon partially filled with water, and pulls wild faces as he begs the People's Court to have mercy on the poor little orphans. As a device to emphasise the drama of the moment it no doubt worked fine ninety years ago, but today such displays border on the comical.The pace of the film is surprisingly good considering its age and running time ? a bum-numbing 150 minutes ? and despite introducing the audience to a large cast of characters within the first ten or fifteen minutes, Griffith does a good job of not confusing his audience. Needless to say, the last reel, with the customary race against time to save the imperiled heroine, is a master-class in cross-cutting and still manages to get pulses racing even today.Despite the melodramatics from certain members of the cast, I found Orphans of the Storm a more accessible and enjoyable film than the likes of Birth of a Nation and Intolerance, which are held in higher esteem by most people. Griffith's touch seems much more assured than with BoaN, and the storyline is obviously less fragmented than it is in Intolerance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic silent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story takes place in France before and after the Revolution. Louise (Dorothy Gish) and Henriette (Lillian Gish) are brought up together but are not really sisters--Louise was left on church steps as a baby and Henriette's parents took her in. Both are orphaned when their parents die and Louise is struck blind. Henriette takes her to Paris in hope of finding a cure. There they are separated--Louise is forced to work with villainous beggars and Henriette falls in love with Chevalier de Vaudrey (drop dead handsome Joseph Schildkraut).The story is wildly implausible with some twists that had me smirking. It's also overlong and VERY melodramatic...but it still works. It was made on a large scale with beautiful settings, costumes and a cast of hundreds. D.W. Griffith did a wonderful job of directing--especially when the peasants revolt and overthrow the government. I usually hate historical movies but I loved this one! The cast overacts wildly (especially Monte Blue as Danton) except for Schildkraut who underplays--and it works. Throroughly engrossing and highly recommended. Also, on a personal note, my birthday is on July 14 which is Bastille Day and is recreated in this movie. I guess I have to like this! I saw the two hour version (this supposedly runs 2 1/2 hours) but didn't notice any gaps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly, with this film, Griffith had lost none of the flair and innovation that were to desert him later on in the 20s. The cross cutting worked amazingly at the climax of the film as Danton's troops race to rescue Henriette from the guillotine - I was on the edge of my seat.Lillian Gish is one of the greatest of actresses but it is interesting that when she was teamed with her sister, Dorothy was always given the more interesting part. In this film she plays the blind Louise and she is able to add some whimsical comedy bits to her role (polishing her shoes, stretching when she steps out of the carriage).By combining real historical figures and fictional characters in an exciting story of the French Revolution you feel you are watching "living history". The film takes some time to get into the main story but once it does - there is no stopping it!!!Baby Louise is left at a foundling home by people that have slain her father. Baby Henriette is being left by her father at the same home because poverty has left them destitute. When he sees Baby Louise on the snowy steps he is over come with remorse and takes them both home. They find a note in a locket with Louise's name and the words "Save her" - also a purse of gold coins.As the years pass Henriette's parents die of a fever that has also left Louise blind. On their way to Paris Henriette catches the eye of an evil nobleman who is determined to take her to a gala fete he is giving- even if it means kidnapping her - which he does!!! At the fete Henriette is frantic, calling for help which she gets from a kind nobleman Chevalier de Vaudrey (Joseph Schildkraut) who after a duel whisks her away to lodgings. Louise has been taken by an ugly old crone (the magnificent Lucille La Verne) who forces her to sing in the street ("you'll shiver better without that shawl") and when Louise refuses throws her into a rat infested cellar. Pierre (Frank Puglia) the youngest son who is taunted and bullied by his mother and older brother becomes Louise's protector. After a realistic fight in which he stands up to his family - he then helps Louise find her sister.Henriette and Vaudrey fall in love. She also helps Danton (Monte Blue) escape a rogue mob thus gaining an enemy in Robespierre (Sidney Herbert) whom she accidentally snubs. Vaudrey's mother, Countess De Linieres visits Henriette to ask her to give him up and when there finds that Louise is the daughter she was forced to give up. Henriette hears Louise singing in the street and calls to her but before they can be reunited she is arrested because she gave shelter to an aristocrat (Vaudrey).It all ends happily with a picnic in a rose garden (I, too, was glad that Pierre was saved and allowed to end his days happily under the care of Countess De Linieres).Fortunately the humour of Creighton Hale is kept to a minimum. The gala fete sequence is beautiful set with tableaux depicting famous paintings of the day (Fragonard's "The Swing").Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Revolution with D.W. Griffith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before and during the French Revolution, "Orphans of the Storm" Lillian and Dorothy Gish (as Henriette and Louise Girard) "suffer through tyranny and selfishness." During the Plague, the sisters lose their parents, and Dorothy goes blind; but, Lillian vows to care for her sister forever, declaring, "I'll see for you." And, she does, for awhile... When the sisters learn the city may hold a cure for Dorothy's blindness; they journey to Paris. There, Lillian is accosted by lusty aristocrat Morgan Wallace (as Marquis de Praille), but she rejects his advances. Mr. Wallace decides he must have Lillian, and arranges to have her abducted for an upcoming orgy; this leaves the blind Dorothy helpless, on the streets of Paris. She is rescued by street beggar Frank Puglia (as Pierre Frochard); unfortunately, his mother Lucille La Verne is a cruel hag, who abuses Dorothy. Joseph Schildkraut (as Chevalier de Vaudrey) falls for, and rescues Lillian, but finding her blind sister during the French Revolution proves to be quite le probl?me.D.W. Griffith and company are triumphant in this (yet another) breathtakingly beautiful film; the direction, photography, sets, and editing, and performances are superb. Lillian and Dorothy Gish are flawless as the "Orphans of the Storm" (this was the last Griffith/Gish cinematic team-up). The children who play the Gish sisters look and act amazingly like their adult counterparts. Mr. Schildkraut is quaint, yet charming, as Lillian's leading man; he is a romantic ideal, kissing her tears and stroking her face; after the revolution, he becomes quite strong. Dorothy's relationship with poor Puglia is an unexpected pleasure; Puglia is given, and gives, a surprisingly vivid characterization; as his mother, Ms. La Verne is deliciously wretched - you can almost see her tonsils as she cackles! The "Frochard" family (La Verne, Puglia and Sheldon Lewis) help give the film a Charles Dickens touch. Monte Blue is thunderous as revolutionary Danton, and Creighton Hale quirky as Picard. One of the characters gets it in the end. ********** Orphans of the Storm (12/28/21) D.W. Griffith ~ Lillian Gish, Dorothy Gish, Joseph Schildkraut, Frank Puglia</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Perry piano score - makes "OOTS" more than a Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece.I cannot help being a musician and silent film lover. Do not fault me for my views. :) The music that populates a movie is important - and it is important to me. When I first saw this movie, it was an accident of 1970s channel surfing - remember when we all had less than 10 choices.I walked in when the titles were going up and the piano sounds of William Perry played. And they played into my heart - and have never left there. Repeated viewings with this piano score has indelibly bored itself into my subconscious.Talk about the original score has intrigued me - and the use of the then contemporary music of Louis Moreau Gottschalk did also interest me - somewhat. Other versions I read about talk about the "nice" string score.I just downloaded the AMAZON version of this version and have come away woefully and irreversibly disappointed with the result.What did I hear? Instead of the Perry piano score, I heard some fin-de-siecle tinklings written by Gottschalk. It did not satisfy - it did not bring me into the story - it did not make me want to see this movie in its entirety. Not like another score that stole my heart.If any of you every have a chance to encounter the Willam Perry piano score for this movie - stop, look and listen. His music like NO OTHER evokes every emotion you could possibly imagine - - every nuance -- like no other score will ever do.The score has romantic melodies that one can recognize and return again and again during crucial moments - it has stirring, dramatic sounds - it has the Marseillaise (even though it is historically precedent of this time in the French Revolution) -- it has up and downs, crescendos and diminuendos, it has tender, heartfelt moments of beauty that I will remember for the rest of my life.Years ago, I was able to correspond with Mr. Perry. I had wanted the piano score - to buy. He said to me that none existed. I was astounded because what I thought was a carefully worked out score - was his own - on the SPOT compilation. He said that he had music of the several themes on his piano - and was always watching the action. He "cued" the movie and then played what he had planned - completely on the fly! I told him that the result to me was astounding and so memorable.This is what genius is. Unexplainable.Though I can recommend this movie without any reservation - because it is my favorite silent film - I cannot recommend any other musical score - than the piano score by William Perry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exceedingly melodramatic but amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By today's standards, ORPHANS IN THE STORM would be considered way too melodramatic or believable. There are just so many improbable situations and far from subtle moments. However, when you realize that back in the early 1920s this was not considered the case, you can appreciate the film so much more. Now this does not mean that every silent movie abounded with these elements, but they were far more acceptable then than they are now.Lillian Gish and her real-life sister, Dorothy, star as the two orphaned sisters. One, Dorothy, is actually the daughter of a Countess that was left on the steps of the church, but they are as devoted as any two sisters can be. Years later, the parents that raised them died from plague and Dorothy was left blinded. So, Lillian decides to take her sister to Paris to see if the doctors there can help restore her sight. Unfortunately for them both, they leave just as the French Revolution is about to erupt (talk about your lousy timing).On the way there, the girls are met by a slimy nobleman. He wants to rape Lillian and arranges for some thugs to kidnap her--leaving blind Dorothy to wander the streets at night! This is a pretty harrowing moment in the film and ultimately an evil lowlife finds her and takes her to live in her subterranean lair--figuring she can use Dorothy's blindness to beg for lots of coins. Dorothy doesn't want to but is tortured into compliance.In the meantime, Lillian arrives at a debaucherous party where the nobleman plans on raping her in front of his party guests. However, one nice guy (who turns out to be Dorothy's biological half-brother, a count) sees her plight and helps her escape. This earns the ire of the nobles but the guy is too fundamentally decent to allow this.A bit later, some more scumbag nobles (and most of them are in the movie) tries to have the Revolutionary leader, Danton, murdered. The injured man stumbles about the street as the assassins are following until he is found and rescued by Lillian.There is a budding romance between Lillian and the Count, but before it can progress any further, the Count is imprisoned for having the affront to want to marry a commoner and Lillian is thrown into a prison for "fallen women". I never heard of such a place and assume it was all made up for the movie! A short time later, the Revolution occurs and as a result the two lovers are released from prison. However, Dorothy is still missing and she only comes to light when Lillian and the Count are brought before the court for being monarchists! They are both sentenced to death as Dorothy is in the crowd and recognizes her sister and vice-versa. They are drug away to the guillotine several miles away as Dorothy screams and yells like a banshee. Minutes later, Danton arrives and realizes the miscarriage of justice has occurred. He makes an impassioned plea and gets the court to rescind the execution order. But, the carts with the two lovers is almost at the scaffold so Danton and his men race to rescue them at the very last second (Lillian already has her head inside the Guillotine when they arrive). The final scene shows everyone happy together. Huzzah! Despite being so melodramatic and having so many coincidences, the film's energy and drama keep you riveted. In other words, you KNOW it's over-the-top but because the movie is so well-crafted, you don't mind. Huge and impressive sets and costumes abound and the print from Kino Video was excellent. By the way, the apartment where Lillian lived in much of the movie is recognizable from several other films, including another D. W. Griffith film, BROKEN BLOSSUMS and I also recognized it from some of the FRANKENSTEIN movies.An interesting point about this film is that several times during the film, the title cards talk about the "evils of Bolshevism"--saying that the French Revolution was akin to the recent Russian Revolution. While there are definite parallels, this was more a statement about the times in which the film was made as opposed to 1789.A very important film historically and one of the last films of Griffith to make money. Unlike his evil BIRTH OF A NATION, this film deserved the accolades and success it attained.A final note: In the movies, Danton was rightfully shown as one of the decent leaders of the Revolution who fought for justice, not mass murder. However, they never mentioned that ultimately he was guillotined at the end of the era for questioning the direction of the revolutionary government, and in particular, Robespierre. Only a few weeks later, in reaction to this execution, Robespierre himself was executed and the Reign of Terror came to an end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film-making, but Reactionary Politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Griffith created this film three years after the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. It is apparent that he is expressing his antipathy towards that Revolution through this film. He does this explicitly by anachronistically calling the evil revolutionaries in the film "Bolsheviks". His characterization of Danton and Robespierre may perhaps be taken to be references to Lenin and Trotsky.The film certainly takes a clear, if ambiguous, political stance. It supports the peasants and workers of France against the aristocracy for the first hour and a half. Suddenly, as the revolution begins, the movie switches and paints the same peasants and workers in hysterical and savage tones in the last hour. This was the feeling of the ruling oligarchs in America at the time, the Czar and the aristocracy were terrible people in Russia, but the communists were worse. One interesting theme is that class does not matter and that people are good or bad regardless of what class they may belong to. This was a direct attack against the socialist ideal and practice of class-based parties.As far as being a story teller, Griffith is flamboyant and exuberant. He throws in fabulous sets, costumes, make-up, acting and dazzling shots. The editing is dynamic. As with many of Spielberg's movie, great cinematic technique overcomes a lackluster story ("Close Encounters of the Third Kind," for example)One can see some interesting psychological processes in Griffith from the movie. Notice that both Gish sisters are the objects of near rape in the film. Griffith has both the aristocracy and the revolutionists engaging in grand orgies. On one level we/Griffith are supposed to associate this type of hedonist behavior with anarchy, chaos and evil. On the other hand, these scenes contain some extraordinary beautiful and memorable shots. The line dances in the garden of the aristocracy and the swirling, mad dance of the revolutionaries through Parisian streets are quite extraordinary. Did Bergman get his ending for "The Seventh Seal" from this movie? I also noticed that the film contains about three seconds of female nudity with the right breast of a woman in a fountain of wine clearly exposed. Shocking! I believe the film was made the same year that D.H. Lawrence released "Women in Love." I also think it is interesting that both this movie and Chaplin's "City Lights" have a plot that turns on a young blind woman. It seems to be that the silent filmmakers may have thought of their lack of speech as a sort of handicap and thus the blind beautiful woman is a kind of metaphor for silent movies themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orphans of the Storm (1921) *** (out of 4) Griffith's epic telling of "The Two Orphans" play casts the Gish sisters in the two lead roles. Henriette (Lillian Gish) promises to protect her blind sister (Dorothy Gish) no matter what troubles the two might find. Their lives are turned upside down when they're separated at the start of the French Revolution and both near death but for different reasons. This was my 122nd film seen by Griffith and this is a highly flawed one but at the same time this contains many examples of the brilliance he contained. I'll be perfectly honest and say the film really wasn't working for me for the first hour because I had a hard time getting involved with the story, which seemed to be too epic for its own good. The simple story of the two sisters seemed to get drowned in all the supporting characters and to me the entire first hour was just a build up for what was to follow. Then, just before the second act, is when the film really picked up and ended up packing one hell of a punch. As I said, the start of the film is highly flawed but don't give up on the movie because it eventually picks up to something really great. As is the usual case, Griffith doesn't shy away from the melodrama and he doesn't shy away from getting his political views passed. He also doesn't shy away from his familiar formula of the poor being taken advantage of by the rich. The familiar subject of evil beggars are also on hand for another villain. As you can see there's a lot of familiar stuff going on here for the director but throughout my film going life I've never seen a director who could build up drama quicker than Griffith. This movie ends on another chase sequence where Lillian's character is about to be killed and her hero must race towards her before it's too late. The fast past editing and Griffith's knowledge of how to build drama makes this scene another of the most memorable from the silent era. Griffith's ability to build drama out of simple melodrama is also wonderfully shown at the end of act one when the Gish sisters are finally reunited but they can't reach one another. As with most Griffith epics this one here benefits from the amazing sets and hundreds, if not thousands, of extras. It's really amazing to watch these Griffith epics because we're never going to see anything like them again but we've never really seen anything come close to them at any point in film history. The mammoth amount of extras really put you in the center of everything that's going on and this is a major plus. Both Gish sisters also deliver very strong performances but I'd also add that Lillian has been much better in other movies. The supporting cast are also fairly strong but this film certainly belongs to Griffith. While the flaws keep this from being brilliant like The Birth of a Nation or Intolerance it's still mighty impressive for its age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The outfit of a razor abusively utilized by some like a barber</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Orphans of the storm" (1921) directed by D.W.Griffith is one of the most important movies ever made in silent cinema, which took the French revolution as target of nowhere unhappiest disgrace to explain maybe by contagion the near happening of another revolution, like the Bolshevik, less obviously maybe and its uncontrolled terror of state mixed with defense motivation. Griffith was here in this movie in the plenitude of his strength as interpreter of a kind of unfortunate conception about evolution of Europe history, taking an option for the goodness to the losers, even if their relatives were responsible directly or indirectly for the state of hungry and the consequent disorganization for the supplies in that society, with the people's savings lost and surviving only with unrest in countryside namely. The style of editing close shots alternatively with some long shots and even the so-called American shots - that was and still is in the half figure subject by his or her chest - as though the variety of compositions and also its shapes inside for a photography made by his fellow Billy Bitzer it seems - but he was out of the credits giving his name to another cinematographer - and the style of a dramatic issue for the romantic story below the tragic events, put this movie still now at high level for an utmost and better context, for another answer to the problem of an issue for the revolution. Independently of the destiny of human beings but as the result of contradictions made by development and its bad distribution between humankind and the people, in splitting classes or in hierarchies against the production of means of wealthy. The story in itself comparing the children in the storm as orphans in between the adventure of their abandoned souls, when it was implanted the system of the three powers after the first big crisis of legitimacy of the ancient regime, because the kingdom absolutism without possible issue at short term in France, surely is the better moment of this movie. Just while in it the characters rolling the eyes round the sockets, as typical touch of the silent drama since Griffith particularly. Surely with the dissolution of customs within these families linked with the propriety of the soil, the owner each own with its heraldic condition, symbolizing strength and the mercy for such a couple of young girls, in a storm for their poor lives at mercy of circumstances as guillotine and Danton's help. Personally which seems an exaggeration from the story, as told by an aristocratic version of a more liberal and perfunctory conception of reflux from the historical movement since Thiers. It is thinkable that the scene with the crowd in exciting mood, with the impression of lack of pity for the convicted on the convoy, it made the matter of the emotions from the viewer, as the execution on the place before the people, in such an exaggeration from the skilled editing of the scene of excited crowd, in an overwhelming way of specific kind of agitation and insensitivity for the mortal ceremony. The strength of its expressively beauty for which it was told also as the so-called salvation from the last minute, typically from the artistic conception of Griffith, whose weakness it was nonetheless understandable by the fault of its amplification, at the level of public service before the opinion of the incendiary times. Incompatible with the needs of a romantic contrast as essence of sweet melodrama, with such a photographic reconstitution - of such a range of details and tears of the victims - there of vengeance, as return for fixing the past with much more poetry.</fullReview>
