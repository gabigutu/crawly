		<fullReview>Beautiful orphan Henriette ( Theda Bara ) is kidnapped in Paris by the Marquis DE Presles ( Frank Goldsmith ), a libertine, leaving her blind and defenceless friend Louise ( Jean Sothern ) wandering the streets alone. While Mother Frochard ( Gertrude Berkeley ), a thief, forces Louise to beg for her food, Henriette is rescued by the Chevalier DE Vaudrey ( William E. Shay ), who loves her. The chevalier's mother, the Countess De Liniere ( Cecil Raleigh ), discovers that Louise is her long-lost daughter and resolves to find her. In the meantime, Mother Frochard's son, a hunchback named Pierre ( Herbert Brenon ), falls in love with Louise, and when his brother Jacques ( E. L. Fernandez ) cruelly beats the girl, Pierre kills him. Just then, the countess locates Louise, and after the girl regains her sight, she is joined with Pierre. The countess then gives her consent to the marriage of her son and Henriette.What a tragic loss this film is for early silent cinema. The Two Orphans was based on the 1872 French play Les deux orphelines, by Adolphe D'Ennery and Eugene Cormon. This film adaptation starred Theda Bara and was produced by the Fox Film Corporation, with some locations filmed in Québec, Canada. It would be remade again as Orphans of the Storm, starring Dorothy Gish and Lillian Gish, by D.W. Griffith.</fullReview>
