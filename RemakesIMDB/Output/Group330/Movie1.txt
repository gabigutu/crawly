		<shortDescription>Classic prehistoric hokum!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching 1970s TV screenings of 'One Million Years BC', the Connery Bond movies, the original 'Planet Of The Apes' and 'The Omega Man' made an enormous impact on my childhood that I don't think I've ever truly recovered from! Looking at it now as an adult you can see how laughably stupid it all is, but you can't help but still love it! The vision of Raquel Welch in her animal skin bikini nearly brought puberty on five years early for me. She's still a sight to see but the charms of Martine Beswick ('Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde', 'A Bullet For The General') are now more to my taste. She's sensational!The plot, such that it is, concerns Tumak (John Richardson of 'She'), one of the "rock people" who look like spaghetti western refugees and like nothing better than grunting, wearing fur, and beating the crap out of each other. Tumak falls out with his old man and brother, is banished and after some aimless wandering around avoiding dinosaurs (and in one surreal moment a giant tarantula!), he stumbles across the hitherto unknown "shell people". They are blonde surfer types who introduce him to such innovations as improved spears, hot water, painting, crying and feminism. And also to the babelicious Loana (Welch) who takes a shine to him. Tumak still has "attitude problems" and ends up getting banished from their tribe too, but with Loana and a new and improved spear what more can the guy want? Of course he heads straight back to his homies and yes, there's trouble ahead including fraternal friction, a jealous ex (Nupondi, the stunning Beswick), lots of Harryhausen dinosaurs, and exploding volcanos. Does mindless entertainment get any better than this? Hardly ever. Add a cool score from Mario Nascimbene and what you have is a classic piece of unforgettably trashy exploitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, having seen many movies about the Stone Age, we should know that the men were all buff dudes, and the women were all buxom babes. That's certainly the case here. Obviously, no part of "One Million Years B.C." really makes sense - humans and dinosaurs never existed contemporaneously - but that doesn't matter. The movie was intended as entertainment, and it's very enjoyable. Maybe that's just because we get to see Raquel Welch in a bikini, but the dinosaurs are also pretty cool. The movie makes us nostalgic for the era, even though we never experienced it.So, it's brain candy to the max, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. You're sure to like it, if only for the thought of Raquel Welch dressed like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's my childhood formative movie memory.It's the glorious Raquel running about in a fur bikini. Those legs, that face.It's a ten. and so's the movie.Watched it again, now some forty-odd years on and, sentimentality aside, it still remains curiously engrossing. Definitely a strange fish, this slice of dinosaur hokum endures in an intangible way and really, in all honesty, I hope never to put my finger on exactly why.Just wallow in it's matinée-marvel and it's appeal on many levels, from youthful monster-glee to, ahem, mature appreciation of the 'cast'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hammer, Harryhausen and Dinos, A Great Combination!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can fans of sci-fi/fantasy not enjoy this 1966 effort from Hammer Studios? You have the wonderful effects of the master, Ray Harryhausen and a decent enough story, oh and dinos! The Region 2 DVD is definitely the disc to get, as it is the complete version of the film and it has a couple of nice interviews with Raquel Welch and Ray Harryhausen. I love what Harryhausen had to say about complaints about inaccuracy with putting man and dinos together on the screen. It's not meant to be a scientific story, it's meant to entertain and entertain it does! Watch as Tumak (of the Rock People) and Loana (of the Shell People) forge a shaky relationship and possibly bring their two tribes of people together. Along the way they battle a huge sea turtle, Allosaurus, Pteradon and other wild beasties of the day. If you love dinos and films meant to be nothing more than fun entertainment, chances are, you'll enjoy this Hammer Studios effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caveman allegory with Raquel Welch, John Richardson, and some really great Ray Harryhausen dinosaurs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie came out in 1967, a year before 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY . . . but they've always been related in my mind. Maybe it was just the time, maybe you had to be there . . . but back in the late 60's there weren't many big "science fiction" productions . . . or in this case sweeping epics about the past or the future.One thing the two films share is a lack of dialog . . . in both cases the director's sit back and the actions tell the story. As well both films are happy to display their special effects moments as set pieces . . . "hey, we spent a lot of money on this?!"Don Chaffey's long cuts and static landscape shots at the beginning of the film are very much like Kubrick's shots of Africa at the start of 2001 . . . and both films are literal and allegorical treatments of evolution as a theme.Of course, that went with the times. The late 60's were a point where the evolution of society was a focal point of culture in general . . . both the Star Child and Miss Welch in her iconic bearskin bikini became the late 60's poster children for mankind's evolution.Interestingly, though Ray Harryhausen did the special effects for ONE MILLION YEARS BC, the film isn't at all like a Harryhausen film, nor is it much like the films of it's production company Hammer Films (except perhaps for the two sequels WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH, and CREATURES THE WORLD FORGOT.)Hammer - with Harryhausen's involvement - had been interested in remaking KING KONG, but in the late 1960's RKO's rights to the Kong character were shared among Universal and Toho (KING KONG VS GODZILLA) and Rankin- Bass (the cartoon Kong which served as a basis for the Toho film KING KONG ESCAPES.) In fact, right at the time that Hammer would have been inquiring, Toho would have been working on preproduction of a film in which King Kong met Mothra and battled a giant shrimp (Ebirah) in the South Seas. (That film mutated, Godzilla replaced KING KONG, and it became GODZILLA VS EBIRAH aka GODZILLA VS THE SEA MONSTER.)So Hammer moved on to a remake of the Hal Roach 1(no YEARS) MILLION BC.With it's lingering shots of vast landscapes, and the very Italian score by Mario Nascembe(with the percussion and use of a chorus it could almost be Ennio Morricone . . .), the film is pretty much unique in Hammer's oeuvre . . . and with it's focus on sex (well, possession at least) and violence in a harsh landscape of sharp desert light or fire lit darkness, it's pretty unique as a Harryhausen picture too.Opinions about the film really depend on the point-of-view you adopt (again like 2001). Those who like their acting to be dialog driven complain about the acting, but actually everyone puts in a good performance here and I have no doubt that beautiful Napondi (Martine Beswicke) wouldn't think twice about impaling Luana (Raquel Welch) with that antelope horn she wields.It's been speculated that the schedule was tough for Harryhausen, resulting in a scene with a photo-optically enlarged Iguana and Tarantula . . . although Harryhausen says the producers wanted those sequences added. (If you look closely you'll see a giant cricket in the scene with the Tarantula, probably the first giant cricket until 2005's KING KONG with it's herd of killer wetas, and doubtlessly in their to excite the Tarantual into a "performance.) The fact that publicity photos show a battle between cavemen and a brontosaurus that never happens in the film probably backs up the story that the schedule was too short for Harryhausen.Nevertheless, the stop motion on view is excellent . . . except for the Brontosaurus who looks about the size of Godzilla. The pacing and animation in the battle with the giant turtle Archelon is excellent, and most people just accept the turtle as real. The Allosaurus attack . . .possibly one of Harryhausen's most exciting sequences ever . . . is terrific. In many ways it holds up even today as a model of the integration of live action and special effects The classic Triceratops battle is interesting for utilizing a Ceratosaurus instead of Tyrannosaurus . . . but with our two heroes in the classic "trapped in a cave" position it's a bit static. However the Pterodactyl scenes, and the big volcano and earthquake finish are pretty riveting.All in all, ONE MILLION YEARS BC is still a lot of fun if your in the right mood. Again, like 2001, the message seems to be that we can evolve and get better . . . but ultimately just as the monolith transforming Dave makes the standoff between Russians and Americans on the moon a non-issue, the battle between the Rock and the Sand tribe becomes . . . well . . . pretty irrelevant when the forces of nature - Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes - make mankind's aspirations tiny in comparison. The film has been restored twice in the last decade, and the recent 20th Century Fox DVD has comparisons of the work done (the original negative was lost). The European version clocks in at 100 minutes . . . and most people say that it is an improvement, with more character scenes and a different order of sequences at the beginning of the film. The Fox version is the North American release version that is 91 minutes long. Spanish and English trailers on the DVD seem to be identical, with the narrator simply translated into Spanish.Ultimately, any dinosaur or monster fan, fan of Ray Harryhausen's work, or fan of "Hammer glamor" is going to want to own this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Raquel Welch's later, more solid acting performances will never erase our memories of this dinosaur-epic wherein she runs around in full cavegirl regalia. Then again, she may not want them to. Time has been surprisingly kind to this reworking of 1940's "One Million B.C." The special effects are very good, the wilds of prehistoric nature are often excitingly, colorfully captured, and handsome John Richardson is charismatic as a caveman who, along with Welch, ditches his tribe to set out on a personal journey. Yes, it's Raquel in a fur-bikini that most people will remember, but a good time is had by all. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is everything a prehistoric adventure should be. Forget the fact that dinosaurs and man did not co-exist...this is just as much a fantasy as "Jason and the Argonauts" or "Star Wars".The world of "One Million Years B.C." is insanely brutal, where man is the weakest creature in a harsh landscape of volcanoes and giant monsters. The Rock People have lives that are "nasty, brutish and short", where only the strongest survive. They are dominated by the rugged chief Akoba, whose two sons Tumak and Sakana are in a constant battle to see who will gain his favor. Sakana gains the upper hand and Tumak is banished into the wastelands. After dodging monsters, he finally arrives at the seaside domain of the Shell People, who are more cultured and civilized. He captures the eye of the beautiful Loana and the two have a non-stop series of adventures.The narrative is direct and primitive, befitting the primeval setting. John Richardson is quite good as Tumak...he is decent but still has a lot of barbarism in him. As for young Raquel Welch, not even the special effects of Ray Harryhausen could outshine her incredible beauty in this film. Even in our own time, gorgeous babes like these are rare...they would be totally impossible in the prehistoric world. The stunning Raquel is pure eye candy and succeeds better in this regard than any other actress in film history. Especially noteworthy is her cat-fight with sultry Martine Beswick, no slouch in the looks department herself.Ray Harryhausen outdoes himself again with brilliant stop motion dinosaurs. Look at the realistic movements of these creatures, which have not been surpassed by CGI. The ravenous Allosaurus who duels with Tumak is a particular stand-out, but the battling Triceratops and Ceratosaur are also pretty cool. The movie also features the more standard giant lizard dressed up and made huge, but even this scene is better than most of its ilk. An eerie scene featuring ape-men and some colossal earthquake and erupting volcanoes round out an exciting picture.Don't look for anything really deep in this one. Just expect primitive action with plenty of monsters, battling cavemen and the awesome Raquel Welch. This movie does everything it sets out to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ray Harryhausens work is unparalleled and is once again to be admired in this film. I was intrigued that the first thing hygiene wise that humans (at least women) must have come up with was shaving. The females in this movie are all clean shaven in places where women traditionally have kept themselves clean shaven. The men obviously weren't going to learn this art until some time later. Nonetheless this motion picture is one of those that never gets tired with repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take off your cultural blinders...the one you put on when you watch a "trashy" movie...and think about what you are actually experiencing as you watch this movie. Is it merely a "trash" entertainment? To be sure, Raquel Welch in her furkini, the now quaint quality of the Harryhausen effects, the girl fight between Raquel and Martine Beswick, all provide the frisson of "trash" delight. But this movie is much more than that, a tour de force of imagination, and a heartbreaking work of staggering genius. The vision of man adrift in a hostile universe, at odds with his fellow creatures, his own untamed emotions, and the apocalyptic earth itself, is haunting and beautiful. Our only hope is Raquel, who offers a transcendent vision of peace and love--without uttering a word.Special kudos to the music. Where the special effects strain against their limits, as in the terrifying pterodactyl attack and the final upheaval, the music carries home the emotion. I am reminded of Schopenhauer: "The internal relation that music has to the true nature of all things can also explain the fact that, when music suitable to any scene, action, event, or environment is played, it seems to disclose to us its utmost secret meaning and appears to be the most accurate and distinct commentary on it." In a film where words matter so little, the music is especially crucial. As you watch the pterodactyl snatch Raquel and carry her off to feed its young while the other humans watch in helpless dismay, listen to the music, and think about the "utmost secret meaning" of what you are witnessing. This is an artistic moment of astounding ambition, and there are many such moments throughout this sustained meditation on man and the universe.A few years later, the same team made Creatures the World Forgot, a more "realistic" look at prehistoric survival sans dinosaurs, with a Cain and Abel story that is riveting...and my god, the cave people are hot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stone Age Wonder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those looking for films that deal realistically with prehistory need to look elsewhere. One Million Years BC is a fantasy movie. The creators of this film borrowed creatures and cultural elements willy-nilly from any epoch in earth's history that served their purpose, made up a few of their own elements, tossed them into a cooking pot, stirred, simmered and added seasoning. The final result is an impressive dish. In my opinion, it is the best caveman film ever made.The stark, hostile landscape, the sweeping and lonely vistas, the haunting music punctuated with tribal rattle sounds, combine to create an amazing prehistoric setting. This is a dark and violent setting. Mankind is portrayed as struggling to survive in a world of bloody fangs and destructive elemental powers. You feel this savage primeval world come alive as you watch the movie. Can humanity emerge from such a savage and hostile world? Two cultures are presented, a cave dwelling, dark-haired, violent and bloodthirsty Rock Tribe, and the more settled, blond-haired, and sophisticated Shell Tribe. Both cultures are flawed and seem to be slowly dying out. Two characters, Tumac from the Rock Tribe, and Luana from the Shell Tribe come together in a romance so powerful it will catalyze the transformation of both cultures. A simple series of grunts and monosyllabic sounds are the only dialog in the movie. Both of the tribes are well presented, and offer interesting contrasts in terms of how they solve problems, and how they live in the world.The dinosaurs are fabulous. Not only in how they look, but in what they do. Several scenes stand out as exceptional uses of monsters in storytelling. The attack on Shell village by the young allosaurus is vivid, terrifying and powerful. Tumac fights the allosaurus and affirms his humanity by saving a young child. The pteronodon swooping down on the lakeshore and carrying off Luana (seemingly to feed her to its young) is a cruel and haunting scene. The battle between ceratosaurus and triceratops is a brilliantly choreographed dinosaur fight...I could go on and on.The movie is unrelenting in presenting us with a brutal and uncompromising primordial world. The warthog hunt, the goat hunt, the cat-fight, the men-apes, Tumac learning to laugh - these scenes show us plenty of raw, untamed emotions, and they serve to deepen and embellish both character and setting. And what savage characters! Rachel Welch is a movie poster icon because of this movie. Sure she looks great, but along the way she convincingly portrays a strong and courageous cavewoman. And John Richardson is excellent as Tumac - brutal, smart, adaptable, and a true hero because he fights for what is human even as he discovers what being human is all about. The secondary characters are all excellent and convincing.From start to finish, this movie delivers. A movie like One Million Years BC may not appeal to everyone. But it is the pinnacle of fabulous Stone Age drama. It rocks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorful story set in prehistoric world with dinosaurs and a gorgeous Raquel Welch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This deals about the struggle of primitive cavemen and their battle against prehistoric monsters and other creatures . It's a remake of the 1940 movie by Hal Roach with Victor Mature , Carole Landis and Lon Chaney Jr . It starts with a prologue that tells you all you want to know about this "brutal world¨. This is a story of a long , long ago when the world was just beginning. A young world , a world early in the morning of time . A hard , unfriendly world with creatures that sit and wait , creatures that must kill to live. And man , superior to the creatures only in his cunning . There aren't many men , a few tribes scattered across the wilderness . Never venturing far , unaware that other tribes exist even , too busy with their own lives to be curious . Too frightened of the unknown to wander . Their laws are simple , the strong take everything . A chief named Akoba (Robert Brown) is leader of the Rock tribe . And his sons are named Tumak(John Richardson) and Sakana (Percy Herbert) from the tribe of the Brunettes. There is no love between them and confrontation emerges . Tumak meets a cave woman (Raquel Welch) from the tribe of the Blondes , both of whom trying to make a life for themselves and take on rival clan , subhuman, cannibalistic tribes and volcanoes on its ending in an earth-splitting volcanic eruption .This classic Hammer -in its 100th movie- and Seven Arts production is a stupendous story of adventure , thrills and romance. The tale provides sweeping and exciting entertainment . The action scenes blend creatures and humans more seamlessly than ever before in cinema and has some nice battles between prehistoric animals . Surviving Brontosaurs, Triceratops, Dinosaurs ,Alosaurs, Pterodactyls are the true stars , rise to the occasion to amuse in an otherwise slow movie. The fantastic beasts look superb and are stunningly made by expert craftsmen as the spectacular special effects include dinosaurs , fighting between Tiranosaurius Rex and Triceratops , a giant turtle ,along with some superimposed iguanas, all of them are made by technician-artist Ray Harryhausen. As warns the movie the characters and incidents portrayed and the names used herein are fictitious and any similarity to the names character or history of any person is entirely accidental and unintentional . Produced and written by Michael Carreras adapted from an original screenplay by George Baker . Wonderful cinematography in glimmer color DeLuxe by Wilkie Cooper filmed on location in Lanzarote , Island Canarias (Spain) . Exciting music and special musical effects composed by Mario Nascimbene with usual musical supervisor Philip Martell ; furthermore rare sounds by Roy Baker . The motion picture is professionally directed by Don Chaffey . Rating : Good and unforgettable for famous fur-trimmed bikini clad that you'll always remember .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all-time favorite movies. It was a '10' when I saw it first in '66 and it still rates a '10' today only because I can't give Raquel Welch 100 out of 10. There simply are not enough adjectives in the English language to describe the jaw-dropping beauty of Raquel Welch, she is the image of female symmetrical perfection. In my opinion, the most beautiful woman to appear in movies or TV, ever, then or since, no contest. I could rave about Ms. Welch all day, even though she was not what you would call a 'great' actress, she imprinted the formative years of my youth like no other. This movie is a bit of schlock from Hammer Films, has a thread-bare story line, no dialogue other than caveman grunts and groans, but amazingly, they pull it off quite well! It is exciting and brutally violent, and manages to convey the caveman struggle for survival quite well. Ray Harryhausen shows why he was the master of stop-motion animation with excellent dinosaur sequences throughout - no such thing as CGI back in '66, yet the dinosaurs hold up pretty good even by today's Jurassic Park standards. I saw 2001 when it came out, saw Planet of the Apes, and I would rather watch this movie any day because it appeals to the adolescent in me. Yes, overall it's kind of a hokey B-movie, but to me it will always be a masterpiece. And dear lord and sonny Jesus is Raquel Welch a beauty or what?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, don't go to see this film if you are of the serious, straight-laced, humourless kind. If you are the sort likely to complain about human not co-existing with dinosaurs, this is not your kind of film. This is the sort of film best enjoyed leaving your brain behind - the plot is stupid, the acting practically non-existent, but hey, what an enjoyable romp it is. Raquel Welch is simply unsurpassed as a cave-woman in her best caveman-designed swimsuit. And whatever that may be said about it, the animation of the dinosaurs still looks good. So go gasp at the giant turtle, be amazed at the battle between the dinosaurs, cheer at the cat-fight between the cave-women. Have a fun time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harryhausen at his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One million years b.c. It really is probably the best movie I have seen in which all of the dialogue is undecipherable(hope I spelled that word right.) It starts off with a tribe of cavemen known as the rock tribe. They are pretty brutal and ruthless. During a fight over food one of the clan, Tumak, is kicked out of the tribe. Tumak goes off on a stretch walk and eventually passes out on the beach. He is rescued by another tribe known as the shell tribe. The shell tribe I like a lot better because they are more civilized and peaceful, not to mention many of their women are really hot. Tumak makes friends with the hottest female of the group, Luanna. He then proves his worth by saving the tribe from an Allosaurus. But Tumak gets in a scuffle with another member of the tribe and kills him accidentally. Tumak is forced to leave and luckily for him Luanna goes with him. Soon Tumak runs into his old tribe again.The story really is not hard to follow. It is your basic guy looking for belonging after being kicked out of one caveman tribe, joins another tribe and then must leave again. SOmetimes you can tell what the characters in this film are trying to say to each other, but it is caveman talk.Ray Harryhausen is at his best in this film. THe dinosaurs and other creatures he puts in look amazing. True the first creature to show up is a giant iguana that is just a normal iguana made to look bigger. I think they did this to pay respect to the original 1000000 years b.c. But later you get to see a giant turtle, pteranadon, brontosaurus, and an epic battle between a ceratosaurus and a triceratops. My favorite dinosaur was always the Allosaurus so I loved the scene where the Allosaurus attacked the shell tribe. That is easily the best part of the entire film. Harryhausen was a great special effects artist. There are very few who were as good at the trade as he was.Other things I enjoyed watching belonged to Raquel Welch. She is stunningly beautiful and a major reason that this film has endured and the picture of her in the fur bikini is so famous.So this is a very good film, better than its sequel "When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth". THe dinosaurs, women, and story are great. The caveman language makes it hard at times to understand what is going on but I give the director credit for being creative. Go and see this movie, it is entertaining in many ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, let's get this out of the way right now. Yes, Raquel Welch is in a fur bikini, and yes, she is gorgeous in it. That being said, I remember watching this and other Harryhausen classics on a tape my dad copied from TNT's late night monster fest. Obviously it isn't accurate, but it is a great movie. For a movie without real dialog, the actors do a good job portraying their characters. However, the best part of the movie (including Miss Welch) are the creatures. Other than a few real life things blown up in size, they are brilliant. Harryhausen just knows how to make creatures. They react to things, they are more than just rampaging beasts. Also, his creations always have great sounds. The all time greatest is when the baby Allosaurus is impaled. It's death scream is the most memorable noise I've ever heard from a movie monster. Overall, you can't go wrong. You'll come for the girls, but the dinosaurs are worth checking out as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One Million Years B.C." is arguably the best caveman movie ever made, and one of the best films in special effects artist Ray Harryhausen's oeuvres. It is one of the few examples of the remake surpassing the original. Mr. Harryhausen's stop-motion dinosaurs are the highlight and real star of the film (yes, more so than Ms. Welch's famous bosom), and are a big aesthetic improvement over the original's (somewhat notorious) usage of real animals with glued-on frills and horns. The allosaurus raid on the Shell People's village and the abduction of Loana by the pteranodon are justifiably considered as high-water marks in the history of palaeo-cinema. And there are other aspects of the production which are also outstanding. The filmmakers made excellent use of their locations to create a forbidding, bleak, but also beautiful primordial world - a perfect backdrop for a story that heavily features human savagery and brutality. Welch and co-star John Richardson manage to emote effectively within the context of their proto-verbal characters, and generate some real screen chemistry. *SPOILER* The climactic volcanic eruption is quite well done - frighteningly intense, in fact; and the aftermath, in which the survivors, including members from both of the warring tribes, band together as they begin a trek to find a more congenial place for habitation, packs an emotional punch as well.And then there are those dinosaurs ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the concept of this movie may be interesting, if it wasn't for Raquel Welch's curvy figure in a fluffy bikini and Ray Harryhausen's AWESOME special effects, then most people probably wouldn't see much appealing about this movie. Harryhausen's dinosaurs look fabulous, it puts Jurassic Park and all those other GCI beasts to shame! This is how I want my monsters to be in films, animated via stop-motion. Imagine what LOTR would've looked like if Peter Jackson had used a stop-motion puppet instead of CGI for the Cave Troll! (PJ is a big Harryhausen fan too...)Alas, for me this isn't the greatest work Harryhausen has done (that has to go to 'Jason and the Argonaughts') but it's still canny viewing. The plot is (at times) very slow, so unless you actually care about the war between the shell/rock people, you'll probably get bored quickly...aaaawwgghhh - but that CGI pherodyctal (flying dino-bird) looked fab! PJ should've used that in LOTR for the Fell Beasts!!Well, it's still great viewing, rent the DVD, get some popcorn...and enjoy the view!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ray Harryhausen at his very best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Million Years B.C. is the best Ray Harryhausen movie and one of the best dinosaur movies ever made. Ray's dinosaurs are magnificent. He didn't animate the giant lizard or giant spider though, but these still look impressive.The other star of this movie is of course Raquel Welch. She looks well groomed, despite being in prehistoric times. One of the best scenes of the movie is where she gets picked up by a Pteranodon, as a potential meal for its young. At least she survives. This movie also has a great, thunderous score throughout and is atmospheric.This is the best of Hammer's prehistoric adventures and is a must for all dinosaur movie lovers.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little ditty 'bout Tumak and Loana...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prehistoric hokum from Hammer about a brown-haired caveman named Tumak (John Richardson) and a blonde cavewoman named Loana (Raquel Welch) falling in love despite their differences. We learn a lot about the politics and relationships of primitive man, as well as learn all there is to know about dinosaurs. And it's 100% true! Screw naysaying scientist types. This is a remake of the 1940 Hal Roach film One Million B.C., which starred Victor Mature and Carole Landis. I'm one of that movie's few fans. Most people bash it pretty hard. This Hammer version is more famous than the earlier one, due almost entirely to lovely Raquel Welch. Like the earlier film, this one gets little respect. Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion effects are great. The film has a very attractive look, with nice cinematography and good location shooting at the Canary Islands. Of course, one can't praise the aesthetics of this movie without talking about the beautiful women in their fur bikinis, chief among them Raquel Welch. Even if the movie were just 90 minutes of her in that bikini, that would be enough to warrant recommending it. She's boobtacular! There's definitely some camp appeal to this flick. After all, it's a caveman movie where they communicate mostly through grunts and noises, with the occasional jib jab word thrown in. I think it's a fun time-passer. Not a lot else to say about it. It's babes in bikinis and bearded bozos fighting dinos. Anybody who goes into this expecting something deeper than a puddle deserves to be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"People did not live in the days of the dinosaurs. You must realise that the picture is being made for entertainment, not for professors?. I think one has to accept that licence with an 'entertainment picture', because it's not supposed to be a documentary," declared Ray Harryhausen. Before this film, dinosaurs in movies were created by shooting lizards in close-up, with extra body-bits glued onto them to create the desired effect. Here, Harryhausen uses his considerable talent as a stop-motion animator to create numerous monsters of the past, including an allosaurus, brontosaurus, ceratosaurus, triceratops and pterodactyl.One Million Years B.C follows the adventures of a caveman named Tumak (John Richardson). The son of a tribe leader, he is banished from his tribe following a fight with his father over a piece of meat. He wanders alone into the wilderness and encounters various strange creatures, before eventually stumbling across a more advanced tribe who have developed things like music, painting, jewellery-making and agriculture. He is welcomed by these new people and lives among them, quickly catching the eye of a cavegirl named Loana (Raquel Welch). Meanwhile back at Tumak's birth tribe, his father is overthrown as leader by the ruthless Sakana (Percy Herbert), Tumak's treacherous brother. Tumak is forced to leave his new tribe after attempting to steal a spear, and is joined on his wanderings by Loana (who has fallen in love with him). They have various adventures before eventually making it back to Tumak's native home. Upon discovering what has happened during his absence, Tumak challenges his brother for leadership of the tribe. The final battle is interrupted by a massive volcanic eruption which wipes out many of the people in its path.The film is the best of the series, helped along by a solid performance from Richardson as the adventurous caveman and Harryhausen's sterling work in the effects department. Welch is on hand to provide the 'eye- candy' while Martine Beswick provides extra sex appeal as an animalistic girl from Tumak's tribe. Also worthy of note is the score by Mario Nascimbene, a beautiful blend of siren-like wailing and clashing cymbals, reminiscent of the operatic music of the spaghetti westerns. It's probably the best score of the entire prehistoric series. On a more negative note, One Million Years B.C. is the ugliest of the films at a photographic level. Despite promising Canary Islands locations, there is something unattractive about the cinematography and the film's poor use of colour. The story structure also becomes a little wearisome towards the end; an endless cycle of walking around ? dinosaur attack ? walking around ? dinosaur attack ? walking around ? dinosaur attack. Overall, though, this is a good film with enough going for it to make its weaknesses forgivable. Is it the best film Hammer made? No? but it is a lot of fun, and Harryhausen's contributions alone make it worthwhile. We all know it's bogus as history and repetitive as a story, but One Million Years B.C. works well as what it was intended - that is: wild, sexy, adventure-filled entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When dinosaurs attack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about this movie is Raquel Welch in a Stone Age bikini. The next best thing about this movie is Ray Harryhausen's special effects work, which is impressive while still containing the charm of stop-motion animation.Pressed to name a third thing, I'd probably say veteran Bond girl Martine Beswick in a Stone Age bikini.Those are the only things.This is a pretty silly caveman flick, which contrasts the lifestyles of the savage brown-haired cavepeople with the peaceful, harmonious blond-haired cavepeople. All the while the cavemen and cavewomen are subjected to unprovoked attacks by dinosaurs and other giant reptiles.Aside from some opening narration, the only dialogue is in caveman-speak, but the story is not difficult to follow. There's not a lot of depth here. Just hairy men, sexy women, and some dinosaurs.Harryhausen's work effectively blends stop-motion creatures with live-action footage to bring the impossible battles of man vs. dinosaur to life on-screen. The impressive parts are when the people interact with the creatures (throwing spears at them or hitting them with rocks). Blurring the lines of what was live action and what was animation was what Harryhausen did best.Raquel Welch is the homecoming queen of the blonde cavepeople, with Martine Beswick as the sexiest member of the vicious brunette tribe. Yes, there's a cat fight. Welch and her bronzed bod steal the show, cementing her legacy as a sex symbol in this iconic role. For a cavewoman, she sure had a good makeup team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cavewomen were stunning apparently.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that newcomers to Hammer need to appreciate is that many of their films are low-budget, and kitsch, and One Million Years B.C scores high on the cheese-factor even by Hammer's yardstick. The film's tagline is laughably off-target ? "This is the way it was!" ? I am almost positive cavewomen didn't have immaculately coiffured hair, push-up loincloth bras, eyeliner, and waxed legs, while their primitive menfolk did battle with dinosaurs that scientifically speaking died out many millions of years earlier. Needless to say, a willing suspension of disbelief is a prerequisite to enjoyment of this movie.Inappropriate marketing aside, if you can get past these hurdles, B.C is an entertaining, if mindless, action movie, and one which is elevated to ongoing cult status thanks to 2 main factors - Raquel Welch and Ray Harryhausen.Even if you have never heard of this film, chances are at some point you have been exposed to "that picture". Raquel Welch is THE reason this film's cult following is 95% male, and seeing her in her loincloth bikini is quite honestly a sight to behold. Fleeing from giant dinosaurs, and fighting with cavewomen, this role in a low-budget British monster movie is the one that put her on the map and created one of the greatest sex symbols ever to light up the silver screen.Only just losing out to Raquel Welch as the star of the show, are the creatures themselves. Animated by the inimitable, legendary Ray Harryhausen (as far as I know the only special effects guru to become a household name in his own right) the creatures are brilliantly realised, and integrated seamlessly with the live-action elements. Aside from Jason and the Argonauts, and Clash of the Titans, this is some of his best work ? the Allosaur attack on the shell-people's village being a real technical accomplishment and highlight of the film. The results are slightly marred though by the the integration of real animals, shot and superimposed to look massive. An early attack from a giant, half-asleep looking iguana is hardly menacing, nor is a (thankfully very brief) appearance by a gigantic tarantula that is trying to eat an equally gigantic cricket. These negative moments are forgotten though when Harryhausen's flawless stop-motion takes center stage, bringing us the iconic triceratops fight amongst other great set-pieces.Thanks to the jaw-dropping "talents" of Raquel Welch, the rest of the cast are pretty expendable. Even main star John Richardson's character of Tumak could have been played by a monkey in a spacesuit when Welch was on screen, no-one would have noticed. Everyone plays as well as they need to though, given the grunt-riddled, running-away-from-an-imaginary-monster screenplay. The storyline is simplistic, (primitive man learns tolerance and civility) and is basically a thinly veiled cover for a series of awesome action set-pieces and monster vs human battle sequences, and a vehicle for the scantily clad Raquel Welch to run around getting sweaty and dirty, which can only be considered a bonus.In summary, leave your brain at the door and you are likely to have a great time. This is a cult classic; a camp, entertaining showcase for Harryhausen's skills, and while shallow, has enough action and sex-appeal to please the average testosterone-laden viewer. Worth watching for Raquel Welch's magnetic presence alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No dinos in caveman days ---???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the way everyone who reviews this movie feels compelled to point out the fact that there were no dinos in the caveman era, as if they were expecting a pat on the head and a gold star from their science teachers (These are presumably the same geniuses who can't help patting themselves on the backs because they figured out that the giant shrews in KILLER SHREWS are dogs in suits). I want to establish an award, which I would like to call either the DUH! or the NIETSNIE, to be given once a year to the bonehead who makes the most stunningly obvious observation under the impression that he's being clever as all hell (maybe I should name it after my own dad, who trashed the old FLYING NUN TV series on the grounds that nuns with big hats are not capable of independent flight, as if no one before him had ever realized that). Now here's the big irony that these MENSA candidates seem to overlook: in all of the reviews I've read of KING KONG. THE LOST WORLD, LOST CONTINENT, etc., one criticism that I've never seen leveled at these movies is that dinosaurs don't live in modern times. Dinosaurs living in modern times is apparently acceptable whereas dinosaurs existing 100,000 years ago is just ridiculous! So what do they think, that dinosaurs all went extinct 65,000,000 years ago then magically popped up again around 1912? Think about it, people!Oh, about the movie itself? I find it kind of a bore whenever the Harryhausen monsters aren't on screen. Raquel Welch and Martine Beswick help make up for it a little but not that much. The scene where the allosaurus attacks the camp of the Shell People is terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Million Years B.C.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After working on Jason and the Argonauts together, director Don Chaffey and Ray Harryhausen re-teamed yet again for this film. Jason and the Argonauts was actually not that big of a success during it's initial theatrical run, and by the mid sixties these kinds of films were even less "in style". So, not surprisingly, Raquel and her glorious frame was the center of attention in all it's promotion and it paid off. Martine Beswick is actually just as easy on the eyes in this, in my opinion, but nevertheless went on to having a mere cult following, while Welch became one of the biggest sex symbols of all time. Harryhausen's dinosaur work in this is very impressive. The only lame choice was using real regular sized lizards in some scenes, blown up to look big. They should of went with stop motion model work throughout the whole thing. The film overall is weak story wise, but the presence of Raquel and Ray's effects boost my rating to a 6, where otherwise it would of gotten a 3 or 4 without them. All the characters sporting 60's hair styles adds to the camp factor.This review pertains to the Region 1 91 minute DVD released in 2003. There's a 100 minute UK cut, but as shown in the restoration comparison featurette, Fox was mainly interested in using the highest quality print, not the longest print.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a well-done and underrated remake with fantastic Ray Harryhausen creatures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both "One Million B.C." (1940), and this film, a remake, "One Million Years B.C." (1966) are films that are half-cherished and half-despised. They are what are classified as camp classics and I agree that both of them are exactly like that. They are both about equal in entertainment quality, but they must not be taken too seriously. Like I've stated in my review of the original "One Million B.C.", dinosaurs and caveman did not live in the same time period. They never knew of each other. But "One Million Years B.C." is a fantasy movie. It takes place in an imaginary world. And it must be treated exactly as it is: a fantasy."One Million Years B.C." is just as good, if not better, than the original film upon which it was based. It follows the same basic storyline and the same kind of plot. It's basically an ancient love story to perhaps explore the possible emotions of our ancestors. And then to add some campy, but innovative action to heighten the entertainment value. The film stars Raquel Welch, who in her fur bikini, is undoubtedly the most famous feature of the film. The poster shot of Raquel from this film is more famous than the film itself. And she is stunningly beautiful on screen. Also not all that bad in performance. John Richardson is a great equivalent to Victor Mature from the original and in my opinion, Richardson has a more convincing appearance and performance as a strong and bold warrior. And the rest of the entire cast is just more actors and actresses dressed in fur clothing and wearing makeup to enhance the appearance of an ancient race.After Raquel Welch, the most famous feature of "One Million Years B.C." is the stop-motion dinosaurs created by the famous and brilliant effects artist Ray Harryhausen. Here, he is at his peak. It was animating dinosaurs in his youth when he began to learn to perform the art, so bringing them onto the screen was always right in his territory. The film features several dinosaurs, not enough in my opinion, I would have liked to have seen two or three more, but enough. All of whom are realistically created after hours and hours of hard work. And the dinosaurs are much more convincing than the people in rubber suits and giant lizards from the original. There is one graphically enlarged lizard in the film, however, and it turned out more comical than frightening with its hissing sounds and its slurping tongue. But not a bad effect or idea, nonetheless. The other dinosaurs, particularly the fearsome Allosaurus, are magnificently done. They even utilize the breathing mechanisms to make it appear as if the animals are actually breathing. And while stop-motion animation may seem obsolete now days, back in its day, it was the most convincing special effect in Hollywood. And it still remains to this day as a magical and popular animation technique.Aside from the dinosaurs, the other special effects were acceptable for their time. There were a few moments where I could tell that the cave wall that two cavemen are shoving each other into was really made out of rubber. And a few other shots weren't perfect either, but nothing to get picky about. It is, after all, a 60s film.Bottom line, "One Million Years B.C." is a very fine film and is very entertaining and satisfying if you just simply treat it as a non-serious fantasy film, which it is. Just sit back, enough the sight of Raquel Welch's stunning beauty, the magnificent Mario Nascimbene music score in the background, fine performances by the cast, wonderful stop-motion dinosaurs, and a great camp classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, one of the first comments people are tempted to make about this movie is that, anywhere close to 1,000,000 B.C., the dinosaurs were long gone, and modern humans hadn't arrived yet. This isn't intentional humor; the movie was meant to be taken seriously. "Leave your brain at the door" doesn't quite cover it. I'll add a bit more on that at the end of this review.So apart from that gross mistake, how is the movie? The two sentence version is, "It's a lot of fun. Rent it." On its own terms, it really isn't that bad. That's partly because of the unrealistic but spectacular sight of Raquel Welch in her primitive swimsuit, but even apart from that. The story comes down to the interaction between two very different groups of primitive humans. The rock people of caveman Tumak are viciously competitive within their own tribe, showing little consideration for each other, willing to kill each other at the least excuse. Tumak is driven out of the tribe by his father during one such squabble.Tumak wanders until he is taken in by a seacoast tribe. The first of this tribe to find him are a bevy of spearfishing maidens led by Loana (Raquel Welch). Her people are much less savage. Where the Rock Tribe squabble among themselves in their filthy cave, these seacoast people sit around quietly doing useful tasks, and share among each other without any fuss.Of course, we know that Tumak will have to settle his issues with his own tribe, and we know that Loana and her people will get drawn in somehow. To say any more would turn into a spoiler. It's not really that ridiculous a story, though. What makes it seem so are the grossly inaccurate elements that I mentioned at the beginning.And I really have to wonder about that. Of course, Hollywood doesn't have the greatest track record for getting its facts straight, but still. It's one thing not to be able to distinguish, say, between the Triassic and Cretaceous periods for dinosaurs, or to be hazy on when modern humans evolved. It's quite another to show either dinosaurs or Homo Sapiens around at this period. Were the movie makers really this ignorant about prehistory? Did they know better, but play to the general public's perceived ignorance? Yes, by all means keep a sense of humor about it, but it would still be interesting to know what was going through their minds.The production values are really quite good, by the way. There's some impressive scenery, and the special effects are well enough done for the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In One Million Years B.C., Hammer's rather camp lesson in prehistory, dinosaurs co-exist with cavemen, giant tarantulas and over-sized iguanas roam the scorched earth, and cave-women are buxom beauties in teensy revealing outfits. Director Don Chaffey's 'screw the facts' approach might not win him any awards for historical accuracy, but it does allow him to deliver loads of spectacular action set pieces in which hot women in skimpy togs are frequently in mortal danger from a variety of impressive stop-motion creatures (courtesy of FX legend Ray Harryhausen, who also worked with Chaffey on Jason and the Argonauts). And dinosaurs plus babes equals loads of fun in my book!John Richardson plays Tumak, a member of the savage Rock tribe who is forced to leave the safety of his cave when he has a run-in with his father, chief Akhoba. After wandering through miles of barren volcanic wasteland, a weary Tumak stumbles into the coastal domain of the peaceful Shell tribe, where he is found by a fishing group comprising of several extremely fit, big-breasted blondes, led by stunner Loana (Racquel Welch, sporting her iconic fur bikini).Tumak is taken to the Shell tribe's cave (spacious, dry, with colourful murals and a sea view), and is nursed back to health. He also learns the art of using a spear, which comes in handy when a hungry Allosaurus decides to dine at Chez Shell Tribe: Tumak saves the day, slaying the beast (but not until a couple of men have been snacked upon).Having proved himself a hero, Tumak tries to help himself to a spear belonging to one of the of the Shell people, who isn't too keen on letting his prize possession go. A scuffle breaks out, and Tumak is once again sent on his way, this time accompanied by Loana, who obviously likes a bit of rough. Together, the comely cave-couple head back to Rock tribe country (dodging head-hunting troglodytes and sparring dinos on the way), where trouble awaits for them in the form of a jealous ex-girlfriend (brunette Hammer hottie Martine Beswick), a hungry Pteranodon, and a volcano that is about to erupt.With its continuously breath-taking shots of vast inhospitable landscapes (which were actually filmed in Tenerife and Lanzarote), a marvellous sweeping orchestral score by Mario Nascimbene, and stunning effects from Harryhausen, One Million Years B.C. is wonderful entertainment for all fans of prehistoric monster mayhem. Despite that all of the dialogue is indecipherable 'cave-speak', the film is gripping stuff, and never bores; on the contrary, it whips along at a fair pace, with a giant creature of some sort always attacking at regular intervals. In fact, only the rather abrupt ending spoils an otherwise faultless slice of outrageously hokey entertainment.Highlight of the film (apart from Welch and Beswick rolling around on the floor together like wildcats) is the brilliant Allosaurus attack, which still looks very impressive 40+ years on.If you haven't already seen One Million Years B.C., pull up a rock in front of the TV and treat yourself to a true classic of fantastic film!</fullReview>

The best part of the movie (including Miss Welch) are the creatures. Other than a few real life things blown up in size, they are brilliant. Harryhausen just knows how to make creatures. This is a cult classic, entertaining showcase for Harryhausen's skills, and has enough action. The movie has a giant iguana, ape men, Brontosaurus, a giant spider, Archelon, Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, a Triceratops, Pteranodon n Rhamphorhynchus.

		<fullReview>Like many people, I really only knew about this film because of the leading actress and her iconic look, but I was also up for seeing humans and dinosaurs living together, from Hammer Studios, directed by Don Chaffrey (Jason and the Argonauts, Pete's Dragon). Basically caveman Tumak (John Richardson) has been expelled from the Rock Tribe, after fighting with their leader Akhoba (James Bond's Robert Brown), also his father. After days of wandering the wilderness, Tumak stumbles upon the Shell Tribe, specifically the several female members, living on the coast, he is in a bad condition from his ordeal, he is nursed back to health by the chief's daughter Loana (Raquel Welch). Loana's betrothed Payto (William Lyon Brown) becomes increasingly jealous of this, and eventually the two men get into a major fight, Tumak is expelled following it, however Loana decides to join him as he travels back to his people. Loana teaches the Rock Tribe how to be civil, while Tumak was away Akhoba was severely injured, so he becomes the new leader, this does not sit well with his brother Sakana (Percy Herbert), who plans to overthrow him. While this storyline is going on, the Homo sapiens are surrounded by many dinosaurs and other large prehistoric creatures, some of which they encounter and battle with, including Brontosaur (herbivore), Archelon (a giant prehistoric turtle), Allosaur (carnivore), Triceratops, Ceratosaur (carnivore), Pterodactyl and its hatchlings and Rhamphorhynchus (carnivore). Also starring Thunderball's Martine Beswick as Nupondi, Jean Wladon as Ahot, Lisa Thomas as Sura, Malya Nappi as Tohana and Richard James as Young Rock Man. Welch is the big draw of this film, she is a beautiful woman with a stunning physique, sporting a furry bikini, she has no dialogue, only a number of grunts, no wonder she became a poster pinup with her iconic image (the poster famously appears in The Shawshank Redemption). The film has only a little bit of a storyline going on, you sort of ignore and concentrate more on Welch, but there are some good sequences of the cavemen fighting against dinosaurs, brought to life by the stop- motion animation of the brilliant Ray Harryhausen, as an overall film it's a reasonable prehistoric adventure. Raquel Welch was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and the film was number 86 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For their 100th release, Hammer Films remade the 1940 cavemen groaner One Million B.C. It would prove to be a roaring box office success, whilst simultaneously making Raquel Welch an iconic poster girl and Ray Harryhausen an even bigger hero.Plot is slight. Two tribes exist in prehistoric times, the Rock People and the Shell People. The former are more aggressive and basic, the latter more forward and assured. Tumak (John Richardson) of the Rocks and Loana (Welch) wind up together, fighting prejudices and lots of giant beasties! Hooray!That's really it, the message is clear but ultimately we are here for the dinosaurs and giant creatures (well OK, the scantily clad cave dwellers as well), with Harryhausen once again showing why he was a legend in his field of animation. With good fights, a bit of sexy sizzle and a volcanic finale, it's all good really.It's no history lesson of course, but as Harryhausen was wont to say, they wasn't making a film for history professors! 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not well 'up' on my prehistoric mammals, the ones which inherited the Earthy from the Dinosaurs, or I'd suggest remaking this film to be little bit more accurate from a natural history standpoint. You wouldn't want to set it in the Ice Age. You'd have had to cover Raquel in fur, and covering so much as an inch of her skin (beyond what's needed to avoid an 'R' rating, of course) was to be avoided at all costs. After all, that was what people, especially guys, paid to see. But how about having the hero defend the village from an attack by a saber-toothed tiger? Hunting Woolley Mammoths would be out; they, from what I know, lived in cold, snowy climates, and that would have required covering Raquel up, as I noted above. That's why the extra research would be needed. What monsters would people have faced in those days in a warm climate, where Welch could stick with her doe-skin bikini? What about hunting horses no bigger than dogs? Harryhausen did fine with that little project in 'The Valley of Gwangi', and they did exist. It;s known that these little horses lived in North America and they were hunted to extinction. It took the Spanish to introduce ridable horses to their possession in the Americas in the 1500s.I'm sure Ray Harryhausen would have done as well with a saber-toothed tiger as he did with a T-Rex or a triceratops. The basic plot needn't have changed, but the relationship between Tumac, his father, and his brother might have been softened a bit. You don't have to get rid of the sibling rivalry entirely, but it doesn't have to be lethal.Still, fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original film "One Million B.C." less than a year ago so I still remember the story line pretty well. This remake is just about the exact same one down to the character names and situations, but with the benefit of Ray Harryhausen's dinosaur creations that appear quite an improvement over other prehistoric monster tales from the Fifties and early Sixties. Even his giant lizard has a scale to it that makes it an improvement over say, "The Giant Gila Monster" from 1959 which looked rather ordinary most of the time.And then there's Raquel Welch. Ah yes, looking divine in that bearskin bikini; the poster that graced the walls of thousands of male teenage bedroom walls a decade before Farrah Fawcett took over when she hit it big with "Charlie's Angels". I had to do a double take here though since I'm not used to seeing her as a blonde. Not bad but I'll take the natural auburn hair.All the expected dinosaurs make their appearance here - a brontosaurus, your requisite triceratops versus tyrannosaurus battle, and a pterodactyl that swoops away with cave girl Loana (Welch) in tow. I wondered how she was going to get out of that scrape but needn't have worried. No way was Raquel going to become dinosaur fodder, even if the pterodactyl nestlings were hungry.Well I can take these cave man/cave girl flicks in small doses so I've had my fill again for the time being. However if your tastes lie in this direction I would direct you to the aforementioned "One Million B.C", along with other luminaries of the genre like 1970's "When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth", and a personal favorite of mine if only because of the title, 1958's "The Wild Women of Wongo".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far Ray Harryhausen's worst work, a disappointment on every level. Although there is some good stop motion dinosaur action,there is also plenty of disappointing lizards on green screen action. It has a slow moving story and absolutely NO dialogue. They should have gone with less grunting and more action.The cave people seem to know everything except how to communicate with each other and that's lame.And why do they all live in one cave?Being able to watch a young Raquel Welch makes it bearable. I'd recommend this to fans of Welch and Harryhausen but all of them have probably seen it already.Otherwise,only watch this if you like to be very bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back by popular demand, it is time for "Matthew Praises." I remember seeing a brief clip of on READING RAINBOW in the episode "Digging Up Dinosaurs." That clip made me believe that dinosaurs looked and sounded like that. (I was four so this was before JURASSIC PARK which came out when I was nine.) Although Raquel Welch's beauty was there to make the picture sell, I think it was Ray Harryhausen's animated beasts that really made it enjoyable to me. The music is great, but by today's standards it looks good, but the iguana and tarantula (eating crickets) made it look cheesy. After all, they wanted to pay homage to the original 1940 classic. I mean, the 1940 film ONE MILLION B.C. was clunky. It had dinosaur effects ranging from lizards with horns and spikes glued on their bodies to men in suits. Kind of like those FLASH GORDON serials from the 1930's by Universal. This movie had better monster effects. If anyone asks me what is your favorite movie where the remake is better than the original, I would say ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. made by Hammer. Hammer was planning to make a big monster movie after the success of making their Gothic horror films like THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, HORROR OF Dracula, and the 1959 remake of THE MUMMY. They wanted to remake KING KONG, with Ray's special effects skills, but they couldn't afford the rights form RKO so they ended up remaking ONE MILLION B.C. I saw this movie on Turner Classic Movies and I highly recommend it. The film was such a success, that there were cartoons that cashed in on it like Pink Panther's EXTINCT PINK (1969) and PREHISTORIC PINK (1968) and a porno parody called ONE MILLION AC/DC (1969) (Read my review, it's a "Matthew Rants" one). Followed by WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH (1970) (read my review on that one). Not rated, but it contains violence, nudity, peril, some gore and one scary scene (specifically that tarantula). Best viewable for children over the age of 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fond Memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie essentially begins during the dawn of mankind with the leader of the Rock tribe, "Akhoba" (Robert Brown) slyly trapping a warthog and allowing his son "Tumac" (John Anderson) the honor of leaping into the pit to slay it. This decision angers Akhoba's other son "Sakana" (Percy Hebert) who is quite jealous of Tumac and sees him as a threat to his ambition of one day ruling the Rock tribe as the successor to his father. Additionally, the fact that the beautiful "Nupondi" (Martine Beswick) prefers Tumac over him also infuriates Sakana to no end. But things change quite suddenly when Akhoba and Tumac engage in mortal combat over a piece of meat which leaves Tumac forcibly evicted from the tribe and left for dead. Fortunately, Tumac manages to survive and upon wandering a great distance through the desert collapses near the vicinity where some young women from the Shell tribe happen to be fishing. Having never seen a male outside of her tribe "Loana" (Raquel Welch) takes it upon herself to nurse Tumac back to health. This sudden interest for this stranger by Loana causes some concern by one of the males named "Ahot" (Jean Wladon) who rather fancied having Loana for himself. Anyway, one thing leads to another and eventually Tumac and Ahot engage in a violent struggle which results in Tumac once again being evicted. But this time he has a companion in Loana who forsakes her tribe to be with him. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this particular picture is a British remake of an earlier Hollywood film by the name of "One Million B.C." which was produced in 1940. Personally, I prefer the remake to the original due to two specific reasons. First of all, unlike its predecessor, the 1966 version is filmed in color which enhances some of the special effects. But the main reason this movie is better is the presence of Raquel Welch who created quite a sensation in her fur bikini during this time. No doubt some who remember watching this movie at the local theater or drive-in will know what I'm talking about. In any case, while this movie is clearly not meant to be historical in nature and doesn't have anything resembling a coherent script, it is still a fond memory for me and I rate it as slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not pre-history, but still a great adventure story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You appreciate the full meaning of this title best if you express it as 1.002 million years B.P. (Before Present). - the extra 0.002 million years represents the bulk of all recorded history, and we are looking a very long way further back. But don't worry - this film does not claim any allegiance to known facts. I remember it from when it first appeared and, with most of my contemporaries, I particularly enjoyed it for the magnificent battling dinosaurs so vividly created by that special effects master Ray Harryhausen. But I also remember its total rejection by most of us later when maturity set in and we began to appreciate the difference between the Pliocene and Jurassic ages, recognising that the only mammals alive in the age of dinosaurs were no bigger than a modern rodent. Probably we also gradually became aware that Raquel Welch really looked a lot more attractive to us than we might have expected from the reconstructions of female skeletal fossils from the Pithecanthropus Erectus era which we can see in museums. However Raquel has had many more worth while roles than wearing a rabbit skin bikini and grunting at potential paramours from other tribes. This role was pure fun, but even without it the film would remain very watchable thanks to the magnificent dinosaur battle sequences generated in his backstage workshop by Harryhausen. Copies of the DVD are now beginning to be hard to find, but this film is also included in a Raquel Welch DVD collection, although not as far as I know in any Ray Harryhausen collection which would be equally appropriate. 20th Century Fox, now have the North American distribution rights for this British classic, and I urge them to ensure the contribution he made to cinematography as we know it today remains appreciated by modern film-goers by ensuring that this film (preferably also with others featuring his work) is released again soon in the form of one or more Blue-ray disks so that we can all continue to marvel at his gripping illusions which still match any CG sequences I have ever seen. ."Quest for Fire", a later and equally memorable film with a similar theme but greater scientific credibility, perhaps provided more fascination but many also felt it gave less entertainment value - it had no RH to spice up its video sequences and it never achieved the fame of "One Million Years BC". Another work with a similar theme which was written almost like a film-script and has been crying out for filming is Jack London's book "Before Adam", but as yet no director has dared to accept this challenge. As for "One Million Years BC", let's forget the fur bikini, watching battles between these scaly monsters and our puny ancestors, followed by its dramatic volcanic sequences remains a cinematographic experience comparable with that from any average adventure film made today, so it still deserves an IMDb rating of at least 5 or 6. But it is now also a genuine classic which should increase the rating we give it by at least one star. If database users show clearly that this remains a realistic assessment of the film, it is hard to believe that it will ever be allowed to drop into total oblivion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not hard to see why this movie has become sort of a semi-classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A scarcely dressed Raquel Welch, a cat-fight and Ray Harryhausen dinosaurs. What more do you need to have a good time?This movie is better than it's remake, that's for sure. The movie was remade only 4 years later, under the title "When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth". This movie in itself is also a remake of the 1940 movie with the almost similar title "One Million B.C.", starring Lon Chaney Jr. and directed by Hal Roach and his son with the original name Hal Roach Jr.This is not the sort of movie you would expect from the Hammer studio's. Not only its concept and settings differ from their normal horror productions but also the atmosphere is totally different and it doesn't at all feel like an Hammer movie. Guess this was the touch of director Don Chaffey, who was more experienced in making entertaining and adventurous productions, such as for instance the classic production "Jason and the Argonauts" from 1963.There isn't much story present in the movie, or perhaps I was just too busy staring at Raquel Welch's breasts. It's just the one prehistorical event and fight after the other basically. The movie is made more in a documentary sort of style. But that's OK, this isn't really the sort of movie that requires a story.It's sort of funny to see 'giant' real iguana's, turtles and tarantulas being presented as big prehistoric flesh eating monsters. It of course makes the movie look terribly outdated this present day but it at the same time is also part of the charm of these sort of movies. 'Historicaly' it of course doesn't has any value. The stop motion-effects for the dinosaurs and the dinosaur battles were done by none other than Ray Harryhausen, who was at the top of the game at the time. The effects are also good looking in this movie and also surely provide the movie with its most memorable and classic moments. The dinosaur fights are definitely more classic and better known than the actual movie on its own.Next to its effects, the movie is also otherwise a good looking one. I liked the settings and costumes and all, though it always remains sort of funny in these sort of movies that the actors all seem to have perfect white teeth.Good fun prehistorical nonsense, that features all of the elements you would expect.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great '60s kitsch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure "One Million Years B.C." is bad. It's premise is absurd, without credibility -- there were NO dinosaurs around one million years B.C. -- and its story is trite and uninteresting, but this IS great sixties nostalgia, maybe even seventies nostalgia if you grew up watching it on TV. It's quite watchable. Raquel Welch became THE sixties sex symbol as a result of this movie, and she and Ray Harryhausen's special effects are the film's main attraction. Add to that a strange percussive score by Mario Nascimbene and either you dig this type of movie or you don't. I guess it's all a matter of how much you like watching fur-bikini clad babes battle prehistoric beasts, have fights with other fur-bikini clad babes, and get carried off by cavemen. It also helps if you like seeing cave people get killed in a variety of ways. It's silly, it's crazy and believe it or not it's also British! Percy Herbert is in it! It was made by Hammer, and dark-haired cavewoman Martine Beswick is just as hot as Raquel. Their fight is better than the one between the allosaurus and the triceratops. One great flub to look out for is when the cave teenager gets his hand burnt and screams, revealing 20th century A.D. fillings in his teeth. Great stuff. And if you think this movie is bad, check out "Prehistoric Woman" (1967). Now there's real kitsch. The only thing else I can say about "One Million Years B.C." is that I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. If you like this movie, check out "When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth" (1970) and "Creatures the World Forgot" (1971). You won't forget 'em. And remember, "AKEETA!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic when it comes to fluff entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a late night t.v. favorite of mine when I was a little boy (early 70's), &amp; today I still find it very entertaining! There are some aspects to the film that are not accurate at all (cavemen living in the age of dinosaurs, a giant tarantula, etc.), but just forget about them and enjoy the picture. Ray Harryhausen's stop-animated dinosaurs are a big spectacle of this movie, and this was also the movie that put Raquel Welch in the spotlight. Possible SPOILERS ahead: John Richardson plays Tumak; a primitive man living with a rough and dirty tribe. He is one of the sons of the leader of the tribe, and there are some power struggles between Tumak, his father and his brother. Eventually Tumak gets thrown out of the Rock Tribe, and must fend for himself in the vast wilderness. As he wanders through the desert wilderness he encounters a giant reptile (a real creature made up to look like a dinosaur, and back projected), a giant tarantula, and a brontosaurus. Tumak is suffering from thirst and hunger when he stumbles into the Shell Tribe's area, and collapses. The Shell Tribe are more civilized, and much cleaner. Loana (Raquel Welch) of the Shell Tribe goes to make an examination of the stranger. Suddenly an archelon (a giant prehistoric turtle) appears out of the surf, and the Shell women blow their shells to alert the men for help. The Shell Tribe take Tumak in, and nurse him back to health. Loana finds Tumak attractive, and pays a lot of attention to him. The Shell Tribe teach Tumak many things, and he in turn also seems to teach them a couple of things. The Shell Tribe are attacked by a tyranosaurus, and Tumak leads the Shell men in the fight against the creature. All seems well until Tumak gets into a fight with one of the leading Shell men. Again Tumak is told to leave a tribe, but this time he does not go alone because Loana runs to be by his side. They venture back the way Tumak originally came, and end up in a cave of savage beings. They also encounter a fight between a triceratops, and what appears to be a ceratosaurus (like a tyranosaurus but with a horn on its nose.) They manage to arrive back at the Rock Tribe's cave, and again there are some fights. A pteranodon picks up Loana, and carries her off to a high nest. Another pteranodon fights the one carrying Loana, and Loana ends up being dropped into the ocean. Tumak and another Rock man try to rescue her, but Tumak believes it is too late. Loana comes ashore and wanders into the area of her old tribe. She pleads (in a primitive language) with the Shell people to help her find Tumak. They then set off and eventually come to the area of the Rock Tribe. More fighting takes place, and Tumak ends up killing his brother. The local volcano erupts, and the land quakes. Many people fall into the earth, or have rocks fall on them. The survivors of both tribes organize themselves enough to begin a journey away from that area. One Million Years B.C. has some nice photography, and the music score is very moving. The actors do a fine job with the prehistoric words, grunts, body language and facial expressions. It is a lively and entertaining movie that will entertain as long as the viewer remembers it was made in 1966. Some of the special effects may seem dated and some parts of the film may seem campy at times, but it makes for a fun Saturday afternoon feature or late night movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"One Million Years B.C." was produced by England's Hammer Films who were best known for their color horror flicks from the late 50s to the mid-seventies. This film deals with life in the prehistoric world of cavemen and dinosaurs.  The creatures created by the legendary Ray Harryhausen with his stop-motion technique are quite convincing and realistic for their time and hold up quite well even by today's computerized special effects standards. The inter-action between them and the humans is quite good. There is an excellent battle between a T-Rex and another three horned dinosaur (the name of which I can't spell). The story centers on the character played by John Richardson who is banished by his tribe. He wonders the wasteland until he comes upon Raquel Welsh and her band of merry maidens. Her tribe helps him regain his strength until they too banish him so he and Raquel and her skimpy costume wander off amid danger until they return to his tribe. In between there are several battles between the humans and with the creatures. The dialogue is limited to a few grunts which, I suppose is appropriate for this setting. The best sequence of the picture takes place when a volcano erupts. The destruction that follows is as good as you will see in any movie past or present. </fullReview>

They can still be watched in this era where everybody talks about digital effects and some of the scenes even steal your breath fot quite a few seconds.It's also a movie where women aren't dragged back into the cave by their hair, a clearly stupid idea most cave movies hold about the prehistoric times.

		<fullReview>I expected to like the film but not to the extent that I did. I think that this is the only sound film that I've ever seen in which there is practically no dialogue in a real language. (I'm fairly sure that the only proper word used in the film is "Archelon," which is the actual scientific name of the giant turtle which attacks the Shell tribe.) To be honest, I was a little apprehensive about watching the film for that reason as I thought that it would slow the film down significantly but it didn't at all really, surprisingly enough. The excellent musical score certainly adds to the atmosphere.The film is beautifully shot. Don Chaffey, an underrated director, utilises the exotic locations of Lanzarote and Tenerife to wonderful effect, giving it a much different look and feel to most other Hammer films. It has a slightly otherworldly feel which is appropriate in the circumstances. Ray Harryhausen's special effects are absolutely (and typically) brilliant for the time and hold up remarkably well. With one small exception, the dinosaurs even look realistic when they appear in the same shot as people. I don't think that the dinosaur effects were surpassed until "Jurassic Park". Even the pterodactyl flying effects look great. The film is visually striking in other ways too, such as Tumak discovering the ape men's skulls and the severely injured Akhoba's face when he returns to the Rock tribe's cave.I was enjoying the film so much that it was a full hour before I realised that it didn't have a plot per se. It's more of a collection of excellent set pieces loosely held together by Tumak's growing relationship with Loana and his periodic power struggles with his father Akhoba, his brother Sakana and Ahot. However, I can't say that that effected my enjoyment of the film! Due to the lack of any true dialogue, the actors rely on their eyes and facial expressions (as well as frequent acts of violence!) to communicate their emotions and most of them do a very good job of it, particularly Robert Brown (who is far more authoritative as Akhoba than he was as M!) and Martine Beswick, while Raquel Welch and John Richardson make for very appealing and likable leads.</fullReview>

This is the film that made her a sex symbol for the Sixties right into the Seventies.This remake of the 1939 classic where Victor Mature and Carole Landis became stars boasts Technicolor and some nice Ray Harryhausen special effects dinosaurs. Of course the fact that dinosaurs were not contemporary with cave men on the evolutionary journey is as irrelevant here as it was in 1939.The plot such as it were follows pretty much along the lines of the 1939 story. Cave man John Richardson from one tribe meets cave girl Raquel Welch from a slightly more advanced tribe and in this prehistoric Romeo and Juliet story, the Montague and Capulet tribes do find some common cause to survive. If they didn't I'm sure we wouldn't be here.Ray Harryhausen monsters and Raquel's bulging mammaria, what's more to want in a film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hammer's depiction of life in prehistory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One Million Years B.C." is actually a serious 1966 attempt to depict life in prehistory for cavemen and women. Many reviewers complain that human beings and dinosaurs NEVER occupied the same period in prehistory, but this is merely our best present-day educated guess. Who knows? Twenty years from now we may discover evidence that people existed at the same time as dinosaurs. The fact is that we DON'T KNOW precisely what it was like for people in prehistory and never truly will; all we can do is guess based on the evidence at hand. This movie is simply a serious attempt to show what it may have been like for people IF they lived at the same time as dinosaurs. Capeesh?I said this was a serious depiction, but there are admittedly some humorous aspects. For instance, the mullet-headed blond men of the Shell Tribe and the indoor cave sets straight out of the original Star Trek TV series.Other than that, I can't think of anything bad to say. The location photography from the Canary Islands is awe-inspiring and Ray Harryhausen's dinosaur animation is excellent, holding up very well even to this day; take, for instance, the way the allosaur and, later, t-rex are shown breathing in their dying moments. Needless to say, great attention to detail. The movie even throws in a couple of superimposed iguanas and a tarantula.Oh yeah, most guys understandably rave about Raquel Welch as Loana and her infamous cavegirl bikini, and she is indeed stunning, but -- believe it or not -- there are a few other female castmembers that are more beautiful due to better womanly curves, like Lisa Thomas as the blonde Sura, essentially Loana's sidekick in the Shell Tribe, and Yvonne Horner as the dark-haired Ullah of the Rock Tribe. The statuesque Martine Beswick is also on hand as Nupondi of the Rock Tribe. I must not forget to mention the outstanding musical score; it's very fitting, very primal.Lastly, there's no talking as we understand it; only grunting and primitive lingo. Bottom line: "One Million Years B.C." is enjoyable and highly recommended unless, of course, you have pompous hangups about (supposed) historical chronology.The film runs 100 minutes.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not One of My Favorite Harryhausens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this one in a small first release cinema back in 1967 when it was first released. As the cinema was part of a nation-wide chain owned by 20th Century-Fox, naturally the version screened for an audience of seven (me plus six usherettes) was the 91-minute USA cutdown. Admittedly, screening the British version would have made no difference to the size of the audience. With the sole exceptions of "Fantastic Voyage" (1966) and "Bedazzled" (1967), all the films in which Raquel starred were total write-offs in Australia. Worse, her part in "Fantastic Voyage" could hardly be described as typical; while as for "Bedazzled", her role was little more than a cameo. To say that Miss Welch had no box office appeal in Australia would be the understatement of the year. That's a shame because I always liked her. My favorite of her movies is "Fathom". I also like "Lady in Cement", even though most of the glory here belongs to Frank Sinatra. As for "One Million Years B.C.", I think Miss Welch looks far more appealing in the publicity photos than in the film itself. Also John Richardson struck me as an actor with no charisma. Like him or hate him, you can't say that about Victor Mature who starred in Hal Roach's first version, "One Million B.C.", back in 1940. And for those who groove on special effects, the 1940 film is far more spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racquel Welch is one ravishing Cave-Woman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am generally a huge fan of the Hammer Studios, and while their prehistoric adventure "One Million Years B.C." of 1966 does not nearly reach the greatness of most of their Horror flicks, this is more than entertaining to any lover of cult-cinema. The main reason to watch "One Million Years B.C." is of course the ravishing Racquel Welch in scarce cave-girl dress. The iconic promotion picture of sexy Recquel in front of prehistoric land is world-famous and exceeds the fame of the film itself by far. But even apart from the beautiful Miss Welsh, the film, which is a remake of the 1940 film "One Milion BC", has quite a bunch of other things to offer. The legendary Ray Harryhausen's great special effects may look dated to some by now, but they sure are astonishing for the time. The score by German Composer Werner R. Heymann is also great, and gives the film a lot of atmosphere. Sexy Martine Beswick furthermore delivers even more female eye candy. The film is, of course, a pure fantasy picture and historically pure nonsense, but, as far as I am considered, that is what makes it so much fun to watch. Not only do we see cavemen fighting dinosaurs, there are also a bunch of other over-sized animals, such as huge lizards and turtles involved. The cave-women, especially Loana played by Racquel Welch, are sexy babes with 60s hairstyles and in seductive mini-skirts. The cave people speak in a primitive fantasy-language, which I actually found surprisingly realistic, since I had expected them to speak English before seeing the film. The main reasons to watch this film are its sexy female stars Racquel Welch and Martine Beswick (whose husband John Richardson stars in the lead as caveman Tumak), but even apart from the female eye candy, this is more than worth watching. "One Million Years B.C." is a classic, and while it may not be great cinema, it sure is great fun. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5 words: Raquel Welsh In A Bikini</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summary says it all. Watching the lovely Raquel in a prehistoric bikini is excuse enough to watch the movie. I don't remember anything else about the movie. It's funny to watch movies like this because the actresses have manicured nails and styled hair. The Ringo Starr movie is another example. But when this movie shows up on TV, I can't help but watch it. It's like watching a train wreck, but what a beautiful way to die. Raquel is beautiful. She probably still is. I think she only had one line in the entire movie. I first saw it as a kid, and still remember it. Cable hasn't shown it in years. Let's hope they show it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In prehistoric caveman times, Tumak, a member of the brutal Rock People, is banished. After travelling across a treacherous landscape he is found by Loana, and taken in by her more enlightened tribe, the Shell People. Ultimately the two tribes meet and fight, but their battle is interrupted by a huge volcanic explosion ...This is an interesting movie, which launched a million posters of Welch in her famous furry bikini, and was so successful for Hammer Films that it spawned several lesser follow-ups (Prehistoric Women, When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth, Creatures The World Forgot). Curiously, although it has an adapted screenplay by producer Michael Carreras, it's a fairly straight remake of a 1942 picture called One Million BC. Although it's easy to poke fun at, it's a serious attempt to dramatise our not-so-sophisticated ancestors and it works very well - the subtle contrast between the two tribes is terrific and the film never goes for laughs or sappy unrealistic characterisations. It also has some seriously scary troglodyte cave-dwellers, several great Ray Harryhausen dinosaur sequences (the best of which is a groovy fight between an Allosaurus and a Triceratops) and a tremendous fire and brimstone ending of biblical proportions. The barren volcanic locations (exteriors were shot in the Canary Islands) add to the powerful imagery, as does a total lack of intelligible dialogue and Mario Nascimbene's bone-rattling one-note score. Welch is of course an incredible cutie in this movie, although for me the gorgeous raven-haired Beswick is even hotter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie in it entirety or in part many times; it's a perfect time fill when you're surfing around late at night and come upon it. Historically lame, cave girls obviously never looked this good, but they DID provide good window dressing for a plot that at least tied its beginning to the rather abrupt ending so lets give the screenplay a C+ for effort. Ray Harryhausen's special effects are, as usual, a delight; there's even a t-rex and triceritops battle royale here, something I was hoping for in the Jurassic Park efforts. What really draws me into this film every time I see it is it's dark, atmospheric mood which is even more enhanced by a somber, historic melancholy type soundtrack; I must admit I've always been a sucker for wordless female choral voices. In short, the film has many flaws but the presence of Harryhausen and it's dark, bleak mood and soundtrack more than make up for all its shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ludicrous fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing best remembered about this Hammer fantasy is not the movie itself, but the iconic image of Raquel Welsh, which has donned many a students' wall throughout the decades. The movie itself is a bit of fun, but relatively forgettable.It tells the story of Tumak, a neatly-bearded cavemen. One of two sons to the tribe's leader, he is a member of the Rock tribe who seem to spend their time jumping on top of warthogs, squabbling over chunks of meat, and having dramatic stick-fights. His overbearing father rules over the camp like a nomadic Hitler, and banishes Tumak after a squabble over chunks of warthog meat leads to a dramatic stick-fight. After walking the land for a while and meeting some of ancient Earth's giant monsters, he walks upon a tribe who seem to exist with a more peaceful outlook on life. Also, the women in the tribe are all blonde, skimpy- dressed, and seem to shave their legs.It's a vision of man's beginning as seen through the eyes of Karl Pilkington. The giant creatures created by Ray Harryhausen are, as usual, fantastic to watch, but as the film goes on I started to wonder where the creators got their crazy ideas from. Obviously, the film wasn't ever going to strive for historical accuracy, but when I saw the scene in which a giant turtle attacks the tribe I was gazing open- mouthed at the TV. It's the kind of lunacy that makes the Hammer films of lesser quality still so endearing. Harryhausen defended the film, stating that he "didn't make it for professors." Take Harryhausen's words and just enjoy the sights on show, be it a giant gecko, a dinosaur fight or Raquel Welch.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Chaffey directed this prehistoric tale that stars John Richardson as Tumak, who has been banished from his cruel tribe, and now wanders the wasteland, trying to survive, and avoid the occasional dinosaur. He eventually meets the gentle, peace-loving Shell people and falls in love with the tribeswoman Leona(played by Raquel Welch) They decide to strike out on their own, with unforeseen consequences, and a volcanic eruption providing a fiery climax... Ray Harryhausen provides the dinosaur F/X, and does an impressive job as usual. Raquel Welch is stunning of course, and no doubt the primary viewing attraction, though is it silly in itself to point out the innumerable historical mistakes running throughout the picture?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** Tumak, John Richardson,kicked out of his caveman tribe the Rock People for grabbing a piece of pork roast without the permission of his old man the tribal chieftain Akoba, Robert Bown, is left to die in the wilderness until when he's just about done in, from the broiling sun and starvation,Tumak wakes up out of his delirium and thinks that he just died and went to heaven. There's this bevy of sexy and well endowed women looking like California beach girls out fishing and playing catch by the shore! Leading the golden girls is beautiful and tanned Loana, Requel Welch, who takes a liking to Tumak in his very cave-man like appearance. It's when Tumak fights off the giant turtle with the help of Loana fellow Shell People that her liking the good-looking and a bit uncouth, especially in his eating habits, Tumak turns to love.This attraction of Loana to the outsider, from the Shell People, has her boyfriend the hot headed Ahot,Jean Weldon,get a bit hot under the collar or caveman suite that leads to a wild confrontation between the two suitors, for Loana affection, with Tumak ending up at first getting the short end of the stick! In the end Tumak not only ends up getting the entire stick but Loana as well as she together with him leaves the Shell People and gets out in the open desert to find their way back to uncivilization in the uncivilized and grunting,in that they never developed a language of their own, Rock People that Tumak belongs too.****SPOILERS*** By now Tumak's brother Sakana , Percy Herbert, took over the leadership of the Rock People by almost killing his pop Akoba by dropping him down a 30 foot embankment as he was holding on, at the edge of a cliff, for dear life after he screwed up in trying to kill a mountain goat to have for dinner. With pops now a broken and disable old man Sakana is more then determined to knock off his brother Tumak in not that he's just a threat to his leadership of the clan but that he never really liked Tumak in the first place! Meanwhile Loana has her own troubles with Tumak's Rock &amp; Roll, from the Rock Clan, girlfriend Nupondi, Martine Boswick, who's jealous as hell at her for taking her handsome caveman, Tumak, away from her! This leads to a wild cat fight between the two cave women that ends with the proverbial sh*t hitting the fan when after both the Shell and Rock people start rumbling in the rock pile that all of a sudden the local volcano, as if on cue, erupts and finally puts an end to all this pre historic insanity!P.S Requel Welch at age 25 was never more beautiful and real, before her almost 30 years of involvement in cosmetic surgery, in the movie "One Million years B.C" which made her almost overnight the ultimate sex symbol of the 1960's and 1970's for every red blooded American boy as well as boy the world over. Little did we know at the time that within three years after making the movie Raquel would show her true acting ability, besides her 37-24-36 vital statistics, in film classics, ranking right up there with "Citizen Kane" &amp; "Casablanca", like "Flearup" &amp; Myra Breckenridge".</fullReview>

Much as I loved this movie when I was a kid, it doesn't quite stand the test of time as do some of the other Harryhausen movies do. The effects are still great, but acting and so forth seem to have faded with time. As a kid, Raquel Welch and John Richardson's love story just slowed the movie down. I just wanted to see dinosaurs. Now I think the best parts of the movie are the confrontations between Tumak, and his father and brother. Still enjoyable though, a solid 7. (5 if not for Harryhausen). I think they should have spent more time with Tumak and his tribe. Quest For Fire, arguably the best caveman movie ever made, was all about the people who lived back in those long ago times, not the monsters they fought.</fullReview>

Raquel Welch's seminal (in more ways than one) fur bikini'd performance; 3. The exotic and unworldly look of the locations, which suit the movie perfectly; 4. Welch and Martine Beswick's catfight.Robert Brown (the 2nd James Bond M) makes a fairly unrecognisable appearance as Rock People Chief. Percy Herbert is in it (it was compulsory under UK law for Percy Herbert to appear in all UK films made during the 60s, a little known piece of British film arcana)(that's a joke, by the way, before it gets picked up and repeated elsewhere). John Richardson was not bad, but failed to capitalise on the promise he showed here and in Hammer's "She." Mario Nascimbene rattles lots of stuff on the soundtrack. Some geezer dresses up in a monkey costume.Yes, but it's got Ray Harryhausen's dinosaurs! It's great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It had to start somewhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before "Jurasic Park" there were films like "One Million years BC". Of course one can go back even further in 1925 there was the remarkable "the Lost World" and of course the original King Kong. These dinosaurs were before computer trickery and look very impressive even today. One million Years BC was laughed at in its first release. It was seen as a skin flick, an excuse to see scantily clad Raquel and avoid the scissors of the censor. It was all in the name of art and history. Now most of us believe that people and dinosaurs did not exist together but this movie takes plenty of liberties.Just the same it is certainly not as stupid as some people in the USA who call themselves creationists believe. Its hard to imagine that people can actually think that, wait for it, the world was created in seven days. To be fair most creationism is scorned by the majority but these people have power. They even teach it in schools!!! Here in Australia creationism and intelligent design (no I am not kidding) is largely dismissed as childish nonsense but in USA there are people who believe this hog wash. My point is that the odd claims in this movie are at least better than the silly claims by creationists.The movie is not good evolution though, the theories are distorted or just plain odd. Its bad evolution but pretty good Hollywood. Dear Raquel is actually pretty good but its very amusing to see she never has a hair out of place. Welsh was a a good actor and went on to star on Broadway and by all accounts she was fabulous. There were certainly worse actors than her.I like her. The effects are pretty fabulous although the first dinosaur looks like someones pet iguana. The fight scenes are wonderful and so is the quirky sound track. I know the sex symbol is meant to be Raquel and she is cute but for me its hunky John Richardson. This hunky bear does not wax his chest and could put his club under my bed any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING! - Never, ever judge a DVD by its enticing, bikini-clad, surfer-girl, cheesecake cover! Oh-me! Oh-my! Believe me, this prehistorically preposterous "Romeo &amp; Juliet" love story literally set the art of romance back by about a billion years (B.C.). It really did.This film is a prime example of some of the most primitive-minded, stone-aged trash that actually makes the likes of The Flintstones cartoon seem about 10x more entertaining (and authentic) by mere comparison.From wrangling with supremely peed-off warthogs to claw'n'nail cat-fights between hot cave-girls in high-fashion fur bikinis (ooh-la-la!), One Million Years B.C. can only be fully appreciated if one chooses to view it as a demented, dim-witted, slapstick comedy, presented in the comic style of a Monty Python's farce.From my point of view - This neolithic nonsense of fighting, killing, raping and grunting scraped the absolute bottom of the primordial barrel.I'd say that about the only thing missing from this one's primeval tale of uncivilized romance (perfect for Valentine's Day) was to have had the gruff &amp; grubby Rockman (Tumak) club the sweet &amp; delicate Shellgirl (Loana) over the head and then drag her back by her long, blond locks to a convenient cave for a little bit of "you-know-what", caveman-style.When actually comparing this film's dinosaur effects (courtesy of Ray Harryhausen) to those of 1933's King Kong, I'd confidently say that what one saw in the latter picture (though filmed 33 years prior) was, indeed, far more superior to the former flick in every way imaginable.Anyways - The truth of the matter is - One Million Years B.C. was a total stone-aged embarrassment on all counts. Yep. And that also includes its climatic "erupting volcano" scene that was (obviously) hastily thrown into this primitive mishmash for good measure.And, finally, I ask you - How the hell can Man's future possibly be looked upon as being friendly when his savage, blood-thirsty past (which goes all the way back to one million years B.C.) certainly wasn't?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Million Years B.C. was overall very entertaining for what it was, as many others think so, but also as many others also disagree with, and I can understand that. I liked their use of costume, and the special effects were very good, though not great, for the year this film was made in. The characters, though all of them communicated in supposive cave language and grunts, were really likable and interesting in ways, and the plot itself was very good and cool. I know all of that makes it sounds like it's a decent movie, but believe me, it is anything but decent.The movie itself did get pretty stupid and boring at times, but it was just meant for fun, and should not be taken very seriously at all; if I would have taken it seriously from the beginning, I probably would have ended up hating it, or at least not liking it as much as I did, because it is a cheesy movie, how could you not know that just by the cover? However, if guys start to hate the movie they at least have the beautiful Raquel Welch to look forward to, and all the other half naked women running around with tons of make-up on and hard to conceal breasts, so that should make up for it's supposedly unbearable to watch moments, because honestly in a film with no dialogue, they better be glad they had such lovely women and pretty cool violence. I am pretty sure if a girl watches this she knows what she is getting herself into.In conclusion, this movie was really good for the B-Movie kind of sense it has. It entertains, and is enjoyable, so overall it would not kill you to watch it, but do not be expecting the best, and do not be expecting the least. I enjoyed it, but that's just because I have a very big tolerance in my heart for these types of films, so I do not recommend it if you have a critical eye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Million Years B.C. starts with the very creation of Earth with lots of stock footage of volcano's &amp; flowing lava. Then we are introduced to Akhoba (Robert Brown) the leader of the primitive 'Rock Tribe' &amp; his two sons Tumak (John Richardson) &amp; Sakana (Percy Herbert) whom hate each other. After a fight over some meat Tumak is banished front he tribe &amp; wanders off to fend for himself. After some close encounters with the local prehistoric wildlife Tumak stumbles upon the Shell Tribe whom live near the coast. The Shell Tribe are far more advanced than the Rock Tribe &amp; Tumak is particularly impressed with a blonde bird named Loana (Raquel Welch) who also takes a shine to him after he single handedly kills a Carnosaur, however the Shell people don't like violence &amp; Tumak's brutality so they drive him away. Since Loana still has the hots for him she goes as well. Tumak takes a spear along with him, a weapon not know to the primitive Rock Tribe, with which he plans to kill his Brother Sakana &amp; take control of the Tribe for himself since their Father Akhoba was murdered by Sakana earlier in the film. But the journey is a perilous one dodging dinosaurs &amp; various other dangers...Directed by Don Chaffey One Million Years B.C. was British studio Hammer's 100th production. Probably more well known for their Dracula &amp; Frankenstein series of films I didn't think that much of this. The script by producer Michael Carreras features no recognisable dialogue whatsoever which is probably historically accurate (about the only thing that is) but doesn't make for a good film, in fact it makes for an incredibly dull film. Imagne sitting through an entire 90 plus minute film with no dialogue at all, no characters other than the basic grunts, groans &amp; psychical look of cavemen. I also found it difficult to tell who was who, most of the men have long hair, beards &amp; the same animal skin rags that pass for clothing &amp; look virtually identical. I never cared for anyone &amp; I just wasn't interested in what was happening on screen to these faceless &amp; nameless cavemen who have given me absolutely no reason whatsoever for me to like or care for them. The only reason to watch One Million Years B.C. are the excellent stop-motion special effects by Ray Harryhausen which are a joy to watch in this modern world of soulless CGI, sure they look more realistic but have no personality. The effects are well photographed &amp; they interact with the on screen actors as well as one could hope. From the fantastic giant turtle &amp; flying Pterodactyls to the wonderfully animated &amp; detailed fight between a T-Rex &amp; Triceratops. If you are a fan of this sort of special effect or Harryhausen's work then One Million Years B.C. is an absolute must see, it's just a shame the rest of the film didn't entertain as much as the monsters. Technically the film is OK, the Spanish volcanic locations look authentic enough &amp; it's generally well put together. The acting isn't really applicable here as no one says anything other than some basic grunts, annoyingly the entire film is like this. Remove Harryhausen's wonderful monsters &amp; I thought One Million Years B.C. was a poor, dull &amp; boring film about a couple of prehistoric tribes. I will give the film 1 star &amp; the monster effects 5 which adds up to 6, worth watching for the monsters but nothing else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"One Million Years B.C." will be remembered for mainly one thing: Raquel Welch in that fur bikini! She plays Loana, the love interest of the main character, Tumak, played by John Richardson. "One Million Years B.C." is reminiscent of the Ringo Starr vehicle "Caveman," except the latter movie was purposefully trying for laughs. In the immortal Welch vehicle, there is little dialogue, including the narration at the beginning. Ray Harryhausen adds his touch with his classic stop-motion animation special effects, but it comes off as rather silly, using such "prehistoric" creatures as a giant sea turtle and giant spiders. It's ridiculous enough to those who know that man and dinosaurs did not co-exist! Anyway, if nothing else, the movie is worth seeing for the camp, and, of course, Raquel's bikini.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this movie late one night on a local independent station. I thought I was watching it as part of something like MST3K or Monster Vision, but I was mistaken!This movie features Raquel Welch, running around in a fully revealing "cave girl" uniform. After seeing this, I am thoroughly convinced that she was a template for Pam Anderson!Aside from that, it also features "animated dinosaurs." These are along the lines of Godzilla and other famous "B movies" At times the scenes with them look they were filmed with a "wallpaper backdrop."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grim film, exclusively showcasing certain "assets"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What assets you ask? I'll get to that later. Being a big fan of "The 7th Voyage Of Sinbad", I was excited to learn that Ray Harryhausen, claymation guru of 7th Voyage, was in charge of the "special effects" in One Million as well. The reputation of the film preceded it, or rather Ms. Welch's famous pose for the movie poster did. I geared up for what promised to be a film of epic proportions.I guess promises WERE made to be broken.Harryhausen, using the mentality that huge turtles, spiders and lizards roamed the earth a million years ago, inserted these creatures within the live action shots, making for hilarious results, instead of the awe-inspiring clay work from 7th Voyage. Harryhausen's dinos go over a lot better than the doctored stock footage of household pets, but that alone does not an epic make.I believe the main excuse for making this film was to focus on a certain body area of Ms. Welch. And it ain't her feet. The film turns into a "hormone-ic" joyride as soon as she hits the screen. And when she's not in camera range, I found myself, normally a hormone-controlled male (at least when it comes to movies), hooting for more. With the plot completely lost, and me on the lookout for Welch's chestally gifted area, I couldn't really remember what the message of the film was. It's there somewhere. Tribes fighting, good against evil, civilization against nature...or something like that. If they wanted me to focus on Raquel Welch's bosom, and forget everything else, congrats on a job well done fellas!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of the worst movies, rather one of the best unintentional comedies !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I know that I open the hell's gates by saying that; but Raquel Welch doesn't look any sexy in this movie, in fact, my fat uncle is more sexy compared to her! Raquel is undoubtedly beautiful, many movies can witness that she's one of the oomph queens of cinema. The thing is in this movie something was wrong; the outfit?, her body?, the movie itself?, all of the above? I go with all of the above! In this, Raquel looks like a brunette copy of Pamela Anderson at her worst shapes in Baywatch's episodes (and I hate Pamela Anderson even in her best shapes !). So how come that Raquel turned into a sex goddess after this, having her looks, with that stone age bikini, to be in every list made to date about the sexiest moments ever been on the silver screen ??! It's not historical, it's more like historical enigma to me !Maybe it's something related to the Americans back then. They got board with the voluptuous blondes and looked for something different, something leaner and darker. However, in a bathing suit competition, done exclusively for the brunettes of the late 1960s, I believe that Sophia Loren could have kicked some Raquel's butt, and won by a landslide ! Maybe it was the idea itself. The cheekiness and the loveliness of it. It wasn't fit or familiar at the moment for the movie's heroine to wear a bikini FOR ALL THE MOVIE'S TIME! I recall Marilyn Monroe's movies, Beigitte Bardot's movies, Elvis movies, Bond's movies, Matt Helm's spoofs along with the era's beach musicals; none of them had that offer. So, sure it presented some outrageous sexuality that was too rare to find.Let alone how that wild fantasy was shown as a barbarian girl; namely someone spends a little of her time speaks gibberish, and most of her time acts violently. Wow, that should have been an event. Most of the movie's dolls / heroines up to that moment used to be infantile, rational, or a little bit of both (Doris Day-type), but no wrestler. I began to understand the formula that dazzled the 1966's *male* viewer : different beauty, nearly naked, no talks, loving, with on demand fangs. Well, this had to be enchanted as well as groundbreaking mix ! Now to the movie. Pardon me.. What movie? Was there a movie around? I didn't meet any! There were some ugly people in fur, beating up each other, cat fights, dinosaurs, volcano for the end, and everybody saying in every event nothing but : AKITA TUMAK, AKITA TUMAK !!!As an action, cleaning my room has more steam. As a fantasy, Ray Harryhausen made better, more memorable, stuff. As a sexy movie; just UGH! For my taste; the word hot doesn't apply to anybody here, including one of my early obsessions : Martine Beswick; that girl had a real, original and ultra raunchy cat fight 3 years earlier in From Russia With Love, this time it's the poor, dirty and untalented copy of it !On the other hand, as a movie with acting it's outright hilarious. For small instance look to Percy Herbert; he deals with all the situations, all the feelings, by one unchangeable reaction: gazing in anger while constricting one of his eyes; This is unforgettable ! As a sci-fi it's more than inspiring; it propounds such a brilliant idea; what if all the language became one word? Ahh, it would have been a blast. I think our life could have been finally about deeds not talk. Imagine how spouses' arguments, political speeches, schools' curriculums could be all summarized by just one AKITA TUMAK. Sheer magic !Watch this movie to believe that it was made one day. Exploitation wasn't deprived of anything interesting like this before. It served only Raquel Welch, and serves only her die-hard lovers. For me; when I firstly watched it, back in the late 1990s while being in my early twenties, I put it in the top 10 list of the worst movies I have ever seen. Now, I got matured, putting it in the top 10 list of the best unintentional comedies ever made, where it's in the list's end by the way due to its status among its peers as the most boring ! I wonder, if the cavemen did a movie about their life, wouldn't it be more sexy and dramatic ?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>- Two brothers fight to succeed their father as the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Along the way, the run into dinosaurs, an earthquake, and Raquel Welch.- I've always found this movie a fairly boring affair. The story is uninvolving, much of the acting is very stiff, and it doesn't help matters that not a word of English (or any other language) is spoken in the entire movie. There are some Ray Harryhausen special effects, but they seem out of place here. The best thing that can be said about One Million Years B.C. is that it launched the career (big time) of Raquel Welch.- To sum it up, other than the Harryhausen special effects (and the Raquel Welch special bikini) there's not much here to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>even Raquel Welch's breasts can't save this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of an earlier bad caveman film by the same title. The only interesting thing about either film is the casting of Victor Mature in the original and Raquel Welch in the remake. Casting Welch was not a bad idea, as watching her grunt, be chased by dinosaurs and dance around half undressed is indeed preferable to seeing Victor Mature do the same! However, this being said, all these elements do not add up to a movie any sane person would want to see. I mean, think about it, people grunting and using "caveman talk" for about an hour and a half!! Boy, even with Ms. Welch's breasts so prominently displayed, this movie becomes almost immediately boring! Think about that for a moment--this beautiful actress is scantily clad and yet the movie quickly becomes boring--it takes a lot of effort to do that!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Except for Brigitte Bardot in the 50's, nobody had a better body than Ms. Welch in the 1960's and she shows it off to full advantage in this caveman epic. John Richardson is fine as Tumac (he was also in SHE with Ursula Andress the year before). Great locale in the Canary Islands and wonderful dialogue.A 4 out of 10. Best performance = R. Welch. The costumes are perfect and Ms. Welch is quite fetching in her garb especially. A fun film that should be enjoyed by all. What do you expect them to use for monsters of the past ..cartoons? No one should complain about a film like this. It delivers what it promises - Raquel in her prime!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got all excited over the cover - Raquel Welch in her fur bikini - only to find that I had to rewind the tape half way back from the last victim who rented it. This was the first bad sign. The second came when no-one, meaning people with really bad mullet wigs and chest hair, didn't speak english for the entire film's dialog. But if you can put up with a super lame plot line and stone-age speak, the film has some pretty good monster fights. They're not quite the same calibre as Japanese monster movies, but theyre pretty good for early dinosaur films. All in all its pretty lousy, so if you're thinking of getting excited over a B-grade thrill, I warn you this is definately closer Z-grade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neo-Nazi Propaganda and Fur Bikinis in the Lower Pleistocene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One Million Years B.C" is a remake of "One Million B.C." from 1940, which I have never seen. It is essentially a romance about lovers from two different tribes, Tumak from the Rock People and Loana of the Shell People. The two tribes seem to have reached quite different stages of cultural development. The Rock People are a crude, brutish lot who have no spoken language as such, communicating only by means of grunts and cries, although oddly enough they all have personal names which they are quite capable of articulating. The Shell People, by contrast, are more civilised, having developed the arts of music, painting, jewellery and weapon-making. They even have their own language, although it seems to consist of only about half a dozen words which they repeat endlessly. ("Akita! Makan!"). What is one to make of the fact that the Rock People are all dark-haired whereas the Shell People are predominantly blonde? (Even Raquel Welch appears to have dyed her normally brunette locks). Neo-Nazi propaganda demonstrating the cultural superiority of the Aryan race? Intertwined with the story of Tumak and Loana are scenes of dinosaurs who engage in fights with the cavemen and with each other. It is these scenes which are responsible for the criticism most frequently made of the film, namely that it is anachronistic. Neither dinosaurs nor modern humans existed one million years ago; the dinosaurs became extinct around sixty-five million years before that date and modern Homo sapiens did not arrive on the scene until about 200,000 years BC. There would have been hominids of some sort roaming the earth in 1,000,000 BC, but I doubt if they bore much resemblance to the lovely Raquel. One might also ask how a world which appears to be a barren desert (the film was shot in the Canary Islands) can support so many huge herbivorous creatures and the carnivores which prey on them.This is not, however, a criticism which I would make. Even though "One Million Years BC" was advertised under the tagline "This is the way it was", it was clearly intended as a fantasy rather than a serious historical picture of life in the Lower Pleistocene. One might as well criticise "Lord of the Rings" on the ground that hobbits, orcs and ringwraiths are not species known to zoology. Indeed, some of the dinosaur scenes are the most enjoyable thing about this movie, especially the duel between the Triceratops and the large carnivorous dinosaur. (I assumed it was a Tyrannosaurus Rex but am informed it was in fact a Ceratosaurus). The volcanic eruption towards the end is also pretty spectacular by the standards of the sixties.I would, however, have some other criticisms of the film. I normally have a soft spot for Ray Harryhausen's work, but must admit that this one is something of an exception. All those bad sci-fi and "critter" movies from the fifties should have taught him that small, inoffensive creatures like lizards and spiders do not become remotely scary when optically enlarged to apparently gigantic size. The animated sequences produced using his famous "stop motion" technique are better, but I am not sure what persuaded him to make one of the cavemen's antagonists a giant turtle. I mean, who is going to be frightened of a sea creature out of its natural habitat, built for defence rather than attack and so proverbially slow and clumsy on land that the least athletic human could easily outrun it? Incidentally, the Shell People's name for the turtle in their language is "Archelon", which by a remarkable coincidence is exactly the same as the name given to it by their palaeontologist descendants a million years later.Another drawback is the lack of any comprehensible dialogue; no subtitles are provided for the Shell People's language. This means that the actors are deprived of what would normally be their normal method of conveying meaning and emotion and have to rely solely upon gestures, expressions and body language. Acting without words is a difficult skill, and one which none of the cast seems to possess. Also, I was unsure why the final scene, after the eruption, is in black-and-white. Did this have some symbolic significance, or did the producers simply run out of colour film? "One Million Years B.C." might today seem like no more than a cheesy bit of sixties pulp cinema, but it was obviously successful in its day as it spawned two sequels, "When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth" and "Creatures the World Forgot". These sequels are today very much Films the World Forgot, whereas "One Million Years B.C." itself is still well-remembered. The reason for this, of course, is that it was the film that catapulted Raquel to stardom. ("When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth" was intended to do the same for another glamorous actress, the Playboy centrefold Victoria Vetri, but signally failed to do so). Raquel's performance here is far from being her best, but she had not only the looks but also the charisma to become an instant celebrity; that famous picture of her in a fur bikini became a poster found on the bedroom walls of adolescent males for years afterwards. That was probably the film's most enduring legacy. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before The passion of the Christ and Apocalypto, there was this film. Probably the first with native dialog throughout. Unfortunately, we hear the cavemen grunting and groaning, but there are no subtitles.I can imagine that many tuned in to see Raquel Welch in her early years. The needn't have bothered. This piece of Grade Z garbage is not worth your time.Giant spiders and turtles are funny enough, but only someone in the Creationist Society would have dinosaurs and men living together. And, even then the men are almost as tall as the T-Rexs! If that is not enough, they fight the T-Rexs with cheap spears and win! What a load of hooey! Stay away! Stay far away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So in order to see 10,000 BC,I figured I should check this out 1st. The effects while dated to say the least,were still pretty cool,in fact seeing the monsters attack were the most exciting things in this film,other then that,there's basically just a lot of grunting from the actors,and walking around with the characters fighting over stupid things,hell even seeing Racquel Welch's breasts gets boring after a while.The ending was definitely cool to say the least,I was impressed by the effects,the location&amp;scenery was also good,but that's really all the good I can say bout the film,it's cheapish looking and quite a chore to sit through half the time,So if you really wanna see this,go right ahead,I really don't see the need though,at that time it may have been something else,but now it's just a bore. Not recommended unless you have nothing really else to watch.The acting is nothing memorable thats for sure. Racquel Welch just basically grunts and screams,and lets her Breasts do the acting,she's quite gorgeous to look at,but her performance is nothing short of terrible.John Richardson Is the main focus of the film,but the film Doesen't give us a reason to give a damn bout him,why should we care that he survives,he's a caveman just like the rest,a ruthless savage,even though he's meant to look like the hero,a decent performance for what he's given but nothing more then that. Rest do their thing and grunt around.4/10</fullReview>

I don't mean to be a kill joy, but really...Alright, maybe the special effects were good for their time, but they're laughable now. That wouldn't make a difference if the plot were sensible, but it's not. Perhaps there is something compelling about a dumb caveman who has to over-come giant lizards, ridiculously proportioned dinosaurs and killer turtles on a desperate quest for survival, but it just doesn't cut with me. That's not to say that others aren't allowed to enjoy it, though. I'm just in a bad mood and want to rant about something. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is she sexy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always wanted to see Raquel Welch in this movie. The first time I heard about it, some 20 years ago, it sounded extraordinary. When I finnaly saw it this year, it was a total disappointment. This would be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Only the fact that I paid 15$ for it kept me watching, but with a lot of FF on the VCR. This movie is very pretentious. It has many interesting features, but basically it is badly done and without a coherent plot. The lack of language (no character speaks, but only hums) makes it quite incomprehensible. It is very clear that the movie was done for a white public, because all the good guys are blonde and all the bad guys (except the hero) are brunette. And finally, Welch's outfit is so unsexy (basically, a bikini made out of rags), that even this 'important' feature is omitted by the producers. Dear potential viewers, please don't waste your time on this movie!</fullReview>
