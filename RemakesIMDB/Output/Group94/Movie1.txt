		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best noir ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate formal film evaluation lists that ostentatiously rate the relative value of certain films, such as Citizen Kane for example. I do think Citizen Kane is a great film. But I also think that about fifteen or twenty other films I could quickly name are every bit as good as Kane in their own way. (Almost any Richard Gere movie, for example. Just kidding.)This brings me to D.O.A., directed by Rudolf Maté. D.O.A. in my book is the Citizen Kane of the noirs. It's so good that I often wonder about how it got made in the first place. Since many of the people who were involved in its production are now no longer with us, I may never learn anything about its origins. That's a frustration, of course, but the more important thing is that I can recognize a great noir when I see it.Why, you ask, is D.O.A. a great noir? The most obvious reason is its plot. A guy goes out for a night on the town and someone, a total stranger, slips him a mickey in a bar-a lethal mickey. But it doesn't kill him instantly. It kills him slowly, so slowly that he's given the chance to find out who did this terrible thing to him, and why.Second, the film is exceptionally well made in every other respect. Okay, the Pamela Britton character is one dimensional and embarrassing, we all agree on that, but who really cares when everything else in the film is so good? Edmond O'Brien had one of the best roles of his career in D.O.A., and he took full advantage, though few critics give his performance much credit for the film's success.O'Brien, a classically trained actor, plays a small-time Southern California businessman living his ordinary little life, minding his own business, regularly boffing his secretary (this was implied rather than made explicit; after all, this was 1949), and avoiding her whiney entreaties that they tie the knot, as he's been promising her he would do for ever so long.You can't help liking O'Brien in part precisely because of his human flaws. He's basically decent, but harassed, overworked, and stretched to the limit by the pressure put on him by Britton. What adult male couldn't identify with this man, or at least sympathize? His very insignificance as one more human ant on the planet Earth, and the terrible thing that's about to happen to him, are the essence of great film noir. (Detour, although by no means a favorite noir of mine, is nevertheless another perfect example of an ordinary man, a small-timer, minding his own business and unexpectedly colliding with Fate and all that it has in store for him.) We resonate to D.O.A. because fate and contingency have been the fundamental conditions of life on the planet earth since before the beginning of history. Our time on Earth is brief and our lives but little scraps of paper blown about by the wind toward endings we know not. We live noir lives.The film's particulars are wonderful. From the sunny hick town of Banning, the movie switches quickly to San Francisco. If ever there were a noir town, it's Frisco. (Hitchcock picked up on that real quick; watch Vertigo again to see how he saw the eerie side to that town, with its creepy deserted streets, little ghostlike fog-blown urban hills, and other abandoned places suggestive of loneliness and soullessness.)From here one great noir scene follows another in astonishing succession: the smoky, crowded jazz bar where the sweaty black musicians are blowing up a storm (to an all-white 1949 audience of course), while a murder is silently committed with a switched drink. The doctor holding the eerily glowing glass tube of luminescent poison and informing O'Brien, "You've been murdered." O'Brien running through the crowded downtown streets like a madman, as if velocity could help him escape his fate. O'Brien, after being shot at, a gun now in his own hand, looking for his killer in the abandoned processing plant. His encounter with Luther Adler's insane, sadistic henchman played by Neville Brand. Brand, speaking softly, glints of spittle in the corners of his mouth, nutty little eyes lighting up with anticipated pleasure: "I'm gonna give it to you in the belly. You're soft in the belly, aren't'cha? " Then the fantastic night scene in the crowded Los Angeles drugstore with Brand stalking him among oblivious customers-till shots ring out, then screams, followed by death. Finally, again at night, O'Brien's confrontation with his killer, which (inevitably) occurs in the Bradbury Building, that great architectural shrine to noir, scene of so many other noir films.Let's stop for a moment and go back to an earlier part of the film. Fatally poisoned, still not quite believing what has happened to him, exhausted and uncertain of anything, O'Brien has run for block after block, but now his energy has finally petered out and he finds himself alone near the docks. Utterly depleted, all hope lost, he wearily leans against the side of an old wooden newsstand in an otherwise bleak, abandoned area. Eyes glazing over, he's terrified, trying to catch his breath. During a medium close-up we briefly study him, then notice something to his left, a single long vertical row of magazines, all identical covers, arranged down the side of the kiosk just half a hand away from him. He isn't looking at them, isn't really aware of them, but we are. For just a few seconds we see: Life, Life, Life, Life, Life, Life, Life. Then the film quickly moves on and goes about its business, as if we had been shown nothing of importance.You tell me this isn't a great film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly brilliant thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the crappy 1980s remake starring Dennis Quaid, this is the real deal! From the fantastic opening sequence ("I want to report a murder" ... "Who was murdered?" "I was") to the inevitable end, this is an utterly brilliant thriller that will have you riveted to your seat! Edmond O'Brien, a great character actor who was in everything from the classic rock'n'roll movie 'The Girl Can't Help It' to Peckinpah's western masterpiece 'The Wild Bunch' (he played the old coot, you probably won't recognize him here), is the "hero" who is told he has been poisoned and has days, maybe even hours to live. He frantically tries to find out who did it and why. Some people complain that O'Brien's character isn't all that likable, but I think that makes the movie even stronger. When you DO find out the who and why it doesn't really make that much sense but I don't think it matters all that much in the end, the journey is the thing, and only a very picky Noir fan could be disappointed with this. On top of that, Neville Brand, who later in the 1950s played Al Capone in 'The Untouchables' TV series, and later still starred in Tobe Hooper's gonzo cult classic 'Death Trap' (a.k.a. 'Eaten Alive'), plays one of the most memorable screen villains of all time, the dim witted Chester, a real nasty piece of work! 'D.O.A.' comes with my highest recommendation. If you like thrillers you'll LOVE this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>extremely simple yet extremely effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best film noir flicks of all-time (along with The Killers). DO NOT CONFUSE THIS WITH THE REMAKE!! The film stars our unattractive hero, O'Brien, as the man who has been poisoned and is told he has only 24 hours to live. He has no idea who did it and spends almost the entire film tracking down the dirty rat that done him in. It's amazing how many wonderful noir films O'Brien appeared in over the years. The pacing is good, acting top-rate and very noir-ish, and it manages to pull so much out of a very simple plot with minimal sets. In other words, it gives a fantastic "bang for the buck" and modern filmmakers would really benefit from learning a lesson or two from DOA.I just checked the IMDb Top 50 Film Noir films and for some odd reason this film is not listed. How is this possible?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive Film Noir....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Bigelow: "I want to report a murder." Homicide Captain: "Where was this murder committed?" Frank Bigelow: "San Francisco, last night." Homicide Captain: "Who was murdered?" Frank Bigelow: "I was." It must be the dream of all directors to open a film with a scene or line which carries great impact and remains in the memory. The opening line in D.O.A must rank among the most dramatically effective and intriguing lines that has ever opened a movie. This is the quintessential film noir. Edmond O'Brien as the tough, hard drinking businessman who has grown tired of the normalcy of his life and the clinging Paula. His holiday in San Francisco is an opportunity to break the shackels. The premise that the hero has been given a slow poison for which there is no cure, and only a day or so to solve his own murder before he dies, is exceptional. We also have an array of sultry "bad girls", a seedy villain and a manic hitman. Rudoph Mate directs brilliantly, not missing a moment to twist and turn the action at a fast pace with no dull moments. Scenes of O'Brien running through city streets after he has learned his fate are superb with incredibly realistic wide shots. The fact that his direction is so effective makes one wonder how he could have allowed the lapses of ridiculous canned "wolf whistles" whenever the hero passed a good looking girl in the early scenes. Although these "wolf whistles" are really out of place and very annoying, the film is so effective that we can forgive the indiscretion. This is a classic example of a brilliant plot superbly told in a way that is still gripping 50 years after it was made. D.O.A. defines Film Noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a nifty/superb little film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the kind that doesn't kid itself at all- it knows what it is and is pretty happy to have it that way. It's filled with the classic tough-guy, 'real-to-life' dialog of the thriller, while staying a foot ahead of the audience. This is because the director, Rudolph Matte (the great cinematographer behind many a film-noir and Carl Dreyer's masterpieces) has such a clever hand of the material. One wrong step and it could slip into being too hokey. In fact there is a camp factor in a couple of scenes; the subject matter almost slips into Naked Gun parody before stepping back up for air. But for the fans of mysteries of today would want to check this out, as it provides a twist on the usual logic of the sub-genre (if a genre at all). While not as 'dark' as other film-noir pictures, it still ranks very high in it storytelling, having a potent enough story to tell, and a slew of actors just pushing the limits of the B-movie style.Edmond O'Brien is at his absolute best as the worried Frank Bigelow, worried because he's in a rotten predicament: poisoned by a random drop of 'luminous poison' at a jazz club, with no chances of survival. The one thing to do then is to investigate it, 'his' way, through searching the histories of men like Phillips and Rakubian. One has to pay attention to his story a few times, but after a while everything does come together, adding to the suspense. O'Brien doesn't play him very naturalistically- it's actually quite great at being a simply cinematic performance, with the occasional swagger, roughness, but determination of the best of the doomed heroes of these stories. There's soul in his work, even as he says lines fast or with such vigor to maybe go overboard. But it works, especially because of the other cast around him being so solid. Several are good, and a few are stand-out; Luther Adler as Majack gives some worth in his scenes, and especially a small but very memorable part for a nasty character, Chester, done to a T by Neville Brand (the little dialog scenes between them are as shamelessly pulp as any other film like this, but compelling and very entertaining).Aside from the merits of most of the cast, and Matte's visual approach (much of the outside running scenes and chase bits are shot right on location, like in a pre-guerrilla style of film-making), there's the aspect of the script. Stories like this are hard to come by now, even ones being almost this simple. At the same time, the screenwriters implement a kind of twisty logic that happens in the course of the film. The sort of MacGuffin lies in the bill of sale (as maybe I missed something) as it's the last thing to worry about. What one looks for in something like D.O.A., is how the written matter can go through the director's visual mind-warp. Under the radar in a sense, the film does some techniques that wouldn't of made it had it been a bigger A-list film. Two examples of this were striking to me, making D.O.A. of some note (this is besides the adept on-location work. One was the mix of shots shown in the jazz club scene, the musicians. This is a great, great little scene, adding a sense of atmosphere that another filmmaker would've passed over. Another was during a short scene when Bigelow arrives at the hostel- women pass by, and with each one a little sound effect comes through. This is whimsy, maybe, or maybe just some un-explainable little joke put into the film, but either way its terrific. When a filmmaker can add a little flavor to the film like that, it elevates the material.D.O.A. is on a short list of numerous writers regarding the histories of 40's-50's 'film-noir' pictures in America as one of the premiere examples, and it's not far from the truth. It's compact enough to not make Bigelow's strange mix of abrasiveness, confusion, and drops of tenderness to his secretary/love interest Paula, while allowing enough of a story to be told to make it feel complete. And that scene near the end in the hallway...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film in classic noir style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An exceptionally well thought-out and executed film noir. A man who is fatally poisoned with a slow-acting substance wants to discover who killed him -- and why. The answers seem pathetically insignificant compared to their repurcussions. O'Brien provides a solid "everyman" type leading performance that puts Gary Cooper and Glenn Ford's best attempts at the same to utter shame. Bev Garland puts in a good show too as a sort of misunderstood femme fatale in a minor key. Credit should go to director Mate and photographer Laszlo, who match the words and feelings of the story perfectly, neither showing us too much or too little at any time. The narrative force of this story is strong because it is focused on one man, with whom we can identify, who has been placed in an exciting, intriguing, and terrifying situation by events out of his control.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Better Print Helps This Unique Noir Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I started watching all the film noirs I could find, I was a bit disappointed in this. However, after three viewings I now find it decent. It's nothing super, but certainly better than what I though at first. A big help is having a better print of the film. This is one of those movies that always had a poor VHS quality transfer and many times the same on DVD. Finding a good print is hard, although I finally got a decent one with this Killer Classic DVD set that includes this movie.The story, like the print, is not always easy to follow, either, even though the premise is very simple. A man discovers he has been poisoned and there is no hope for recovery. Before he dies, he retraces his steps to find out who "murdered him" (even though he's still alive when saying that) and why. The story gets a bit complicated. Like a Sherlock Holmes or Charlie Chan mystery, there are a number of suspects that keep popping up. Many of them are hard to figure.This is an odd film noir for several quirky things in this movie. The lead character, "Frank Bigelow" (Edmund O'Brien), is strange and kind of stupid in the beginning. There are a half dozen of these dumb whistle-like wolf call sound-effects that come out every time he sees a pretty woman. It just doesn't fit in a tough film noir. Then there is his possessive girlfriend/secretary "Paula," (Pamela Britton) who is constantly calling him and paranoid about his whereabouts. She acts more like an insecure, nagging wife but she obviously cares a great deal about him. But, man, give the poor guy some space! The dialog in this film ranges from incredibly stupid to very clever and solid film noir material.We also see one of the most sadistic people I have ever seen on film: "Chester," played by the sadistic-looking Neville Brand. Wow, is this guy sick or what? He reminded me of "Vera" (Ann Savage) in "Detour." Those two would have made an interesting couple! Brand's character is only interested in one thing in life: inflicting pain and the slower and more brutal, the better.Anyway, if you find a good print, tolerate some of the goofy things in the film, this is an interesting film noir that gets better with each viewing, as you understand the story better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Shines Like Luminescence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DOA was made on the cusp of Edmond O'Brien's transition from leads to character roles and it may very well be his career part. It's a cheaply made thriller and it shows in spots. But it more than makes up for it in originality of plot and the performances of a superb cast of players.DOA involves nothing less than Edmond O'Brien solving his own murder. He's in some kind of business and as a sideline he makes a little extra money as a notary. He notarizes a bill of sale and in doing so is a witness to a piece of evidence that a man who was a party to the sale had no reason to commit suicide.But the perpetrator doesn't slip O'Brien something fast acting like cyanide. No he gets something called luminescent poisoning which is slow acting, but irreversibly fatal if not caught within a few hours of ingesting. When he learns what happens, O'Brien has nothing to lose in his hunt for his own killer.Best in the cast of supporting players without a doubt is Neville Brand who invades Lyle Bettger territory in playing a psychopathic thug in Luther Adler's employ. Adler himself is always good as are good girl Pamela Britton and bad girl Beverly Garland.The film was made on a shoestring, but occasionally those films can prove worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The poison that forms the plot of this movie does actually exist. However, one glass of it will not kill you unless it is VERY concentrated and then it would be glowing! I doubt if anybody would drink that stuff in such concentration. However, in the late 1920s and early 1930s a patent medicine was sold in the United States. It was called "Radiothor". It was a small amount of radium within water; sold in 1 oz bottles. A few bottles would not hurt you, but a few people bought quite a few of those bottles and drank them. They died slow, lingering deaths (it took months of agony before death released them). The man who marketed this product was put in prison and the Food and Drug Administration was created to keep this from ever happening again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>D.O.A. 1 and 2.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably Rudolph Maté's peak.When a B-movie reaches such heights,it should be called nothing but classic.The movie starts slowly,after a brilliant opening,then picks up speed and ends up leaving the spectator panting for breath.Like every film noir -why do they use a French expression for a typically American genre?-,it's very hard to catch up with the very complicated plot,although the cause for the fighting is laughable(a bill of sale).There are a lot of characters,male and female,but the scenarists manage to preserve cohesion.This film noir recalls the Greek tragedy,because we learn in the very first scene that the hero has been irremediably poisoned . Some scenes are particularly brilliant:the killer sadistically smiling,as he tells the hero he's going to kill him slowly,very slowly(the irony lies in the fact that he does not know his prisoner is really slowly dying);the short-lived reunion with his girlfriend;the funeral urn.The last line is the very title of the film.There have been very harsh words about the remake("color me dead"(1988)),featuring Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan.Probably unfair.It's no longer a film noir,but rather a whodunit,the plot -only the initial situation is the same- multiplies the wrong tracks .Quaid is a college professor and Ryan a student.So do not try to compare it with its highly superior predecessor,and you'll be able to enjoy it .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A forgotten classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not too sure if DOA should be classed as a forgotten classic. I am a bit of movie buff and I had never heard of it before. I came across it on the Internet Archive and was quite surprised at how good the movie is. The story itself is quite remarkable. Frank Bigelow (played by Edmund O'Brien) plays a small time accountant / lawyer who travels to San Francisco for time away from his somewhat nagging girlfriend.While Frank is in San Francisco his drink is spiked with a lethal poison by a mystery person. Frank does not know who the mystery person was, why his drink was spiked and why someone wants to kill him. Frank does not do what probably most of us would do in a similar situation - sulk, cry, get drunk, etc. Rather he sets out to find out who did this to him and why.Apart from a fantastic plot, the movie is very memorable for the collection of shady characters who Frank has to deal with in trying to find out who poisoned him, particularly the psychopathic Chester. One thing to note is that the plot is quite complicated. I found myself having to go back and watch scenes a second time to work out what was going on. So make sure you concentrate when you watch this movie.This is an excellent movie. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dissent From the Consensus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm generally partial to film noir, and D.O.A. is about as close to pure noir, at least in spirit, as a movie can be. But I don't like it and never did. Both the director and cinematographer have done brilliant work elsewhere, and the film is no no means incompetently made; but it's poorly written, has way too convoluted a plot, and is for the most part very badly acted. There are no likable characters in the film, and no engaging performances. I grant that much of the outdoor photography is excellent, and that the views of postwar California offer a sociologically fascinating and at times aesthetically striking picture of real life at a certain time and in a certain place. But such ancillary pleasures do not a good movie make.One of my chief problems with the film is its leading actor, Edmond O'Brien. When well cast, O'Brien could be excellent. He had a fine background in the legitimate theater and could play Shakespeare quite proficiently (as his Casca in Julius Caesar attests). But he is a dull hero. In D.O.A. his mere presence makes his hounded character absurd almost from the start. With Bogart, Ladd or even Dick Powell in the role the movie would have worked better, as these actors, whatever their limitations, were bona fide stars, and would have audience empathy just by showing up. O'Brien, while not a loathsome presence, isn't the sort of actor people care for. He is workmanlike as the unfortunate "hero", but there's no spark there, no reason, from a likability standpoint, to identify with him. My greatest concern for O'Brien was for the actor himself. As he was a heavy-set, beefy fellow, his running up and down stairs all the time made me worry that he might have a heart attack. The best thing about O'Brien, and one of the reasons he was never out of work, is that he was, in the parlance of Old Hollywood, a great dialog man. He always spoke clearly, never muffed his lines; and no matter how stupid the things he had to say might sound, he delivery was impeccable. In a lesser role, Luther Adler makes a tedious, predictable villain. It's the sort of performance Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt or George Macready could have delivered in his sleep. Adler tries hard, but is defeated by the script; and he is badly photographed and directed. There's no menace to him. As his henchman, Neville Brand is so obviously trying to give the kind of "dangerous" performance that put Richard Widmark over in Kiss Of Death a few years earlier, that he's impossible to take seriously. As the years went by he became a capable screen performer, but here his grinning and eye-popping, while fun to watch, just make him look silly. Pamela Britton is a dull love interest, and like O'Brien seems to be in the wrong film.How this film ever became a cult classic baffles me. I like dark cinema as much as the next guy, but I don't cherish films just because they're dark, or because they have doomed heroes, or are photographed at night, or offer brilliant, dandyish European villains. Such things had become clichés by the time D.O.A. was made anyway, and the formula was wearing thin. Noirs would continue to be made, fitfully, through the next decade, but in a different mode, more realistically than before, with greater subtlety. D.O.A. is caught between two modes. As it came out in 1950, it still has some of the Chandler-Woolrich feeling of the previous decade: dark cities, eccentric secondary characters, evil women, indifferent or corrupt cops, and an air of fatalism. Yet it also reflects the semi-documentaries of the postwar period in its location shooting and in the absence of much studio artifice, which ought, at least in theory, give it an air of hope, of modernity, which alas, its ironclad plot doesn't possess. It would take the talents of, among others, men like Phil Karlson, Don Siegel and Robert Aldrich to move noirs in a contemporary direction more appropriate to the times. Indeed, Aldrich seemed to have learned a thing or two from this film, which his later Kiss Me Deadly, though vastly superior, seems stylistically to be at times an homage to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reporting His Own Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In San Francisco, the accountant Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) goes to the Homicide Division of the Police Station to report his murder and the captain and detectives listen to his intriguing story.Frank has an accounting office in the small town Benny, on the way to Palm Spring. He tells his secretary and fiancée Paula Gibson (Pamela Britton) that he will travel alone to San Francisco to spend a couple of days on vacation expecting to have fun. Paul lodges in the hotel and befriends a group that is participating in the market week event. They go to The Fishermen and Frank is bothered by Sue, who is married with his host. Frank leaves the woman and meets the lonely socialite Jeanie and a man swaps his bourbon by another. Meanwhile Paula calls him telling that a man called Philip from Los Angeles wants to meet him. On the next morning, Franks wakes up with hangover and goes to the Medical Building and the doctors tell him that he had drunk luminous toxin poison that affects vital organs and there is no antidote. Frank rushes to the Southern Pacific Hospital and the doctors confirm the diagnostic and give one week of life maximum. Frank Bigelow decides to investigate the reason why he was poisoned in a quest to find the truth."D.O.A." is a film with the intriguing story of a simple accountant that comes to the police station to report his own murder. The plot has a complex development and an ironic motive for the murder ? the notarization of a bill of sale. Paula Gibson is irritating and annoying character. In 1988, I saw the good remake of D.O.A. with Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan and Charlotte Rampling. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "D.O.A. Com As Horas Contadas" ("D.O.A. With the Hours Counted")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small town California accountant goes to San Francisco for some R&amp;R before he gets married. One of his recent seemingly insignifigant business dealings back at the office that was filed away and forgotten comes back in a gruesome way when he's poisoned in a wild San Francisco bar which features a live jazz band and is filled with a lot of Beatniks hanging out and snapping their fingers. This film has vaulted to my personal favorite of Edmond O'Brien's films. It's truly a wonderful performance in which he carries his usual regular guy image and adds a lot extra to it, at one point running full speed on sidewalks and crossing busy streets to get back to the bar where it all began. In addition to O'Brien, Neville Brand is in rare form as a sadistic killer, and the two of them share a long night time car ride scene together as the film seems to propel itself into overdrive heading to the finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over his dead body</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great B-movie film noir, played as if his life depended on it (and it does) by Edmond O'Brien as a small-town notary who pays a big price for signing the wrong document at the wrong time, turning what should have been a pleasure trip to the west coast into a murderous affair altogether.It starts with a bang, O'Brien staggering into the local homicide unit to tell the cops that there's been a murder - his, before launching into the massive flash-back which takes up pretty much the rest of the movie. The action from there on is hectic and as convoluted as all the best noirs are as O'Brien, infected by a deadly poison, races against the clock to track down his own killer and the reason behind it.The film makes fine use of actual San Francisco and Los Angeles locations as well as authentically depicting the hot and steamy atmosphere at a Frisco jazz club. O'Brien is great as the doomed Bigelow, racing, often literally, against the clock, stopping only to palm off his adoring secretary girl-friend, Pamela Britten, who of course doesn't find out what's wrong with him until too late.The pacing is almost non-stop once it gathers momentum, unfortunately when it does, some of the scene-writing gets over-ripe and correspondingly over-acted as O'Brien and his girl pour out their hearts somewhat unnecessarily. The film ends bravely though with a downbeat conclusion, delivering what the title says it must and at least tying up all the loose ends by that time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The waking dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** Staggering into a L.A police station barely alive Frank Bigelow, Edmound O'Brien, has a story to tell about a murder that he witnessed, his own! It all happened two days ago when Bigelow was straying in San Francisco on vacation from his job as a tax accountant during Market Week. At the Fisherman Club Bigelow got a bit juiced up and during drinks he was slipped a dose of luminous toxin in his glass. It's that toxin that's now on the verge of killing him. The reason that he was poisoned had to do with him notarizing a bill of sale for a shipment of iridium that was stolen and could put the person who shipped it behind bars for at least five years!It took a while for Bigelow to realize that he had a fatal dose of luminous toxin in his system and by the time he did it was too late to save his life. But it wasn't too late for Bigelow to track down and find the person or persons who had him poisoned. And it's during the rest of the movie, in flashback, that's exactly what he did! And did it with an unrelenting fury as if his life depended on it!In what is undoubtedly Edmound O'Brien's best role as Frank "Biggie" Bigeow the film "D.O.A" has him move heaven and earth to find the person who eventually murdered him. From San Francisco to Los Angeles as well as parts in between Bigelow finally track him down to the Philips Inport-Export office at the Bradbury Building in downtown L.A. It in fact was Philips who was murdered, by being thrown to his death, because of the illegal iridium shipment that he later realized he was tricked into handling. With Philips dead the only person who could connect both his murderer and the person whom he shipped the iridium for is Frank Bigelow who handled, by notarizing the bill of sale, the shipment!Non stop action thriller as a dying, or murdered, man turns L.A upside down in trying to find his killer and exact punishment on him before he himself expires! Bigelow also gets involved with L.A mobster Majak, Luther Adler, whom the illegal iridium was delivered for. In knowing about Majak's involvement in it had Bigelow targeted by him and his sadistic and unstable hit man Chester, Naville Brand, for immediate termination. That's if the luminous toxin doesn't kill him first!Even though the movie is a scant 83 minutes long it packs enough action to fill some half dozen films of it's type: Film Noir Thrillers. Frank Bigelow is a man who knows that he hasn't long to live and therefore throws caution to the wind in trying to find his killer before the curtain comes down on him. It was in fact that almost suicidal determination on Bigelow's part that in the end brought him results!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iridium, Desperation &amp; Luminous Toxin Poison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D.O.A is a top noir with a "no way out" motif which provides tremendous impetus for the story of a man in pursuit of his own murderer. The action starts with the man going into a police station to report his own murder. This set up is so bizarre and memorable that any replication of it in another movie would immediately be recognised as a D.O.A homage or rip off.The man in question is Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien). The police are not surprised by his information and invite him to tell them his story.Frank runs a small business in the little town of Banning; he'd gone on a short holiday to San Francisco during "Market Week" and got caught up in the partying going on in his hotel. When a group of people went on from the party to "The Fisherman" club, he went with them. At the club, a man at the bar swapped Frank's unattended drink with another one. Frank consumed some of the drink but didn't finish it because it had an unpleasant taste.Next day, back at the hotel. he felt unwell and went to the Medical Building where one of his tests confirmed the presence of luminous toxin poisoning. He was told that this was fatal, there was no antidote and he had only a very short time to live. He went on to a hospital emergency unit where further tests confirmed the previous diagnosis and he was told that he only had a maximum of a week to live. The doctor deduced that he had been murdered and notified the Homicide Department. Frank panicked and raced out of the building and along a series of streets until he got to "The Fisherman" which was closed. Back at the hotel he found that the people he'd partied with had left. The only possible lead he had to help him find out who had killed him was that a man called Philips had been trying desperately to talk to him. Frank had not responded to his request because he didn't want to interrupt his holiday. A telephone conversation with Paula (his secretary / fiancée) confirmed that Philips had died. Frank then decided to go on to Los Angeles, where Philips' office was located to see if he could find out what he'd wanted to discuss so urgently.Through his investigations Frank found that Philips had purchased some iridium from a man called George Reynolds and sold it to someone called Majak. The iridium, which was very rare and costly, had been stolen. Philips was on bail and was facing a possible jail sentence unless he could show that his part in the deal was legitimate. He could've cleared himself if he could've produced the bill of sale which had been notarised by Frank. Further investigations revealed that Philips had not committed suicide but was murdered and his murderer had then poisoned Frank to prevent him from producing the document. Frank eventually confronted his killer before getting his revenge.D.O.A. provided Edmond O'Brien with the role for which he is best remembered and his depiction of Frank's descent into increasingly aggressive, brusque and desperate behaviour as his efforts to find his killer are met with a series of dead ends and complications, is suitably frantic and convincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic noir film with suspense and a first-rate starring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tale concerns about a lengthy flashback where the protagonist (Edmond O'Brien) after leaving his girlfriend (Pamela Britton ) goes to San Francisco . There is given an extremely slow-action poison . The starring relates his own murder and becomes himself in detective , spending his ending moments trying to uncover his hit men . As his time runs out , he has only hours to identify , he desperately seeks to discover who is responsible his death . The search for the suspect is further complicated by thrilling facts , numerous intrigues , deceits and confrontation against mobsters (Luther Adler , Neville Brand) . It's an exciting B-thriller of vibrating pace that unites various elements as the fatalism , cynicism , corruption with a noir vision of America from the time . The original title belongs the notes about the deceased person . Magnificent interpretation by usually secondary Edmond O'Brien as when he is frantically running by San Francisco streets . The scene in which he runs in panic through the streets after learning he has been poisoned was a stolen shot . The pedestrians had no idea a movie was being made and no warning that Edmond O'Brien would be plowing through them . Nice secondary cast , being film debut of Beverly Garland and Neville Brand . The film gets a good black and white (though available colorized) cinematography with some excellent close-ups (the jazzmen) by Ernest Lazslo . Atmospheric music by the classic Dimitri Tiomkin . The movie is well done by Rudolph Mate , a famous and habitual cameraman . It's followed by inferior remakes as ¨Color me dead¨ (1969) with Tom Tryon and 1988 version with Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan . The motion picture will appeal to dark noir movies fans . Rating : Notable and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting, Frenetic, Much-Imitated Film Noir Of Poisoned Man Trying To Find Who's Killed Him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a night out he feels unwell and goes to a doctor, who explains he's been poisoned and only has a few days to live. Reeling with shock, Bigelow desperately tries to uncover who is responsible and why before his number is up.D.O.A. has a killer opening - a guy walks into a police station to report a murder where he's the victim. The subsequent flashback structure is then doubly intriguing in that we know he's gonna get it and we share all his puzzlement over the details. The story, by writing partners Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene, exploits Frank's predicament to the hilt, throwing him into a dizzying conspiracy of theft, double-cross and infidelity with which he has only the most marginal connection. I love the way almost all the women in this picture seem to be cheating; the hoofer of a wife with Frank, the gossipy secretary with Stanley the brother, the exotic model with the victim, and that old stalwart, the grieving widow with her husband's killer. The only femme who isn't fatale is Frank's secretary Paula, although she's possibly the most needy female since Salome. Maté, a talented cameraman turned director (he shot Foreign Correspondent and Gilda and directed When Worlds Collide) makes the film's low-budget threadbare quality stylish, and the look clearly influenced Kubrick's early work. It does have some liabilities - once the story gets going it pops, but the first couple of reels are a bit turgid and aren't helped by some dated Beat Culture trappings and Dimitri Tiomkin's deafening score. Also, leads O'Brien and Britton are both a little pedestrian; they have some style but they're not remotely real people and the tale depends on us believing in them. The best performance for me is the completely over-the-top one by Brand as Chester the scary henchman - if you're not familiar with him, check out his heavies in movies like Riot In Cell Block 11 and Birdman Of Alcatraz - along with Richard Widmark and Timothy Carey he was arguably the craziest villain of his day. Note the use of the iconic Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles, where Halliday's office is located - it's also the setting for Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer's memorable duel in Blade Runner, and features in several other movies. This is classic film noir territory, and a must for all fans of the genre. Remade in 1988 with Dennis Quaid in the lead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic CLASSIC noir that features Edmond O'Brien chasing and being chased by nearly all the bad guys in 1950's San Fransisco. He's a notary adjuster, and when someone spikes his drink while on vacation in SF, instead of dying in peace or something, he's determined to figure out why someone would poison him! Of course, the shady people aren't cooperating, but luckily he has a brain (seems like I don't, he was able to pick up stuff I totally missed!) and he picks apart, piece by piece, the diabolical plot against him. Everyone in this is just DYNAMITE! The plot snaps and crackles at every turn, and I was HOOKED until the very last scene! Wow! Great entertaining movie here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>D.O.A delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first this on TV as a kid and have probably seen it a dozen times since then. Ask anyone to name a film noir movie or two and D.O.A is likely to mentioned simply because it has had a long TV life and so many generations of people have seen this. there is a reason why this is one of the most shown film noir flicks too, not because it is the best of the genre but because it is a good film with an instant hook to grab your interest and a great ride all the way through. Edmund o'Brien is great as the poisoned Frank Bigelow in search of his those responsible for his doomed plight and why they did it. look for fine performances by Neville Brand and Beverly Garland. Film music giant Dimitri Tiomkin provides the score. Two great cinematographers collaborate on D.O.A in Rudolf Maté and Ernest Laszlo. Maté who had done the cinematography for such films as Come and Get it, Foreign Correspondent, That Hamilton Woman, Gilda, and Sahara among many others takes the helm as director for this film and enlists Laszlo as cinematographer. Laszlo had a 50 year career in cinematography beginning in the 20's through the 70's including such films as Inherit the Wind, Kiss Me Deadly, Judgment at Nurenberg, Stalag 17, Baby the Rain Must Fall, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Airport. Logan's run and many many more. Good film editing here as well. I would give this an 8.5 out of 10 and recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ikiru with muscles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor Spoilers Herein. You have been warned. Frank Bigelow had gone on a guilt-ridden weekend vacation to get away from his nagging girlfriend. A few minutes into the vacation, he is poisoned, but doesn't find out until the next day when he starts feeling ill. What follows is his desperate attempt to find out who would want to kill a guy like him. But he has to do it in twenty-four hours. Bigelow is an ordinary guy with ordinary faults, much like Holly Martins in The Third Man. He seems an unlikely target to be murdered, especially by a poison so rare as "luminous toxin." In his action filled, plot-twisting investigation to find his murderer, Frank discovers painful truths about himself, and how strong his love is for Paula, the girlfriend. The movie often has laughable points because of its melodrama, yet there are some scenes that are surprisingly poignant. It inevitably reminded me of Ikiru... true, a noirish, over-dramatic, American Ikiru (and Ed O'Brien is no Takashi Shimura), but after I accepted the ridiculousness of it all, I was able to appreciate how much fun it was, and how much I was actually able to care about Frank Bigelow.There is a very long, 'we get the point' scene where Frank and Paula profess their love for each other. At the end of the movie (the main bulk of it was a flashback told by Bigelow to the police), Bigelow does indeed die, and utters his love's name one last time. Butlove between Bigelow and Paula (his secretary) seems very contrived. His love for her only blossomed when he realized he was dying. Paula obviously loves Frank, but Frank is holding on to Paula because he knows that he's dying and needs someone to love him in his final hours. The film, like The Third Man,raises the question of what it means to be dead. It begins with Bigelow in the police station, reporting a murder. When the police ask him who was murdered, he dramatically responds, 'I was.' The scene is unintentionally funny, as many are. But it is also very lovable. My grade: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent and gripping thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched D.O.A. and found it very gripping in parts.Frank Bigelow goes on a week long break to San Francisco but during this, he is poisoned with a luminous toxin by somebody for no apparent reason. When he goes to see a doctor, he is shocked to discover he has only days to live. So he sets out to find his murderer and the reason behind this. This takes him all over San Francisco. At the end (and beginning as the story is told mostly in flashback) as he arrives at a police station, he drops dead.The movie has some good location photography and a rather haunting music score.The cast includes an excellent performance by Edmond O'Brien (White Heat) as Bigelow, Pamela Britton as his fiancée, Beverly Garland (It Conquered the World), Luther Alder and Neville Brand.D.O.A. was remade in 1988, although I don't think it is so good as this version according to reviews I have read. I haven't seen the remake.D.O.A. is certainly worth a look at. Excellent.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First?class thriller, suspenseful and virtuously played, masterly directed, though fatalistic like a noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I want to settle a disputed question?the merits and value of Edmond O'Brien (35 yrs. in this role)'s performance; he was a formidable actor. He brings half of DOA's interest.DOA has several moments of very intense emotion, of undiluted emotion. It is a mystery thriller ,dynamic, suspenseful, sharp, enormously, tremendously enjoyable. It has some features that remind the noir conventions?first of all, its fatalist premise?the doom of an innocent man, victim, prey of an occupational hazard; then, the MALTESE ? traits?the group of bums that capture Edmond O'Brien. Yet there is much in favor of DOA?the fact that the mystery is not just a pretext for an incursion in the underworld;--the lack of cynicism;--the pure moments of poetry and emotion;--the light, funny comedic notes at the input of Edmond O'Brien's escapade ?.And there is an undeniable directorial brio and flair, a wonderfully maintained tempo ,a high sense of adventure and suspense. It is a movie you feel the need to share, to recommend to pals. (You might rightly conclude from the above that I refuse considering DOA as a noir, since it is so much more than the standard exponents and lessons of the noir?like DETOUR, etc..DOA has a diversity and a cordial attitude the noir usually do not possess. DOA is not noir, it surpasses the genre?it is much more than a noir ?.) DOA is very inventive, ingenious, and, stylistically, a delight. It is what the kids call a roller-coaster. Visually, DOA is spectacular and aw-some?former director of photography, distinguished collaborator of someone like Dreyer himself, then Hollywoodian cinematographer, Rudolph Maté proves a consummate director with DOA, movie that marked his beginnings as a director .Schooled in Europe, Rudolph Maté appears, if compared with someone like Ulmer or Mann, to be the most skilled and refined. There is, indeed, a manly refinement in the very concept of DOA. You can sense the wide experience and the technical expertise of the director. (During the same period, Mann ,not much younger than Maté, was directing He Walked By Night ?--there is a difference of scripts and concepts, yeah, but also one of skill and expertise!) Edmond O'Brien was so fine a lead! Handsome and virile, he had nonetheless a quite mean expression (in the way Bogart also had one).He played much finer than many of his more famous and awarded contemporaries. His role here is a marvelous achievement, a creation to be cherished, remarkably competent.'DOA' is one of the finest, and O'Brien's performance, especially good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edmond O'Brien, who later would win awards for his performances in "The Barefoot Contessa" and "Seven days in May" gave an outstanding performance as a man who was poisoned and spent his remaining time trying to find out who did it and why. Turns out it was just one of those unfortunate deals of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, but he is dead anyway.Pamela Britton, who would find later acclaim as Blondie and a regular on "My Favorite Martin" gave a passionate performance as his ditsy girlfriend.This was classic film noir and the score was terrific. It really added to the suspense of the film. It should also be noted that the depiction of jazz musicians was a bit racist. The camera angle made them all look as if they were on drugs. Maybe that was common then. It bears more investigation.It is always good to go back to the beginning to see how a film was first handles. Now, I will take another look at the 1988 version with Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan. I have seen it, but need to refresh my memory. Last years "Crank" with Jason Statham is a modern version of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad booze and a bellyache.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unrelenting Rudolph Mate film noir that tunnels deep into the underside of urban bleakness, but crests at the top of the genre's ring of royalty. Edmund O'Brien is Frank Bigelow, C.P.A., and all around swell fellow. But Bigelow--a great noir name--has a small problem. Perhaps a little indigestion and heartburn from a night of carousing? No--more serious. He visits a doctor and he tells him he's been poisoned. Luminous poisoning. We know this because the good doctor turns off the light and the test tube glows in the dark. Bigelow gets a second opinion. Same results. He's told he has a week to ten days (tops) to live. Bigelow turns tail and spends the rest of his life (and the movie) seeking his killer. Bigelow bounces and careens off the city landscape like Roger Rabbit on speed. The despair and cynicism of a modern metropolis is bored into like a doctor's syringe that is thrust into a patient's bone marrow during a spinal tap. At the Fisherman's Bar in San Francisco, Bigelow is slipped a Mickey Finn while chatting up a female hipster. From that very first lethal sip from a spiked drink, his humdrum occupation and clingy girl friend are all but a distant, fog-shrouded memory. His journey through Los Angeles' dark streets and its even darker denizens, puts his life in serious peril. He doesn't care. He doesn't have anything to lose. He no longer has to be polite or gentlemanly toward women. He has no trouble manhandling the broads he comes in contact with if it may help his cause. One has a great line: "If I was a man I'd punch your face in." Or something like that. Composer Dimitri Tiomkin's somber and, at times, quirky score (punctuated by wolf calls on a slide flute whenever the lead character spots an attractive dame), works fine in the long run. But Bigelow's run will be short. His penultimate line of dialog in the movie is simple but filled with confusion and regret: "All I ever did was notarize a bill of sale." Never has film noir been so fatalistic-- but true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Bigelow is in San Francisco for a break away from his fiancée, after a night on the town he wakes up and feels a bit under the weather, after consulting a doctor he is told he has been poisoned by a luminous toxin and only has a few days to live. This sets Frank off on a furious journey to find out who is responsible, and why?Thus is the story of this cracking mystery thriller, Edmond O'Brien is Bigelow and layers it perfectly, from Frank's calm soaking in of the events to the frantic slam bangery as he draws closer to his goals, it's a great show. The pace is perfect from director Rudolph Maté as he eases us gently thru the first third, and then ups the pace to keep us alive to the fraught nature of Bigelow's plight. Genuine menace drops into the picture in the form of Neville Brand's hit-man Chester, whilst Pamela Briton as Paula Gibson is a solid female presence in amongst the grimy feel of the story.Hugely enjoyable. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the classic noir thrillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the great noir thrillers, and begins with Edmond O'Brien going to report his own murder to the Homicide Bureau. He has been poisoned with a radioactive isotope of iridium and has only moments to live. This was one of 1950s films dealing with the sinister aspects of radioactive materials, the most famous being 'Kiss Me Deadly'. It is more relevant to today than it was to 1950, as we have seen with the poisoning of a Russian dissident in London by one of Putin's thugs (now a member of the Duma, which tells us all we need to know about Russia today), using the radioactive substance polonium. It was probably because of his magnificent performance in this film that three years later Ida Lupino chose O'Brien to star in her devastating drama 'The Bigamist', which was perhaps his greatest role. It was O'Brien's convincing 'ordinariness' that made him so valuable in certain parts where the character must not be thought to be acting as he does, or experiencing what he does, because of some exceptional quality which he possesses. O'Brien was, in short, a truly brilliant 'everyman', which makes films like this all the more harrowing, as it could be you or me or anybody who has this happen to him. There is a stunning performance from Pamela Britton as O'Brien's clinging and hysterical girlfriend. Neville Brand is absolutely terrifying as a sadistic psychopath who 'is only happy when he is inflicting pain' and who 'likes to see blood', according to Luther Adler, who hires him and strokes his face lovingly when he threatens to kill people, as some people love their attack dogs best only after they have killed a poodle. The direction by Rudolph Mate, cinematography by fellow-Hungarian Ernie Laszlo (whose most famous triumph was 'Ship of Fools'), music by Tiomkin, and the editing are all superb. This is how it is done, folks. O'Brien may have walked into the police as a 'dead on arrival' case (DOA), but this film is an LOV, 'live on viewing', and will never slacken its pulse, no matter how many times you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ohhhh, Yes!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is it!! As far as I'm concerned, this is the ultimate film noir. This classic set the standard by which all other films, that are included in the "noir" category, must be measured. Forgive me for gushing, but this picture has it all. It had the unsuspecting protagonist, the sweet ? stand by your man, no matter what ? girl, the dangerous femme-fatale(s). It had the smoke filled nightclub, the hypnotic jazz music, the dimly lit atmosphere ? creating the foreboding sense of shadowy gloom and danger, the realization (of the protagonist) that he had been targeted, the various stages of grief, and then the dizzying/frenetic pace in the quest for retribution/justice? Frank Bigelow was the man among "noir" men.When I saw D.O.A. for the first time, several years ago, I was not aware of the term "film noir", but I did notice that this was a film that was more than your usual, garden variety "crime drama/mystery" fare. It made me sit up and take notice of the movie's pacing, the manner in which the photography was almost like an additional character (through the use of shading), and, most particularly, the behavior/desperation of Edmond O'Brien's Frank Bigelow. The direction was tight, and the script was crisp. I was so impressed by the characterization, of a man driven to the point of no return, that I never forgot how seeing the film made me feel many years later.One of the entertaining touches in the film is how Bigelow behaves, once he realizes that he is "dead". Shouldering the knowledge that he could "drop" at any minute, he charges onward, undeterred and fearlessly, in his pursuit of the wrongdoers. He can now say anything he chooses to say. What are they going to do, kill him, again? The final scene, in the police station, is almost impossible to top.Due to that incredible experience, I have become an avid enthusiast of the films so categorized. I have done extensive research on the subject matter. I chose to do essays, and various research papers, while in school, on the subject of film noir. Needless to say, I have several "noirs" on my all-time list of films (some of the finest movies ever made are in this category, in my opinion), but D.O.A. stands out as the best of the lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. The first time I saw it, I stayed with it to see how it played out. The second time, I watched it for the little period details; the now 'retro' neckties; the goateed hepcat at the bar where O'Brien gets 'the drink'; the street scenes of a vanished San Francisco.Ever notice how many great movies were shot in San Francisco? I think 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'Dark Passage' were filmed there as well as the Hitchcock classic 'Vertigo' and of course, 'Bullitt'.Yes, the story line was implausible, but it's purpose was to entertain and it certainly does that. Something about this movie must have grabbed film makers to have spawned two remakes.Bit of trivia:Pamela Britton, (Paula the love interest) also played Mrs. Brown the landlady in the TV comedy series My Favorite Martian. That series starred Bill Bixby &amp; Ray Walston.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior noir thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The excellent Edmond O'Brien stars in this nifty story as Frank Bigelow, a small town tax accountant who goes on vacation in San Francisco. During a night of partying, he is stealthily administered a slow acting luminous toxin, which will kill him at any time during the next two weeks - possibly within the next 24 hours. Once he finds out, the panicked Frank becomes coldly determined to find out who could possibly want him dead. After all, who is he? A small time accountant. Soon he will be encountering an assortment of suspect individuals, and running for his life."D.O.A." benefits from a snappy (and not too hard to follow) screenplay by Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene, not to mention a real grabber of an opening. Frank goes to the police station, where the following exchange occurs: "I want to report a murder." "Who was murdered?" "I was." From then on, you know you're going to have a fun time with this briskly directed (by Rudolph Mate) and paced film. Its action scenes and atmosphere are top notch, and there's an undeniable tension building throughout the scenario. Once Frank learns that he has been poisoned, that's when the story really kicks into gear.O'Brien is completely believable as an average guy turned tragic hero. Pamela Britton is appealing as the co-worker who loves him, and the rest of the cast is equally fine. Particularly noteworthy are the charismatic Luther Adler as a smooth criminal named Majak, and the young Neville Brand - in one of his first films - as a trigger happy, psychotic, ultra creepy muscle man. Brands' character Chester is so eager to end Franks' life even earlier that it's scary. The ladies are lovely: Ms. Britton, Beverly Garland, Lynn Baggett, Laurette Luez.This is a real corker, one worth watching for any lover of classic cinema. It's just too bad that it ended up in the public domain, where the many bargain basement DVD releases don't do it any favours.Remade in the 1960s (as "Color Me Dead") and the 1980s.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>D.O.A.: A convoluted mystery that gradually builds to a frenetic pace.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of film noir should see this one, as this film is up there with the best.It's a story about how a simple act can lead to disaster ? in this case, death. If you've not seen it, I'm not about to tell you much except this: it has perhaps the most imaginative beginning for any murder mystery ever devised as Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) fronts up to the Homicide Bureau in Los Angeles to report a murder ? his own! Thereafter, the story traces Frank's attempts to find out who is trying to kill him, and why. One of the best pieces of irony is when, having learnt that he will die soon, Frank runs and runs until he's out of breath and stops, panting, beside a newsstand where there are multiple copies of Life magazine hanging there, just beside him. The director, Rudolph Mate, had a real insider joke with that shot.And that long tracking shot, by the way, was an excellent example of how to use fast camera work and great editing.On another level, the movie very much fits the times vis-?-vis the portrayal of evil and where it leads: retribution is always just around the corner for those who transgress society, even if you think you're justified. When you see this movie, you'll know what I mean.And, for the times, the acting was good, with a standout performance from Edmond O'Brien, and ably supported by the ever-competent Luther Adler (as Majak, the sharp dealer in stolen goods), and Neville Brand, as the psychopathic Chester. The rest of the cast was adequate. The only jarring note (no pun intended) are the peculiar and bizarre wolf-whistles (inserted by some demented sound engineer?) that accompany Frank Bigelow as he looks at women in his hotel at San Francisco. What was the director thinking of...?That aside, it's a good, fast-paced action mystery that helped to keep the film noir genre very much alive. Have a go...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast-paced Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it's a thriller and it HAS to be fast paced because poor Frank Bigelow (O'Brien) only has 24 hours to live. He's an innocent law-abiding citizen from Banning, CA, who takes a vacation in San Francisco. (The St. Francis. Whatever he does for a living, it pays well.) When he wakes up after his first night in the city he finds he's been poisoned by a "luminous toxin". To demonstrate the fact, a doc shuts out the lights and the tube of what must be presumed to be chyme glows in the dark. Very dramatic.O'Brien spends the rest of the movie tracking down the persons responsible for his death -- and, man, it is a tangle of thorns. I got lost in a few places. Something to do with an illegitimate scheme to sell iridium, which I always thought was to be found in meteors or someplace. O'Brien has been murdered because he once notarized a bill of sale that could incriminate a gang of ruffians and thieves.Among the ruffians and thieves is Neville Brand in what is probably his best role. He is lean and mean here, more animated than in later roles, and less sullen. (Although I liked him in "Cry Terror" too.) He is brutish and dumb. He has the features of some Bulgarian pederast. His hair is coarse and its locks slide around on his forehead as if greased. His eyes shift back and forth. And when he is about to cause someone pain he grins widely and shows us a mouthful of great big chiclets. "I think I'll give it to you in the belly," he gloats while taking O'Brien for a ride.O'Brien left his girl friend back in Banning and, when he realizes he's dying, he finally comes to terms with the fact that he loves her as much as she loves him. That is, he'd be willing to "commit" in the current code if it weren't too late. Pamela Britton as Paula has a role common to these kinds of films -- blonde, plain but attractive, devoted, efficient, cheerful, brave, kind, thrifty, and reverent. Probably helps old ladies across the street. How extraordinarily dull. Maybe that's the way it was in 1950. Today's modern man likes them beefier, with a black tattoo of barbed wire across their upper arms, and another of a huge dark-green mothlike creature perching on their coccyx. Their hair should come in at least three designer colors, two of them resembling fuschia and chartreuse. A spike collar helps.Where was I? Poor O'Brien. He doesn't get past Stage Two of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's five stages of dying. First Denial. The script gives him a lot of help here. "You're CRAZY! That's it -- you're a couple of PHONIES!", he screams at the doctors who give him the bad news that he's only got 24 hours left. Stage Two: Anger. First he runs through the streets of the city, from Parnassus Hill to the Embarcadero. Then he stops, pauses, sets his jaw grimly, and stalks off to find his murderers.The fact that he has such a short time to unravel the complicated scheme behind his poisoning forces the pace of the film. O'Brien must have lost ten pounds while running around. He has no time to be polite so he pushes people in mourning around and snarls at strangers. In fact, his impending demise subjects the plot to demands that it can't logically meet. He travels all over the place in those 24 hours, including flying spontaneously from San Francisco to L.A. Things that would take you and me a day to accomplish he seems to zip through in a few minutes.The score is one of Dmitri Tiomkin's less inspired ones although the usual marching-band dramatics are immediately recognizable. Someone in the Sound Dept. must have gotten the bright idea of using one of those sliding whistles, maybe a new instrument at the time, because there are some jarring uses made of it near the beginning. I wish I could remember the name of that instrument. Snoopy? No, that's a dog.It's an interesting twist. A movie that opens with a guy wanting to report a murder -- his own. And it really IS fast, so that the holes in the plot don't register all that much. D.O.A. is often cited as a classic noir but I don't know why. It's a murder mystery with a twist. It isn't a classic but it's engaging enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense and the perfect 'ticking clock' plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film noir genre threw out plenty of gems during its peak in the 1940s and early 1950s and this is one of them, a solid detective story with a great premise. In it, a man must discover the person responsible for his own murder, a plot point realised thanks to the presence of a slow-acting poison that gives him only a day or two to live.D.O.A. presents a bleak and icy narrative that has a strong degree of pessimism to it, thanks to that excellent premise. But there's more to it than that, as the actual detective story is compelling in itself. The protagonist finds himself drawn into a murky world of smuggling and corporate corruption, while at the same time coming into contact with some decidedly shady characters.The best thing about the film, for me, (aside from that premise) is the presence of Neville Brand's Chester, a character who could have been portrayed as an ordinary henchman but who, thanks to his psychotic nature, becomes the real highlight; Brand effortlessly exudes an air of pure evil in what was his first role. The rest is good too, of course, particularly Edmond O'Brien's tough-but-sympathetic lead, leaving this one of the highlights in a crowded genre thanks to that perfect 'ticking clock' premise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is classic, low budget film noir, with terrific actors and a gripping story. One of Edmond O'Brien's best performances. The director, Rudolph Mate, was a famed Polish/Hungarian cinematographer who worked with Karl Theodor Dreyer on "La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc," and had many other principal photography credits on American films like "Gilda," Hitchcock's "Foreign Correspondent," the superb Alexander Korda film "That Hamilton Woman," "Dodsworth," with one of Walter Huston's best performances, "To Be or Not to Be," "The Pride of the Yankees," and Orson Welles' "The Lady From Shanghai." The pedigree for this film is amazing. And it's a far better film that the silly Dennis Quaid/Meg Ryan "remake" done a few years ago.This one is a collectible for long-time noir fans, a must see if you've never seen it before. Definitely a TEN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film noir that is alright I guess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D.O.A is a 1950's film noir all about a man who has been poisoned and we see him then trying to find out who did it and why. It's a film that could almost feel like something from Hitchcock but no it comes from Rudolph Maté a most of the time cinematographer who had directed also though in the previous few years to this. Maté manages to create a story that is interesting but not really in my opinion one that is a classic, different yes but it feels the whole gimmick overrides this to make it look and feel like it should be a classic. Nevertheless this movie is not boring at all, with a decent running time as well it whizzes by quite nicely and the whole plot wraps itself up in just over 80 minutes.It stars Edmond O'Brien as Frank Bigelow the man who has been poisoned, he has no idea why because he has no obvious enemies and he doesn't even know where he was poisoned. Pamela Britton, William Ching and Luther Adler join O'Brien in the cast and most do a good job but I couldn't help feel the acting is just a little bit too shaky. I just felt at certain points when the script throws up some quite dramatic part, the actors kind of go a bit over the top with what they've got, no one fails in this film but it is only some scenes are ruined by none believable acting though.Rudolph Maté uses the script from Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene to make a very fast yet efficient film, it never gets too bogged down in its own story and although it can open up too many avenues of investigation, it still comes to a conclusion that makes sense. Maté works well with the cast at his disposal and also uses his skills with the camera to make this feel even faster then it really is, some scenes look great though even if the camera is moving about extremely fast. I also liked the bad people or person(could be either,no spoilers) in this, of course I will not claim who they are so I do not ruin for possible readers of this but although they are not superbly evil, they definitely have a ruthless streak waiting to come out.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys well film noir, I still don't think many will find this near being a masterpiece although I am sure some will enjoy it massively more than I did. I must say though I did pretty much enjoy this myself though, I never quite felt wrapped up in this mystery, you know edge of your seat kind of stuff but I did at least want to see what happened next and who was responsible and that makes this a pretty decent film from my view. Whether Maté was a better director or cinematographer well that is for those who have seen all his work to decide, he certainly manages to tell a story here and make it come across as more than just your average tale of mystery or a whodunit, he makes it OK and that is all that is needed. And so overall as said I felt it to be pretty good but not completely well, good, a movie that maybe is not the absolute best but certainly one I would tell people to go and watch.</fullReview>

The Continuous Over-the-Top and Cringe Inducing Musical Score from Dimitri Tiomkin Betray the Surreal and Expressionistic Aspects of the Movie with Silly (wolf whistles) and Sappy (violining the love moments). It is the Film's Biggest Misstep.All of the Scenes with Edmond O'Brien's Girlfriend, Either on the Phone, the Beginning, or in The End, are Intrusive at Best and Intolerable at Worst.These Things Would Sink a Lesser Movie and Irritate So Much that it Couldn't Recover. But This One is So Full of Great Stuff that Overall these Remain Inconsequential. The Great Opening Premise, the Scene at the Jive Bar, On the Street Locations, the Blistering Pace, Neville Brand's Sadistic Psycho, Tough Talk, and a Rather Intricate Interwoven Plot are Some of the Things that Make This One of the Great B-Movies and an Essential Entry in the Noir Canon.Symbolism (the "Life" magazines), Post Nuclear Paranoia (radiation poisoning), Odd Camera Work, and a Conflicted Everyman Literally Doomed by Circumstance ("All I did was Notarize a Bill of Sale."), are Some Others.

		<shortDescription>A Classic Film Noir from the 50's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Frank Bigelow" (Edmond O'Brien) is a single man who works in a small town in California as an auditor and also and serves as a notary public as well. Anyway, this film begins with him walking into a Los Angeles police station and telling the chief of police that he would like to report a murder. He then goes on to say that he is the victim. Obviously, wanting to hear more the chief asks him to sit down and once he does Frank begins to tell the story of how he was given a toxic dose of poison while at a nightclub in San Francisco which has eventually led him to where he is. Now as far as the overall movie is concerned I thought that it had all of the elements of a classic film noir from the 50's--good mystery and plenty of suspense along with some decent acting by both Edmond O'Brien and Pamela Britton (as Frank Bigelow's secretary "Paula Gibson"). In any case, all things considered I rate this film as above average and recommend it to anybody who might be interested in this particular genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Yeah, you got it, Bigelow!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite Edmund O'Brien film. What makes him so enjoyable in this is that you can tell he really enjoys acting; he just puts his heart and soul into every part he ever played; the passion and emotion are always there. He loves his craft. I don't think D.O.A. is film noir, as it seems to be almost a parody of film noir (notice how deliberately hard-boiled all the characters are (well, except loving, loyal, sweet Pamela Britton as his true love, though he doesn't know it yet) and call O'Brien's character always by his last name, Bigelow, even the less than diplomatic doctor who, coming out of his lab to confirm luminous poisoning and holding up the vial, says, "Yeah, you got it, Bigelow". So much for bedside manner. I love Luther Adler here; he really is menacing in that Mad Magazine way; remember, fellow Boomers, when Mad ran that piece about how movie villains are somehow always polite and the hero is always rude and hostile? Well, here Adler does that perfectly; after giving him to "Chester", he intones, "Forgive me". Memorable B-movie in every respect; great location shooting, great use of sound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous Metaphor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D. O. A. is an intriguing, fast paced movie, rife with metaphor. A mood of chaos and uncertain boundaries is introduced early in the film. At a hotel in San Francisco, businessman Frank Bigelow, seeking little more than the ephemeral pleasure of a brief trip, finds himself in the midst of party revelers. With unsettling frivolity, they roam randomly about their various guest rooms which appear unlocked and opened. The mood of strident, forced conviviality climaxes when they move the party to a local bar called "The Fisherman." As the jazz played in the venue intensifies in volume and rhythm, uneven camera angles catch the various musicians playing to the point that they're breaking sweat and literally, physically vibrating. Bigelow himself is jostled about in the crowd, actually losing his footing for a moment. The setting is that of a little world both frenzied and crazed. Bigelow appears detached as all react excitedly and emotionally to music that he admits isn't his taste.This memorable key scene portends his disconnection from those around him and represents a crack, however slight, in his life's foundation. Though initially reticent about socializing and imbibing with people he just met, he has unwittingly been thrust into a reality more threatening than is immediately apparent. Later in the film, a jarring example of his full blown isolation occurs when he finds himself in an outdoor, public area. In unbearable turmoil, he momentarily encounters a little girl innocently playing with a toy. She appears in soft lighting, contrasting starkly to the shadows surrounding Bigelow, whose face registers the painful shock of awareness that ordinary activity continues unabated even while he grapples with extreme danger. This is reinforced when seconds later he observes a young couple embracing, compounding his agonizing realization that all simple pleasures are now unattainable to him. Noticeably, when he is literally "up against the wall" his back is touching signage of "Life Magazine" logos. All that once comprised his own life, that which he had considered to be little more than mundane minutiae, is heightened in significance and irrevocably at stake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I don't think you fully understand Mr. Bigelow, you've been murdered."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've known about this movie for years but only got around to watching it today; I wish I hadn't waited so long. The film grabs you right from the outset, as Edmond O'Brien's character Frank Bigelow rushes in desperation to unravel the mystery behind his own murder. At first, I thought the luminous toxin ordeal was a contrivance invented for the film, but the movie closes with an assurance that such a poison actually exists. One learns something every day.There are some great scenes in "D.O.A.", not all of which are critical to the plot. The jazz riff at The Fisherman in particular is especially enjoyable, sweat gleaming off the brow of the frenetic trombone player and his fellow musicians, a "jive crazy" moment worthy of comment by the bartender. This is where it all starts, as Bigelow is slipped a mickey by an unknown figure who we'll recognize later by his curiously identifiable upturned collar.The see saw nature of Frank's frantic search is personified by his race through the streets of San Francisco at breakneck pace. I wonder how many takes were needed to complete that entire piece, O'Brien doesn't look to be in that kind of shape.The crux of the plot involves a bill of sale that accountant Bigelow notarized some six months earlier. Entirely insignificant at the time, the paperwork can exonerate a businessman of a fraudulent transaction if it can be produced. In an ironic twist of fate, the iridium that changed hands in the transaction is now responsible for Bigelow's impending doom.Besides O'Brien, memorable performances are turned in by Pamela Britton as his needy girlfriend Paula Gibson, and Neville Brand in a greatly over the top turn as a henchman for a low life named Majak (Luther Adler). Brand's character Chester is just brimming with a malice that oozes, there's none of the subtle Peter Lorre type hostility here. As for Paula, her clingy personality made it entirely reasonable why Bigelow needed to take a week vacation without her in the first place.Though we know the actual outcome of the story right from the start, one can't help hoping that something will dramatically occur to rescue Bigelow from his plight. But it can't be any more final, as large block letters "D.O.A." are stamped on his case file at the film's close. I'm just glad we didn't have to deal with Paula's reaction when she learns the news.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best concepts for a film noir or even any film in general. It reminded me of Ida Lupino's The Hitch-Hiker, taking an interesting concept and creating a great B-film that wouldn't necessarily have been any greater if given a higher budget. The film's rawness and grittiness works to its advantage, as it can with most noirs. The cinematography was very good. The rushed pacing of the film both helped and hindered. Once Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) learns he has been poisoned the pace immediately speeds up, but it seems as though the tension rarely relaxes so it can be allowed to build back up. For example, this could have been achieved by having other characters who were unaware he had been poisoned bring him into situations where he had no control over how quickly they helped him. Even the scenes when Bigelow is talking on the phone with Paula (Pamela Britton) as she prods him with questions, the pacing still seems to be just a little too hurried. By dragging the scenes out, the sense of urgency might have been amplified. Of course, one could equally argue that the relentlessness is entirely appropriate. Being that I've only seen the film once, it is hard to say until I watch it again. Overall, it's an intriguing film that hooks the viewer's attention from the opening scene and won't let go until the end. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film has a great opening hook. A man shows up at a police station to report a murder - his own. Well that got my attention. But then the next few minutes almost ruined it for me. The following scenes after the police station include some bad acting, soap opera type material - especially with the sappy secretary who whines and nags. But I thought, okay I'll give it a little time. It does eventually get going, but still has some annoying traits. Particularly the sound effects whistles every time the lead character sees a pretty woman.My biggest problem was the convoluted plot and murky characters. While I do like a movie that has some complexity and layers to solve, I don't like it when it gets too complicated and hard to figure out who all the suspects are and what they have to do with the victim. The players involved get confusing as the plot goes in one direction, then another. I just wasn't clear in how it all fit together in the end. I'm still not sure how Rakubian, Phillipos and Mrs. Rakubian fit it.But faults aside, there are some good points. Like the superb cinematography that only could be effective in the classic black and white like a true noir film should be. I loved the scene where he is running through the streets of San Fransisco after he gets the fatal diagnosis. I also loved the setting for the climax scene between Bigelow and Halliday in that dark office building with the great wrap around balconies - very effective in helping convey the mood.There is some overacting to be had in this film. Obviously the whiny secretary gets to be a little over the top. Also, the scene where he bursts into the emergency hospital unit - I thought the doctor and nurses in that scene gave very exaggerated performances. I also felt that when Bigelow finally succumbs in the end in the police station, he literally throws himself on the floor which was not at all a believable reaction. The ending title screen with "the medical facts in this film are authentic.luminous toxin is a descriptive term for an actual poison" was a cheesy way to close a classic Noir film. But that's just my opinion.Overall, it is still worth watching if you can look past the shortcomings and can manage to follow along with the plot. I only watched it one time, so maybe it takes multiple viewings to understand and truly appreciate this classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead on Arrival.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edmond O'Brien plays Frank Bigelow an everyman type who enjoys his vacation away from work and girl-friend when he gets poisoned with some sort of luminescent toxic substance in a jazz club in San Francisco. He then spents the rest of the movie trying to find who "murdered" him and why. The opening scene - a long tracking shot of Bigelow entering police HQ and announcing to a homicide detective that he has a murder to report, "who was murdered?"/ "I was..." - truly matches the idea behind DOA in terms of originality and is surely one for the ages in the film noir universe. What drags DOA down a notch or two after such a promising start is the incredibly convoluted story and the occasional silliness that feels out of step in a movie revolving around a character who is investigating his own death. The occasional silliness I'm talking about involves wolf-like whistling sound effects whenever Bigelow comes across beautiful women in a San Francisco hotel - what the hell were they thinking? It also involves some of the most sappy and melodramatic dialogue ever caught on celluloid - "Ohh I never realized how much I love you.."/ "I love you so much". Even though there is subtext behind it that makes the overt sentimentality a bit justified (Bigelow is dying and that's probably the last time he'll see his girlfriend), more restraint would have worked miracles. That's early 50's high melodrama soap for you I guess. Add to that the intrusive score by Dimitri Tomkin that in certain scenes is content to just clang away aimlessly, rendering any sort of emotional punctuation impossible, and one quickly realizes that DOA is far from an "essential" film noir. The premise behind it is great, but the execution is flawed.Of course that shouldn't stop film noir enthusiasts from checking it out. Even as flawed as it is, DOA still packs quite a punch. It might take some time for the dust created by the convoluted plot to settle, but when all the twists and turns are over it is quite rewarding. The exterior shots, done on location, add an air of authenticity to proceedings that reminded me of Blast of Silence and the work of Cassavetes. Add to that some very good long tracking shots that make sure the movie never feels stifled, and DOA scores good points on the visual department. O'Brien is right on the money on his role as the determined, gruff, doomed hero and most of the cast turn in good performances...Gripping, fatalistic, with moments of pure noir brilliance, DOA is well worth checking out for genre fans, even as flawed as it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>D.O.A. (Rudolph Mate', 1950) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent noir arguably gives burly leading man Edmond O'Brien his best ever role (followed perhaps by that in another little-seen noir, Hubert Cornfield's THE THIRD VOICE [1959]) and it may well also be celebrated cinematographer Mate''s best directorial effort; regrettably, several years ago I passed on a chance of acquiring Mate's previous noir ? the well-regarded THE DARK PAST (1948) ? on VHS! The idea of a dying man seeking out his own killers before he expires was very original at the time, but has been much copied since ? in fact, this film was itself remade twice as COLOR ME DEAD (1969) with Tom Tryon and Carolyn Jones and, again, under its original title in 1988 starring then real-life couple Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan! The 'murdered' man acting as narrator in a way anticipates Billy Wilder's SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950) as well, and even Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON (1951)! Despite their belated entrance, Luther Adler's sleek businessman and Neville Brand's thug are memorably villainous and remind one of Sydney Greenstreet and Elisha Cook Jr. in John Huston's THE MALTESE FALCON (1941). Even so, these two are not really the parties involved in O'Brien's poisoning and, in fact, the plot is a little too convoluted along the way until one gets all the threads sorted out towards the end.The character of O'Brien's secretary/girlfriend is quite one-dimensional and gets a bit annoying as a result, but it is relevant to the plot nevertheless; besides, the whistling on the soundtrack every time a good-looking girl passed O'Brien by during the early stages of the film was rather corny. However, Dimitri Tiomkin's frenzied score admirably mirrors the agitated state-of-mind of the desperate protagonist ? while the all-important jive session sequence became something of a noir staple (probably introduced in Robert Siodmak's PHANTOM LADY [1944], which I watched recently for the first time).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most seen and talked about film noirs and people are still seeing it today. Alpha Video offers you a very fine print here. Edmond O'Brien (The Killers [1946]) plays a man who needs to get away from his job for a couple of weeks, so he goes to San Francisco. While at a jive joint, his drink was switched by a mysterious man. The next morning he feels ill so he goes to the doctor. He is told very seriously he has a luminous toxic matter inside of him and there is no cure for it. He has only days left to live. He's in a race against time to find out who poisoned him. As of this writing, of the cast that is still alive, the lovely Beverly Garland (My Three Sons tv series), who played "Miss Foster" and Henry Hart who played "Stanley".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, but occasionally really poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead On Arrival is a slow paced murder mystery in which the victim is not actually dead, rather, dying. He has been poisoned and he has to find the person responsible for his death and why he did it. There's a lot to like about this picture. The way the plot unfolds is remarkably realistic and at times it is quite suspenseful. The film also doesn't shy away at showing real humanity from the main character and his wife. However, this acting isn't really that good. I can forgive bad acting, but not when it is distracting. While the film is well made for the most part, there is the occasional scene that comes off so inept and cheap that it feels, in some ways, worse than an Ed Wood movie. The scene in which his wife leaves him is ridiculously melodramatic, as is the scene in which she decides to try and help him. Unfortunately, since these two scenes are important to the development of the story, it's actually a serious flaw and it is impossible to really get a good feel for the film unless you see it knowing that you can better concentrate on the plot and not the technical parts, which is, unfortunately, nearly impossible. You may as well see it since it works for the most part, but be prepared for the occasional moment weak acting or directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tight noir, but a little too tight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A "race against time" story about a man trying to solve the mystery of his own murder, caused by a slow acting but foolproof toxin. DOA is certainly gripping. However, though I'm a fan of many of these low budget thrillers from the golden age, this one is a little bit overrated, principally because it's just slightly too cheap and, because of that, ill thought through. The tale should be about a boring and timid small-town accountant forced to travel on a job to San Francisco where he is dragged into a world of easy sex, gangsters and murder. Edmond O'Brien's a good actor, but in this the transition seems invisible ? like Charles Bronson in Death Wish. This makes the first quarter hour of the film excessively slow. It's a silly set-up - the hero plans a hedonistic holiday alone in the city, clearly to the chagrin of his longstanding girlfriend - and the poor dialogue fails clearly to define the characters. Even the famous opening to the film, where the hero reports his own murder, sounds better in the telling than in the movie itself, where it's clunkily put together. Later, in a SF hotel, we endure a rather silly procession of babes ? dubbed on the soundtrack with musical wolf whistles ? that we're meant to think are just dying to sleep with this portly bean counter. Even in 1948 this would have seemed a bit far fetched.The story really gets going when Bigelow (O'Brien) agrees to go to a hep club with his boozy hotel neighbours and becomes irritated with the world they embody. Nevertheless, in the world of film noir you have to pay for your pleasures: he's given a drink laced with toxin. Suddenly the pace of the film hots up, and Bigelow finds himself dashing around San Francisco and Los Angeles to find his "killer". This is the film's one offbeat idea, and clearly the makers thought they didn't need any others. For instance, it strikes one as odd even just after World War II that a professional auditor would be running round flashing a revolver without any internal debate about it. It's also somewhat unconvincing that somebody would be given a slow poison which would in fact aid the police in determining the background to the crime - the illegal trading of radioactive substances - when all that was required was for Bigelow to be got out of the way. Interestingly, the fact that we are told (with a second opinion!) that Bigelow will surely die in the course of the film subtracts from the tension somewhat, as the audience would want him to be trying to find a cure. More worryingly this certain doom nullifies the subplot involving Bigelow's relationship with his girlfriend Paula largely consists of stodgy telephone conversations between the pair of them, instead of an exploration of their characters under pressure. When Bigelow finally meets her again, after she has followed him to Los Angeles, he won't level with her but leaves her in a hotel lobby promising to come back ? a promise that he can't possibly keep. Of course this leads to an unsatisfying lack of closure at the end of the film. Bigelow doesn't seem to have learned anything about himself apart from that he's in love with Paula, and this is a missed dramatic opportunity.Nevertheless, the film has many enjoyable moments. Neville Brand, a cult actor in his own right, is notable in a one-dimensional part. However, Luther Adler steals the film as the urbane gang boss Majek, apologising for having to order his psychotic gunsel bump off Bigelow and explaining why. Much of the movie is filmed in the streets, which gives an edge to the drama it wouldn't have otherwise had. But it's the kind of film that you'll enjoy once, but not so much a second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>D.O.A: Rather Disappointing.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of film noir and find that I like most of the films associated with the movement. Yet, D.O.A was a major disappointment for me. The premise is thrilling, yet somehow the end result did not satisfy me.My disappointment does not rest with Edmond O'Brien, who turns in a very capable and engaging performance as the man who finds he has unwittingly ingested lethal poison, and must race to find the killer before he is dead. It is everyone's worst fear, O'Brien's situation, and he certainly gives a good account of his character. The scene in which he is told 'I don't think you understand...You have been murdered' is very effective and chilling.Perhaps it lies with the inconsistency in the plotting- the first half of the film is much tighter than the second, which is action-packed, yet confusing and rather all over the place. The love interest angle is inevitable, yet slightly unbelievable all the same (perhaps inspired by 'Odd Man Out', which also has a doomed protagonist in James Mason and a faithful girlfriend who rushes to find him before death in Kathleen Byron).D.O.A has plenty of atmosphere, and some nice cracking lines, yet really didn't leave me feeling satisfied with my film-going experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Noir Film but two major problems in the plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edmond O'Brien was a very skilled character actor, who would eventually win an Oscar as best supporting actor, as publicist Oscar Muldoon in THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA (1954). But up until then there was a serious misunderstanding of O'Brien's considerable talents. He was at his best in supporting parts, not starring roles. Up until 1954 most of his roles were as a star of his films. The best known performances in this period was as Ben in ANOTHER PART OF THE FORREST and as Frank Bigalow in this film, D.O.A. ("Dead on Arrival"). D.O.A. is one of the films pointed at as classic film noir. The story is about how O'Brien is a part-time notary, who has just notarized some papers concerning a sale. He then goes on a vacation to meet his girl friend. While in a hotel he gets involved with some people in a nearby room, and then falls asleep - possibly from a drugged drink. Subsequently he wakes up some time later and does not know what exactly happened to the people who were there - and he finds he doesn't feel well. When he checks into this he discovers that he has been given some extremely rare poison that is inevitably fatal if you do not have it pumped out of your system within four hours of ingesting it. But due to the drink O'Brien is now way over that safety period. He is doomed, and now is fighting the remaining time left to himself to solve what happened and why...and to find out who killed him.The film is set up with the dying O'Brien stumbling into police headquarters to report his own murder, and tell his story. It's an interesting framework - I may be wrong but I don't think it was used again in film noir. In his search for the killer he comes across such characters as crime boss Luther Adler, his henchman Nevil Brand (who enjoys punching the chubby O'Brien in his belly), William Ching, and Beverly Garland, and O'Brien is trying to do what he has to without alarming his girlfriend Pamela Britton. There are some great set pieces in the film, such as Adler's henchmen chasing O'Brien in several cars while he rides an ordinary bus. The film is quite shipshape to this day - a film to put aside DOUBLE INDEMNITY, DETOUR, SUNSET BOULEVARD, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, SCARLET STREET, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, and WHITE HEAT.But there are two major plot problems that I have with the film - which prevent me from giving it a "10" as many others would. First, although O'Brien is a part-time notary it is not that likely that he would recall who the man was whose papers he notarized that led to the crime. Most notaries don't recall these details all the time - and O'Brien did it only part-time. Secondly, if someone wanted to kill a person for any reason, one uses a method that is fast and not unusual. That is why most murders are by knife or gun or common poisons like arsenic or prussic acid. You don't get rare, easily traceable exotic poisons if you don't want to make it easier for the police to catch you. Quibbling problems in an otherwise well made film, but somehow they still bother me a little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Opening But The Story Has Problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that "D.O.A." grabs your attention right from the opening scene, as the camera follows Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) walking into a local police station to report a murder - his own! He's been poisoned, and has only a short time to live, and the movie then becomes a flashback, as Bigelow recounts his story to the police. This is certainly lively, as Bigelow becomes more and more frantic in his effort to discover his killer before he dies, but there were perhaps too many twists and turns in the plot, making it very hard to follow the trail of clues. There was also, it seemed to me at least, a major plot oversight. Simply put, how did his killer know that he was going to go on vacation in San Francisco? His presence in San Francisco is essential to the story, but I just didn't understand that. In addition, there were a number of aspects to the film that I just didn't like.Am I alone in really not liking Bigelow? The guy essentially decides to go off on vacation and sow his wild oats so to speak with the local ladies, leaving the woman he supposedly loves back home wondering what he's up to. He looks at virtually every woman he sees with lust in his eyes (at least we know what's on his mind!) and the wolf-whistles that sounded every time he looked at a woman were silly and even irritating. We got the message! They really weren't necessary. Even the relationship and repeated conversations between Bigelow and Paula seemed to serve no real purpose in the story. His relationship to Paula had nothing at all to do with his poisoning - so why bother with it? Kudos for that great opening scene which gets you interested. Had it not been for that, I suspect that few people would stick with this. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often that someone gets the opportunity to solve their own murder, pre-mortem no less. Well that's the intriguing premise of D.O.A., certainly one of the more inventive Noir entries in a genre where intrigue is usually listed as the first ingredient.Yes, the plot is a tad too convoluted, with one too many characters with one too many identities; or others who are blameless only for the fact they've been dead for six months. And there's also the crucial incriminating letter that gets conveniently discovered the day after it might have answered the crucial questions. But these are all easily excused, if one doesn't peer too closely into the standard number of plot holes.The acting is overall good, although there is some degree of overacting as other reviewers have noted. DOA deserves the high regard it has earned in the Film Noir genre; it's inventive and doesn't necessarily end well, like all good Noir should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent "noir" classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films, like people, "wear" better than others. For me, "Shawshank Redemption " is a film I like better each time I've viewed after its original release; conversely, "Forrest Gump" is one I've never enjoyed as much subsequently as I did initially."DOA" is one which I've grown to like more each time I've seen it over the years.Edmund O'Brien was an actor who was often the 2nd or 3rd male lead, portraying characters who were a friend, confidante or adversary of the primary star(s). And where he was the lead, as in "DOA," it was usually a lower-budget work. However, his performances were always well-done, and provided convincing portrayals of the characters assigned."DOA" provides the nostalgic, "noir" feeling of this type of drama, as filmed 5 or 6 decades ago. Viewed now, in addition to an interesting story and plot, it provides an often amusing glimpse of the way stories were approached, and techniques utilized -- then, versus the way they'd be done today. (The supposed remake of this film - with Dennis Quade - is far below the level of this film, despite have today's technical advantages. It bears a resemblance to this original solely in that the lead male ingests the fatal substance early-on, and the plot deals with the dilemma and how he addresses it.)In this film, O'Brien is the sole proprietor of a small bookkeeping service, with only a "gal Friday" in his employ, in the southern California town of Banning, who has misfortune upon visiting San Francisco.And it is not his primary function of keeping books and doing taxes which generates his problem -- it is his collateral function as (of all things!) a notary public which brings his serious problem upon him (and can anything be more "serious" than having been slipped a fatal "mickey" for which there is no antidote??).Edmund scurries around San Francisco to seek the perpetrator of his impending demise, moving about like a Sikh running barefoot over a bed of hot coals. There are several over-the-top, slightly cornball aspects to his character's actions, as well as with regard to other characters and his interaction with them. Neville Brand plays the psychotic, hotheaded goon to perfection (also with humor as well as malice) the kind of role for which this character actor was perfect.The scene where his hotel room is adjacent to convention revelers, with the married lady trying to seduce him, is hilarious, These folks looked like, say, a group of small-town convenience store owners, loose for the first time in the big city.I've been to the "Bay Area" on extended visits a few times, and while the traffic and overall bustle might have been a bit less in this film than I encountered in later years -- from my experience in this crowded, busy city, it would have taken Edmund's character about two weeks to have done all the hurrying and scurrying, and visiting all his many destinations, whereas he accomplished all of this in a matter of hours in this story.Still, a very entertaining movie, with these features adding to the enjoyment of its story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>D.O.A. has arguably one of the greatest opening scenes in the history of films noir: Edmond O'Brien stumbles into a police station and says he wants to report a murder- his own. In mere moments, we're hooked. He then proceeds to tell his tale. It's here that the movie loses its full-speed-ahead momentum, but it's justifiable: the groundwork must be laid before the monument can be built. There are a couple of odd moments, though, along the way- in particular, the wolf whistles that we hear every time a "dame" appears on screen. Once our hero gets the bad news from a doctor that he's been poisoned (which occurs in a bar scene that's oddly shot), things really pick up. O'Brien manages to convey a sense of life-or-death urgency as he runs all over the country trying to track down his killer. Along the way he encounters Neville Brand as a particularly nasty psychopathic killer (the kind of guy who might even give Richard Widmark a moment's pause) before the final but inevitable scene. It's a classic for a reason (or three).</fullReview>

This gent flys through airports, turnstiles and crowded streets like nobody's business. He is desperate for answers but refuses to tell anyone why, why? Most likely to frustrate and annoy the audience and admittedly with great success.They sure do know how to dress and singly identify the bad guy with the hip houndstooth scarf and matching hat, what a stylish combination! And lest we forget the 'knife in the belly' lover evil henchman whose bug eyes were prominent scene stealers during the entire joy ride. This type of schtick was the underbelly of the script and truly laughable. The kazoo sound effect to appreciate the conference female clientele says it all.Every time that syrupy sweet girlfriend attempts to flash her independence, there she is smothering him to no avail. The only person who seemed rationale was the police officer who made the final declaration of D.O.A. and for all that matters a designation for this script!Moderate recommend for directing the peripatetic poisoned prisoner. Look for the documentary "Poisoned by Polonium" for a more accurate portrayal of film noir and censorship.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>California accountant Edmond O'Brien (as Frank Bigelow) briskly walks into a Los Angeles police station to declare he has been murdered. This startling accusation turns out to be true because Mr. O'Brien was poisoned earlier, and there is no cure. Neither we nor O'Brien know who administered the poison, or why it happened. Next, we flashback to see O'Brien's story. Two days earlier, he left his office for a vacation in San Francisco. Although he appears to be romantically engaged with blonde secretary Pamela Britton (as Paula Gibson), O'Brien appears to be very interested in some other female companionship. He leaves his hotel door open to listen in on a party and later joins the revelers for a night on the town. At a bar, O'Brien is lured away by a sexy blonde while a mysterious figure prepares his fatal drink..."D.O.A." (Dead on Arrival) is a strange but entertaining film. Credit should go to director Rudolph Mate and black-and-white photographer Ernest Laszlo for giving it a stylish look. They know how to make the cameras and performers move beautifully. In an early role, Neville Brand (as Chester) is his nasty best. There are a few problems, however. A minor one is the initially unclear and later juvenile relationship between O'Brien and his secretary. A major one is the soundtrack, which is credited to the otherwise esteemed and skillful Dimitri Tiomkin. Most notably, after O'Brien's character goes on vacation, a weird sound effect plays every time he sees an attractive woman. These sound effects are loud, distracting and unnecessary. Someone should have noticed this was not a "Three Stooges" comedy.******* D.O.A. (4/30/50) Rudolph Mate ~ Edmond O'Brien, Pamela Britton, Luther Adler, Neville Brand</fullReview>

The police has been looking for him. He recounts his last few days to the police. He had left for a needed vacation getting away from his clingy girlfriend Paula Gibson (Pamela Britton). While drinking at a bar with the jazz party, he gets poisoned with no antidote possible. He is given a death sentence by the doctors, and goes in search of his own murderer.The first half is very cheesy and cheap. I especially hate the slide whistle every time he watches a pretty girl walks by. The jive talk and the beatniks at the bar also degrades the tone of the movie. And I don't really accept the excuse that they deliberately lighten the tone at the beginning. After such a great opening, the cheesy pre-poisoning does nothing but to make the movie feel cheap. It does get better after that. Edmond O'Brien is great as a man on the edge. In the end, it's a pretty good noir film overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Closer Look at a Midnight Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing DOA for the first time as a kid. It was on the Late, Late Show, a perfect venue for what may be the best of the post-war noirs. As the movie tension mounted, it almost knocked my socks off. After all, how many films in those days ended with a "dead hero" charging around San Francisco, even if he wasn't a cable channel zombie.Anyhow, don't let those sappy early scenes fool you. They're necessary to set up the contrasting downspiral that ensues. As it happens, Frank Bigelow (O'Brien) may be bored with his accounting job in a quiet little town, along with the prospects of marrying a conventional girl, Paula (Britton), and living out a routine existence there. So, at the first chance there he goes, off to enjoy adventures in the big city, even if only brief ones. And get a load of the available women swarming around his San Francisco hotel. Now that adventure beckons, it's no longer thoughts of Banning or Paula. (But what was musical arranger Tiomkin thinking with those utterly cartoonish wolf whistles, perhaps the movie's only flaw). So, along with the goodtime gang he's hooked up with, it's off to wild nightspots for the suddenly footloose Bigelow. The trouble is Frank has taken a big step away from the ordered simplicity of his small town and into the unfamiliar world of chaotic city life. And worse, the frenzied chaos of The Fisherman, its strung-out patrons and aggressive atmosphere, clouds the fact that his life will never be the same. In fact, the jazz scene with it's blaring, chaotic close-ups amounts to a superb one-of-a-kind metaphor for the bizarre world the small town accountant has now entered. Just as importantly, it makes anything that happens thereafter seem weirdly possible. As a result, when Frank swallows what turns out to be a deadly neon toxin, it seems perfectly in keeping with this landscape of disorder.I may be biased, but O'Brien really deserved at least an Oscar nomination for his energetic and nuanced performance, as though Hollywood ever rewarded low-budget B-movies. In fact, I'm ready to enter him in the Olympics, for that 500-yard mad dash down Market Street. What a great natural reaction to the news that he's already a dead man. And filming the sequence with, I suspect, a hidden camera adds a kind of realism to the convoluted remainder of the whodunit.Another high point is the sequence with the psychotic Chester (Brand). What a great piece of casting. Brand has such distinctive features, which he twists to full effect on the tormented Bigelow. But little does he know that Frank has acquired a peculiar kind of power. After all, what does he need to be afraid of since he's already dead. That scene in the drug store where Chester overplays his hand is another piece of fine filming and staging. I wouldn't be surprised that many in the audience have speculated with what they would do with Frank's kind of power, heavily purchased though it is.What's so amazing about the movie is how adeptly the theme builds right down to the inevitable climax. We begin with a glimpse of a well-ordered world, but one that quickly descends into the depths of chaos and disorder, as Bigelow travels a nightmare road in pursuit of the where and why of his killer. I take the moral to be a conservative one, something like appreciating the routine and conventional, since it's never certain when an uncaring fate might intervene. After all, Frank really only comes to appreciate Paula and his small town once he's experienced its opposite. It's something that could happen to any of us, since even the most routine act may have unforeseen consequences. That's what's so unsettling about the movie.Anyway, it's hats off to everyone involved in the making of this memorable noir. It's one of those submerged classics like Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) that surfaced only after a period on late night TV. Frankly, I still sometimes slip it out late at night, and pull up my socks real tight. To me, it's got that kind of staying power.(In passing?living in LA, I occasionally pass the Bradbury Building and think of the movie. It looks pretty much the same as it did then, but has since acquired a kind of cachet among movie makers. I like to think it's because of the sweaty, underrated Eddie O'Brien and the unforgettable Frank Bigelow.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead Man Walking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edmond O'Brien cannot save his own life in director Rudolph Maté's crime thriller "D.O.A," but he can find out who killed him before he dies. Everything that happens in this taut thriller occurs as a consequence of a illegal business deal. Our protagonist had nothing to do with the deal other than to notarize the bill of sale. Since he knew about a bill of sale, Frank Bigelow's life is forfeit. Indeed, this alarming little thriller doesn't believe in happily-ever-after endings, and O'Brien dies in the final few minutes of this 83 minute epic. Frank Bigelow has scheduled a vacation for himself in San Francisco, and his girlfriend Paula Gibson (Pamela ) wants to accompany him. Nevertheless, Frank refuses to take her. At the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, Frank falls in with a group of party hardy salesmen and they hang out at a bar, The Fisherman, where a band plays some lively jazz. Frank goes back to his hotel and wakes up feeling weird. The first doctor that he visits informs him that he is living on borrowed time. It seems that nobody slipped a luminous poison into Frank's drink in the bar. Frank has absolutely no clue why anybody would want to see him dead. He learns from Paula that a guy named Eugene Phillips has tried to contact his office in Banning. Refusing to believe the diagnosis of the first two physicians, Frank rushes off to another doctor at the Southern Pacific Hospital and learns the brutal truth that he is a dead man walking. Naturally, he sets out to find the man who poisoned him and encounters a suspicious individual named Majak (Luther Adler) with a sadistic bodyguard Chester (Neville Brand of "Stalag 13") who craves the chance to kill Frank. Eventually, Frank does discover who gave him the poison. Maté gets things off to a brisk start with our doomed protagonist marching into the Homicide Division to announce that he knows something about a murder?his murder. A strong cast, good direction, tense suspense, and superior writing from scenarists Russell Rouse and Clarence Green make "D.O.A." a memorable melodrama. The jazz scene in the bar is pretty cool. They actually use the word "jive" in this 1950 film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Example of Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D.O.A. is a classic example of the sort of film where the main character's settled and ordered life is completely disrupted. It's exactly the sort of thing Alfred Hitchcock used to do so well so often, in films such as The 39 Steps and North By Northwest. Although D.O.A. was not a Hitchcock film, it certainly is a classic example of the genre just the same. In D.O.A. the main character is an small-town Accountant/Notary Public who decides to have one last bachelor fling in the big city prior to getting married. His holiday suddenly goes haywire when he wakes up felling ill, sees a doctor and learns that he has been poisoned and has only days to live! But by whom, and why? With only a short time left, he engages in a quest to find out. Although this film was remade in the 1980s, this is the version most people remember, and that will probably continue to be the case. Don't miss this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Whodunit About a Man Trying to Find His Own Murderer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edmond O'Brien has always been a favorite of mine. He was great in "Seven Days in May", and funny in "The Girl Can't Help It", showing great acting range and always convincing. Here, he tries to find the man who murdered him with a slow poison.This story is shown in flashback, beginning with a man who walks into a police station and demands to see "the man in charge" in order to tell his story. O'Brien plays Bigelow, a quiet accountant from the California desert who takes a business trip to San Francisco. There, he makes friends at the hotel, and goes for a night on the town. When he starts feeling ill, a doctor tells him he's been given "luminous toxin", which will soon kill him. As the doctor (Frank Gerstle) tells Bigelow, "I don't think you understand, Bigelow. You've been murdered." In his quest to find his killer, Bigelow tears the town apart, encountering characters played by Neville Brand, Laurette Luez, and Beverly Garland, among others. He eventually corners his killer in an office building and shoots him dead.This film is well directed in "film noir" style and has great acting by O'Brien, Pamela Britton (Bigelow's lonely girlfriend), Neville Brand (the evil henchman Chester), Beverly Garland (a lying accomplice), and Luther Adler (the head bad guy), among others. Some of the close-up photography of faces is annoying, and many scenes are pretty dated, but the story is as sturdy as ever. O'Brien's persistence in the face of certain death tells quite an enjoyable and complex story.</fullReview>

The direction is top notch in this low budget film that proves money isn't the key to a great film. Anyone making a film on a low budget should be forced to watch this just so they can see what can be done.

		<shortDescription>Classic film best of its kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a man named Frank Bigelow, who finds out he has been murdered by slow poisoning which there is no cure for, and he attempts to find out who did it. Edmond O'Brien gives his best lifetime performance as Bigelow. His girlfriend is named "Paula," and the movie could well win an award for the most times in a movie the name "Paula" is mentioned. You get the sense the film crew had fun with that. The movie is in black and white, and it would be a mistake to colorize it. This is a mystery, and too much information just clogs things up. We're supposed to look for the clues in the black and white world along with Bigelow. There is plenty of action, but more drama. And the drama is well played, and done in an action packed sense. Those bored by drama won't be bored by this smartly directed piece. What makes the movie so different is that Bigelow isn't perfect in any sense. He isn't super tough. He isn't heroic, he isn't evil, he isn't vicious, he isn't anything but a believable character. In fact he's more of a true anti hero than what Hollywood later defined as an anti hero. He leads along his devoted fiancé, Paula, but at the same time he cares for her. There are so many fascinating bits in this movie that would make any director envious, and paved the way for great directing. The classic scenes with a sadistic character played by Neville Brand such as when he delivers the famous line "and baby makes three"; the scene in which Bigelow is first diagnosed; the scene in which Bigelow runs through the streets of San Francisco and watches other people live their lives; the scene in which he walks into the police station; and many other landmark scenes never since outshone. This is a movie of great scenes, of great suspense, and of great emotion. The end is a certified tear jerker, easily in anybody's top ten pick for all time movie endings, and the whole movie will definitely be in your top forty all time movies if you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead Man Captures his own Murderer in the Great Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This pulpy noir from 1950 shouldn't be good. The actors are B-list, the music is mediocre, the characters are caricatures, and that out of place wolf-whistle that sounds each time Frank passes a pretty girl in the hotel is just plain weird. But all of these combine to make a campy noir classic about a man who goes to San Francisco to meet chicks and ends up getting poisoned. He finds out about the poison, there is no antidote, but he has a couple of days to live. He runs frantically around, nearly getting killed a few more times and solves the mystery of his murder. Crazy Chester goes berserk in his role as thug, making this movie even more fun.This movie is like grits. Throwing some coarsely ground corn into water and salting it doesn't sound that good, but the coarseness and the salt together turn it into a great meal. It is substantial, but not too heavy. It has its own distinct flavor without being overwhelming, and it's kind of fun to eat. 7/10http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Main reason this movie rates an "8" is because it WILL hold your interest. Fast-paced noir with one of the strongest individual performances ever, by Edmond O'Brien. In this movie O'Brien dominates but he does so by sheer energy, not overacting.Effectively captures the late 1940's ambiance with black-and-white photography. Here again is proof that a big budget is not always necessary, maybe even counterproductive in some cases. It just wouldn't seem necessary to view this in color, or with a big studio staff trying to justify budget with a big-name cast and prestige. "DOA" also features the ultimate starlet in the history of starletism: Laurette Luez. She makes you glad the Hollywood system invented the starlet concept.</fullReview>

He is well remembered for memorable supporting role performances including his Oscar win for "The Barefoot Contessa" in 1954.As Frank Bigalow, he meets a terrible fate by merely notarizing a paper and then goes off to vacation in San Francisco. Here, we see a story unwind dealing in a film noir setting. We see betrayal, killing and all other sorts of mayhem.While Bigalow is given days to live, he still has plenty of strength to deal with those who poisoned him.Pamela Britton, who was Mrs. Brown years later in "My Favorite Martian," shines here as Bigalow's love interest. In true Romeo and Juliet fashion, tragic love ensues here.The story gets better and better as the details unwind. Truly, a classic film. With an excellent supporting cast that includes Luther Adler, this is a must see film for film buffs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Others have comment on how Bigelow was not a sympathetic character. I don't think that mattered. Sure he was a jerk to his "girlfriend/love" and a bit of a pig - but the empathy comes from the fact that no one deserves to be anonymously poisoned for seemingly (at first) no reason. I think this makes it a stronger film. It'd be boring/unrealistic if he was an attractive perfect paragon of a person.I'd like to thank the person who pointed out the irony of him standing in front of a row of "LIFE" magazines. I had missed that because I was watching the deliciously ironic/poignant reminders of what he would never have in his life walk past him at that point, the child he could never have, the happy couple he would never be. This short scene was second only to the opening shot in what makes this a great film.I also enjoyed the shots of San Francisco's Embarcadero and (I assume) Market St. That was fun simply from a historical/sociological perspective.Sure it's not perfect. The whiny clingy woman was incredibly sexist &amp; annoying. The Chester character was over played. Yes, the stupid "wolf whistles" were jarring and out of place.Overall though, this is a fantastic film. Should definitely be considered the top of the film noir genre.Miles ahead of the sloppy non-noir remake w/ Dennis Quaid that turns it into a thriller. Would suggest avoiding that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Opening in the History of Film..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If we talk about film openings, what comes to mind? You may think of Star Wars, for example, where weird 3D lettering rolls across the screen, boring you to tears, but ultimately preparing you for one of the most unusual films of the century. But the film you really should think about is this film (not the remake, which was merely OK, whereas this film is stellar). In the opening of this film, the narrator, the voice-over, tells us that he is investigating a murder .. his! And so begins one of the best "Filmes Noires" of all time. In fact, this could be a template for that genre of film. The action, the direction, the story -- so compelling that you will lose yourself in it within moments and, unless you hit the PAUSE button, you will be carried along right to the last scene. The genius of this film is that, while it seems to be merely about a character in a story, the sheer outrageousness of it -- someone has murdered you, you have only hours to live, AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW OR EVEN WHY?!! -- connects with the viewer at a visceral level. Obrien is brilliant. You can practically smell the flop sweat. The writing is astonishing. The director is hypnotic. One of the best films ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man dying man searches for his killer and the reason he's dying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"D.O.A." starring Edmond O'Brien made a big splash when it was first released - in fact, there was some Oscar talk about it, and it caused actress Beverly Garland to be blacklisted. Naive to the ways of Hollywood, when someone at a dinner said they thought D.O.A. would be up for best picture, Garland said she didn't think so. Producers don't like that sort of thing, and Garland, who under the name Beverly Campbell had made her debut in the film, soon found the work had dried up. Shortly afterward, she was apologizing to the producers, who gave her a blank stare and said they didn't know what she was talking about. But gradually she found work coming her way."D.O.A." is an excellent example of film noir - it's dark, fast, and beautifully directed by Rudolph Mate. The story has been told over and over, but never as well as it is here: A man finds that he has been fatally poison while on vacation, and tries to find out who poisoned him and why in what little time he has left. There are some interesting people in the cast, including Luther Adler and Neville Brand, both of whom are excellent. Pamela Britton has the difficult role of O'Brien's somewhat annoying girlfriend. Beverly Garland, known for most of her career as a slender, petite blond, looks amazingly different as a curly-haired brunette. Her debut role is very showy and well played.But this is O'Brien's film. A burly man and a wonderful actor, O'Brien has a huge list of credits (including a hysterical turn in "The Girl Can't Help It") but his role as Frank Bigelow is his most famous. He starts out as a businessman who wants some time alone (he probably just wants his girlfriend to stop talking) and goes on vacation to San Francisco, hitting it during Market Week. There are single, available women everywhere and Frank seems ready and willing, and even joins people from across the hall for a party. Then, while in a bar talking to a pretty blond, someone switches his drink. The next day, he feels sick and sees a doctor. When he gets the bad news, he runs out of the doctor's office and goes to a local hospital. When they give him the same news, he leaves there. The normal, overindulgent vacation becomes a horrific nightmare. O'Brien is very effective as an angry, confused, exhausted and sick man trying to deal with the bad news at the same time he runs through the streets of San Francisco and L.A. trying to track down the reason. The viewer likes Frank and wishes a happy ending for him. The ending is particularly dramatic, right up to the final stamp put to a piece of paper.Truly one of the great noirs, as one comment says, "if your dictionary doesn't give the definition of film noir as D.O.A., throw it out!" I couldn't agree more.</fullReview>

He tries to solve the murder before he drops dead. The mystery plot is confusing. Even when the killer is revealed I still had half a dozen questions unanswered. Is it worth the watch? Yes. Is it The Postman Only Rings Twice? No, Postman had plot holes, but that wasn't why that movie was successful. It was because the leads were so convincing. The scenes of goofy Edmund O'Brian being smooth with the ladies are very funny, but totally unrealistic. O'Brian was not a leading man. The secondary characters seemed pulled from other movies. The foreigner Luther Adler could have been playing a part in Casablanca. Also, the director could have done without the slide-whistle wolf call whenever O'Brian saw a dame he liked. Director Rudolph Maté (cinematographer for Pride of the Yankees &amp; Sahara) did better with sound cues when O'Brian was trying to think of the night before, and the sound of the jazz club quietly played in the background. With a talented Cinematographer directing, it's no surprise that the movie's visual style is excellent. San Francisco looks great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been seeing this film in the used video store for months and have heard of it vaguely before, so I decided to finally buy it. BOY, Am I glad that I did! DOA is a film noir. Just the right kind of story that must be filmed in Black and White. The screenplay is brilliant and the acting, though not A types, is great. My husband and I sat there on the edge of our seats, deeply into this film. Average man Frank Bigelow(Edmond O'Brien) leaves on a little trip to San Francisco and then fate steps in. He finds out that he has been murdered. Poisoned by someone and it's too late to save him. He has just a few days to find out who did it and why. His search takes him deep into the underworld. Along for this ride is his "girl"(My Favorite Martian's Barbara Britton) who is wants to be more in his life and can't fiqure out why he is so aloof.This film just never lets go. You just HAVE to watch it to the end. I am looking for more of these film-noirs. Of course The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, A Touch of Evil, are some good ones too. Does anybody have any suggestions of what are some other good ones?? Watch this and you won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the quintessential "film noir". Found it in the UK recently on a 4 film DVD set also including Man With The GOlden Arm, Suddenly and The Stranger. The idea for this film is BRILLIANT. Just put yourself in the protagonists shoes for a few minutes. It's just been confirmed to you that you have ingested poison and that you will die before the week's out. How do you react ? When he learns of the fate that awaits him, our hero runs out into the streets of San Francisco and the whole of this passage is brilliantly filmed. There is a sense of deep frustration, but also that "now, nothing matters any more ..." After this our hero is galvanized into action and is determined to find out who poisoned him and why, even if it is too late for him and that life will shortly leave his body whether he likes it or not. He embarks upon his quest with such enthusiasm, that the spectator forgets that he is going to die. As to the plot itself, it remains somewhat confusing for my small brain, there are some red herrings and the main thing I understood that our hero was in the know about an illegal sale of metal. Why he should die for it heaven knows, but there it is. The scene in the night club with the jazz band just about blows your brains out and I especially liked the drum solo. Since seeing Time after Time and Pacific Heights, I have always found that San Franciso appears sinister in films and DOA is no exception. Picture and sound quality are below par but this does not detract from the general interest of the film. I am very happy to possess this on DVD.</fullReview>

It's about a man who consumed some lethal substance that was put in his drink and his odyssey to find who did it while slowly dying. The story is complicated and demands concentration on the dialogues, otherwise you will surely miss the subtle details that are necessary for comprehending what's going on. The tension grows as you watch the soon-to-die man's building up anguish (portrayed excellently by O'Brien) and although you know his fate, you are still curious about what will happen.

		<fullReview>D.O.A.(1950) is a surrealistic Film Noir that would be influential to many Noir pictures made during the 1950s. Its use of non linear plot and storyline differs sightly from some Noir pics of its time. Noir Veteran Edmond O'Brien plays a fatalistic protagonist who fights against time to find out who poisoned him before its too late. In the style of another low budget Noir Classic called Detour(1945). Rudolph Mate brings a feeling of claustrophobia to the main character and his surroundings. D.O.A.(1950) is interesting to watch for its nightmarish qualities. The cinematography by Ernest Laszlo who did the brilliant camera work for the masterful, Kiss Me Deadly(1954) is one of the best in a Noir Pic.</fullReview>

And the often praised script scenario doesn't fair well if you think about it too much. But these flaws -- the volume and intensity of them -- cross a threshold into the surreal. In particular Neville Brand's over the top performance as "poor" Chester. And that's the secret of D.O.A.'s greatness, I think: its nightmare trappings, its grotesque actor/characters, and its amphetamine rush toward disaster. It espouses such a feeling of hopelessness, the viewer can feel some relief that real life isn't like this. The same goes for Dick Tracy comics, Iggy Pop songs, and Francis Bacon paintings. If you like weird movies, you ought to like D.O.A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a masterpiece by any means, but a decent, compact thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Businessman Edmond O'Brien, traveling from his small California town to San Francisco for a meeting, is given a slow-acting poison which will mean his eventual demise; he attempts to finger his own murderer before dying. A great premise is done only marginal justice by this cast and director Rudolph Maté, who shows a hint of humor early on...but not dark, appropriate humor. Maté seems to belong to the wrong generation for a noir melodrama and his touches of levity are dated and jarring. O'Brien presents almost the same problem: he's too stuffy and unenthralling as an actor to be at the center of a thriller, and his obvious misplacement constantly undermines the proceedings. Remade twice: as "Color Me Dead" in 1969 and as "D.O.A." in 1988. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A noir `classic' that, while fun to watch, falls far short of a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The flashback in film noir was much more than a gimmick. It was part and parcel of the cycle's pessimistic ? fatalistic ? spirit. By opening with their endings, only then going back to fill in the story, many of these movies (Double Indemnity, The Killers, Sunset Blvd.) defiantly locked in their downbeat denouements and so froze out any hope of happier resolutions to their narratives. When protagonist Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) staggers into Los Angeles' City Hall to report a murder ? his own ? Rudolph Maté's D.O.A. joins this dour and Calvinist group. In many ways an emblematic noir (and an enjoyable one), it's clunky and contrived, with little mystique lingering once the credits roll.Bigelow runs a small-town insurance business; his girl (Pamela Britton) works for him but pointedly aspires to be more than his secretary. But he's not ready to commit, and tells her that he's leaving for a week in San Francisco, by himself. Once he gets there, it's obvious that a spree of tom-catting would suit him just swell. At his hotel, he joins a party of salesmen and their dates and ends up in a jazz dive on Fisherman's Wharf. A sinister stranger switches his drink, giving Bigelow a fatal dose of `luminous toxin.' Under the weather next morning, he visits a doctor only to receive a death sentence: He has at best a few days to live (his blood glows in the dark, a bright reminder of the fears of the newly-dawned atomic age).Tearing through the streets of San Francisco, he halts, out of breath, at a news-stand (ironically, under a display of `Life' magazines) only to notice, all around him, a heart-warming panorama of the future he's been robbed of. Resolute once more, he strides off (and nobody strode quite like O'Brien) to find his killer. His quest takes him to Los Angeles, where an importer had tried to contact him but has since committed suicide (maybe), and thence to a crawl through the city's underbelly, only to find that he was but a tiny obstacle in a criminal scheme involving stolen Iridium....Iridium exists, but too much of D.O.A. (`Dead On Arrival') is harder to swallow than luminous toxin (which, the film assures us, also exists, under another name). The implausibility of its complicated plot comes from too many people knowing enough to be in just the right place at just the right moment. And Maté juggles some deft moments (a reprise of last night's jazz signaling Bigelow's hangover) with some dreadful ones (those slide-flute wolf whistles!). But its chief liability remains O'Brien. Effective in secondary roles (The Killers, White Heat), as a leading man he's faintly buffoonish, what with his pompadour, his speed-walking, his now unavoidable resemblance to Meat Loaf. He shows little knack for redeeming limp lines (`You're crazy. That's it ? you're crazy!') or for putting a distinctive stamp on the part that might bring it to life. He fails to convince that he's anything more than a competent if lackluster actor granted a meaty role. The same holds true for the rest of the cast: A dark femme fatale (Laurette Luez) and a blonde one (Lynn Baggett), a psychotic sadist (Neville Brand), a suave middle-eastern operator (Luther Adler). They're fun to watch but never let us forget we're watching a movie, one that leaves us thinking less about random and implacable fate than about over-zealous plotting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the award for most overrated film noir goes to ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films I am loss to explain why it has attained classic status. Sure, its not a horrible b-film, but there are so many flaws that take away from what could've been a much better film. I say the film has potential because the concept is one of the most novel in film noir. Plus, the opening scene is a classic as many have noted.Despite the redeeming qualities, there are many aspects that get in the way of the classic status. For one, the character of Paula is possibly the most annoying female ever in a film noir. She nags and nags, eventually causing one to wonder why Frank would stay with her. Oh yeah, Frank isn't all that likable a character to begin with. He whines and seems to think about cheating on his fiancé every chance he receives. I always felt Edmund O'Brien was an overrated actor but he does what he can with the material. Nelville Brand often garners acclaim for his performance as the psychopath Chester. Sure the character was sadistic, but Brand was so over the top I wasn't exactly intimidated by him. Plus, that annoying music score and the wolf whistles on the soundtrack whenever an attractive female is present.To be fair, the film isn't completely worthless. As I stated above, the premise is very novel and innovative. The film only comes alive in the last half hour, when it is very tense and well directed. The fact also that Frank in no way seemed to intentionally bring harm or become involved with danger adds to the dread. Still, I can't see why this is considered to be one of the pinnacle film noirs. Give me "Touch of Evil" or even "Detour" any day. (5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B Movie is Grade D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The gimmick here is that an accountant is given a slow-acting poison and tries to track down his own killer. The premise is intriguing but the execution is terrible. As the victim, O'Brien, a fine supporting actor, doesn't have the charisma to carry the film. This B movie is incredibly cheesy. When the hero gets near women at a convention, there are wolf whistles on the sound track to convey his lecherous thoughts. The scenes where the doctors reveal that he is slowly dying is very poorly filmed, and the poison glows in the dark! The acting is uniformly terrible and the direction is completely incompetent. It is amazing that this turkey has come to be regarded as classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Off Kilter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only redeeming feature about this film was the plot twist of knowing from the start, along with the "hero", that he is dying of poison. The movie is his search to find out "who dunnit." But it is so convoluted, so corny, so contrived, so cartoonish, and so crappily acted that you should avoid it. The (glow in the dark yet) poison makes him feel off-kilter throughout the movie and you feel off-kilter, too from bad plot and bad acting throughout. Oddly enough the doctor tells him he'll hardly notice the poison until "the end" and he barely shows any symptoms, including while running, beating people up, ending up in gunfights, and on and on, yet another guy who only took it 30 minutes before talking to him is on death's door. That's just one of the many, many broken pieces of plot this movie trips over.His girlfriend (who turns out to be Mrs. Brown from the 60's TV show "My Favorite Martian of all people...a babe in this film from 20 years earlier but with a much more sultry voice) begs him to go with him, then suddenly backs off with no reason in the plot (but spends the rest of the movie chewing furniture running hot or cold in her reactions to him long-distance on the phone). He's an accountant but just happens to have a gun that he pulls out of his coat when he is suddenly fired upon in the street (for no good reason). He goes on vacation, alone without his girlfriend, to San Francisco, but doesn't know it's a yearly festival event in town and at the hotel he apparently regularly goes to. In the middle of this "film noire" suspense flick they play a WOLF WHISTLE on a KAZOO (I kid you not) over and over again to show he is interested in literally every female that passes him in the hotel. Everyone else is just as bad an actor/actress as him...and on and on.Maybe I missed something (like a movie or 2 hours of my life) watching this. Maybe I needed more Russian sensibilities since apparently the writer, director and producer seem to have Russian names.When I was in college there was a malt shop drink called the "Awful, Awful" because it was "Awful big and Awful good." This is just AWFUL. To quote a much better movie, Monte Python's "Holy Grail"..."Run Away! Run away!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great film noirs that had no need to be remade!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edmond O'Brien is one of my favourite actors of the period, and if you need any startling evidence of why, just check out his performance here in Rudolph Mate's heartily original noir-shocker, 'D.O.A.'. Another great reason to check the film out, the Polish-born director, made a smooth transition from being a great cinematographer, and this is probably his most shining triumph helming a picture.If you have ever wondered why 'film noir' has been considered such a consistently rewarding and enthralling body of cinematic work, like the earlier 'Pre-Code' era, check this one out, and others of its ilk. A sheerly delightful film that holds up well today.Though I haven't checked its 80's remake out, I'm not too curious about it, other than the slight curiosity from its notoriety of it being the film in which Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan met and eventually decided to marry. Other than that, I'm more than content simply watching this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien), told he has been poisoned and has only a few days to live, tries to find out who killed him and why.The New York Times, in its May 1950 review, described it as a "fairly obvious and plodding recital, involving crime, passion, stolen iridium, gangland beatings and one man's innocent bewilderment upon being caught up in a web of circumstance that marks him for death". O'Brien's performance had a "good deal of drive", while Britton adds a "pleasant touch of blonde attractiveness".I do not know if it is "obvious", but i hardly found the film "plodding". This has to be one of the better film noir stories out there, and certainly among the best of its time. It should not be surprising that the film is preserved by the Library of Congress. This seems like a story that would be very influential. (Strangely, of all things, it reminds me of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit".)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've Been Murdered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was not uncommon for films noir to begin with narration by a dead or dying man; think of William Holden's voice over narration as we see him floating dead in a swimming pool at the start of "Sunset Boulevard," or Fred MacMurray's confession while nursing a bullet wound in "Double Indemnity." But "D.O.A" is the only noir I've seen about a dying man solving the mystery of his own murder.That dying man is played by Edmond O'Brien in a marvelously sweaty performance. His character takes a break from the small legal services business he runs to spend a couple of days in San Francisco, enjoying some extra-curricular female activity out of sight of the girlfriend back home who's pressuring him to marry her. While in that most noirish of noir cities, he's poisoned one night in a jazz club, collateral damage in a tangled criminal plot that finds the plot's mastermind doing away with anyone who could serve as a witness. I spent some time trying to unravel the plot itself, but quickly gave up. As with most movies like this, the specifics don't much matter. All you need to know is that some really bad guys are up to no good, and O'Brien's character is caught up in their misdeeds through a dumb twist of fate -- he notarized some bills of sale that could link the criminal to his activities. You might think that the film would be about O'Brien racing the clock to find his killer, discovering in the last minutes that there's an antidote that can save him and give us a happy ending. But you'd be wrong. This is a dark, cynical noir -- O'Brien is dead from the moment he ingests the poison, and his actions for the rest of the movie are those of a drowning man frantically trying to save himself because he doesn't know what else to do with his final moments on Earth."D.O.A." looks like it was made for about five bucks, but it nevertheless managed to line up some formidable talent behind the screen. The director was five time Oscar nominated cinematographer Rudolph Mate, while the actual cinematography was provided by Ernest Laszlo, who would go on years later to win an Oscar himself. Dimitri Tiomkin provided the musical score, and while the music has been criticized for being at odds with the film's tone, I thought its at times jaunty incongruity added to the off-kilter mood of the film.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic film noir about a man (Edmond O'Brien) who finds out he's been poisoned. He doesn't know how or by whom. He's told he only has a few days to live so he spends his remaining time investigating his own murder. A riveting thriller with a relentless pace. You'll be glued to your seat. O'Brien is excellent. Neville Brand makes a good psychotic. Seems like he might have watched Richard Widmark in Kiss of Death to prepare for the role. Because the film is now in public domain, that means finding it is easy. It also means that most of the prints you will see are terrible. Try to find a good one. A movie like this doesn't deserve the same fate as some crummy Poverty Row cheapie. Remade in 1988 with Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan. Not on the same planet as this film but worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) is dead. He's a walking dead man. It seems he has been given a slow-acting poison for which there is no antidote and given perhaps a week of life. There is nothing science, doctors or anyone else can do to save him. Bigelow decides to discover who, where, when and why this is all happening to him. There is a scene where Bigelow, exhausted from running from the nightmare of his inevitable and unavoidable death, stops at a kiosk, where magazines and newspapers are being sold. In the rack is the magazine LIFE. This is in no way a perfectly made film. It was made on the cheap and some of the acting is simply awful, but the story line and momentum of the film cannot be ignored. Neither can Dimitri Tiomkin's unforgettable score be overlooked. So, too, Neville Brand, (in his movie acting debut,) as Chester, a sadistic thug. So sit back, relax, and enjoy a truly original film noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Radioactive Poison Killed Ex-Spy British Say Case of Putin Critic Is UnprecedentedBy Mary Jordan and Peter Finn Washington Post Foreign Service Saturday, November 25, 2006; Page A01London, Nov. 24 -- Former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was fatally poisoned by a radioactive substance, traces of which were found in his urine, at his home and at a London restaurant and hotel he visited the day he became ill, according to the British health department. It called the case "unprecedented" in Britain.Authorities closed the restaurant and sealed off part of the hotel Friday as part of an emergency effort to trace the substance, polonium 210, and ensure that it does not harm other people. Litvinenko would have eaten, inhaled or received it through a wound, according to Pat Troop, chief executive of Britain's Health Protection Agency.Coming after the mysterious poisoning of another prominent opponent of the Kremlin, Ukrainian politician Viktor Yushchenko, the death provoked accusations that Russia continues to use Cold War-style tactics to eliminate critics abroad. London was the scene of the 1978 assassination of a Bulgarian dissident who was killed by a jab from a umbrella tip bearing the toxin ricin.Litvinenko blamed the Kremlin shortly before he died, according to friends and family members. "As I lie here I can distinctly hear the beating of wings of the angel of death," Litvinenko, 43, said in a dictated statement, according to friend Alex Goldfarb, who met reporters while accompanied by Litvinenko's tearful father."You may succeed in silencing one man but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr. Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life," the statement said. "May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people."Kremlin and Russian security service officials have denied any involvement in the poisoning of Litvinenko, who fled to Britain in 2000 after publicly accusing the security service of involvement in the bombings of two apartment buildings in Russia in 1999 in which 300 people died. Litvinenko had been investigating the murder last month of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, another critic of the Putin government.Litvinenko's death complicated a summit in Helsinki between Putin and European Union leaders. Speaking there, the Russian president called Litvinenko's death a tragedy, expressing his condolences and pledging his country's cooperation in the investigation.Addressing allegations that he had ordered the assassination to silence a troublesome critic, Putin said, "I hope the British authorities won't fuel groundless political scandals." He added, "It is a great pity that even such tragic things as human death are used for political provocations."Putin questioned why Litvinenko's deathbed note had not been made public before he died. Putin also said there was no official finding that Litvinenko had been murdered. "As I know, the medical certificate of British doctors does not indicate that he died a violent death," Putin said. "It does not say that. Hence there is no reason for such talk at all."Troop, the British health chief, said no autopsy had been conducted. She did not say why, but the BBC reported that "the delay is believed to be over concerns about the health implications for those present at the examination."Roger Cox, another health agency official, told reporters that radiation emitted by the polonium had been detected in Litvinenko's urine.**John Henry, a toxicologist who was asked by Litvinenko's family to look into the case and who examined Litvinenko before his death, said the type of polonium involved is "only found in government-controlled institutions." In an interview, Henry called polonium 210 an "extraordinary poison" that is lethal in doses so small, "you can lose it on the point of a pin."** ....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far superior to the laughably bad remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rudolph Mate's "D.O.A." opens with what is quite possibly one of the greatest film beginnings of all time. A disheveled man strides calmly into a police station and walks firmly down the halls of the large building while the credits role. As they come to an end he arrives at the homicide division of the station. "I'd like to report a murder," he says. "Who was murdered?" a cop behind a desk asks. "I was," he replies.The key to "D.O.A." lies not in its silly, ridiculous plot but rather the buildup of tension, and the horrific realization that you are to die and nothing you can do will stop this. The only thing you can do is find the man who did kill you and figure out why. Edmund O'Brien does this in "D.O.A." He plays an accountant named Frank Bigelow (who is not, ironically, a male gigalo). Frank takes a vacation away from his small town and ends up in a noisy downtown bar. He orders a drink, moves across the bar next to a young woman, asks the bartender to pass his drink down, sips it, and his face goes awry. "This isn't my drink," he says. He orders another and shrugs off the event.The next morning Frank feels strange. He goes to see a doctor. The doctor has some bad news: Frank has swallowed a dose of "luminous poison," a glow-in-the-dark, lethal substance that kills in a day, sometimes two days, but never longer than a week. At the end of the film is a disclaimer telling us that luminous poison is a real substance. However, it fails to tell us if it really acts as a slow-killing toxin, or if it is just some non-lethal substance used as an acid or adhesive (you never can tell).There's a terrific scene after Frank is told he will die. He flees the doctor's office like a madman and runs through the city. The camera follows him forever, using dissolves and finally it all ends when he comes to the bar he was at the night before. He knocks on the door but nobody inside answers. Distraught, he asks for another opinion from another doctor. It is confirmed that he will die.Frank retreats to his hotel a beaten man. Imagine how it would feel if you knew you were going to die within as short as a day or even a week? What would you do? Frank doesn't take the time to answer this - he departs on a game of detective, trying to track down his killer. He finally figures out that it is all over a sales claim Frank filed months ago that would prove a sale between two men, one of whom didn't want it known. But the killer is still out there...and which man is the killer?If "The Third Man" (1949) is the father of all film noirs, "D.O.A." (1949) is the mother. It isn't quite as skillful or believable or atmospheric as the former, nor as daring or haunting, but it still remains one of the best film noirs of all time, right alongside "The Maltese Falcon." The idea may be silly but the basic idea behind it - knowing you will undoubtedly die - is the horror of it all. Edmund O'Brien is a bit of a weak casting choice - he doesn't seem quite as manly as the main character should be - but I suppose he does well. He is a short man and looks a bit comical sometimes. He doesn't have a very strong screen presence. Let's leave it at that. Humphrey Bogart of Joseph Cotten would have been better choices, but we can't always have what we want in a low-budget B-movie from the 40s, can we?There is some terrific material in "D.O.A." It has elevated to a type of cult classic stature over the years. It was even remade in 1988 with Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan and Daniel Stern, but the outcome was an unfortunate, laughably bad campus farce about an author who was killed over a student's novel - miles away from the plot of this film. Some movies are just not meant to be remade.5/5 -</fullReview>

Did anybody buy this kind of dialog in 1949? It seems hard to imagine now.The acting is routine and mundane; some of it is almost laughably bad.But there are redeeming features. I liked the sleazy sexuality of ordinary people that reminds us that sex was indeed invented before 1963. I loved the street scenes of San Francisco of that period. Maybe it's a generational thing, but it seems to me that, if 1979 and 1999 occurred on difference planets, then 1949 and 1969 happened in different solar systems.

		<fullReview>Being a film noir lover, I was disappointed with this film.To begin with, the story is far-fetched and very pretentious. For having been poisoned with only a few days to live, Bigelow gets around really well, in both SF and LA, trying to solve an enigma about his "luminous poisoning". The fate of the main character will be determined by a fictional toxin! Bizarre scenes follow, due to the poor screenplay and acting.Bigelow and Paula come across as very corny, just as the repeated wolf call whistles. The sappy soundtrack theme is heard repeatedly and then yet again coming from a radio in a restaurant. Now that's corny!The jazz band scene is the best part; the musicians are obviously talented, but ironically were not credited. Yet we get a cornball credit for Luminous Toxin which the voice-over says is a fact. It is a fiction from paranoid cold-war days. Skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Original for the 1950's but a little bit overused for younger generations the theme of a man running against the clock to find the truth behind the lies on matters of life and death is the main premise of "D.O.A." a classic film noir starring Edmond O'Brien playing Frank Bigelow, a man who tries to catch the person who poisoned him with a lethal substance during a trip in San Francisco. Why he was poisoned? What's the mystery behind this happening? Mystery is set up in a nice film with lots of suspense, twists and turns.I like the film, it has its good moments and a strong solid acting by Mr. O'Brien and the supporting casting too but my view of this film was a little negative since I absolutely love the remake with Dennis Quaid released in 1988, since that was a movie with so much more to show. While the film of the 1950's is kind of tiresome and the plot is really confusing to track down all the names and situations the modern version had a better rhythm, lots of style (a cinematography that changes accordingly to the character's declining health; the great soundtrack), and a extra thing when it comes to hit us with an interesting revelation behind the poisoning (a college intrigue) instead of the confusing sales thing presented here. But, if we look back exclusively to what this film was years ago it was and is a innovative experience to see, a character who has his fate sealed right in the first scene, then telling his whole unfortunate experience in wonderful flashbacks, it's quite impressive. O'Brien captured the desperation of the character who knows about his tragic destiny, frantically running against time to find the responsible for his eminent death. He makes the film a enjoyable ride, even if there are times we get stuck with a romantic subplot that works sometimes. 6/10</fullReview>

The characters and acting aren't much (aside from the lead played by Edmond O'Brien, who is generally convincing), and the dialogue is inconsistent, so the plot has to do most of the work. It has some flaws, but the concept of a dying man trying to figure out what's going on while he still has time is interesting enough to keep you watching, and pretty soon there are plenty of new developments.After the first scene does a good job of getting your attention, for some reason it then slows down quite a bit, ostensibly to develop the characters, but this really just takes up time because they are indecisive and largely uninteresting in themselves. But once it gets going with the actual mystery, it's worthwhile. Though low on plausibility, it's creative and it moves quickly. If you like mysteries or crime films and won't mind the low-budget look, you'll most likely find it worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(Obvious joke) A film that's not dead on arrival (to my TV) but not quite the classic it's made out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>: This isn't quite the classic that it seems to be heralded in some quarters as. It's still an interesting flick. Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) has been poisoned for some unknown reason and has but days to uncover whodunit, before he dies. Interesting premise and it allows a certain tension to be built up as he races against his own ticking clock.Acting here. isn't great. O'Brien is able to play the `average Joe', meaning he comes a bit rough, with edges. but he's not all that convincing. His form and posture aren't quite aggressive enough to be fully believable. Others, such as Pamela Britton, have very thin flimsy roles that don't lend themselves to the material. Even Chester, a menacing villain, played by Neville Brand, seems over-extended and trying too hard. Nonetheless the performances never grate, or distract, and you can get on with the movie.This is definitely a script movie. We're left in the dark as much as Bigelow is. At first the movie is slow, but it does gather momentum and twists and turns suddenly appear from all angles. You have to keep focused to work out who everyone is and their interlinking relationships - all roles have their part to play. Everything does play out well and does make a satisfying sense in the end (even if it appears initially convoluted). It's a classic film noir in that sense, especially with the doom and gloom element of death overhanging the main character.Film noir is also helped by a director, in this case Rudolph Mate. He uses sharp contrast black &amp; white cinematography here. Sometimes this can make the film distracting - the visuals seem off kilter for such a movie, rather than having more layered shadows. At other times it aids to the atmosphere of the movie, and the tension faced by Bigelow. There is a distracting overuse of sound, particularly an irritatingly `comical' whistle used in an earlier scene to point out Bigelow's interest in women (yeah, we got it) that tends to grate but the pace is fairly tight, and the running time short enough (so as not to lose the tension).I'm not overly mad about `D.O.A.' There were too many flawed aspects to let the script win itself out and the script is more clever than having decent characterisation or witty lines. It's more than a curiosity and does exhibit more intelligence than many movies but it's not a classic nor essential viewing. An afternoon movie (which is precisely when it was on for me) - 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fictional Poisoning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one plays out like a science fiction mystery-thriller with it's "luminous poisoning" idea. Seems they could have found real poisoning idea for this film - like he's being poisoned slowly over time and goes to the doctor because he's getting sicker or something. This film's fictional poison and it's cure are a silly idea for a realistic crime-mystery. I can easily buy into this idea for sci-fi but not for a supposedly realistic crime-drama. I also think the idea of a fictional cure is worse than the idea of a fictitious poison - I guess they wanted an "all's well that ends well" finale that didn't pan out for our lead. The film has it's good points: it's interesting watching this poor guy uncover who poisoned him and why. But that's about it. The film is not as good as it's made out to be in my opinion but worth a watch.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why not say radiation poisoning?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good movie, but why do they go through all this gibberish about a "luminous toxin," including an official note from a doctor at the very end which says "luminous toxin is a descriptive term for a real poison"? It's obvious, with all the talk of shipments of iridum and the way the poison glows in the dark in the doctor's office that we are talking about radiation poisoning. I wonder if it had to do with the politics of the time. Since they were doing all these above ground atomic tests, I wonder if the government didn't want people thinking radiation could kill you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To really appreciate this film it should have been watched on its release, 1950. Sixty years later in a world of CIS and the like it seems strangely innocent. Top marks however for selecting the right leading man, Eddie O'Brien was a great actor who could and did do anything - within three years he was playing Casca in Mank's Julius Caesar and the following year, also for Mank, he was an unforgettable Oscar Muldoon in The Barefoot Contessa. Here he is cast as a small-town CPA, more or less decent, who lights out for Frisco on a week's vacation where, for no apparent reason, someone whose face we don't see slips him a Mickey with a difference. This Mickey is fatal if not negated within hours. Now the plot proper kicks in, with an unspecified time though days at the most to live, he sets out to try to discover why anyone would want to kill him. It is, of course, hokum - the weapon of choice is right out of Agatha Christie, a hit-and-run for example would be more effective inasmuch as death would be instantaneous so that he'd never know who targeted him and why. On the other hand, improbable or not it makes for a gripping yarn and O'Brien extracts every last ounce out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you literally translate "film noir" ....black film... then this is the epitome of the term. It is dark and unrelenting, depressing and unpleasant.There is not a sympathetic character in the cast, unless you count Pamela Britton as the girlfriend. But her character is so secondary that it does not really register. Edmund O"Brien does a good job as the doomed "hero" and probably was the right choice for the part. He had always been cast in second leads because he did not have the charisma, air of mystery, or looks that it took for leading man status. In this film, he fits the bill perfectly as a common man who has something evil thrust upon him through no fault of his own.Neville Brand is ludicrous in the bad boy role...such mugging hasn't been seen since the transition from silent to sound when actors were still getting used to the microphone. You hope he is killed immediately after his first appearance! The overuse of characters names is very irritating. For instance, O"Brien says "Paula" about 25 times in a 3 minute telephone conversation with that character. People don't talk like that. Luther Adler is OK as the main bad guy but never really seems evil enough for the role. The story is unusual and holds interest although it suspends belief that the whole mystery can be solved in 24 hours. I'm not sure that it is a classic film noir but if not, it is as close as it gets and is a hell of a lot better than the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DOA is a very enjoyable film that is a prototypical film noir. Unfortunately, it includes all the weaknesses of that genre as well as the strengths: an incredibly tortuous plot, illogical action, tough-guy antics, some real B-movie acting and directing, etc. If you like film noir, you will certainly enjoy DOA, but don't expect it to rise above the genre or to the level of The Big Sleep or Chinatown, say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a script that reaches for an identity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D.O.A. has all the right elements to be a great film-noir, but instead the script fumbles for an identity: romance or mystery? Often times this combination can be pulled off beautifully (see anything Humphrey Bogart was involved in), but in this case the romance acts independent of the mystery and frankly we are not sure if Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) is even interested in Paula Gibson (Pamela Britton) and frankly by the latter third of the film we don't care.The actual mystery of the film is quite promising, if somewhat implausible. Bigelow is poisoned mysteriously, will die in a few days and must find out who did it before time runs out. However, each step of the mystery is not securely bound and you are more left scratching your head than gasping in wonder or fright.D.O.A. is a B-grade movie that unfortunately plays out with a lesser grade script. Edmond O'Brien fills out his role by running and yelling a lot and Pamela Britton doesn't seem quite sure what her character wants: love or to just out of the relationship (the viewer is wondering is there even a relationship to begin with). D.O.A. certainly lives up to its acronym.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>luminous poison and cat calls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a lousy film. It is almost impossible to follow the plot and the cliché amateur acting (like the bad thug who rolls his eyes)is painful to watch. As some one else put it at times you feel like you have to laugh in a painful way.I could go on and on about the stupidity of the story: luminous poison?? what the he*l? I guess it was in the age when nuclear bombs and radioactivity were at the forefront of people's minds--why not just call the poison that?? A radioactive substance? It could have been like that Russian guy who just died in London.Bad guys trafficking in iridium??? In short nothing is convincing or realistic in this horrible movie. I rented it only because it was part of a series entitled the "Best in Film Noir" marketed by Block Buster. I expected things like Diabolique....hardly!!! This is pure garbage...Oh I forgot to mention cat calls when ever a pretty girl walks by...that really fits into a noir film atmosphere.Don't even consider this movie. Every copy of it should be destroyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Extremely Chaotic Crime/Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1950 - I had heard a lot of good things about D.O.A., but, unfortunately, found its story's premise to be way too haywire and implausible for me to take it at all seriously. Instead of being exciting, I found D.O.A.'s frantic pace to be actually quite annoying.As well, this film contained a lot of over-acting by its principal players. There seemed to be so much over-the-top scenery chewing taking place, especially by Edmond O'Brien, as Frank Bigelow, that I began to view this gravely solemn Crime/Drama as something of a cartoon-style comedy.There were a number of times when I actually burst out laughing when the situation was clearly meant to be taken with the utmost solemn seriousness.Told in a series of continual flashbacks, D.O.A.'s story concerns Frank Bigelow, a small-town accountant, who, after living-it-up in San Francisco one weekend, finds out that he has been poisoned by a "luminous toxin" (which had been, unknowingly, poured into his drink).With there being no antidote, Bigelow is told by the doctor that he has, at the most, a week to live. (It is never explained why this poison didn't make him violently ill) Not knowing who did this to him or why, Bigelow embarks on a desperate journey to try to find out the identity of his murderer.Directed by Rudolph Mate', D.O.A., filmed in b&amp;w, had a running time of only 83 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well known due to the remake and lacking the style of that version but is still a tough, enjoyable mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Small town accountant Frank Bigelow goes to San Francisco for a bit of holiday to kick loose before marrying his fiancé Paula the next weekend. However several days after arriving in the city he arrives at a police station and reports a murder ? his own. He then recounts the story of his past few days where he was told he had been poisoned and sets out to find out where it happened and who did it before he dies.I have seen the rather silly remake already and knew what to expect from this film although I was glad to see that the plot was different even if the basic concept was the same. The plot here is enjoyably convoluted and, to be honest, I was still left with some questions around some of the steps the film makes but generally I was swept along with the mystery story. The film twists and turns a little bit, leading Frank into trouble (even if he is doomed anyway) and it is enjoyable whether the twists are red herrings or the real story. This original lacks the clever style of the remake (I loved the way the colour fades throughout) but it makes up for it by being a solidly staged thriller with the blacks and white of noir, even if it doesn't have too many moments where it really shines in this regard (a surprise to me considering Maté's track record as a cinematographer). The plot twists do demand some forgiving but once the film gets going then it is easy to be swept along by it's desperate pace ? only a slow 15/20 minutes after the impacting opening acts as a bit of a drag, giving us more background and character than we really needed.What makes the film work well is the tough dialogue and the scenes of increasing desperation as the film progresses. Part of this is down to the writers ? I do not know why this film was banned in Finland for six years but I imagine it was for the violent tone of the film. Individual tough lines are complimented by a violent edge ? the most surprising example of it was the graphic (for the time) speech from Chester about putting one 'in the belly'. Of course the dialogue is naught without a good delivery and in this regard the cast serve it well. O'Brien's lead role starts averagely enough but he does a great job of taking his 'nice' character and making him tough and harsher as the moments of his life slowly tick away ? with his performance alone it is like we are seeing another character slowly emerge. The support cast are pretty good and the only downside of the mystery is that the bad guy is not present until the very end. For me the standout support role was from a wide-eyed Neville Brand who only has a few scenes but steals them all in the same psychotic manner than Pesci did in Goodfellas.Overall this doesn't have as much style as the remake did but it is a much better film. The plot twists are enjoyable even if they are not all as perfectly written as you'd like (a flaw that is well covered by the film's desperate pace), the cast are good with a very strong lead from O'Brien, and they all get tough dialogue to work with in a film that is a lot tougher than I expected and enjoyably slick. It's only real weakness is a slow 15 minute set up after an initially impacting opening scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Idea, Poor Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that most of the commenter's on this site loved this film, and that makes sense. The ideas behind it are essential to noir - that existential despair which arises when life hits you in the belly, the fear of death and the overwhelming desire to understand why fate has dealt you these cards. Everything in this film is noir to the hilt, and it could furnish a hundred essays with ease.But it's crap.That's too harsh, but honestly, no true film fan can watch this without it embarrassing them. Godawful acting by all involved, light characters, poor dialogue, the infamous 'wolf-whistles'. I don't want to be an arsey nerd-hole, but one of the things which is exciting about noir is how well made they are, how they stand up to time as exciting visions of artists rather than mass produced nonsense. The only well produced scene in this is the jazz scene with the fishermen. It's an outstanding vignette which I regularly show to my friends (you can jut imagine the fun we have round my house... kerazy). In all the other scenes you keep getting the unfortunate need to laugh.Luminous. S***ting. Poisoning. So that's a poison so dangerous it glows in the dark. Come on people!A premise that would make most directors sweat is reduced to ridiculousness by the fact that every scene is weak. Bad direction, bad acting, bad script. This really could have been a contender; no wonder people have wanted to remake it. I'd do it myself if I had the chance. I don't want to be unfair to this film. If you 'get' old films and have a penchant for film noir then do go and see it. Just don't expect a 'Touch of Evil' or a 'Kiss Me Deadly'. It's all the more frustrating for just falling short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"D.O.A."'s sensibilities are straight out of the stone age. The female lead is a drippy loser who gives her lover carte blanche to cheat on her while he's out of town, but then she gets all clingy and calls him night and day; kinda hard to respect a character like that, isn't it? Our intrepid hero is basically a big jerk, walking all over his girlfriend and bossing everybody around once he finds out that he's ingested a healthy dose of luminous poison. The "ticking clock" nature of the story is pretty exciting, but the mystery's resolution is typical noir stuff, overcomplicated and confusing. Simplistic and silly - there's a lot of better crime movies out there than this.</fullReview>
