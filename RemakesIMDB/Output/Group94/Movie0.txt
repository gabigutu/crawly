		<shortDescription>Fantastic Sleeper Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"D.O.A" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact. The film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. Would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography. All these elements help to keep proceedings fresh. Really the greatest thrill here is to be had with the dialogue, it's snappy yet intricate, doesn't waste a word and yet still manages to be entertaining. The screenplay for this is like a pocket work of art. This went unnoticed by me for ages before I finally caught it late at night. If this is the first you've heard about it, don't leave it like I did! Catch it soon, it really is top-notch... ! If you're in the mood for a solid genre flick that manages to surprise at every turn, this really fits the bill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VASTLY UNDERRATED; QUAID IS EXCELLENT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D.O.A. (1988) *** Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan, Charlotte Rampling, Daniel Stern. Fast-paced and nifty remake of the 1949 classic about a man being poisoned with time his factor as he tries to solve his own murder. Quaid is top-notch as a college English professor trying to figure out just who his enemies are and Ryan is plucky student aiding him. Cool camera movements and some fine direction from the creators of tv's "Max Headroom", Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A promising 'noir' remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those wishing to see film noir remakes, should not see this as as a remake, you will always be disappointed. Instead, enjoy a gripping performance from Dennis Quaid and visual imagery to commend. The colour drains from the film (literally, not metaphorically!)) as the plot gathers pace, and the dialogue is crisp and gritty. The opening dialogue is clever, and the viewer is carried along by a sharp screenplay and a real, original film noir feel,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of a classic which just doesn't even come close to the required standard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D.O.A has a good premise, borrowed from a 1950 film of the same name and a 1969 film entitled Color Me Dead. But beyond the premise it fails to develop into anything worthwhile. The script mistakes ludicrousness for cleverness; the directors peculiarly seem to think they're making a pop video rather than a film; and Dennis Quaid puts on a weird grin and raises his eyebrows maniacally as if he's auditioning as a Jack Nicholson impersonator. It's good for a laugh but, since that wasn't the original intention, it's hard to rate this as a worthwhile film.English lecturer Dexter Cornell (Quaid) is a bitter, bored shell of a man. Formerly a great author, he never recovered from the critical failure of his fourth and final novel and vowed never to write again. Without the drive of writing to fill his life, he gave up on everything else too, including his marriage and his dedication to the job. When pupil Nick Lang (Rob Knepper) apparently commits suicide after handing in an assignment, Cornell hits the booze to get over the shock. But soon thereafter, he learns that he has drunk a slow-acting poison, and that within 48 hours he will be dead. So close to death, he finally finds a renewed purpose in being alive.... as, aided by student Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan), he desperately attempts to solve his own "murder".It's such a good idea that one can hardly imagine how it could fail. But it does. It really, really does fail in a big way. All the pointlessly fancy camera angles, all the inappropriate musical scoring, and especially the jaw-droppingly stupid solution to the mystery, conspire to ruin the film. D.O.A stands for "Dead On Arrival", and that's the perfect adjectival phrase for the entire film. Some day, this wonderful idea for a film might be used once again to better effect, but for now you'd be best advised to stick with the 1950 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dex's Frantic Race Against Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the 1950 classic film noir of the same name cleverly utilises a combination of old and new elements to create an entertaining thriller which, although designed for 1980s moviegoers, still has a strong appeal to contemporary audiences.Fans of the original will particularly appreciate the fact that the basic premise of the story has been retained and will also enjoy the black and white sequences at the beginning and end of the movie which provide a stylish homage to Rudolph Mate's film. Those not familiar with the original will also find it an enjoyable mystery which involves murder, jealousy, campus politics and a very unusual motive for murder.University professor Dexter (Dex) Cornell (Dennis Quaid) goes into a police station to report his own murder and as his story is recorded on video tape, it becomes clear that he's been poisoned with a slow acting substance which left him with less than 48 hours to track down his killer and to find out why anyone would want to murder him.Dex had written some successful novels but when writer's block set in, he'd become disillusioned and progressively lost interest in what he was doing. His despair became even greater when one of his most talented students, Nick Lang (Robert Knepper) died after falling from a high building and his wife Gail (Jane Kaczmarek) pressed him to go ahead with action to speed up their divorce. Dexter then reacted by seeking consolation in the local bars where he met Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan) who was one of his students who had a crush on him. The couple then got drunk together and went back to Sydney's place.Next morning when Dex woke up feeling ill, he knew he was suffering from something more serious than a hangover and checks at a local clinic confirmed that he'd been poisoned. There was no antidote which could help his condition and so, knowing that he didn't have long to live, he decided to visit Gail who had been involved in an affair with Nick. When Dex found her dead body, the police immediately suspected him of murdering both her and Nick. Dex took an opportunity to escape from the police and then decided to force Sydney to go with him to the places they'd visited the previous night, to try to discover who'd murdered him.During Dex's frantic race against time he learned more about Nick's complicated family background and together with Sydney escaped the attentions of a vicious assailant who pursued them with a nail gun. The identity of the murderer surprises Dex but the motive proves to be even more shocking.Directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel employ an interesting combination of stylistic influences which work together very effectively. The use of high and low angle shots, close-ups and tilted camera angles are also especially successful as they reflect the sense of chaos and confusion which prevails through certain passages of the action.This is a film which features good performances from Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan and Charlotte Rampling and has a premise which gives its story a natural sense of pace and urgency. Add to this a number of twists and numerous moments of suspense and humour and the final result is an intriguing mystery which is great fun to watch.</fullReview>

Supporting cast in frankly enjoyable , such as Charlotte Rampling , Daniel Stern , Jane Kaczmarek , Christopher Neame , Robert Knepper , Jay Patterson and the deceased Brion James . Colorful cinematography throughout the story , the color in the film begins to drain to monochrome, thus representing the central character's deteriorating health as the poison steadily takes it's toll until it is in black and white as in the opening - presumably showing the flashback catching up to the current time-line of the story . Screeching and inappropriate musical score composed by means of synthesizer .The motion picture was middlingly directed by Rocky Morton ans Annabel Jenkel , the same people who brought ¨Max Headrom¨to TV series . This story results to be a remake from ¨DOA¨ (1969) a dark B-thriller directed by Rudolph Mate with Edmond O'Brien , Luther Adler and Pamela Britton . It was also followed by a inferior remake as ¨Color me dead¨(1969) by Eddie Davis with Tom Tryon , Carolyn Jones and Rick Jason</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good update of the original film, with good performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original "D.O.A." is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after "The Right Stuff" made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.This is more of an "update" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different. The plot is pretty much the same. A man (this time an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin) is poisoned and he has only 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him. Jane Kaczmarek plays Quaid's estranged wife, in a low key, but intense performance; she steals every scene she is in. Daniel Stern (also in an early role, before "Home Alone" made him famous) plays Quaid's colleague. Charlotte Rampling is fine too in a supporting role.The entire cast is top notch; The film is stylish, with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end. I think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller, and as a modern version of a classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another One slipped by</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid).Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a bit much, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students. He has recommended a friend for advancement, and one bright young student has submitted a manuscript to him as an independent project. Cornell doesn't even want to read it, so gives it an "A", and pushes it to the side. Leaning back with a drink in his office he stares out the window, when the bright young student falls past his window on the way to meeting the sidewalk in a splat encounter.Hal comes to talk, and they chat, drinking some more. The Cornell realizes that he HAS to read the manuscript, now. When he goes home, his wife is waiting with divorce papers. He drinks some more. She leaves, and he goes to a faculty affair, only to find her there. He drinks even more. And when his wife learns that the student is dead, she swoons, and he learns that she had been having an affair with the student. This of course prompts him to do some more serious drinking. The next morning he wakes up to find himself in the dorm room of one of his students, a freshman named Syd (Meg Ryan).He feels worse than a hangover, goes to the doctor and learns that he has been poisoned, it is irreversible, and he has 24-48 hours to live. He doesn't have much time to find out who killed him, and there are sub-plots, motives, relationships and surprises at every turn, although everything makes sense at the end. All his discoveries and exchanges are adorned with sarcasm, dry wit and keen observations. Let's just say that this movie will give new meaning to the adage "publish or perish".There are no bad performances in this movie. There are recurrent images, and symbolism used at careful intervals. Watch for the cracked glass, and images distorted through glass. Some of the camera shots are revolutionary for 1988, and some of the violent action is carefully and skillfully choreographed. The music is unobtrusive and appropriate, although occasionally it makes it's own statement, in song lyrics. The visuals in this flick are impressive.If there are any failures, it is that the opening 20 minutes move a little slow, and nearly puts you to sleep. But the pacing picks up quickly, with just the right amount of exposition in between action segments.There are no explicit sexual encounters, although there is violence and some bad language.This is a writer's movie, and is best appreciated by those who have a sense of humor about their own success or failure. I do think if you take it seriously, you're already in big trouble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch-able but overdone --Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film takes a lean, mean original and attacks it from the standpoint of the 80s/90s block-buster/Splurge Culture aesthetic, piling set pieces high as if more is more, and way too much is never quite enough.The first D.O.A., which was once some pretty over-the-top stuff, seems positively spare, Bergmanesque, compared to this late 80s Hollywood Baroque Garage Sale. Upholstered over the simple frame of the original film: a bloody, violent wife murder sub-plot; a nail gun attack in the dark; a car wreck into a nasty, burbling, all-engulfing slime pit with everyone scrambling to escape; a new motive for the protagonists murder, something or other about professional jealousy among writers (talk about your self-referring script); and a diffuse, wha-happen new arty ending.As watch-able as the film is, it is a little overdone. I guess when you aren't sure whether you can do one or two things really well, the best thing to do is crank out two dozen things, and hope at least a few of them will stick in the audience's mind. And why treat a movie like a short story -- everything toward one effect -- when you can make it like one of those sprawling 1200 page literary developments, the kind the drugstore sells?The music, again, irritates here, seeming jarring and incongruous in several places. And long, slow, lazy Tangerine Dream style synthesizer blares and wails, while evocative of a certain mood are also, perhaps even more, evocative of the early-mid 80s. 7 stars. I like this Quaid; he works in the role. After seeing it, I would say it is hard to imagine anyone else in Hollywood at the time playing this character with the right mix of vulnerability and near toughness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Life in the Genre on Presentation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Books and movies really are different and nowhere is this more apparent than with the mystery. The genre is among the most popular in literature and least popular in film. The closest one usually comes is a `thriller,' where plot details are revealed piecemeal just to keep your attention. Sometimes we are tweaked with a twist at the end (Sixth Sense, Usual Suspects), but it is localized and gimmicky.Why this mismatch? Why are filmed mysteries (mostly on Public TV) mere character pieces? Because the nature of the mystery has to do with the notion of internal narrative in a novel; in `normal' fiction, the separation between reader and writer is straightforward. In a detective story, in the original form, the reader is co-writer, with reader and writer each inventing what happens next. (Assuming the story plays `fair' with facts and logic as was originally the rule.)Each tries to trick the other, in a mental contest that adds life to the story in a peculiar and intense way no other genre or medium can match. The device is seldom quoted well in film, so in DOA (a remake), we have reason for celebration.Caution: Spoilers ahead.Here we have an old-style mystery which is deeply self-referential. The writer of this story wrote about: what else? A writer of mystery stories. The device of bringing life to the story by engaging the reader is applied to the story of: guess what? That writer having `lost life' in his work and thence in his `real' life. It is a terrifically well crafted self-reference in both the mystery form and the mystery story and concerns killing over yet a third story (which `has life' because that student writer's life and death is the driving mystery of the film's story). Here, the director does not shy from making the viewer co-director. Thrilling!This device is aided by two parallel effects: One planned, one not. The planned effect is overtly cinematic: The film starts with full color, normal lighting and `straight' staging. The viewer is not reminded that this is a film. As the story progresses, the film becomes more and more aware of itself: the color is replaced with high contrast black and white, with the lighting and framing very `arty.' The director wants to emphasize that as the viewer becomes a collaborator, the film gains inner life becoming more introspective.The second effect is biographical. Quaid was deeply into drugs at this time. His real life savior and to be wife (no fooling) is the young student here. Adds another reflexive dimension.You can enjoy this intelligent film both directly and indirectly. So cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This so-called remake of the 1950 movie by the same name is probably less similar to said movie than Avatar is to Dances With Wolves... It shares the premise of a man learning he has a limited time to live, and tries to find out who poisoned him in that time. The settings, characters and execution is very different, though, and personally I much prefer this "remake" to the 1950 movie.I was especially caught by the cinematography and color effects, which I found quite unique. The main character is properly fleshed out, and likable, and his story is fascinating and told in an effective and well paced manner. I found the resolution rather predictable, but it didn't really take away from my enjoyment of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Remake Of The 1949 Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D.O.A. is a remake of the 1949 film of the same title that shares the same premise but otherwise have a different story and characters. It stars Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan, and Charlotte Rampling. It was directed by Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton and scripted by Charles Edward Pogue. The writers of the original film, Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene, share story credit with Pogue. "They didn't kill me; I was dead already," is the statement uttered by Dexter Cornell, an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has been poisoned by a slow-acting toxin and who has twenty- four hours to track down his killers before he ceases to exist. Cornell is a burned-out novelist trying to hold on to tenure at the university while seeing his marriage collapse around him. As if that weren't enough, he is receiving amorous come-ons from smart, young student Sydney Fuller and being badgered by another student, Nick Lang, to read his brilliant first novel. Not long after Dex demurs to Nick to read his novel, Nick is killed in a fall. Only then does Dex find out that Nick has been having an affair with his wife. Things keep going from bad to worse when, after an all-night drinking binge, Dex discovers that he has been slipped a poison that will kill him within 24 hours. Teaming up with the adoring Sydney, Dex tries to track down the person who poisoned him while dodging the cops, since he happens to be a prime murder suspect.It's not on the same level as the original, but this updated version still manages a few enjoyable twists, as it is a witty and literate thriller, with a lot of irony to cut the violence. The ending shouldn't be given away, but it hangs on a laughable motivation for murder that says more about the plagiarist Zen of Hollywood and screenwriters than anything else. Quaid is convincing as the chain-smoking English professor, Ryan is true blue as the stalwart coed and Rampling looks capable of keeping her victims alive just to toy with them.In summary, "film noir on campus" idea works surprisingly well as it has enough inventive moments to make it interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a remake - more like a clever homage with a gripping story in its own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The similarity between this DOA and the original is that a man has taken poison with no known cure, and with a limited time left to live, he seeks to learn why he was poisoned. Other similarities turn out to be that if you let the film take you where it takes you, it is a fast-pace and highly enjoyable thriller with very clever dialog, interesting and menacing characters, and unusual situations. This one mixes in a bit more dark humor than the 1950 version but the stories are different and the inclusion of Ryan adds zest. The direction is crisp. The supporting work by Charlotte Rampling, Daniel Stern, Jane Kaczmarek, and others is at times, amazing. I highly recommend seeing the 1988 DOA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dennis Quaid/Meg Ryan film 3 years before they married, good suspense film I rate 6 or 7 of 10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAUTION -- MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS --In just the 13 years since this film was released, film-making has improved so much it is hard to rate older films accurately, but I give it "7" of 10, mainly because of the Quaid/Ryan interaction. Or maybe only 6, we'll see! She was only 26, a mere kid, and he a ripe old 33 when filming was done. This was their 2nd film together, they married in 1991."D.O.A." gets its title from the opening sequence, in B&amp;W, when Dex (Quaid) gets himself to the police station, saying he is already dead. The whole movie is then told in "flashback" form, in color, and then goes back to B&amp;W in the last scene.The mystery is unfolded gradually. Dex is an English professor, Syd (Ryan) is one of his students "just wanting to spend one night" with him, but gets caught up in his "chase" when he uses superglue on his hand, then wrapped around her wrist, so they become inseparable. Another student is Nick Lang, a budding author who is being put through college by the woman whose husband was killed by Nick's father. One day Nick falls to his death right past Dex's office window, onto the street below.Nick's fall turns out to be murder, meanwhile Dex starts to feel very sick and a blood test shows he has a poison in his system which will kill him in a few days. Then his wife, Gail, filing for divorce, turns out to be Nick's lover, and she is then murdered too because a copy of Nick's book ends up at her house. Turns out Dex's fellow English professor (Daniel Stern), jealous of Nick's book, decides to steal it for his own, but must kill everyone, including his friend Dex, so that he will not be exposed.In another twist, Nick turns out to be the real son of the lady putting him through school, and they had to stop him from dating his little sister. The plot keeps the viewer guessing, and the film has a sort of "Hitchcock" quality to it. But some of the dialog, and much of the action, are kinda "cheesy". Dex's last line, to the policemen ready to tape his story, "Just somebody's homework. That was all."I'm going to change my mind, and only give it "6" of 10, it's just a little too ragged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who was murdered? He was!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D.O.A. is directed by Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton and adapted to screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue from a story by Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene. It stars Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan, Daniel Stern, Charlotte Rampling, Jane Kaczmarek and Christopher Neame. Music is by Chaz Jankel and cinematography by Yuri Neyman.A loose remake of the 1950 film noir of the same name, the story finds Professor Dexter Cornell (Quaid) staggering into a police station proclaiming that he is dying because someone has poisoned him. Told in flashback by Cornell, we see the events that led up to the point he was poisoned, but not who did it, and then track the frantic Professor as he tries to solve the who done it mystery before he keels over and dies.Not as bad as the poor box office returns suggest it is, D.O.A. is still very much a frustratingly shaky experience. Lifting only the basic idea of the 1950 movie, the makers stamp their own mark on the premise but add too many red herrings to the already fishy stew. Some plot developments are daft, as is the casting of Meg Ryan in the key femme role - seriously she is just too cookie cute and homely for this material ? while the motive reveal is a bit much to swallow. Yet there's still a lot to enjoy and sample here for the neo-noir faithful.Visually the picture is stylish and appreciative to its noir roots. Opening in black and white to set the story in motion, Jankel and Morton then infuse the film with angled shots and frame distortions. Shadows often come into play, with Venetian blinds and roof rafters impacting, while the addition of a spiral staircase late in the day is most pleasing. Quaid is ever watchable in what is a tricky role that calls for him to garner sympathy whilst not being likable! While elsewhere Stern and Rampling provide good characterisations, even if as written the roles are too small given the importance the characters have to the plot shenanigans.A bit over cooked on the page, and basically a race against time thriller dressed up in neo-noir clothing, D.O.A. is still none the less worthy of a viewing. 6.5/10</fullReview>

Dennis Quaid,(Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems! If you like Dennis Quaid and love Meg Ryan you will enjoy viewing this film, Meg gave an outstanding performance and kept this picture worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In case you are wondering, I *did* see the original 1950 "D.O.A." movie years ago, and I remember that I enjoyed it. Much more so than this unnecessary remake. While it's not the worst remake I have seen, it is burdened by flaws that will be noticeable to even those who haven't seen the original version. For one thing, there is the portrayal of the central protagonist. He comes across as a kind of a jerk both before he is poisoned as well as when he knows he is dying and is trying to figure out who the culprit is. Another problem with the movie is that it is pretty easy to figure out who the culprit is as well as that person's motives - all you have to do is look at who is near the top of the cast billing and realize that that certain person seems to have no other purpose in the movie. The direction is stylish and effective at times, but more often than not it is loud and garish, and ends up being very distracting. Even if you dislike black and white movies (unlike myself), this is definitely one time where you'd be more satisfied with the original movie rather than this remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think when Quaid and Ryan were married and their chemistry on screen is terrific in a terrific story remade from an even better earlier film from the 40's, I understand. This DOA is just different enough to make it interesting to watch. Yes in places this updated version of DOA drags almost to the point where I got bored. There are more than a music club scenes in DOA that seem to be thrown in just to get lots of use the club set. The music is loud but nothing special. This revamped DOA is more of a who done it and valid suspects are plentiful. The characters are well acted an interesting. The original DOA did a far better job of telling you time was of the essence. This DOA uses a contemporary theme of a cheating wife, questionable associates and scheming students to create a web of suspects the main character must weed through.The film moves a mile-a-minute, with people getting knocked over the head with things, people chasing through tar pits, and of course a short episode at the compulsory carnival. Seems like suspense movies from the 1980's until the mid-1990's always have a scene where the protagonist is stumbling through a carnival or bizarre of some sort late in the evening to add to his already dazed-and-confused condition. Some of the action is a bit unbelievable but what saves it are the fine performances of all the leads, particularly Quaid who keeps you wanting to find out with him what is really going on. Certainly not the best movie of its type, but it has a look and feel all its own.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good in all aspects except the mystery itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks mostly to its unique premise (yes, yes, I know it's a remake, but it's still pretty unique), "D.O.A" has the strong sense of narrative propulsion and urgency that most thrillers wish to achieve, backed up by an innovative music score and effective, occasionally "distorted" cinematography. The film even has some existential depth to it; the scene where Quaid learns the news of his imminent death, runs outside, and experiences the sun, the air, the people as if it's for the first (and possibly last) time is terrific. The one flaw of the movie is the obviousness of its red herrings; it wants to be a whodunit, but the killer is not that hard to spot. Apart from that, a good movie with a good cast. Best line: - "This is kidnapping, you know" - "If I'm lucky they'll give me life!". *** out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>flawed remake of excellent 1950s classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fast-paced remake of the exclellent 1949 film-noir. With Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan on fine, romantic form Quaid is the English professor who walks into a police station and reports a murder: his own. He has 24 hours to live after having been given poison, and is determined to use the remainder of his life to find his killer.This film is fast-paced and littered with corpses and more red herrings than Brixton market, but the direction and script never gel. Despite a competent and charming performance by Quaid, paired with his real-life wife-to-briefly-be Ryan (a romance necessarily also conducted at top speed), D.O.A. is let down by a cop-out ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>D.O.A. (1988) vs. D.O.A. (1950)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original D.O.A. had one of the all-time classic premises of Film Noir: man investigates his own murder after he is poisoned. This perfectly encapsulated the Film Noir world: creeping doom, hidden motivations, danger around every corner, and the everyday, ordinary man whose world is turned upside down and thrown into confusion and horror. To the ultimate level, in fact: his world is coming to an end and there is nothing he can do to alter his fate. All he can do is unravel the mystery, ensuring that he will obtain the one minimal thing he can achieve at this point, that being the answers to his fate: who killed him and why. Cold comfort, but it's all he has left at this point and he knows it, so he grabs for it with all the tenacity of a drowning man struggling for a life raft, but one which is full of holes anyway.The 1988 re-imagining keeps that general premise, but changes everything else, and for no good reason that I can determine. The newer film copies the 1950 film for about the first minute, then deviates into its own world. Setting, plot and motivations are all completely altered.We have the "Christmas heat wave", the University setting, changing of the protagonist from accountant to English professor, adding of additional murders, the Crazy Glue on the arm bit (a bit of The Defiant Ones there) and a good chunk of Chinatown lifted wholesale, as well as a few bits taken from Citizen Kane. Well, if you're going to steal, steal from the best, so I can't dock them too much on that score. There's also the addition of Meg Ryan as occasional helper and romantic interest, something which weakens the notion in the original where the doomed hero must figure out everything for himself.The film was directed by Max Headroom creators/directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel, helmers a little later of the justifiably excoriated Super Mario Brothers: The Movie. Note the Max Headroom tribute in the first scene at the police station where Dennis Quaid is seen on the twonky video monitor.Well, they do put together a lively action film with a lot of 1980's colors, and even a cameo from one-hit wonders Timbuk 3. Cool, like watching one of those obscure 1960's relics like The Cool Ones which features Mrs. Miller.But, that ending! You really sank the boat with that ending, people. Have to rate you at a 2 out of 10.Spoiler Alert! What happened at the end? Did he die? Isn't the whole point of the movie that he dies at the end? Otherwise, then why, for corn's sake why, is the movie even called D.O.A.? Does he just walk down the hall? Or is that a metaphorical hallway, where he "walks toward the light"?It was not clear! A little clarity would have been appreciated guys. But, if you intended that he was cleared of all charges and he just walked out of the police station, then, with all due respect, I must ask you: W T F ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The title says it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rudolph Maté's film from 1950 is given a revamp for the 80's, Dexter Cornell(Dennis Quaid) is a university lecturer who used to have a successful writing career, but thats now gone down the tubes along with his marriage. The initial exposition plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him, so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned, we are not that surprised, unless of course you are familiar with the original. Dexter after being told he has less than 48hrs to live, decides to trace back his steps with the help of one of his students Sydney Fuller(Meg Ryan), but they find they have many obstacles in their way.The film begins promisingly in black and white, as Dexter staggers in the rain towards the local police station where he wishes to report a murder...his own, but the Huey lewis style 80's beat that accompanies this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be pretty bad, its only a question of how bad? Sure enough we are soon using the old flashback medium, but now the film resorts to full Technicolor. There are some brief homages to Noir, as the embracing couple stand in front of a venetian blind, but there's really nothing here to recommend it, the performances are awful, Ryan in particular doing her usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine. The film is a lazy attempt to put some unneeded ooomph into an already fine movie premise, obviously trying to cash in one the Body Heat audience, the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at a teen audience and to be sure, they are welcome to it. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Passable time filler...back in 1988. Otherwise a somewhat unnecessary redo of a '50s era Noir classic, lensed for the most part in Austin, Texas. Quaid's portrayal of a haunted and hunted college lit prof is passionate if nothing else. Supporting roles are mostly filled with what can generously be termed, "over-actors". Charlotte Rampling must have wandered in from another set, ironically giving the proceedings a bit more art house street cred than deserved. I enjoyed this when it was released. Upon re-watching in 2016, the film now seems slight and dated. Not really clever enough to be a satire, it instead aspires to homage with somewhat uneven results.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead And Alive !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well.. (Meg Ryan) was fabulous.. I've always dreamed of a similar classmate or mate !, she was at the top of her loveliness, tenderness, sexiness. (Dennis Quaid) was at the top too.. He did some unforgettable efforts to the extent that I believed how he was this grieved sarcastic professor. (Annabel Jankal) &amp; (Rocky Morton) made a fine job to sense the oddity of the moment through solidly suspenseful atmosphere.In fact I'm crazy about such a plot which can make the whole world collapses on the head of its hero in only one or two days whatever the genre is (Die Hard, 1941, Before Sunset, Hallo Dolly.. etc). Here it's the perfect thriller : How to find the one who killed YOU in just less than 48 hours ?!!! I said a genuine WAW when I knew that it had been done firstly at 1950 !, it's a great formula for strong noir, sharp thrill, and one hell of a meaning too because ? as in here - when you're living in a world has no trust in it among society of unfaithful people to discover eventually that your closest friend is the one who planned to kill you..Then definitely you're dying ! But I think this movie altogether didn't deliver ALL of this that well ..Why?It's technically glaring but maybe the script cared basically for making hot pursuits and chases more than strengthening the deep concept about the end of a guiltless guy in such horrific dark world where perfidy rules, or the poisoning of the intellectual in this savagely violent community where money owns souls. Actually the types of people which the movie presented didn't express that important motif. However it seemed generally like an elegy of our modern life and its message was unmistakable especially with the main character at the end living his death literally : Try to find the ones whom really love you, try to do the right thing by finding and facing the truth early enough before it destroys you or others, and to be that active, cautious not that blind all the time.. Or should I say all the time you've got !I'm in love with some scenes where everything was quite perfect : (Quaid) knows that he's going to die so he runs in the streets like a shadow with a screamer electronic guitar.. It was how to define "helpless" cinematically, the song at the bar (Too Much Sex, Not Enough Affection) by (Timbuk. J) which refers to the absorption in materialism plus this whole scene and the smile of (Meg Ryan) at its end too, the moment when the wealthy wife finds out about the suicide of the student. It was fair work and what a sweet adventure they all done (the crew, the actors, ..etc), there are interesting image and sound along the way and some talents behind them made (D.O.A) a worth watching experiment.All in all it's about being alive indeed not to be dead and alive in the same time, AND that had been said in a movie was so alive at action and suspense however not that alive intellectually, and finally it's alive work but close to dead when it comes to appreciate its real amusing time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remake of the Rudolph Maté classic (1950),DOA does not deserve the bad reputation it's got.It boasts a very absorbing plot,with twists and surprises.It has nothing -or so little - to do with its unforgettable model,except the poisoning,the first scene ,the last one and maybe the scene in the hospital and the one in which D.Quaid is prisoner in the car which all recall the first version.All that remains is new,be it the settings -a university- or the characters: Quaid is a professor and M.Ryan a student.The prologue and the epilogue are shot in black and white while the long flashback is in color.Meg Ryan's part is a bit pointless and the plot would not suffer if the character were removed.Much more interesting is the Fitzwaring family,with Charlotte Rampling ,the par excellence femme fatale, who is the only connection with the film noir genre .This wealthy family is almost a subplot in what is mainly Dexter's ordeal.The movie is badly marred by a horrible and aggressive music.The pictures are too flashy and Hitchcock's shadow hang over the whole thing,but the directors have not the Master's finesse.On the other hand ,the story,albeit far-fetched ,hold the audience breathless till the very end.SPOILERS.......SPOILERS THe two versions have another thing in common:the cause for the drama was almost nothing:in the 1950 version,a bill of sale;student's homework in this remake.It gives a Hustonian flavor -think "the Maltese Falcon- to both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't quite work out but still a perfectly watchable thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that tries hard but it doesn't quite takes the cake. The movie tries to put in many different successful thriller elements but the movie is nothing more than a mixture of styles that weakens the movie as a whole- and with a flawed and simple story in it.The movie is quite short and this is definitely notable in its script. The concept is quite great and it showed some good potential but the story is at all times kept rather simple and short and the movie its story mainly falls from one coincidence into the other, which really doesn't make this the most credible movie to watch. It's just too much of a series of unlikely events, even for thriller standards. Things just don't add up and the weak climax, that is more ridicules and lame than clever or credible, also doesn't help much. The movie its story gets poorly developed, which also makes the movie lack in some good tension or mystery.Yet the movie is a fairly well known movie in its genre, which seems odd, since it's definitely no text book example of a good thriller, even though all of the formulaic ingredients are present. It probably has to do with the fact that the movie has a good and well known cast. Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan are the main leads of the movie and like always they are great together. They also used to be a real-life couple for years, till Russell Crowe broke up their marriage in 2000. However problem in the movie is that they're just an unlikely couple to team up. It just seems odd to me that a college professor would team up with one of his students, in the final hours of his life, to solve his own murder. But this is probably also the direct result of its poor story development that falls flat in the end and in which nothing quite adds up. On a positive note, Daniel Stern was good in a serious role.The movie tries to be noir, or at least an homage to film-noir, by using black &amp; white images and certain camera-positioning (strangly only at the beginning and ending of the movie and not the movie entirely.) but also with its 'mysterious' story and characters. After all, the movie is also a remake of a real classic film-noir from 1950, by the same title. The end result however doesn't deserve to touch the genre with a 10 feet pole. It becomes nowhere close of being in the same league. This is due to the poorly developed and just weak story but also because it tries to bring in several '80's movie-making elements, which just doesn't work out. Oh and mixing film-noir style with '80's musical is always a bad idea! It should be a rule; if you pay homage to film-noir, don't ever put 'modern' music under it. Further more also the typical '80's action editing works really lame and makes the action sequences look even cheaper and clumsier than they in fact really were. Also the black &amp; white images don't look right because they don't seem to use proper lighting for it.One of this typical thrillers that is only watchable once.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot about as convoluted as figuring out your Alternative Minimum Tax: Enjoyable but kind of wacky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know which pushes the limits of cerebral capacity more: figuring out your Alternative Minimum Tax or the plot of this movie. The opening shot in black and white is certainly an eye-opener. (The opener apparently references the film noir classic of the same title, D.O.A., 1949-1950, but the 1988 offering is not a remake) Prof Dexter Cornell, played by Dennis Quaid, stumbles into a police station to report a murder. The first question of course is who was murdered to which Quaid responds with his memorable but simple answer, "I was." Quaid plays an English professor-novelist who says, at some point, that English professors don't inspire the kind of passion to be victims of premeditated murders, which is I guess the point of D.O.A.: not even English professors are completely without risk. But don't let this movie fool you. Being an English professor is sort of like flying, it's one of the safest ways to travel.The rest of the movie is a flashback entirely from Cornell's point of view in which the events leading up to his entry into the police precinct are retraced, which turns out to be two days. The movie shifts back into color, and we are taken back to the morning of two days ago in Cornell's writing class. The first hint of a plot is an unpublished novel written by one of Cornell's students, Nick Lang. Cornell had promised to read the work but delayed. After class, when Cornell is dashing off, presumably to another class or a meeting, Lang runs after him through the halls begging him to read his work. At one point, the student says he will kill himself if the prof dislikes his novel. A couple of scenes later, guess what? Lang is turned into mush, presumably having killed himself by throwing himself from an undergrad dorm window. Cornell's office just happens to be underneath, and the body hits the window before becoming a human pancake. (I have never heard of student dorms being above professor's offices on a college campus, but that is one of the many strange coincidences that permeate this film.) The incident does not stop Cornell and one of his colleagues from celebrating in his office shortly thereafter.But this is just the beginning. A whole back-story about Lang emerges about him having been put through college on the tab of an older wealthy lady who shot a prowler-thief in her house 20 years previous to the events of the movie. As an interesting twist, it turns out Lang is the son of the slain thief. On top of that, Cornell's marriage is ending. He gives his soon-to-be ex-wife a toy Ferris Wheel and she gives him the divorce papers, a rather odd exchange of Christmas presents. They attend a university social function where he makes a drunken fool of himself. But to add to the twists, the event is sponsored by guess who? The lady financing the late student-writer.It is never fully explained exactly what Cornell writes. We gather he had 4 or 5 successful books, probably novels, but has had nothing for the last four years. But what he is good at is the bottle. He goes to a bar and encounters a young woman who turns out to be the daughter of the lady of the student who killed himself. It's starting to sound like the nursery rhyme "The Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly." The girl is dragged out from the bar by one of the lady's henchmen leaving Cornell to his own devices. But he is not alone. He ends up drinking himself into a frenzy with one of his students, played by Meg Ryan.Next morning, he wakes up in Ryan's freshmen women's dorm room. One of thing about this movie: Quaid keeps waking up in places after having conked out. Luckily, he did nothing that would be reported in the gossip column of the university newspaper and jeopardize his tenure. But he feels worse than having a hang-over. He drags himself to the university hospital only to find that he has been poisoned. The lethal chemistry has been absorbed by the body enough that he only has 24 to 48 hours to live. And now he has to find out not only the who but the why. Sort of like a Clue game for geniuses, DOA has many pieces of the puzzle, and Cornell has to figure out their arrangement before he falls over for the last time, and not just from the numerous shaken-not-stirred martinis. Martinis and poison go well together to accelerate the demise of the poor victim. When the pieces start falling into place, they are like nothing you would expect.The film moves a mile-a-minute, with people getting knocked over the head with things, people chasing through tar pits, and of course a short episode at the compulsory carnival. Seems like suspense movies from the 1980's until the mid-1990's always have a scene where the protagonist is stumbling through a carnival or bizarre of some sort late in the evening to add to his already dazed-and-confused condition. Some of the action is a bit unbelievable but what saves it are the fine performances of all the leads, particularly Quaid who keeps you wanting to find out with him what is really going on. Certainly not the best movie of its type, but it has a look and feel all its own. So take a break from trying to figure out your Alternative Minimum Tax depreciations and check this film out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller that goes a bit over the top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts out with an intriguing storyline of a person who gets poisoned and knows for sure that he will not survive the next 24 hours. All that is left for him is to find out who did it and why.That 24 hours are effectively very little time is felt in every second of this extremely fast paced movie. There is no time to stop and think as the story unfolds, instead we see Quaid on constant overdrive using every second of his precious time to follow any lead he might get on his killer. There is in fact a romantic involvement, but even this happens on fast-forward speed.So far so good, but the movie actually disappoints in two areas: Firstly, there are a lot (count them!) of violent deaths in this movie that don't really add to the main plot and distract from the interesting premise that was set in the beginning. Was it really necessary to kill off that many secondary characters? Was there no other way to keep the suspense up? At times it felt like the director thought: "Well, there have been at least 12 minutes without anybody being killed, it is high time we include another death in the script"The even bigger disappointment for me was the conclusion. Without giving away any details here, I couldn't help but think "so THAT was what it was all about?". After all that suspense and in-your-face action, I thought the "solution" to be a bit lame and not very realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a really dumb movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of the 1950's original and about 20 minutes into this remake I started to think this was going to be as good as the original but it wasn't. The motive for the murders was incredibly stupid. Two of the lovers in the movie turn out to be brother and sister-excuse me while I barf. The main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex which doesn't make sense considering the situation he's in. If the film makers wanted a sex scene they should have put it earlier in the movie before the main character (Dexter played by Dennis Quaid found he's about to die and that he's accused of a crime. There is a reason for where the sex scene is at. Early in the movie Dexter isn't living life to the fullest so he's not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan. I still feel it would make more sense for the sex scene to have either been cut or earlier in the film and the two siblings not to have been lovers.One of the dumbest parts of the movie involves a gun fight, a couple people getting killed and one person being run over all within 15 yards of a crowded carnival and yet NOBODY AT THE CARNIVAL NOTICES!!! Also in the scene is the tar pits the university where the movie takes place is built on. If you fall into the tar you sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds. Not only is it hard to believe stuff would sink that fast in tar, but more importantly who builds a university on tar pits. I would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is but I don't want to put a spoiler in my post.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the original, the main character and the premise are established in a few minutes. The plot moves along briskly and as O'Brien tries to find out who did it and why, you are as interested to learn the answers as he is.Here, for more than half an hour you have no idea what the picture is all about; at one point it crossed my mind that it might not be any sort of remake at all. How is this half hour spent? In establishing that Quaid's character is someone who could live or die and you couldn't care less either way.Learning form other reviewers that the denouement is a colossal letdown comes as no surprise; I couldn't say myself because I couldn't be bothered to watch it through.Meg Ryan is gorgeous and Quaid gives a solid performance, but apart from that it is hard to find much good to say about this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is the real killer?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the only movie that I can think of when I instantly knew who the killer was. It is in the scene after the plot kicks in, this is a spoiler, but someone dies. Dennis Quaid and Daniel Stern is sitting in Dexter's office and drinking.Since Dexter has quite the drinking problem, we are supposed to assume that he could have gotten the "Mickey" from anyplace. We are set up to believe that he got it from Meg Ryan's character, Sydney. Dexter even gets that idea. But from that one scene it is pretty obvious who did it.Now for the why do we care part. Quaid is a gifted performer, who never really got his due. I think, that his career took a downward turn after he played Jerry Lee Lewis, maybe the worst biopic ever made. I liked it at the time, but after having seen 20 or more of the same genre, I can definitely say that it is the most untrue to life bio ever made.Enough of that. Quaid is actually quite good here but the mechanisms of the plot weigh him down from nearly the beginning. As a mystery we are given too many distractions and it takes us a long time to get to the climax.There are a few good spots in between. The scenes with Charlotte Rampling as a Black Widow type and her little overprotective chauffeur. He is quite the character, extremely violent but always polite. May I break your neck with this 2*4, please? Sorry, that line is not in the movie but it could be if they made a spoof of this film.Since I knew what was coming, I would have preferred if they cut at least 10 minutes from the end. There is an extremely poor fight sequence at the end.Still, if you wanna see Dennis Quaid in one of his best parts it's definitely worth a look. He wouldn't get a choice one again for years.</fullReview>

I was lucky to survive the film without falling asleep in my popcorn. I watched this film with my family. It is fairly safe to watch with your kids. (only 1 semi sex scene)If you wish to see a young Meg Ryan...check out this movie. Very 80-ish. You will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at Christmas, booze, super glue and tar. Or maybe you are like me... and have have a higher standard for acting in films. However I did like the way the movie began and ended! Mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a stiff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains a partial spoiler.Shallow from the outset, 'D.O.A.' at least starts as if it might be a slick, entertaining piece of nonsense like Fincher's 'The Game'. It's central character(Dennis Quaid) suffers from a nightmarish sequence of events that appear to be setting up a twisted and cunning thriller. But the plot rattles along at too great a pace, leading to a dramatic twist not half way through, when the character learns that he has been poisoned and has only 1-2 days to live. And this, simply, is too big a twist to add casually to a story. Once this has happened, the film's only chance of success is if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its principal, indeed, its only subject matter: but 'D.O.A.' continues as if this was just a normal revelation like any other you might usually encounter in a thriller. The problem is two-fold: firstly, Quaid's actions don't convince as what someone is his situation would be likely to do; and secondly, even if they did convince, it's hard to care about what happens next when the most significant point of plot has already been prematurely resolved. The rest of the film is pretty standard fare for a film of this sort, but made more tedious than usual by the character's slightly-treated predicament, which logically dwarfs the events the film is interested in. Dennis Quaid, in the lead role, doesn't convince either as a burnt out professor or as a man who is destined to die: Meg Ryan is, as often, ditzy and annoying. Another negative feature is the ugly 80s soundtrack. Watch 'The Game' instead, which from similar roots remains tight and character-driven, whereas 'D.O.A.' drifts into developments that only undermine its own premise. As the premise is itself quite intriguing, it's a shame to see it drowned in a surplus of over-cooked plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but no match for the original 1950 version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It borders on 80's schlock, though after seeing so many worse films this one has edged up a few notches. It has it's moments and some nice cinematography, though I wouldn't recommend it for other than late night boredom viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's little to commend....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this remake - which frankly, is dire. The presence of big name artists who are so familiar and have previously made many enjoyable films could not save this one from going down the pan. What possessed Meg Ryan, normally such an accomplished actress, to consider being in this nonsense is baffling. Surely this has to be her one awful film to quickly forget. Everyone drops a clanger sometime in life. Let's hope Meg Ryan revert's to her usual impeccable standard in the future, which normally, is beyond reproach. 'D.O.A' deserves a low mark, a generous 2 out of 10. The strongest recommendation is - if you fancy seeing a movie, see something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"D.O.A." has all the potential, flare and intrigue to be a well-done film noir, but it isn't. It isn't convincing. It's contrived. The setup is weak, predictable, and very typical. It has an idea that it is some powerhouse Hitchcockian thriller, but it isn't. It's just another weak, pathetic 80s remake of a 40s thriller, with a silly, predictable, contrived and disappointing ending that tops my list of silliest endings ever.The film starts out grand, quickly deccelerates into mediocrity, then bathes in awfulness towards the end. The first two minutes are basically the only good parts in the film, when a college English professor, Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid) stumbles into a police station to report his own murder. Filmed in black and white with a great sense of film noir, this is the film's only highpoint. The rest is all downhill.Dexter has been murdered by someone. His body contains a substance which will kill him in less than 49 hours. ("No more than forty-eight!") Using the last days of his life, Dexter tries to hunt down his killer with the help of the flirtatious student Sydney (Meg Ryan), who doesn't seem like she has a purpose in the film nearly as much as Harrison Ford's French companion did in "Frantic."Dexter recalls what he found out to the police, what all happened, where the bloody path of murder led him. It all ends up with a very stupid, silly ending that, when you think the film cannot get any mediocre and 80s-typical, pushes over the top and sends the film sprawling into stupidity.I won't tell you what happens at the end, nor who has killed Dexter, nor if he lives, nor if he dies, nor if he ever kisses the girl, but I will tell you that thirty minutes into the film, I really didn't care anymore. I had guessed the ending, and I had another hour to sit and wait for my assumptions to be confirmed. It's too easy to guess, too simple. It's all there, and the "surprise" ending isn't nearly as unpredictable as other thrillers I've seen in recent years. Even "Frantic," which came out the same year as "D.O.A.," manages to entertain and hold one's interest more than this measly dross.I will tell you (spoilers ahead) to look out for someone who gets shot and flies backwards out a window at the end of the film. Last time I checked, when someone gets shot in the chest, they do not do a 180 and leap full force out a window and plummet to their death. It's so typical of an 80s film remake. A handgun would barely make someone get knocked backwards, much less make them spin around and leap to their death.What a disappointing movie.2.5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm so underwhelmed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS --I love Dennis Quaid and I like Meg Ryan. I was looking forward to seeing them together, being married and all, I wanted to see their on-screen chemistry. Okay, that being said, I guess the fact that they are actors, their off-screen relationship didn't have to permeate their performances, especially with this script.How stupid can a professor be to glue himself to anyone. I don't remember the original, but I can only assume that O'Brien probably was handcuffed to his leading lady, probably in a more inevitable way. If I were "bonded" to someone I'd be pretty angry. The crush I would have would definitely have dissipated quickly. Meg showed not even a little annoyance only slight surprise. Dennis would have to take me kicking and screaming. That whole section of the movie was so horrible -- especially Meg having to go to the bathroom (#2) between dumpsters in the dark at night. Ewww. No f****ing way! What's with Dennis socking every single suspect in the movie. Sock first ask questions later. Not once, not twice but too many times -- I could have kept count if I were so inclined. The most interesting part of the movie was Nick and his family drama. Too bad that couldn't have become more of the plot. The assumed off-screen drama leading up to this tragedy. I think it could have been written in without distracting from Dex' quest. My blame lies with the writer of this screenplay. Unless the director and others doctored it up so much that it's unrecognizable.I won't even get into the real reason poor Dex was murdered. How ludicrous is that. Even when Dex confronted the real killer and the reason was explained, (a true "film noir" moment) everyone on screen seemed bored. Oh, _____ happened. Oh. (yawn) "Dex even says this is a silly reason for a triple murder. Oh the tension, you could cut it with a spoon.If anyone but Dennis had been in this movie, I'd have to give it 1/2 star (only because I really have seen worse), but in this case 1 1/2 stars.For Dennis and Meg stars, see ANYTHING ELSE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"D.O.A." is a non-thrilling thriller from directors Rocky Morton and AnnabelJankel. The acting is okay and the screenplay is pretty bad. This movie also has some moments which will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violenceare. For example, someone is shot near a window. We then see from outsidethe building what looks like that person jumped. I laughed my head off when this happened. This movie tries hard, but ultimately fails. Only watch this moviewhen you have no other choice.My Critique: **Rating: [R]Rating Reasons: Violence and language.**There was no rating reason available due to its age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunk By The Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I found out the two credited directors were responsible for MAX HEADROOM I was expecting some MTV over directed nightmare but the artistic style was nowhere as bad as I was expecting . Okay it is a somewhat 1980s type film with an intrusive pop soundtrack in places but a great many ( Too many ) films from that period suffered the same way , it`s by know means as bad or as shallow as something like THE FAST AND FURIOUS from years later The problem I had was with the script that lacks narritive drive for the first twenty minutes . It picks up in the middle but what really destroys the film is when the murderer is revealed at the end and he explains his motivations . " What ? " I cried almost falling out off my seat " You done that because .... " . Ridiculous doesn`t even begin to do it justiceStick to the original film noir classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's Meg?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie primarily because it had Meg Ryan in it, and I was disappointed to see that her role is really a mere supporting one. Not only is she not on screen much, but nothing her character does is essential to the plot. Her character could be written out of the story without changing it much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>D.O.A. (1988) * 1/2 (out of 4) The title pretty much sums up this remake of the 1949 noir classic. This time out Dennis Quaid plays a teacher going through the worse period of his life as he can't get a book published and his wife is leaving him but things get even darker after being poisoned and learning that he's got less than 24-hours to life. In that time he decides to try and track down the person or persons who poisoned him along with the help of one of his students (Meg Ryan). The original film is one of the all-time great classics but many movies were getting remade during the 80s and many of them were quite good (THE THING, THE FLY, THE BLOB) but others were less than memorable and that's where D.O.A. falls. Many people considered this one of the worst films of the years and it's hard to try and fight that because this is one pretty lousy movie from start to finish. This is really one of those mysteries that's quite annoying because everyone you meet is a red herring and not once did I ever feel as if the screenwriters had a good idea as to where they were going because the entire storyline just seemed like one big mess and in the end they could have had anyone be the killer and it wouldn't have made any less sense than someone else. I won't reveal the ending but it's quite laughable and you can't help but really be mad that you've wasted so much time with the picture just to get to this conclusion. Directors ***** try to add some style to the picture but this never works and quite often it's just as annoying as everything else going on. There are some fancy camera moves and some quick edits but they add nothing to the picture. The opening and closing sequences are in B&amp;W and I'm guessing this was done to try and give the viewers a throwback to the old days but it does nothing to enhance the film. The film actually contains some fine actors but none of them are given much to work with. Quaid, one of my favorites, pretty much sleepwalks through the picture and it never really appears he knows what to do with the character. Ryan is pretty bland in one of her early roles and the shocking thing is that she has no chemistry with Quaid. Daniel Stern, Charlotte Rampling and Jane Kaczmarek round out the supporting cast. One of the most annoying things about the picture is its soundtrack, which features some great tracks but these songs really don't mix well with the story or anything going on. I'm not one that goes against remakes but this here is one that can be skipped. Check out the original instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great story and great lead actors (Quaid and Ryan) but the movie suffers from bad directing,bad screenplay and bad script.The lead actors do their part but could not save the movie at all.Too bad because this could have been a good 80's style Hitchcock suspense/mystery/thriller.Ryan looked so young and fresh in this one though.An ok look for big Ryan fans.....</fullReview>
