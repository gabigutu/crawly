		<shortDescription>George and Jane are an unlikely pair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Segal and Jane Fonda are not he kind of actors you would expect to find in this movie with low brow humour that is a delightfully guilty addiction. Dirty jokes, a rancid social commentary and the glib life of bad mid to late 1970's economics drive 'Fun With Dick and Jane' to a level of crime that makes you root for them. Three scenes stand out. Watch for them! One has Segal practicing his stick up routine in the mirror dressed totally in black with a nylon wrapped over his head. Another one has Fonda visiting her conservative parents to ask for financial help and her father turning her down with an evangelical sermon and Dick and Jane's first stick up at a cheap motel. This movie has some slapstick that is hard to resist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a sign of the times (i.e., the 1970s) when Dick and Jane rob the telephone company at gunpoint and all the customers applaud. It's distinctly un-PC now, but very funny back then. As usual, it's a "Jane Fonda movie" that thinly conceals a social message underneath its comic scenario, but I didn't feel it got too preachy until near the finish-line. George Segal works very easily with Fonda, and there are some hugely funny scenes after an arduous opening wherein Segal loses his cushy job. The desperation of unemployment is touched upon briefly (for a comic effect), but there are some stabs at social commentary that do not work (as with two bad caveats involving a transsexual and a man with no vocal chords). But for every foul ball there comes along something fresh and groovy, like the sequence where Fonda acts her way out of neighborhood humiliation once the gardeners start rolling up her lawn, or when the gentleman from Food Stamps shows up at an inappropriate moment (a ritzy family dinner) confessing he just had a Big Mac and a Coke. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the reviewer who said that George Segal and Jane Fonda are an unlikely couple to star in this movie. But, oh, does it work! This is one of my top ten all-time favorite movies. The humor is a bit more subtle than the Jim Carey remake and I happen to prefer that kind of humor.The premise of the movie would be hard to beat at any rate. It really works as a comedy situation. Some of the scenes in this movie will absolutely make you roar with laughter.If you want a good laugh on a Friday night...rent this one. :) Or better yet, buy yourself a copy so you can watch it again and again. It really is that funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is certainly my favorite show for both George Segal and Jane Fonda. They are marvelous as folks trying to make ends meet (by hook OR crook) in the face of unemployment. Their hijinks are marvelous, as they exhaust ALL the possibilities for humor in the search for employment.Especially memorable are the fashion show, the celebratory dinner, and the performance of Carmen. But good spots in this film are too frequent to even cite!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''Fun with Dick and Jane'' is not the best comedy I watched, but still is a nice movie from the 70's starring George Segal and Jane Fonda as Dick and Jane, a couple from the upper-middle class who suddenly stay with high debts, since Dick was fired, and decide to steal to pay their bills and keep their life style. This version is much better then the remake with Jim Carrey. In this one, George Segal plays a serious executive engineer, while in the new version, Jim Carrey makes Dick a stupid idiot. Jane Fonda is very beautiful, and I am amazed that she was already 40 years old when she did this movie,since she doesn't look more then 32.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing but lacking the sharp edges that I was hoping for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dick and Jane Harper are happy and very well off; they have a dog, a son, a great house and Dick has a high-powered job as an aerospace company executive. However when the company hits a bumpy patch, Dick is laid off and very quickly the family is running up more debt than they can handle. Dick keeps trying to find work and even Jane leaves the family home to try and get a regular job type job. However things do not go that well and, as their possessions start to get repossessed, they get increasingly desperate.Recently the subject of a remake (which I never bothered to see) this comedy is a sort of satire on the American dream and the attitudes of big business. Or at least that is what others have said. Personally I think it has a vague swipe at this but mainly it just settles for being a gentle caper that draws laughs from the unlikely descent of the middle classes into crime. It isn't anywhere near as sharp or caustic as I would have liked it to be but it flows along cheerily enough and entertained me reasonably well. Big laughs are few and far between but it is nicely comic for the most part.Given the light material, I thought this was mostly down to the lead pair working with it well. Segal is reasonably good but his strength is in his chemistry with Fonda. She is good and has a nice comic touch. Support is generally solid if unspectacular with turns from Mcahon, Garcia and others but generally the film is carried by the leads. Direction feels a little dated now as the film has a very 1970's look and, without a sharp edge, it doesn't feel as relevant as it should do.Overall this is a comic little film that is amusing and works thanks to easy performances by the lead pair. I would have preferred it to have had a much sharper edge to have blended satire with the comedy but it was still an entertaining little film albeit one that won't stick in my mind or have me coming back for repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful Politically Incorrect Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the executive engineer Dick Harper (George Segal) is unexpectedly fired by the president Charlie Blanchard (Ed McMahon) of the Taft Aerospace, company where he works, his wife Jane Harper (Jane Fonda) and him get completely broken, full of debts including the mortgage of their fancy house and without means to support their lifestyle. Dick unsuccessfully tries to find a new position, while Jane looks for a job and cuts their costs to the minimum. While using the insufficient unemployment paycheck of the social security to survive, they contract a loan in a bank. There is a heist in the bank and Jane accidentally steals some money from the thieves, and the couple decides to robber to survive and maintain their social status."Fun with Dick and Jane" is a great amoral comedy that has not aged or dated. The politically incorrect story is delightful and very funny, and is a sharp critic to the American Dream, satirizing the hypocrite need of maintaining a status and also to the corruption related to the big business of the corporations. Jane Fonda is very beautiful and shows a great chemistry with George Segal. This is the first time that I watch this movie, which is an excellent entertainment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Adivinhe Quem Vem Para Roubar?" ("Guess Who Is Coming to Robber?")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>creative comedy with questionable moral standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun with Dick and Jane serves as an entertaining satire on the upper middle class standards of living, produced in the presumably stifling corporate environment of the mid-1970's. A drunken Ed McMahon lays off overpaid executive George Segal. Lovely wife Jane Fonda, who handles matters fairly well when their landscapers tear up all their unpaid work, finds herself forced to find some source of income to maintain their expensive lifestyles ? it would seem Segal's unemployment only takes them so far. Fonda secures a job as a model while Segal manages to lose his benefits when a gay unemployment officer spots him working as a bit character in the opera. When Fonda loses her apparently not very secure job, the now poor couple head out to get a loan. There they stumble upon a holdup, get taken hostage, and somehow wind up with all the loot. Enjoying their first taste of crime, the pair bungles their way through a series of hold-ups and eventually become near pros. They manage to restore their house to its previous splendor, cockily inviting McMahon to a chic pool party so he can have a gander at their newfound success. Of course, a sip only gets you thirsty, so the greedy couple find themselves faced with the quest for the Big Gulp. The story is funny for the most part, with memorable moments akin to Segal discussing music with a record store clerk during a robbery. There's healthy dose of anarchy for good measure, with destruction happily joining hands with the nouveau pauvre and the will to get back what has been lost. By having its characters steal primarily from the allegedly greedy or malevolent ? the phone company, loan sharks, the Climax Court Motel ? the film does maintains some shaky moral standards. In addition, Fun contains a few instances of dated racism, with jabs at homosexuals, Hispanics and African-Americans (who hold a pajama dance party in McMahon's office as Segal and Fonda crack his safe, their loud drill protected by the celebrants' louder music). A startlingly racist part goes to Hank Garcia, as an unemployed cleaner who works a bad influence on Segal. Nevertheless, the film on the whole manages to function well as a thoroughly entertaining comedy, with an ample dose of anarchism for good measure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In these trying times, when American's financial world is going down the drain, and the dreams, aspirations and livelihood of millions of Americans are evaporating, a film like this one is just what a despairing audience needs. The story of the American Middle Class in jeopardy and is aptly personified in this movie, called 'Fun With Dick and Jane.' There have been several other films based on this theme, but for my money, the stars of George Segal and Jane Fonda are solidly entrenched and not easily replaced by later film couples. Segal stars' as Mr. Richard Harper a Aero-space executive who as his boss (Ed McMahon) states is the very best at his job, but like so many other corporate executives is no longer needed. His position is one which promised security, but has fallen on hard times. Thus he soon learns he is unemployed. The fun begins when Harper and his wife try to adjust to the downward spiral of economic descent. They like so many Americans take what they can get and object poverty is not attractive at all. Thus, when the bottom is ready to engulf them, they turn to a life of crime. Can they do any worse? Not being prepared, they soon realize, they are not cut out to be white collar criminals and decide to quit. That's when opportunity beckons once again. A great movie and one fitted to our time. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! I saw it with my mom in '77 and even though I couldn't have possibly gotten all the jokes and double entendres, I loved it. Seeing it now (I own it on VHS; they don't put movies like this out on DVD all that often), I love it even more. Everything about it positively SCREAMS mid-1970s, from Dick's Thunderbird with the 600-feet-long hood to Jane's clunky Mercury Montego wagon to JANE FONDA WEARING HER JEANS ROLLED UP TO JUST BELOW THE KNEE TO SHOW OFF HER BOOTS! If you're a 70s afficianado, you can't help but love the time capsule that this movie represents. Another big bonus is the guy who played Schneider on One Day at a Time, who here plays a loud contractor with a big bullhorn.As others have noted, the movie is also a time capsule to an era when it was not only OK, but funny to slam African Americans, Hispanics and especially gays. It was a little painful to see George Segal be so homophobic, but I choose to see this as a reflection of how far society has leapt in the last 25 years.I've read elsewhere that Jane only made this movie for the $ to support then-husband Tom Hayden's political campaign/career. Even still, the late 1970s was Jane's era, in which she cranked out gem after gem, from the Electric Horseman to an incredibly bitchy role in The California Suite to a powerful performance in The China Syndrome.All in all, FWDAJ is a funny time capsule that has a few messages, but don't be mislead by posters here who say it's a thinly-veiled moralistic movie. IT IS NOT! It's a fun romp, nothing more or less.PS: Remember when they sold those things called record albums, the sleeves of which could conceal a gun during an attempted hold-up?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of "Fun with Dick and Jane" until the remake came out. Now that I've seen the original, I really like it. George Segal and Jane Fonda play a yuppie couple whose well-to-do lifestyle suddenly gets interrupted when he loses his job. Realizing that they have no other choice, the two of them soon turn to theft to survive. But then there's his former employer (Ed McMahon)...The remake changed the story a little bit, updating the story so that it looked at the era of Enron, Adelphia, Worldcom, etc. This one is about about a simple firing and how the couple seeks revenge, with a lot of funny stuff. You're bound to love the trick that they pull at the end. A really fun movie.Half-cocked indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes a movie starts with one idea and goes nowhere other trying to exploit it several ways.Jane Fonda was the rare thing: a so-called sex kitten ingénue turned serious actress, additionally capable of comedy. Here, they build a comedy around her sexual allure. Every gag depends on it. They all fall pretty flat these days because the sexual banter seems tame, and the memory of her sexual intensity has been lost. But should you take the time to watch this, there is a signature scene that shook the world of Hollywood filmdom. Tame today but a big deal in its time.Jane (the character has this name, and he husband is the dick) comes home with a great, exciting idea. It is sexually arousing we see. She wants to tell her husband and does so while taking a pee, starting the story before and going on well after repantying and flushing. It is a strange association that Americans (and Brits) have mixing toilet privacies with sexual openness, but there it is, used for effect, around which a whole movie of seduction is based.She is alluring, but we now know she was drugged and unhappy.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fun with Dick and Jane" from 1977, starring George Segal and Jane Fonda, is the type of comedy that's rarely made anymore in mainstream cinema. Like the remake, which had a different script but the same premise, it's about a financially totally overextended couple who find themselves flat broke when the husband, Dick, loses his job. Jane takes it well, announcing an end to European wines and agrees to drop a book of the month club. When the landscapers roll up their lawn and remove the shrubs, they have to stop putting in the pool, and they start using candles instead of lights, it occurs to them that there's a problem. When Jane looks over the bills, she declares her husband "the Typhoid Mary of finance." What follows is a very funny comedy as Dick and Jane try to make it on unemployment, apply for food stamps, and attempt to borrow money at a 17% interest rate ("That's illegal!" Jane yells). Finally, they decide to try to get money through robbery.I only saw part of the Jim Carrey version. What I find most interesting is that the 1977 version takes a while building up to the decision to rob, while it comes much earlier in the later film. That's the big difference between films made 30 years ago and now - the art of the buildup is gone. If you don't get to the meat of the plot in 10 minutes, the film is criticized for being slow. Personally, I like getting to know the characters and seeing what leads to the main plot. It's a pity that our MTV generation demands this.I miss this type of comedy. The humor isn't vulgar, and it's about adults and not teenagers. And, given the financial climate, it still resonates. Today you need a Jim Carrey to sign on for a film like this in order for it to be made, where in the '70s and '80s, these movies were plentiful. Fonda and Segal are great. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keeping Up Appearances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun With Dick And Jane has George Segal and Jane Fonda as this upper middle class suburban couple living the American dream with their son Sean Frye. It all comes to an end when aerospace engineer Segal gets fired by his unctuous and smarmy boss Ed McMahon. Owing a lot because they're keeping up appearances in their neighborhood it all comes crashing down. After trying other ways to get an income and failing, Segal and Fonda turn to a life of crime. Though they have many setbacks, they begin to like it.Watching Fun With Dick And Jane put me in mind oddly enough of dealing with World Trade Center families at Crime Victims Board who were a lot like Segal and Fonda. Working in the Towers for various wealthy companies when the male breadwinner was taken away, these families in most serious way were in the same kind of trouble this family was. That lifestyle can be expensive. John Dehner who was Fonda's father may be a self righteous creep, but there is a grain of truth in what he preaches at them about spending on luxury items.McMahon who America knew for decades as the announcer and boon companion of Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show turns in a really good performance. He's a guy you learn to hate more and more as the film progresses. There's a great cameo part from Dick Gautier as a crooked televangelist Fonda and Segal rob. That should almost be legal.With all the humor Fun With Dick And Jane is an interesting social critique and commentary on American values. It even got a remake in this new century. I'll have to check it out to see if it is as good as this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Bonnie and Clyde they ain't. I recall this movie getting a lot of fanfare when it was first released back in 1977, hard to believe it'll be forty years old soon as I write this. Today was the first time I watched it and it was sort of underwhelming. I've never seen Ed McMahon in a principal movie role before so that was new for me. George Segal and Jane Fonda had the right chemistry to pull off their roles here, but a lot of times I thought the story was forced and didn't ring true to character. The stereotypical use of black and Hispanic actors in the picture would never pass muster today, though I don't generally have a problem with those kinds of portrayals when used to comic effect.Something I'd like to point out that really has nothing to do with the movie itself, but I've noticed this in other pictures as well. I generally turn on captioning when watching films so I don't miss any nuance in the dialog, and fairly consistently I find that any words that might be considered controversial are 'X'ed out. So for this picture, any time someone uses Dick Harper's (Segal) first name, it appears in captioning as 'XXXX'. You can do the translation, but the only thing that it does is draw more attention to the more prurient use of the word. I have to laugh every time it happens.I guess you can have some fun with this one in a Seventies nostalgic kind of way, but for me it wasn't very memorable at all. I actually know a married couple whose names are Dick and Jane who are friends of mine, and managed to reference the film the last time we got together. It was for a Happy Together concert tour we went to featuring a bunch of bands from the Sixties and Seventies, so at least we kept it in the same era as the picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Segal made his name in the 1960s with dramas such as King Rat and the sublime Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?In the 1970s he became a master of light comedy and this is a good example as he teams up with Jane Fonda. They are Dick And Jane the aspiring middle classes of 1970s suburban America whose world comes crashing down.Dick is a successful Aerospace Executive whose company was responsible for sending the man to the moon but gets fired as the firm downsizes. The couple who have a large house, a son, maid unfinished pool and garden eventually realise that they have been living beyond their means and life in the breadline is no fun. Dick is unable to get another job and when Jane succeeds with employment it ends in disaster.The couple turn to theft rather ineptly at first to make ends meet. They then decide to rob Dick's former boss who has stashed some slush money in his safe.This is an immoral light hearted film with a subtext of life in breadline America which did get worse from the late 1970s onwards.Its a fun, zippy film which is a lot better than the Jim Carrey remake but has dated with its racial attitudes. Of course its likely that it was the Hispanics and Blacks that were more likely to be in the underclass in that period. Then again even today. Ironically Segal would go on to make Carbon Copy a few years later which would examine prejudice as he discovers he has a grown up black son played by Denzel Washington (his film debut.)George Segal and Jane Fonda bounce off well with each other, there is a nice cameo from John Dehner who plays Jane's father who turns down her plea for financial help.</fullReview>

Oh, because so many people out here can relate to that on some scale. Our couple, portrayed by George Segal and Jane Fonda are really, really good a defining how we saw ourselves at that time. The man, upwardly mobile and celebrated as successful. The woman, liberated (and who more liberated than Jane Fonda?) and choosing to stay at home. yet they were both fooling themselves with their false sense of superiority. Sounds like the while middle class. We are laughing at ourselves, of course, and mostly because it's so true! Ed McMahon makes for a believable drunken ploy, so we are set.

		<fullReview>Dick (George Segal) and Jane Harper (Jane Fonda) are living the American dream. He has a good job at Taft Aerospace but then he get laid off by his boss Charlie Blanchard (Ed McMahon). At first, they're unconcerned. Eventually it gets so bad that the landscaper even takes back the grass. He needs to cut back on spending while on unemployment and she needs to get a job. Her job isn't working out and he gets kicked off unemployment. When they get robbed at the loan place, they get an idea.The first half is basically a spiral downwards for this upper class family. It needs more comedy. It has the potential but it doesn't take full advantage. It plays as a light comedy. The couple is materialistic. They aren't the most nicest but they are likable enough to root for. There are some edgy social commentary with Dick as unemployed dealing with the lower class problems. Then the movie turns with the Bonnie and Clyde antics. It gets funnier and more edgier. George Segal and Jane Fonda play a good bickering couple. It could have been even more outrageous if they treated their help with less than friendliness. Then they could learn something as their table gets turned. The setup could be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have Fun with Dick and Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After upper middle-class aerospace executive George Segal (as Dick Harper) is unexpected fired from his high-paying job, he and housewife Jane Fonda (as Jane) are forced to tighten their economic belts. The family decides to give up membership in a "Book of the Month Club", French wines at home, and ski lessons. Another sacrifice is deciding not to heat their new swimming pool, currently being constructed. However, when Ms. Fonda fails to hold a job of her own and Mr. Segal is exposed as a unemployment check cheat, the increasingly desperate couple must become the "Bonnie and Clyde" of the corporate world...Watching "Fun with Dick and Jane" alongside the 2005 re-make elevates this version of the film, although neither really approaches classic status. Some of the topical humor is painful, but this one has many genuinely funny sequences. The satire is good and tight, but the anti-corporate subtext is all over the map (obvious at the end). One of the best scenes here is Segal's botched robbery; when the leading man has trouble getting a gun out of his pants, the clerk thinks he desperately needs a condom. In the re-make, Jim Carrey's "Dick" has no such trouble. Don't blink once or you'll miss Jay Leno, twice for Thayer David.****** Fun with Dick and Jane (2/9/77) Ted Kotcheff ~ George Segal, Jane Fonda, Ed McMahon, Hank Garcia</fullReview>

It is the same format, executive engineer Dick Harper (The Cable Guy's George Segal) is unexpectedly fired by Charlie Blanchard (Ed McMahon) just after finishing a new swimming pool, and he and his wife Jane (Jane Fonda) are in financial trouble. They try to cut down their expenses, find new jobs and ways to get money, and even with unemployment benefits it is uncertain they can keep the house. There is nothing for it for Dick and Jane, when they gain the confidence to they begin robbing drug and liquor stores. Doing this they seem to be surviving and maintaining their social status, it is only a question of whether they will be caught or get away with it all. Also starring Richard 'Dick' Gautier as Dr. Will, Allan Miller as Loan Company Manager, Hank Garcia as Raoul Esteban, John Dehner as Jane's father, Mary Jackson as Jane's mother, Walter Brooke as Jim Weeks, Sean Frye as Billy Harper, James Jeter as Immigration officer and Maxine Stuart as Blanchard's secretary and Fred Willard as Bob. Segal and Fonda make a good duo, there are more amusing jokes than in the remake, it is a pleasant feel-good (or bad that they resort to robbery) comedy classic. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the remake on my DISH TV, and was impressed with what a piece of S*** it is. This in turn inspired me to re-watch the original, and was equally impressed with how funny it was, and, in this overleveraged recessionary time, how prescient it was as well. Who can resist a movie in which a televangelist is robbed at gunpoint? And who pursues them, preaching all the while (I wont give away how the protagonists escape). The social commentary was dead-on right, it was deliciously un-PC, and I wish they made more movies like this in these moronic, over-CGI'd, lame-brain, Hollywood-should-be-ashamed-of-themselves times.Oh my, the filter here says I actually have to write ten lines of text. Well here goes. Jane Fonda, George Segal, and Ed McMahan are both very well cast and very effective - This is a great movie for those who think Jane Fonda can't do comedy. And pardon me for pointing out the obvious in that Ms Fonda has more acting ability in her left big toenail than Ms Leoni has in her entire corpus. Furthermore, Jim Carrey's act is not unlike Jerry Lewis: Real funny the first time, funny the second time, mildly amusing the third time, and ready to be turned off any further times thereafter.Really the one reason for existence in dimwitted remakes - they make us appreciate the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of Funny Scenes but Very Little Coherence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fun with Dick and Jane" was released during George Segal's flirtation with real stardom during the mid-1970s. While pleasant in tone and easy to take, the movie loses momentum about halfway through, wandering to a strictly standard ending.Dick (George Segal) and Jane (Jane Fonda) are a couple living the Southern California dream: lots of money, big house, comfortable lifestyle. Then Dick is laid off by his drunken boss Charlie (Ed McMahon), resulting in the couple borrowing money at first, then turning to a life of crime later. The film's conclusion is a predictable burglary of Dick's ex-boss' safe, where huge sums of stolen money are hidden.The film has lots of amusing vignettes, including the initial layoff scene, the landscaping company repossessing Dick and Jane's plants, a bank robbery while Dick is borrowing money, and a funny job interview at Dick and Jane's house. However, the movie turns out to be just humorous situations strung together with very little coherence. Segal is enormously appealing as always, Fonda is her usual professional self, and McMahon is great as the evil, corrupt boss. It's too bad the screenwriters didn't give them more to work with.Many movies are called more than the sum of their parts. In this case, I think the movie is actually less. I think viewing the film will provide a pleasant evening with lots of laughs, but it won't leave you with anything memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theaters back in 1977 and it is one of my favorites.The chemistry between George Segal and Jane Fonda is good and there are some very funny moments like when he tries to hold up an Afro-American bar and they just look at him and ask "When did they start busing the white robbers to the black neighborhoods?" The other crack that was risqué for the time is when Dick shoves the pistol in his waistband and screams. Jane sweetly looks at him and says, "Don't go off half-cocked."Dicks career as a car thief isn't going very well as even his aerospace knowledge can't seem to help him hot wire a car. Jane points to a convertible next to the car he is try to steal and he says, "I don't know anything about foreign cars." She says, "I think you can handle this one. The keys are in it." And off they go in a 1974 Jaguar XK-E convertible. Later at the party, someone is admiring his Jaguar and he cracks, "I took one for a test drive and loved it."Ed McMahon is great as the drunken manager firing everyone, playing off his reputation from the Johnny Carson show and connections with Budweiser as their spokesman.It's really a very funny movie for it's time and wears well with age. The remake with Jim Carrey is nearly unwatchable. I have both on DVD and haven't been able to watch the remake more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun with George and Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never seen either version of this film before, I tuned into Fun with Dick on a whim after once again finding their was very little else on the other gazillion channels we extortionately pay for, and was I so glad I did.Respectable Aero Engineer Dick Harper has everything. A high flying job, his dream home complete with soon to be complete swimming pool, the perfect wife and son and obligatory dog. In short he has managed to acquire the prefect existence and has made a complete success of life.However when George is laid off by his company, he finds that he has been completely living beyond his means, as the debts of the financially secure mount around a financially ruined family. Endless Hire purchase agreements and red bank statements hardly make good bedfellows.After several disastrous attempts to find other employment and with their welfare checks withheld, Dick and Jane are almost at the end of their rope. With their affluent lifestyle and social position spiralling out of control it seems that their is no where else for them to turn.However when Dick and Jane become innocent victims of an armed hold up in a loan office, Jane manages to re steal some of the already stolen money which sets them on a new and exciting path to regain the perks and comforts of old.They decide that if they cannot earn money and they are unable to receive it through benefits then they would steal it in a number of bizarre hold ups ranging from sleazy porn motels, record shops and liquor stores.George Segal and Jane Fonda are perfectly cast as the daring couple bitten by the bug of thrills and excitement as their new way of life becomes more than just a means to an end.We see them practise at their new found art, gain their confidence and slowly acquire the tricks of the trade as they slowly and more than willingly turn from amateur to professional criminals.With confidence comes bigger and better jobs, and with the necessary skill and ability, Dick and Jane turn their attentions to Dicks former employers and their bulging safe. The Ultimate revenge. Great stuff.It wasn't a 'fall out of your seat laughing' kind of comedy, but none the less it was amusing and entertaining enough to be perfect family viewing on a rainy afternoon.It really is Fun with Dick and Jane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a word, unfunny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I waited a long time to finally see what I thought was going to be a fun caper flick and was shocked to discover shoddy direction, awkward dialogue, a lackluster pace, unmotivated slapstick gags and an overall coarseness that permeated the film throughout. Just not funny! The sets looked cheap, the costumes by the usually excellent Donfeld are garish and distracting. Even the title song is annoying. The whole children's book characters doesn't come close to representing the married couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job. For a film that seems to aim a dart at the unfairness of welfare and unemployment systems, the filmmakers have no problem in being unfair themselves, allowing Hispanic, black and gay stereotypes played at such a cruel level. The look of the film resembles any episode of Love American Style. This is not a compliment. Tacky seventies fashions abound in this world of white collar theft that only lends an air of implausibility to every situation. Outside of a clever initial idea, and two capable stars in Jane Fonda and George Segal, this dated exercise in social commentary comes off as forced and mean spirited to minorities, especially to gay people. If you want a better caper film, you're better off with The Hot Rock with George Segal and Robert Redford or What's Up Doc with Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand. Now that's funny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an underrated gem, that's really quite funny, and hasn't dated at all, with fun performances and a really neat story!. All the characters are awesome, and George Seagal and Jane Fonda had brilliant chemistry together, and made a hilarious duo, plus The ending was especially smart and clever. I wanted to check out the remake in theaters badly, but decided I better see the original 1st, and after having watched it, I doubt the remake will top this, plus one of the funniest scenes in the movie for me is when Seagal's Gun gets caught inside his pants while he's trying to rob the drug store!. I kind of felt for them, because I know that type of situation is hard, but it does not take itself that seriously at all, plus Ed McMahon was just great as the sleaze ball!. All the characters are extremely likable, and I believe this should be higher then 6.2, plus it's extremely well written and made as well!. Seagal and Fonda really seemed to be enjoying themselves, and the way they robbed the banks was just hilarious, plus I loved the music as well. This is an underrated gem that's really quite funny, and hasn't dated at all, with fun performances and a really neat story, and I say it's a must see!. The Direction is awesome!. Ted Kotcheff does an awesome! job here with solid camera work, and keeping the film funny throughout. The Acting is lots of fun!. George Seagal is brilliant here, he had wonderful chemistry with Fonda, was hilarious, seemed to be enjoying himself,had some great dialog, and before this I have never seen him in anything, but will be checking out more of his movies after this terrific performance!. Jane Fonda was gorgeous and was equally as good, she was very funny, added spark, also seemed to be having fun, and proved she was indeed one of the greatest actresses of all time!. Ed McMahon is funny as the sleaze ball, I really enjoyed his performance. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great 1970's movie with a hint of Blaxploitation. We have a couple of actors hear from Blaxploitation flix. Harry Holcombe who plays the pharmacist was in Foxy Brown and Thalmus Rasulala(the income maintenance technician) was in Blacula and Willie Dynamite. Gene Page who does the music for this movie wrote the music for Blacula. Lamont Dozier also contributes to the music, I think thats him singing in some of the songs towards the end of the movie and he also did the music for Detroit 9000(1973, another Blaxploitation flick). I also like the theme song to this movie sung by a group called "The Movies". This is a fun movie that I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's about the best that I can come with, and that is a good thing...just a pleasant film. I watched it on On Demand the other night for the first time since I originally saw it on cable back in 1978. I was a teen ager who wanted to write movies, and this is one of the films that I recorded onto an audio cassette to listen to over and over again to help with my visualization.There is nothing overly funny about it, it doesn't leave me in stitches, but I do smile a lot while watching it. It is also interesting to see some of the old bit players from the 70s who have either died off (Anne Ramsay) or stopped getting work. For some reason, it is a pleasure to watch. I think there is a sense of living vicariously through this couple that makes it enjoyable to watch.Seeing it as an adult, there are jokes that I now get that I didn't as a pre-teen, but it is still a film that I would let a child watch. It's entertaining...nothing I can overtly say than that it is an entertaining movie, and I am interested to see what Jim Carrey does to the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amusing, occasionally hilarious satire lambasting the hypocrisies of American capitalism. This deft comedy pokes fun at the aerospace industry, the welfare system, and may be one of the first to harpoon televangelism. Segal and Fonda are a great team, and the movie ages surprisingly well. Jay Leno makes an early cameo as a construction worker; Dick and Jane earns 3 and a half (out of five) on the Corky-meter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, so Bonny and Clyde, they ain't! But it was never meant to be that.... And, if you never really were around during the late 70's, you won't get the concept either....Sure, we've all read and re-read the plot concept - upper middle income bracket Dick (George Segal) loses his job - just at the time with he and his wife Jane (Jane Fonda) are playing 'keep up with the Joneses' - by buying and buying and buying everything that his salary will afford: there's the new home (typical of ANYTHING in Orange County at the time), the cars, the household furnishings and electronic gadgets, and, oh, yes, let's not forget the LAWN! One of the things that you have to remember is back then, when you bought a new house - it was just that - the house. No landscaping, no pre-made pools and backyard paradises - nothing. Just a house and dirt...Anyway, so Dick loses his job and they are in fear of the possibility of losing their life.... They try all the normal and legal ways of getting by - welfare, food stamps, loans, and on and no - and nothing works out.... They turn to a life of crime when they see how easy it can be done... and they become quite successful at it (watch the end credits as their cars multiply!)...So, it's not a hilarious movie! Big deal! It's got enough funny moments and quick one liners to work.... It's main comical focus, though, is poking fun at the establishment of the times: how big business (aerospace, at the time) uses up it's people and then just drops them when times go soft, big religion (stealing the money from the televangelists!!!), the inadequacy of government, and on and on... Don't look at the film from a 2004 (or 03, 02 01, Y2k) perspective... Think back to the days of disco and the boom of the late 70s... You'll have a laugh and a half...Oh, and if the movie was SO bad? Why is Jim Carrey mounting a new version with himself and Cameron Diaz as the leads? So, it must have been at least SOMEWHAT humorous to warrant a recreation!A 4 **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, enjoyable family movie albeit far from perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fun with Dick and Jane" is a solid, well-made family movie, although it goes without saying that it's not perfect.Dick (George Segal) is a successful upper-class businessman who suddenly loses his job when his boss (Ed McMahon) fires him. His wife, Jane (Jane Fonda), soon finds her world turned upside-down as she is hard-pressed to afford the most simple commodities.In a last-ditch effort, the couple turn to harmless crime such as robbing banks (never killing people - it is a PG movie after all and they aren't Bonnie and Clyde, as the tagline says), until they decide to even rip off Dick's ex-boss at one of his Christmas parties.The movie is being remade this year with Jim Carrey (originally to co-star Cameron Diaz, who pulled out) and I don't think it's necessary. The original works as an amiable, entertaining family comedy and a remake set today would only seem redundant.The cast is strong - McMahon is a scene-stealer and Fonda and Segal have good chemistry.It's a lite version of "Bonnie and Clyde" with a predictably fairy-tale-happy ending and likable characters. It's not ugly or mean-spirited, it's just a nice family film - and what more would you expect from a movie called "Fun with Dick and Jane"? (Well, other than porn, obviously.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY mild but worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dick Harper (George Segal) is suddenly fired from his high-paying job. There's a recession going on and he can't find another. His wife Jane (Jane Fonda) tries to help but she fails in every job she gets. Finally they turn to robbery to make ends meet...and it works!Silly (as you can tell by the premise) but watchable. I never really laughed or found it funny but I did smile quite a few times. What makes this worth seeing is Segal and Fonda--they're both just fantastic. They give very relaxed, believable performances. They also are great at comedy and play off each other very well. Fonda in particular seems to be enjoying herself. Another plus (or minus, depending on your view) are some truly horrible 70s fashions and decor. Check out some of Jane's outfits and look at the wallpaper in their bedroom! Also interesting to see Ed McMahon as Segals' boss. The only real bad things are a few ugly, needless, homophobic lines and a transsexual set up as a joke. But that was all acceptable back in the 70s.Mild but worth catching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about Dick &amp; Jane is the music, like the main theme by The Movie 'Ahead of the Game', and as some of it's supplied by Lamont Dozier it's not hard to see why. There are funny scenes, like when the food stamps technician turns up at their home, during the one night that they can afford steak and champaign for dinner, and he refuses their offer of food saying; 'No thanks. I had a Big Mac...And a Coke.' But it's all a bit too smug and pompous and 'Oh aren't we all sooo funny.' for it's own good.For a better movie that utilises Ms Fonda better, check Nine to Five (1980). Seagal is better in A Touch Of Class with Glenda Jackson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Fun!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was just okay. I often tape movies off cable and then sit on them for months, until I have a free couple of hours to watch them. I taped 'Fun With Dick and Jane' nearly four years before I actually watched it. I usually refer to Leonard Maltin before I get my hopes up. He only gave this **? so I was in no real hurry to see it. But I like Jane Fonda and George Segal so I figured I would watch it SOMEday. Well, I finally popped it in last week and after a half an hour I was, like, can we get on with the plot now? Then at that point I cracked open Maltin and he wrote that it starts out great, but gets worse from there. This gets worse?! I gave it a little more of a chance and I thought it got better as it went on.The plot is simple. The husband loses his job and their suburban lifestyle is threatened to be taken away from them. That's the whole story, stretched out for an hour and forty minutes. Segal applies for unemployment benefits, food stamps, etc. Fonda attempts to get a job, blah, blah, blah. The two of them eventually turn to crime when they encounter some criminals as they are trying to borrow money from a finance company. They see how easy it is and because they are yuppies they get quite good at it. It's a good rainy day movie or something to watch when you have insomnia. Nothing more.I was, however, surprised at the scene where Fonda squats on the toilet to pee as she talks casually with Segal. It just looked out of place watching her wipe up afterwards, yucch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain traces of spoiler!!! I saw this back in 1979,when you often used to get 2 movies for the price of one.Its probably not the funniest film either Segal or Fonda made.but it races along providing plenty of laughs and hitting its targets.Basically Higher middle income bracket couple turn to crime,after he is made redundant and finds he can't get another job.The funniest scene involves them trying to rob a bar in a black neighbourhood,unsuccessfully.Along the way come encounters with the welfare,food stamps,the opera and a bank robbery.Overall,no classic but very funny and worth seeing at least once,certainly much better than some of the witless drivel that passes for comedy these days.</fullReview>
