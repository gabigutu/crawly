		<shortDescription>"Fun" with Dick...and Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge Jim Carrey fan; I've found with most people that you are or you aren't. If you aren't a Carrey fan than this film may not be for you...I was very anxious for this film to come out once I heard it was in production; however, after I saw a couple of reviews on TV it appeared to be another clichéd holiday flick that featured a toned down version of Carrey.I made sure to keep my hopes low for this film just in case Carrey was not in pure form; however, I was delightfully surprised. Carrey lights up the screen once again with his zany antics and rubberface slapstick comedy. The film, by far from my favorite Carrey movie will definitely be added to my collection for not only Carrey's comedic stylings, but also for its good acting (Baldwin, Leoni) and message.Although I never did see the original, the present day story hits home with current collapses of major corporations such as Enron, Worldcom, and many others. Although this updated script seemed a bit unfinished it was definitely worth the $6.00 ticket.Te? Leoni, while at times was a bit hard to swallow made a good match for her high energy movie spouse, Jim Carrey. She was able to come up to Carrey's intensity with her constant anxious energy, yet throughout most of the movie he out shined her as he does most of his movie co-stars.Another unmentioned quality that the movie has is its clean content. The cussing is kept to a minimum and there is no graphic or violent content; making it a great choice for a family film. My 6-year-old niece saw it with me and she was laughing throughout and it kept her attention! Although I did not give the movie a perfect rating mainly due to the script and emphasis on plot, I would give this movie 3 out of 4 stars. I would liken the film to Liar Liar with a watered down script. I would definitely check out this one out - you're guaranteed to have Fun with Dick, and maybe Jane =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Job, Jim Carey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in a preview screening and I laughed so hard that I had a headache by the end. I am really glad that Jim Carey has finally found a balance between his physical comedy and things that are actually comedic. The supporting cast was also excellent. Alec Baldwin was very good at being a character whom the viewer would love to hate. The story line was interesting and fast moving. It was a spot of light shining on the sad times that followed all of the financial ruin at the beginning of this decade. Although the movie was only about an hour and a half long, it did not feel short at all. All in all it was a fun movie that is worth watching if one really wants a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unemployment line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fun with Dick and Jane" reflects, in many ways, what's wrong with our society. We watch in disbelief as more and more CEOs are hauled up to jail and how these unscrupulous people leave their once valued employees to fend for themselves, as best they can.Dan Perisot directs this remake of the 1977 Jane Fonda-George Segal vehicle and brings it up to date. He counts with two actors that are popular to present this new installment in a funny way, Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni in the main roles.Poor Dick finds out in the worst way the job he held has just disappeared and must face reality. Dick and Jane must deal with their sudden status as they see their electricity cut, their housekeeper deserts them and Dick suffers the indignity of having to compete with other unemployed, former colleagues, for jobs that aren't half as glamorous as the vice-presidency he almost had.What's a desperate man to do? Well, being a resourceful man, he must do what he has to. Jane and Dick start a path into taking the law into their own hands. In a way, Mr. Carrey, one of the producers, mixes a serious problem with his kind of comedy. Jim Carrey is one of the best comedians working in movies today, but he also has an enormous talent for doing some serious dramatic work, as he has already proved. He is a dynamo in the film and turns the situation Dick is facing into fun, in his own way.Tea Leoni, is equally suited to play Jane, the travel agent who suddenly sees all those comforts she was used to, disappear, and must adapt to her new circumstances. Ms. Leoni and Mr. Carrey do some funny things together, making the film look much better than what could have been. The supporting players, mainly Alec Baldwin and Richard Jenkins make good contributions to the film."Fun with Dick and Jane" is a typical example of those holiday themed films the studios love to unload at the end of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Movie with Great Physical Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have we lost our humor in America? This is a very funny movie. In many ways it's a dark comedy with a happy ending. But it moves quickly, is a parody on timely issues and has some of the best physical acting you'll ever see.Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni work very well together. And while the 1977 original had two of my favorite people (whacko politics aside for Jane Fonda because she was a hoot in Barbarella), I think this version was more light hearted and more up to date.I have a strange feeling that younger people didn't understand the concept, 20-30's thought it implausible for them and people above were frightened by its premise.7 out of 10 for an entertaining time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light comedy with some good laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In previews and early reviews this movie was called "one of the funniest movies ever" and I was eager to see it. But after a while it began to get called "the worst Jim Carrey movie ever". I still thought I should see it, being a big Jim Carrey fan, plus I haven't always agreed with the critics. After seeing it I can't say it's the funniest movie ever, but it definitely isn't the worst.I have not seen the original version, but I'm sure there are some modern plot twists and of course original jokes. There are plenty of gags and funny situations that kept me entertained throughout and some really good ones that made me laugh hysterically. Many comedies are very silly which makes them so funny, but people have said that this movie is just silly and not funny at all, I can't agree. While there are some small parts that are just silly, the rest are not.Acting wise it is quite good. Jim Carrey does his trademark craziness well in this one. The rest of the cast do well too.Overall it's a funny, entertaining movie. If you feel like a light comedy with some good laughs, ignore the harsh critics and go and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As much fun as Carrey and Leoni can make it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dick and Jane is a comedy I didn't expect to do very well. I wasn't sold by the trailers, and another remake is something the world can live happily without. Dick and Jane is an underrated hit though, and Carrey and Leoni are remarkably not as annoying as they sometimes can be. Carrey is, thankfully, as hyperbolic as the character of Dick will let him be and Jane isn't as complicated a role for Leoni to fall on. The movie excellently thanks corporations for its inspiration in the final credits.Dick has a happy, healthy upper-middle class family. A promotion to the upper echelon believes him to convince his wife Jane to quit her job and get that hot tub they always wanted. A sudden change in corporate direction however, changes their future as they must resort to drastic measures when the bills aren't getting paid.I didn't find myself laughing as much as I wanted to for a movie. In a year dominated by comedy-remake stinkers like the Honeymooners and Bewitched, Dick and Jane is one of the better movies of the year to watch. If you want a good movie to watch and understand a little bit of corporate history, I recommend Dick and Jane for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This fine movie is grossly underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of Dick, an ambitious marketing executive which is promoted to the top just on the day his corporation implodes due to some embezzlement scheme. The first 15 minutes (Dick's ascent) are really very, very funny - that's Jim Carrey at his best.The movie's best part is when you see Dick and his wife falling all the way to level where survival is really a struggle - this is actually very moving. Their ensuing blotched criminal career is on the other hand not so funny as you might expect -- you have the feeling that this is a very good serious movie trying to be funny just to meet the public's expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey does it again. Slapstick comedy but not the pie throwing variety. it's a lot more subtle than the Ace Ventura movies but it's no dark comedy either.The movie is an extremely exaggerated view of Dick, Jane and kid coping with loss of job, income, car, nanny, TV, grass (the lawn type not the other grass), electricity, and even citizenship. Suspend your logic and have fun. There are escapes, car crashes, robberies, illegal immigrants, job hunts, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Bush ... if this doesn't perk your interest nothing will.The best gag in the film is at the end just before the titles start... don't miss the "Our Special Thanks To" part!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey is hard to beat in a role like this. He looks like the all American yuppie - tall, clean shaven, well dressed, and in control of his life - and his comedic delivery has been refined into a polished riff. All is believable when he lets loose because you know this is a guy who has a great sense of humor and he can get you to laugh until you lose your breath without grossing you out or making you groan at absurd silliness. Even while prancing or jabbing the air or contorting his face, Carrey is - hands down - the sexiest comedian on screen today. Tea Leoni is a good match for him because she too can be sexy while doing pratfalls or ending up with mud on her face. This is a dream coupling that should be repeated in more light comedies the way William Powell &amp; Myrna Loy were paired in The Thin Man series.I found this remake head and shoulders above the original because it had far more energy and there was more 'sympatico' in the match of personalities of Dick &amp; Jane. The new version also has a much more important message about corporate shenanigans and its grave impact on modern society. The film moves at a quick pace and was too short for me, but that's only because I didn't want to leave these characters. They became that fun couple you always invite to your get-togethers because they are the life of every party.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been funnier and stronger if the screenplay was written better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey has come a long way since his early days on In Living Color. He became a hit actor in the likes of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (a personal childhood favourite), The Mask and Dumb and Dumber. He tried hard for an Oscar nom, but always contended with winning Golden Globes. And for years now, he has basically been bouncing around dramas, comedies, and dramedies. So now, he has tackled a remake (of a comedy no less), and the results as per the last few years, are mixed at best.Carrey is Dick, an employee at Globodyne (read: Enron) who is promoted just in time to help sail the company into oblivion on television. He tells his wife Jane (Tea Leoni) to leave her job only hours before hand, and upon returning stunning home, realizes that he may be in a bit of trouble. As the months go on, the pair's assets slowly begin to dwindle, and hope for continued survival begins to evaporate. So with nothing left to do, they turn to life of petty crime and hope for the best.It is not an original concept at all, but Carrey and Leoni do a valiant job keeping this boat floating. While the film does have a few hilarious moments, the rest of it is bogged down by mere snicker-filled sequences or just scenes that are totally unfunny. It's not like these two actors are having any trouble being funny, it's that the material is not funny. Judd Apatow did wonders with The 40-Year-Old Virgin, but he fumbles here pretty hard with his writing partner Nicholas Stoller, who does not have nearly enough credits to his name. A parody on what happened at Enron was inevitable, but this just seems lackluster and barely thought out. Subplots are brought in, but barely resolved, and the key storyline just feels very weak by the end. It's not terrible, it just feels a tad bit incomplete.The sorry thing about the entire film is the fact that much of it just feels like an extended montage with little payoff. It is only ninety minutes long, so it feels like a lot was trimmed down or cut right out. But the film suffers as a result. If it was longer, it undoubtedly could have had more potential for more funny moments, and as a whole, feel more complete.While Carrey and Leoni do their best, it's Leoni who gives a stronger performance. Yes, Carrey is right at home with his zany character, and totally overshadows Leoni in every single aspect. But he just lacks that integral element of human comedy here, that made him so famous in the first place. It's unfortunate, and makes me wonder if the old Carrey will ever return, or if we'll have to contend with semi-funny Carrey for the rest of his career. Leoni is much better, and feels more in tune with what she's doing. Even more unfortunate is the wasted supporting cast does very little. Alec Baldwin as the sleazy CEO Jack McCallister is sparingly unfunny, as is Richard Jenkins as the right hand man Frank Bascombe, who spends most of the movie drunk and not doing anything (besides setting up for the finale). The rest of the cast has little to no screen time, or are simply silly supporting characters that just feel like excess waste in the entire scheme of things.For all of it's faults, the film is a worth while watch. As said, I did laugh at some of it. A bit of work on the screenplay would have benefited everyone here. Just do not go in expecting a comedy classic with Jim Carrey. If so, you will be sadly disappointed.6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why bother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my lord, what were they thinking about with this one. It not only is frantically unfunny, but worse, a very good original was trashed in the bargain. Jane Fonda, believe it or not, actually turned in the performance of her life in that one. Even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life. Maybe she is just flat good as a crook. Any other time, wow, what a waste of time. But she and Segal team up beautifully, so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby, catch the anvil upon which it got beaten into a pulp from.Because very very very little of that one remains, to this ones horror. Nothing in this baby is remotely funny except for maybe a couple of moments when Dick and Jane are bulging lipped up as lepers and cant kiss..... and uhh........oh my lord, that's it? Well, looks like it. It truly is that bad a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the difference???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, not at all do I know why this movie didn't at least earn a 7. It is extremely hilarious just like all the other wonderful Jim Carrey comedies, and there's not much of a difference. The only way this is different from the others at all is the occasional vulgar and drug-related humor, which isn't included in any other Jim Carrey comedy. However, surprisingly, Jim Carrey does this sort of comedy very well for someone whose movies never include that type of humor. That couldn't have possibly brought down the ratings. But what did? is my question. It's like asking how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop. The world, or at least I, will never know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, was this the best Jim Carrey comedy? Not really, but it is one of his better late one's. I think because I have had the week from heck, I just needed a good laugh, thanks to Jim. :) Anywho, Dick and Jane are two average Americans who follow by the rules and manage a reasonable budget. When the company that Dick owns goes broke, he is fired, he and Jane are now in trouble when Dick cannot find a job fast enough. Piece by piece they are loosing or having to sell their stuff, when Dick receives an eviction notice, he and Jane have had it and will no longer play by the rules to live their lives once again. With a cast who seemed to enjoy making the film, I think this was over all a funny movie to watch and would recommend it.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no "fun" poking fun at the desperate plight of illegal immigrants! Or the desperate plight of head-shop owners, for that matter! That the richer-than-God Brian Glazer didn't see the irony of having the "heroes" do exactly what the villain does - rob honest, hardworking people of their life savings - doesn't surprise me! Hell, how do you think he got to be richer than God?!In this alleged satire about greed, these mental midgets reveal their own hypocrisy: the McMansions, the McToys, the McChildren, the McIllegals who are paid peanuts to take care of the McMansions, the McToys, and the McChildren! But the main problem (aside from the revolting bigotry) is the premise: as the former executive of a now-infamous company, Dick would be the Big Scalp for every corporate headhunter in the country! No soup kitchens for him! And, raking in high six-figures, you'd think he wouldn't be caught dead around a Gore/Lieberman poster!</fullReview>

The whole thing is terribly episodic in nature. Jim Carrey didn't bother to bring his "A" material, he just seems bored and slightly ashamed of the whole thing. But heck, when you're getting paid $20 million plus, why bother. Tea Leoni is frantic. I guess I would be frantic not to get blamed for this flop.There's just something sort of off about Dick &amp; Jane. Carrey and Leoni aren't funny and have little chemistry. The script isn't funny. And it's not well-plotted.But it may be bigger than that. The reality of Dick and Jane is, perhaps, a little too real. Maybe it's just not funny for people to lose their jobs in an Enron-like situation, when real-life still lacks a happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wildly underrated remake of the Jane Fonda/George Segal classic --- proving that it's never a bad time to say f### y## to corporate America. Jim Carrey &amp; Tea Leoni find themselves way over their heads after Carrey is run out of his job by greedy boss Alec Baldwin. They plot revenge after trying (in the most bizarre ways imaginable)to make ends meet. Attempting everything from bank robbery to migrant day labor, Carrey is brilliant and Leoni is a perfect match for his hyperactivity. Their Sonny &amp; Cher bit is lunacy and Carrey's run in with some ruthless INS officers has to be seen to be believed. Baldwin, affecting a southern drawl, is suitably nasty and the supporting cast includes Michael Higgins, Angie Harmon, and Richard Jenkins, as the couple's boozy and very unlikely savior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really had no interest in seeing this. I saw the trailers and read the reviews, and decided to give it a pass. My wife really wanted to see it, so we watched it on DVD. I was pleasantly surprised. It was funnier than the commercials showed, and better than the reviewers said. I cannot understand these people that didn't like it. What the hell were they expecting? Obviously, it wasn't completely realistic. Most movies are less so. It was exaggerated for comedic effect! One of my favorite scenes was the scramble and fight for the job interview. Also the scene afterward where the corporate execs are laughing at the plight of Dick. I'm sure most people (especially now in Bush's bad economy) can sympathize with the plight of trying to find a job. I've been in similar situations). It wasn't hilarious throughout, but there were several times I laughed, which I haven't done while watching most recent comedies, like the horrible Failure to Launch. This movie actually dealt with a serious issue millions of Americans face in a funny way. Also, I'm not a big Jim Carrey fan, and I thought he did just fine here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Toothless satire remake of a largely forgotten comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FUN WITH DICK AND JANE (2005) ** Jim Carrey, Tea Leoni, Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins.Toothless satire remake of a largely forgotten comedy.Why does Hollywood continue to remake films that are in no way clamoring to be remade? In the latest 're-imagining' of a 'comedy' from the '70s that never registered to begin with the original FUN WITH DICK AND JANE with George Segal and Jane Fonda, I must admit do not remember at all. I was maybe ten when if first came out and when it premiered on cable most of it was over my head for a sophisticated farce about a middle-class couple facing life on another viewing when the corporate ladder hubby has been scaling shakes him free from his ascent to financial security.In the toothless 21st century attempt to shock the system, Dick Harper (sadly underused Carrey) is a VP wannabe of an Enron-like conglomerate that is on the verge of financial ruin and federal indictments aplenty when its CEO Jack McCallister (a slimily bearded Baldwin) absconds with its pension plans for his own personal gains while alighting on the company helicopter as Dick has been publicly humiliated as the investors' patsy. Dick's downward spiral continues as his wife Jane (Leoni, ditto) attempts to maneuver their lateral positions for the best even if it means paying their housekeeper in appliances when the money run out.What could have been a clever skewering of the '00s blight of corporate thievery and deceit comes across as a slap-happy sitcom sized rejoinder to the rat race with the indisposed couple resorting to stick-up jobs at the local mini- mart and eventually all paths leading back to the man responsible for their plight.Carrey and Leoni make the most of their slight screenplay (by Judd Apatow, Nicholas Stoller and Peter Tolan) and the ham-fisted direction by Dean Parisot but ultimately the story is rather beleaguered and the send-off ending feels tacked on.Too bad the comedy that could've been - sticking it to THE MAN - never comes to fruition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun with Dick and Jane ? Laugh your financial difficulties away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun with Dick and Jane will thoroughly entertain you. It's funny, easy to watch, and will turn to ridicule those callous financiers who have ruined the world economy.You get attached to Jim Carrey's character almost immediately as well as his family. The crisis comes almost right during the opening dumps them into financial trouble on the spot. Their efforts are desperate, yet presented in a comedic fashion. You root for them, but they can't seem to get the better of the situation.This very real situation is solved in a very unrealistic fashion that could have been daydreamed by an enthusiastic young mind. It makes for thigh-slapping laughs and lots of mirth. It's a great mix. Who wouldn't want to be the hero of their economic difficulties?Recommended to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Andrew's Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gets a rating of 4.5/5 stars. The actors were very fitting to their parts, and that enhanced the movie. The main actors in the movie are Jim Carrey, Tea Leoni, Alec Baldwin, and Richard Jenkins. Jim Carrey plays the main character Dick Harper. Tea Leoni plays Jane Harper, Dick's wife. Alec Baldwin plays Jack McCallister who is Dick's boss and the leader of Globadyne that goes under because of him. Richard Jenkins plays another former Globadyne employee who is trying to steal the money stolen from the employees from Jack McCallister. He helps Dick and Jane with their endeavors later on in the movie. Dick works at Globadyne in the beginning of the movie. He is hoping for a big promotion. He gets it, and he tells Jane to quit her job because they don't need the money anymore. He is invited over to his boss's house for lunch and he finds out he is going to be on TV to tell the world about the problems with Globadyne's stock. He acts very confused about what's going on as Globadyne's stock is displayed in the background. It goes all the way from in the hundreds to zero as the company crashes. When dick gets home he finds out Jane took her advice and quit her job. This poses as a problem because they have no source of income, and all of their savings were invested in Globadyne's stock. They have no way of earning money, and their savings are gone. They decide to try to steal their money back that was stolen from them by Jack McCallister. Memorable moments from the film include the first time Dick steals, he steals patches from neighbors' front lawns and has enough to cover his front awn with an extremely patchy layer of grass. His wife thinks it is beautiful, because it was the first thing that was stolen from them, put back. When they are stealing the money in a coffee shop, they also get the worker to make them two latte's and a couple low-fat muffins for them. As they begin their life of crime, they take on different identities on their different jobs. Another special crime is as they are robbing a bank, another former Globadyne employee is robbing the bank at the same time, and they get busted. While Jane is standing outside she thinks they are busting Dick, but he comes running out and they leave the scene as fast as they can. This movie is definitely a comedy and I would recommend it as an older family movie or for anyone who likes a light comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than One Would Expect, Actually</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film at the discount theater just for something to do one day. I quickly realized my mistake...I waited too long to see it! I would have been even better in a better quality theater! The film is a remake of an old '70's film with the same plot: A upper-middle class family ends up in the poor house following the disaterous downfall of the breadwinner's employer. After trying to cope with poverty with comedic results that only Jim Carrey can convey properly, Dick and Jane are forced to steal the money they need to get their lives back in order, also often resulting in more comedic adventures. The film is slow in some parts, but the laughs are worth the wait. I find myself quoting this film often and chuckling to myself. Give it a try, You're guaranteed to laugh at least twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Substitutes wit with bombast and satire with flailing about...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1977's "Fun With Dick and Jane", a serious-comedy about economic hardship coupled with slapstick humor, was ripe for a remake--especially since the financial woes of the mid-'70s seem like an eternity ago. As with the original, this remake begins with an upscale couple hurtled into an uncertain, financially-depressed situation after the husband loses his high-paying job as the recently-appointed VP for a CyberOptics firm. Faced with foreclosure, the married twosome turn to crime, pulling off medium-sized hits until Dick learns he was being used by his former bosses as the fall-guy for their expensive follies. For the first hour or so, this slick piece of goods manages to land a few amusing corporate bull's-eyes, even if (as with the first film) robbery is hardly side-splitting. Still, the final act Big Rip-Off is way over-the-top, mitigating the sharpness of the earlier jokes and turning leads Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni into screeching sillies. The original ran into trouble when it tried to show that Dick and Jane had a conscience--yet went ahead and ripped off Dick's former boss anyhow. This version is equally schizophrenic; our heroes are greedy but not ruthless, and have been treated badly therefore deserve to play by their own rules. It doesn't quite wash, and Carrey's clowning becomes more and more arduous as the plot plays out. The cynicism built into this comic concept (white-collar crime played for laughs) doesn't prod the audience with a sense of recognition. The couple go downhill very fast, and yet don't seem to seek out all the options available to them. The filmmakers go for broke with gruesome gags, but their picture becomes an elongated cartoon in the process. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrey has his moments, but it's not his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey plays Steve Martin's role of a stressed out, very unlucky business man in Fun with Dick and Jane, a comedy about misfortunes and tricking your ex-boss/employers. The movie offers nothing new, but what's there works?a bit. Carrey is at his best when he's in a real panic, which happens as he tries to outfox his boss in the end of the movie. His wife is his partner in crime after the couple loose their house due to Carrey's business shutting down as the CEO desperately unloaded all his shares. However, the movie is streaky up to that point, with some very unnecessary crappy story lines (Carrey's child, on the street, etc.) that make you groan. It's stuff that we've already seen numerous times before. But, with Carrey in the leading role, the film is still fun to watch. You may not laugh at everything he does, but you will laugh at most of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another little comedy to show off Jim Carrey's talents... still it never became boring or felt like recycled stuff. In every comedy he's in, he brings something new in his mannerisms and approach to the character. In addition, Tea Leoni pulls of a nice Jane... a rather plain one who's continuously updating her character. Her performance is a real starrer in the film.There are a number of actually funny humor sequences in the film. Some of them are quite innovative. The first robbery scene in the departmental store is just totally hilarious. I have seen the 1977 version starring Jane Fonda, and somehow this remake suited for me better. That's partly because of the script and the casting of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was OK but I didn't really care for the message it sends. It's saying it's OK to steal and rob people at gun point if it means saving your house, etc... The film makes fun of Dick and Jane turning into robbers, which really isn't that funny. Sure it's great to see the evil boss, Jack, get what he deserves and all turns out all right for the former employees. And it was funny in a mean spirited kind of way.I liked the competition Dick had going on with the neighbor and then found out him and his wife were also robbing banks. Also the scene were Dick is trying to out run other would be job seekers and even uses a fire extinguisher was funny. He makes it first only to find a really long line.FINAL VERDICT: Entertaining. Jim Carrey was good and not too annoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Soul Mate for the Unemployed of Late</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh yeah, this film is very underrated.The performances of Jim Carrey, Tea Leoni, Alec Baldwin and Richard Jenkins are identifiable - but you've got to get into what this film is about and many folks might not get where, where folks who have been recently unemployed for questionable reasons may find a soul mate in "Fun With Dick and Jane".This is a simple story of Dick, a man working for a Corporation who after several years of hard work and waiting finally gets promoted to Vice President of Communications. It's a career elation, a glorious time. His wife, Jane, works for a cut rate travel agencies where every traveler seems to have problems. With Dick's new promotion, Dick tells his wife she can quit her dead end, non-thankful job and stay home with their son - which is something she always wanted to do.Should be the end of the story but it isn't. The American Dream takes a bad hit here. Dick's promotion and new job is only 15 minutes long for the company was in deep trouble and Dick was their Corporate Communications fall guy. Dick and Jane are left with nothing and as the bills mount and the nosy neighbors find out, Dick and Jane sink as low as they can go to survive. They rob, they steal..."Fun with Dick and Jane" could have been darker and funnier - Jim Carrey was the perfect cast as Dick and Tea Leoni as Jane but at points it seems to stop from going as far as it could. A "black comedy" or "deep dark comedy" route would have been even better for this film...and not the sometimes "silly" gestures of Jim Carrey to keep the comedy of the film going.I especially loved the scenes showing Dick (and his ex co-workers) trying to get another job - I think every American HR Professional and students in college should see just those scenes to know what is going on with folks really searching for positions who have degrees and are Managers/Directors/VP levels. From the applications back to those levels to the minimum wage jobs to keep you alive until you get a well paying job. If they see this they wont ask "What have you been doing for the three months since your company stole all your money and shut down." or "I don't understand what you mean - your company shut down?" Sounds stupid, but yes these are questions the employed will ask the unemployed. You expect for the HR person to bring in their employees and take a picture with you to make you feel more of a loser than you already do! This film is an underrated gem for those who are or ever have been unemployed because of what a company did, not because of their performance. If you've had a job with the same employer for years and never been laid off --- or don't believe that happens to folks without their performance being the culprit, this is not the film for you.Morally, you shouldn't rob or steal, but "Fun with Dick and Jane" makes you think - how much can a human take before they snap? And how greedy can a CEO get??? It's played for humor here - and some of the humor hits, while some is strained and takes the film down a bit.A job is more than work - it's a big chunk of time and identity out of your life and you place your life and your family's life around what you do to make ends meet. You do your best, play the game -- and you still end up with nothing - no matter what you do to save or invest to prevent living on the streets. "Fun With Dick and Jane" deals with just that in the most ill-advised, extreme way possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If my tag line doesn't sound glowing, that's because it's not. We've all sat through horrific stinkers and wished to heaven we could have our two hours back, and life is simply too short to watch terrible films, but sometimes you end up watching movies because you're sitting there and you don't want to move, because friends drag you to it, or because you've been unable to find a single other thing on the 500 channels on your satellite setup. Well, let me tell you that if you are forced to see it, you won't have the worst time of your life. Carrey has done oh so much worse things, and the grotesque poop/semen jokes are kept to a bare minimum, while the actual physical comedy and snappy lines work. I've seen better, but more importantly, I've seen FAR worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I managed to find a babysitter and went out to see one of two movies. Unfortunately the two movies we wanted to see were sold out. The only movie that was left (without a 2 hour wait) was Fun With Dick and Jane.I am not a Jim Carrey fan though I did enjoy his work in The Truman Show. Téa Leoni is a fairly unknown quantity for me.Maybe because my expectations were so low, or because I haven't been out to a movie in a dogs age, I can't be absolutely sure why, but I really enjoyed this film. It was not the over the top Carrey of the years gone by and I say "Thank God!" for that.Much of the humour was subtle and fairly mature, resulting (I suspect) in the regular Jim Carrey fans missing it altogether. There were (of course) the standard stupid Hollywood style dumb gags, the kind you'd expect to see on Teletoon, but all in all I found the film to be quite funny.The plot was decent, with a few loose ends left dangling, but this is nothing that isn't unforgivable in this post Agatha Christie era that we're in.The characters were somewhat believable, with the Jane character being the most genuine of the entire show. Others do suffer from dimension envy and I would have liked to have seen Alec Baldwin's character fleshed out a bit more.All in all I think that Fun with Dick and Jane will be one of those movies that people end up renting and being pleasantly surprised.A nice touch is the "special thank you" section of the credits which are worth the price of admission alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the 1977 flick comedy, Dick and Jane are living the good life. What gets better is that Dick gets a promotion, which causes Jane to quit her job. Suddenly, there's a huge downfall on the company, forcing Dick to lose his job. Now, both Dick and Jane have no money, almost bankrupt. Dick decides to turn to a life of crime, with his wife by his side to pay for the bills.I thought this would be an average comedy. Well, it is. This movie is very funny, with some great lines. Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni worked together great, and Alec Baldwin was funny.Anything that can go wrong, goes wrong in this film (in a good way for comedic laughs). You can tell these people are really desperate for money. Even Jane wouldn't want her friends and neighbors to know they're in debt.This isn't the greatest movie of the year, but it certainly is funny. It's one of those happy films that makes you smile. Everyone should go see it.</fullReview>

Everything was going great until the company Dick works for goes bust. Dick loses his job and the family are left close to bankruptcy. Things go from bad to worse as Dick's many jobs end up with painful but hilarious outcomes. Soon, Dick and Jane are fed up and decide that they will get their money back by ANY means necessary.This movie is hilarious feel good fun.

		<shortDescription>A disappointment, but an enjoyable one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film aims at being a good satire. It is a remake of a 1977 film that I haven't seen, but this version is very rooted in modern events. It takes the Enron scandal as a starting point and depicts an upper middle class culture where many people are fighting it out for a few jobs. After attempting to work at a Wal-Mart clone and even as a day laborer, Jim Carrey gives up and decides the only way to get what he deserves is to steal it. He and his wife (Téa Leoni) go on a crime spree. The movie does have some anger behind the story, and it does have some satirical teeth. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite bite hard enough. A combination of mediocre direction and poor editing make a lot of the comedy sequences ? many of which feel like, with a good rewrite, they would have been gut-busting ? fall somewhat flat. I also imagine that the screenplay went through many hands, and the rewriting that it did get was more of a watering-down. There's also a weird thing that happens in the background. All over the place we see Gore/Liberman signs and bumper stickers, which works to set the film in 2000. For a long time, I was wondering why the filmmakers were blaming Bill Clinton, still for some reason every conservative's whipping boy, for all these corporate scandals when, more often than not, the CEOs and CFOs were die-hard, campaign-contributing Republicans (there isn't a single Bush/Cheney sign to be seen). I'm still not sure why all the Gore/Liberman signs, but the only reason the film is set in 2000, it turns out, is to set up a joke whose punchline only comes in the film's final moments ? one character announces that he finally got a new job ? at Enron. It's a joke that doesn't even make sense, and one that is certainly not funny, though it's meant to be. So, anyway, all that needs some more exploration. I imagine that the filmmakers had a good idea that never fully came to fruition. Anyway, the film is something of a failure, but I laughed, and I did enjoy it. I also thought it was very historically interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'Fun With Dick And Jane' is yet another highly unnecessary remake. Please, God, let the studio executives start looking at new material. The only reason to remake an old script is if you have a new way to tell the story. This movie really has nothing to say.The original, a showcase for the comic talents of George Seagal, wasn't very good, so how anyone thought a remake would serve to bring out the best in Jim Carrey, God only knows. Carrey continues to frustrate. He can be a good straight actor ? although I wasn't taken, particularly, with 'The Truman Show', I thought he was excellently suited to the script, and he was excellent in 'Man In The Moon' ? but, as with 'Bruce Almighty' and last year's 'A Series Of Unfortunate Events', he (or his producers) seem incapable of restraining his rubber-faced histrionics. They were tired back in the days of 'Ace Ventura'.There's no chemistry between Carrey and Tea Leoni , as his wife, and this is where the film really falls down ? without a relationship we can believe in at the heart of the film it simply becomes an interminable series of half-arsed sketches. Little details ? such as their child constantly speaking in a Mexican accent because he's been raised by the housekeeper ? could easily have been built on for comic effect. They aren't.Alec Baldwin's short turn as the corrupt CEO of the company whose bankruptcy forces Carrey into a life of crime, puts more into his by-the-numbers baddie role than the rest of the cast, combined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly and Ridiculous Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The storyline of "Fun Wih Dick and Jane" is excellent: "executive loses his job; unemployed and without means of maintaining the lifestyle of his family, his wife and he become thieves, and later they decide to steal his former boss". In 1977, Ted Kotcheff, with George Segal and Jane Fonda, directed a great movie.This 2005 remake is an unsuccessful trial of updating the almost classic movie that became very silly and ridiculous. Jim Carrey simply destroyed Dick Harper, transforming the successful executive engineer of the original story in a stupid, envious and hysterical clown. Tea Leoni did the same with Jane, who was an elegant woman from an aristocratic family that had never worked in the original movie, in a simple stressed clerk that hates her job. The slow construction of the desperate situation of the Harper family of the first movie becomes a caricature in the "updated" version. Last but not the least, the sharp critic to the American Dream, satirizing the hypocrite need of maintaining a status, and also to the corruption related to the big business of the corporations of the first movie simply vanish in this foolish remake. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "As Loucuras de Dick e Jane" ("The Crazy Things of Dick and Jane")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly atrocious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humour and I personally think he's a great actor (Eternal Sunshine, for example).However, this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a Jim Carrey vehicle, so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny, you will sit stony-faced throughout this film, as it has NOTHING else to recommend it.Even if you do like Carrey's comedy, I am not sure you will find this film amusing. I went to see it on a Saturday night at 10:30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh. They giggled throughout the trailers, which weren't particularly funny, but when it came to the film, stony silence. I think it raised about five genuine laughs.The problem with the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be. It can't make up its mind whether it's going for slapstick or serious. If it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but (I'm guessing) it's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters.The strong point of the film is the hold-ups, and there was plenty of potential here. But these didn't start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped. Meanwhile, you have to sit through the first excruciating 40 minutes as the couple's life deteriorates.Four separate groups walked out of this film while I was there, and if my flatmate hadn't asked me to keep away from the house (his girlfriend having just returned from a month-long vacation!), I would have done the same. And in my entire 25 years of movie going, I have done that just once before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First half of this movie is a pretty solid comedy that is not done by some usual formula. It goes for a non-extreme fun (and that is saying something when you have Jim Carrey on board), trying to do "smart humor", which mostly works.Second half, for whatever reason, descends into well known Hollywood formulas. It's not bad, just, it's a little let-down after the first half.It's both fun and funny, not very much so, but, quite enough. Tea Leoni is in her maybe best comedic role, and she looks better than ever (she was not a girl any more, but a very good looking woman). Her joy of being able to cook something when she quits her job, thus having time to actually do it right, is very genuine and funny. The general theme of the movie is also interesting, if, especially in the second half, not fully explored.About the only significant issue I found with the movie is that some supporting roles, like Angie Harmon's, were not explored more, as there was some fun to be had there. Some supporting roles, not all, mind you.It would have been interesting if a sequel of sorts was made after the financial markets crash in 2008., to see how these two would have handled that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the year 2000. Dick (Jim Carrey) and Jane Harper (Téa Leoni) are an upwardly mobile suburban couple keeping up with the Joneses. Dick gets a big promotion to be the VP of Communications. Jane quits her frustrating job. Then the company implodes after the CEO Jack McCallister (Alec Baldwin) escapes with the golden parachute. Dick finds himself jobless, and financially stuck with worthless company stock. As the family struggles, Dick and Jane fall into armed robbery.This tries to tie itself to the modern sense of disenfranchising corporate greed. This story is ready for the update. Putting it back five years does take a little steam out of the movie. The pervasive bitter tone clashes with Carrey's wild-man comedy style. This probably would work much better as a dark unfunny version. Laughs are too hard for this material. It hits too close to home.</fullReview>

I love this movie so much because it achieves it's goal of comedy and quality filmmaking. I would totally suggest this film for teens and adults looking for a good time filled with laughs, children really won't be interested in it. The ending is satisfying and clever. The only part I didn't really care for was the scene where Dick is taunting a man they are stealing from and his antics aren't too funny, and it lasts too long.

		<fullReview>Fun with Dick and Jane (2005): Dir: Dean Parisot / Cast: Jim Carrey, Tea Leoni, Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins, Angie Harmon: Routine remake about communication and marital union. When Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni lose their jobs and are threatened with bankruptcy they resort to crime in order to live. Setup works due to casual development of the plot that isn't rushed but the conclusion leaves questions as to whether a lesson is learned or is crime a payoff. Director Dean Parisot counters cheap sets in favor of developing the setup, which pays off further due to Carrey and Leoni's flawed methods of executing crime. They are an effective pairing coming from different cinematic backgrounds. They are at their best in crime scenes that backfire leaving them empty handed. Parisot previously made the mystifying comedy tragedy Home Fries as well as the science fiction comedy spoof misfire Galaxy Quest. Richard Jenkins carries a few laughs as an ex-co-worker but Alec Baldwin is a complete waste as the cheating boss in what amounts to being a rather standard role. Angie Harmon even got talked into this. It is hardly an impressive comedy in terms of its production values. Despite the fact that this is a remake the theme stresses the difficulty in living yet Dick and Jane's true fun is in their ability to work through these difficulties as a union.

		<shortDescription>Good Movie Though it Lacks A Good Amount of Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun with Dick and Jane is a good Jim Carrey movie, but it surprisingly lacks the amount of humor present in other "recent" Jim Carrey movies such as Bruce Almighty and Yes Man. On this second viewing of the film I found myself engaged in the story to the point that I was not necessarily upset that this movie wasn't was funny as I expected.This movie has an unusually long first act for a comedy. Jim Carrey plays Dick Harper, who works at a company run by Jack McCallister (Alec Baldwin with an atrocious southern accent) and Dick gets promoted right before the company goes bankrupt due to McCallister's embezzlement, which no officials realize even though it is so obvious. The titular couple, Dick and Jane, has to deal with financial hardships since Jane quits her job after Dick's promotion, leaving no breadwinners in the house once the company Dick works for goes bankrupt. It may only take about half an hour, but it seems like a good forty or forty-five minutes for Dick and Jane to get to the point of the movie: the two of them robbing banks.It is enjoyable to watch the couple go from terrible to expert level at the task of robbing money. The segment that deals with the first night Dick tries to rob people shows how pathetic Dick comes across to start, first stealing only a slurpee, then finding himself in weird situations while robbing other stores which includes helping an elderly woman to walk back to her car, and suddenly the excitement hits when the two of them rob a neon-lit shop once Dick explains they will get evicted the next day if they don't obtain the money.It is humorous to see the two act like regular people in the process of robbing, one example being when they order specific drinks at a coffee shop while robbing the place.The second half of the movie seems to go by really quickly, and we find the third act of the film to be more about getting back at McCallister than obtaining a large sum of money, which is a nice turn. When I first saw this film I assumed the couple would just run off with the $400 million McCallister had in his accounts, but Dick and Jane donating the money to the people who worked with Dick seemed a lot more fitting for the light comedy that it was.Though the film could have used more humor and its tone could have been more consistent, Fun With Dick and Jane is a delight to watch since it is a great underdog story that is very easy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enough of Dick and Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun with Dick and Jane is a remake of the 1977 film starring Jane Fonda and George Segal. After the failure of companies such as Enron in the new millennium this remake starring Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni was intended to be satire with Carrey's broad comedy.As a satire its passable with Alec Baldwin playing the Chief Executive who ransacks his corporation and leaves his employees in the dirt. As a comedy it does not really work and never raised a smile with me.Carrey's Dick is VP of Globodyne Corporation, he and his wife both have a good job, a BMW, a prestigious house and living the American dream with an upper class lifestyle. It all goes horribly wrong when his firm goes under.Dick cannot find another executive job and both have them to look for more menial jobs before having lost their savings and household appliances they are forced to commit robbery before Carrey decided to turn on his former boss.As a remake this does not hold a candle to the original. Leoni brings nothing to the table and its left to Carrey to keep the movie being watchable but the satire lacks edge, the comedy is weak and the movie is rather mundane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey Steals The Show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the 1977 American comedy film of the same name, 'Fun with Dick and Jane' is indeed some good fun! And Jim Carrey, Steals The Show with a towering act!'Fun with Dick and Jane' Synopsis: The day before Globodyne's stock tanks, a la Enron, and its pension fund evaporates, the corporation's CEO and CFO set up middle manager Dick Harper to be the public face of the disaster. Jobless, and with no savings, pension, or home equity, Dick and his wife Jane sink slowly into poverty. He looks for work (as do all former Globodyne executives); he even tries day labor with the relatives of their Mexican nanny. A foreclosure notice sends Dick and Jane over the edge into a life of blue-collar crime. Then, as things finally look up, the report of an looming indictment pushes Dick and Jane toward a denouement with the real criminals, the white-collar guys. 'Fun with Dick and Jane' is throughly entertaining &amp; engrossing. At 90-minutes, this 2005 Box-Office Hit, succeeds by arresting its viewer's attention. Its got humor as well as emotional moments, to lead the narrative. Judd Apatow &amp; Nicholas Stoller's Screenplay deserves brownie points. Dean Parisot's Direction is note-worthy. Cinematography is first-class. Editing is just right.Performance-Wise: Its Jim Carrey all the way. He triumphs with a towering act! He's the soul of the film. Téa Leoni supports Carrey, wonderfully. Alec Baldwin is nicely menacing, while Richard Jenkins is perfect, as always.On the whole, Go Have 'Fun with Dick and Jane'!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desperate Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey isn't at the top of my list of favourite actors. He's funny, but way too often he simply goes overboard and it seems as though he's trying to be too funny - with the end result being that he isn't funny, he's just irritating. When he keeps himself more in check, though (and actually acts, rather than trying too hard to be funny) he can put on a pretty good performance, and in "Fun With Dick and Jane" he manages to do that, teamed very effectively with Tea Leoni.What really makes this movie work is not so much the comedy (although it is quite funny at times) but the sympathy you feel for the characters, which - because of the economic troubles in the modern world - is probably even greater today than it was in 2005 when this movie was made. Dick is a corporate executive on the rise, who as the movie opens gets his big promotion to Vice President of a big company, only to be left stammering incoherently in a television interview when the company goes under while he's on the air. He and Jane find themselves in desperate circumstances, unable to find work, having to sell everything they own, finally faced with the foreclosure of their house. This was funny and somewhat sad all at the same time. You could laugh at what was happening on screen and at the same time really understand their plight, while at the same time hoping you never have to face what they're facing. Finally, with literally no other options, Dick and Jane take up robbing stores and banks to try to save their home. Everything worked very well up to that point in the movie.I didn't like the revenge angle, though. Eventually, this turned into Dick and Jane finding a way to make Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin) - who had been the president of the company Dick worked for - pay for his dishonesty. Somehow the movie lost its sense of fun with that, and the end result was a little too "feel-good," as their plot against McAllister worked perfectly and to the benefit not just of Dick and Jane, but of all the company's former employees. It was nice to see McAllister pay up, but to me it didn't really fit too well with what I was feeling about the movie up to that point.This is quite a fun ride for a little over an hour, then the remainder of the movie gets a bit bogged down with this plan directed against McAllister. What really makes this work, though, is that Dick and Jane are truly likable characters whose desperate circumstances you really do care about. They were fine performances from Carrey and Leoni.

		<shortDescription>Distracting Fun Not All On Key</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is a remake of the George Segal- Jane Fonda film from the 1970's, this is a different film. It does have some fun with Jim Carrey, but at the same time often gets distracted with some routines that are totally unrelated to the film, &amp; sometimes just absurd.Alec Balwin (easily the films greatest asset as Jack MacCallister) plays the CEO of a large corporation in the year 2000 who has systematically sold off all his stock over the past year as he knows the company is going to tank. Carrey (Dick Harper) &amp; Tea Leoni(Jane Harper) are an upper middle class couple who get their lives totally destroyed by Jack's company tanking.Surprisingly set in 2000, as it shows George W Bush making a campaign speech (I think) as Clinton would still be in office, there is a reference to the Gore Campaign as well in the film. The Harpers lose everything &amp; wind up stealing to try &amp; keep their expensive house. It takes a while for Dick Harvey to get into it, until Jane starts helping him.The original film is no classic, &amp; neither is this one. This film is for Carrey fans mostly as it will appeal most to them. It is nowhere near his best film, but there is plenty of him here. Not a film worth going overboard for &amp; it does get some play on television on G2 &amp; it is a movie that does not suck. It does not get everything right either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Jim Carrey movie that fits in with his other comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey has been known as being a comedy actor doing funny movies such as The Mask, Liar Liar, and Bruce Almighty. However, he is known for branching out and doing more serious work such as The Truman Show. Jim Carrey is back into the comedy as Dick in this hilarious movie. Written by Frat Pack writers Judd Apatow and Nicholas Stoller, they bring us the jokes that Jim Carrey can do so well. Carrey is as every bit funny in this as he is with his other comedies. Tea Leoni shows that she can do some more funny work after showing a serious side in Spanglish. Alec Baldwin and Richard Jenkins fit their roles really well. This is one worth watching for those who are fans of Jim Carrey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life With Dick and Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the reason why this film wasn't so well-received was because of its serious theme as people expected it to be an out-and-out comedy. However, I think it touches on some very relevant issues, especially today when the economy is at a recession where people are losing their jobs, their houses and slowly everything they own. But coming, back to the comedy element, there's plenty of that and a lot to laugh about so I still don't understand all the negativity towards this fun movie. For me the funniest sequence was the swollen mouth sequence. Carrey and Leoni are awesome together. They make a great comedic pair on screen. Richard Jenkins is terrific too and Alec Baldwin isn't bad either. I haven't watched the original version but I saw an interview of Jim Carrey where he mentions that the movie is more relevant today than it was in 1977. I couldn't agree more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had more fun watching this movie than I thought. I mean I saw so many * 1/2 and ** reviews that I didn't expect to like it. This is an entertaining movie and Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni have good chemistry. They play a couple with a good amount of money until they both lose their jobs. They start losing everything and will lose their house if they don't get some money quick. So they start robbing places and it adds some spice to their otherwise dull marriage. The movie isn't as funny as Jim Carrey comedies such as Liar Liar or Bruce Almighty but it does get some laughs. It's funny how they have a kid that their maid takes care of more than they do. Even when they rob they don't even act like they are doing it to support him. They barely even mention the poor little guy lol. Their Spanish maid takes care of him so much that he even talks more Spanish than English. The robbing scenes are silly and goofy and Carrey and Leoni handle those scenes well. This is anything but a solid comedy but it's a harmless and entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't watched the original, though I can imagine it being superior to this. Dean Parisot, however, I know to be talented... the man directed Galaxy Quest! ...and Home Fries... I guess he gets it right every so often. Jim probably had a lot of "goofing" pent up, that he needed to get out, after a couple of serious films. And Téa is a good, fitting choice to team him up with. They have some great moments, playing off each other. It's too bad that there's so much of this that just... misses the mark. Part of it is that they're both portraying normal people, and, well, it's mainly him... I'm sorry, your average Joe doesn't behave like that. While there are bits of the wackiness(that we're used to from him) that get laughs, and deservedly so, it still doesn't quite "work", because you can't see yourself doing what they do. He's not playing a weirdo, and he's not affected by some form of supernatural intervention, so... I don't know. The plot is fine, and there are unexpected developments. Humor varies, and at least one running gag has them going to the well too many times. The acting is mixed, though there are shining spots here and there(the kid's utterly atrocious, even compared to other child performers). This does hold funny instances, and there are a few memorable sequences. For being about an actual and important problem, this is perhaps overly light. There is a little strong language, sexual jokes and drug references. The DVD comes with an entertaining and informative audio commentary track, deleted scenes, trailers and interviews with the two leads. I recommend this to big fans of Carrey. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carry Fans Come Hither</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Get ready Jim Carrey fans because this is Jim on 120% speed. There is no point in detailing the Carrey gags as they are all here and Carrey fans will know what they are and what to expect. The movie uses a metaphor from the recent Enron company tragedy to tell the story of Dick Harper (Carrey) who is the unwitting fall PR guy who happens to get a promotion just as the company is going down the tubes. Once poor, Dick and Jane spiral out of control until they turn to criminal behavior to try and keep their family together. Enter Jim Carrey to carry off this sad premise with absolute farce. He does what he does best from site gags to site gags and the movie is full of them. The surprise of the film is Tea Leoni. Of course there is no way she can match Carry's manic performance and so all Leoni can do as the character of Jane is to hold on with both hands for the ride. This she does with grace and ease. She is wildly funny in the movie and has more than a few good laughs. As with most of Carry's running mile a minute comedies, this one isn't going to garner any awards or for that matter great praise. One thing is does do though is give Carry fans another chance to see their hero in action. That's who this film is aimed at and who it will attract. Lots of effort is put forth but the movie just could have been better. **/****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun with Dick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, "Fun with Dick and Jane" is a misleading title. The only fun here is with Carrey. Not only is Leoni's performance lackluster, but as is almost everyone else's around the shining beacon that is Jim. Tea is the main culprit here though, as I just find every role of hers is the same. She seems like she cannot escape one character, which is just irritating and unattractive. Carrey is the only one who manages to carry this film, but he does it well. Maybe there is the bias that I am a big JC fan, but I truly think he struck again in this film, producing a different, unique role blended with his original, wacky humor that so many love.The plot is substantial, the script average and the music generic. If not for Carrey, this film would have done a lot worse. Baldwin is probably the only other reasonably funny role. Yes there are laughs and there is fun, but only on Dick's behalf. Everything else seems so average, cliché and something we've seen before. If your a Carrey fan, you still don't want to miss this, as Jim does shine, or at least sparkle and he makes it definitely worth the watch, but maybe only once. I recommend this to any JC fan as it will add to his many great performances or anyone for light entertainment and occasional laughs.6.5/10 Hamish Kearvell A.K.A Screaming Japan Productions - www.myspace.com/screamingjapanproductions</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey fan or not, you'll enjoy this comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie recently and found it to be very comical. I despise people who are over-critical of comedies, and look too much into certain flaws in plots or anything else along those lines. This movie is, no matter what anyone else says, a COMEDY. I laughed throughout this movie and feel no guilt in saying that it was adequately made. The plot kept me interested, and I wanted to keep watching. Some things were slightly difficult to follow at times, but for the most part, I enjoyed the story. Jim is employed at a major company that ends up pulling a scandal similar to Enron, and therefore is forced to find alternative methods to bring in money. Jim added his comical touch to the film, only making it better. I saw the movie about a month after it had been out and there were still about 20 people in the theater. And, I might add, every single person was laughing throughout the movie. The movie really doesn't contain any obscene scenes that I can remember, and is actually fairly clean cut, except for maybe some foul language here and there. Even that wasn't too bad though. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a comedy, even if you're not necessarily a Jim Carrey fan, because it certainly fulfills it's title as a comedy genre movie. I look forward to watching this movie again when it comes out on DVD, and will most likely end up buying it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Remake Does Not Live To Its Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun with Dick and Jane is a remake of the 1977 comedy of the same title. It stars Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni as Dick and Jane Harper, an upper- middle-class couple who resort to robbery after the company for which Dick works goes bankrupt. Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins, Angie Harmon, John Michael Higgins, Richard Burgi, Carlos Jacott, Gloria Garayua and Stephnie Weir also star in supporting roles.It was written by Judd Apatow and directed by Dean Parisot.Dick Harper and his wife, Jane, would seem to have it made considering that Dick has a high-paying job, they live in an expensive house in the suburbs, they have two luxury cars in the driveway, and a housekeeper, Blanca to help look after their son, Billy. But Dick and Jane's fairy- tale life crashes head-on into reality when the firm Dick works for turns out to have been using unscrupulous accounting methods to disguise the fact they've been losing money hand over fist, and he has been made the fall guy for some of their dirty dealings. Suddenly flat broke, they must find a new way to support their lavish lifestyle, and in time they resort to criminal activities.Remakes are always a gamble, so it's a pleasant surprise that the movie pays off with unexpected dividends. It's as entertaining as the original starring George Segal and Jane Fonda, and the teaming of Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni makes this a safe bet for comedy fans.But the slapstick screenplay fails to achieve its fullest potential.It starts off silly, soon becomes funny and then skyrockets into irrepressible hilarity.But unfortunately,it does not sustain a consistent tone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's interesting to see Jim Carrey doing works different from his usual ones; okay, maybe this isn't THAT different from them, but at least he doesn't sound like a goofy retard anymore. In this short flick, Carrey's character is a desperated man robbing and cheating everyone around because his company broke and he's totally out of money. For a comedy movie, I believe there are too few funny moments, but at least they don't try to hard and fail like many of Carrey's comedies do. The plot itself isn't too elaborated or developed; the story is told in an entertaining way so the spectator doesn't have time to get sick, tired or lost in the story. Agree with me or not, but I liked this film better than "The Truman Show"-- and I must say I'm ready to be offended and receive thousand of negatives reactions to this opinion of mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"When Dick Harper (Jim Carrey) is terminated as Globodyne Corporation's VP of Communications, he assures his wife, Jane (Téa Leoni), he'll find another job in no time. Months later, their lawn is repossessed, Jane has sold her body to science, and Dick's career as a day laborer ends with his deportation to Mexico. Madder than ever and not going to take it anymore, Dick and Jane turn to the fastest-growing sector in the white-collar job market - armed robbery - as they become upscale suburban Robin Hoods, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor? namely themselves," according to the Columbia Pictures synopsis.This re-make of the 1977 film starring George Segal and Jane Fonda is surprisingly toned down. The original wasn't a classic - but it was pleasant and somewhat daring, with "politically incorrect" humor and a subversive subtext. Here, the latter is no longer subversive; the former is tamed. If you've seen both films, compare the leading man's botched robbery scene. They've altered Mr. Segal's struggle with the gun in his pants to Mr. Carrey's struggle with his hood - resulting in no "condom scene". And, nothing equals Ms. Fonda's trendy "toilet scene". We should have had more "Fun with Dick and Jane" than this trifle.**** Fun with Dick and Jane (12/21/05) Dean Parisot ~ Jim Carrey, Tea Leoni, Richard Jenkins, Alec Baldwin</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I decided to watch Fun with Dick and Jane on TV (10/25/09) and I found it to be very entertaining and quite funny. I've read many reviews of this movie. Some bad/some good but I agree with the good reviews. This movie is great. It starts off as a comedy in the first half then switch's to an action/crime film. Jim Carrey is great and funny in this film. They start off rich and wealthy then suddenly Dick loses his job, Jane quits hers because of Dick's words then they become poor and start losing their house piece by piece. Then they find ways to get if back by robing banks and convenient stores and they succeed. Then in the end, its like how it starts, they're rich and wealthy again and living free and happy.Dick get revenge on McCalister. There were many funny scenes like all the scenes when the rob banks/stores/markets while having on funny disguises. One of my favourite scenes are when Dick tries to rob the hasty market and he couldn't pull his gun out in time, so he basically ends up not paying for a slushy. As the movie went on, they became better at robing and it became more funnier. I like the scene towards the end when Dick and Jane find a way to get a paper from McCalister. It starts weir then gets better, they succeed and it is funny This is a great light comedy for the whole family to enjoy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really did like Jim Carrey's Fun with Dick and Jane a couple of years ago. There were tons of hilarious moments in it. I'm not saying that Fun with Dick and Jane is Carrey's best film or performance, but I liked this film a lot. The film has a great cast including: Tea Leoni(Jurassic Park III, Ghost Town) Alec Baldwin(You know who Alec Baldwin is) Richard Jenkins(The Visitor) I like most of those people. Besides Alec Baldwin, who I don't like as much after that thing with his daughter. I don't hate him, but I don't quite like him. I prefer other people, but I do like him on his show 30 Rock. Fun with Dick and Jane is a really funny film, showing that other people can be funny, Like Tea Leoni. Fun with Dick and Jane is a good film and I think you should see it.The Plot: Dick Harper has just become the V.P. of communications at his work. It all goes downhill when he goes on a news show and destroys the company. Causing him and everyone that works there to lose their job.

		<shortDescription>Destined to be a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is relevant now more so then it was intended to poke fun at the Enron scandal. Carrey is in tip-top comedic form as Dick Harper, your average upwardly mobile suburbanite who has the picture perfect life that keeps getting better until it completely implodes, and not by his doing. Don't expect over the top slapstick silliness as with "Dumb and Dumber", this is more painfully humorous and a look into life's tribulations that many could be going through today. You can't help but laugh out loud at the steps Carrey and Leoni take to survive their dilemma while attempting to maintain their lifestyle. This movie gives serious props to comedy classics as "The Out of Towners" and "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House". Whatever can go wrong will. Since it's a comedy, there's really no point in dissecting the acting skills. Téa Leoni's casting for the part of Jane Harper couldn't have been more spot on. She's smart, sexy in a yuppie kind of way and can deliver the humor as confidently as Carrey. Alec Baldwin, as Jack McCallister, plays the perfect sleaze bag corporate CEO who's more interested in keeping as much for himself while flushing his naive and trustworthy employees down the toilet. Proclaiming only the strong survive while boarding his private helicopter and leaving Dick with a "deer in the headlights" look on his his face, it's hauntingly ironic a towering adjacent office building in the background clearly displays a large Bank of America logo. Paid advertising or just coincidence? I'm certain they'd come forward with an army of lawyers to have it removed if this was a new release. Fast forward to today and the correlation to AIG and Bernie Madoff is nearly uncanny. Frank Bascombe, played by Richard Jenkins, who's one of the only people in upper management with a conscience supplies Dick with the details of what's really going on when all hell breaks loose, and this insider information forms the catalyst of revenge for Dick.I have watched this movie at least 10 times since its release on DVD, and every time I find myself enjoying it more. That's a rare quality for a comedy in this day and age. The pace and humor is wonderfully timed, as well as the intentional cliché of characters that are now more real to life then ever. I've recommended this movie to non-Carrey fans with overall positive reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you thought he was good in Bruce Almighty,just wait until you see this movie. Another great movie from the A-list comedy genius Jim Carrey who plays Dick Harper who is employed by a company named Globodyne(an obvious crack at energy company,Enron) which is owned by Jack McCallister(Alec Baldwin).His wife,Jane(Tea Leoni) also suffers from financial difficulties.This movie was better and funnier by watching it at home rather than the cinemas.When I watched it at the cinemas,I would have given it a 7 out of 10(average) but when I watched it at home,I realised it was funnier and I decided to give it a 10 out of ten(excellent).Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take the money and run: The 'Fun' does live up to its title.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Modestly funny caper comedy with Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni. It's hard to make a fully effective comedy nowadays. I know that. I mean, how many movies can you see on the screen that, when it's over, leaves audiences totally having their sides hurt badly? Not much, I'm afraid. And to these facts, shallow comedy efforts like FUN WITH DICK AND JANE is enough to satisfy my viewing time. It's not a bag full-'o-giggles, but Dick and Jane (along with director Dean Parisot) manages to provide the fun promised in the title.Meet Dick (Carrey). He has a good job. He works at Globodyne Industries and nears his promotion. And meet Jane (Tea Leoni), she also has a good job and proud of Dick's promotion. So happy, she quit her job. The all live the happy life, until Globodyne industries go bankrupt and life goes downhill. Out of money and almost out of their heads (You would too if you were kicked out on almost every job in the state), the couple is forced to rob banks (and bakeries and groceries). In begins a series of bizarre disguises and hilarious behavior (a must for every Jim Carrey film) as the two rob banks unlike any robbers you have every seen.The film is a remake of the 1977 comedy of the same title, starring George Segal and Jane Fonda. I haven't seen that film yet, but I did see this one, and reviewing it as a stand-alone effort, I think it was pretty decent. The laughs (thanks mainly to Carrey and spunky Leoni) come in fast, although not all of them work as well as the others. Still, if the director (Parisot) wanted to give us an update of an old-fashioned comedy, he did succeed in making a kinder and more humble effort for a comedy.While other comedies this millennium have become totally crazy, in other words silly and some even laugh-free, comedies like FUN WITH DICK AND JANE are always welcome to me, who is very tired on the same old (bad) gags on tired comedy flicks. It's like watching a clown forming the same balloon animals on different parties. And like the parents who should hire new clowns, producers should hire new people who need to breathe new life on Hollywood comedies.Rating: *** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a response to: I have seen this in theater and I was laughing my ass off and I just seen it again on DVD it's even funnier w/the bonus features especially the deleted scene of Toy Store that was hilarious! As far as the story goes, I really don't care if it's a remake but the team really did a good job making the movie. You said two contradictory and quite opposite critic: you wished they tell the story like it is without worry about but in the end you said it was gross and politically incorrect?? It is fiction, and it is comedy! You can make fun of comedy.. And how about those action--killing people business? Aren't they messed up morality/ sending wrong message? At least this one have some kind of good morale: is to bring back to community/ justice for all. It is wrong to steal/ do criminal, but can't satisfy everybody..Bottom line I truly think this movie is one of the funniest most freshest movie i've seen in god knows how long.... it's hard to find quality comedy like this nowadays.. usually just typically about sex teenager(boys&amp;girls), college life stuff like that.. People should working on more plot in their comedy.. 9 stars! wait i seriously think it's almost-perfect so I'll just give it a 10!! =D</fullReview>

You can't just take Jim Carrey and have him do some funny faces. It just don't work. It almost appears as if they created the movie around Jim Carrey... "Hey Bill, let's make a funny movie with this Carrey Guy again, he's so funny!" Must have been something like that. What makes it worse: you could easily tell that there's no real story because of all the way to different parts of it.

		<shortDescription>as dumbed down as the characters in the title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About the only memories I retain of the original "Fun With Dick and Jane" (which I saw when it was released in 1977) are the grass-reclamation scene and Jane Fonda sitting on the toilet doing her business while she and hubby George Segal discussed what next to do with their lives. Well, I'm here to report that, while the sod-recalling scene managed to find its way into the remake, the chat on the can did not. Under normal circumstances, I would hail that as a triumph for shrewd editorial judgment and good taste, but in this case at least, a bit of cheap potty humor might have gone a long way towards elevating the comic level of this current film.Dick and Jane Harper are an upwardly mobile couple who fall on hard times when Jane quits her job and Dick loses his when the company he works for goes under due to a corporate scandal. After trying to make ends meet as best they can, but being thwarted at every turn, Dick and Jane decide to turn to a life of crime, holding up convenience stores and coffee shops like a modern day version of Bonnie and Clyde. Eventually, however, they realize that they are aiming too low in their targets, so decide it's time to turn the tables on the CEO (Alec Baldwin) responsible for their woes and come up with an elaborate plan to hit the Big Boy of Business where it will do the most good.What with the Ken Lay/Enron scandal still fresh in our minds, the time would certainly seem ripe for some bright satirist to take on the subject of greedy CEOs and general corporate malfeasance as fodder for ridicule. But "Fun With Dick and Jane" is certainly not that movie. Instead of finely-honed wit and sophistication, the screenplay (credited to no fewer than FIVE writers!) gives us inane slapstick routines that cater to the lowest common denominator audience imaginable. Perhaps, if this hadn't been fashioned to be a starring vehicle for Jim Carrey, the film might have been able to provide more in the way of humor than some cheap mugging and endless mindless pratfalls. Carrey has rarely been more annoying than he is here, and even the normally appealing Tea Leoni is at a loss as to how to make this hopeless material work. In short, this is a dreadful, drearily unfunny travesty that makes the original "Fun With Dick and Jane" look like "Dr. Strangelove" in comparison.I never thought I'd miss that toilet scene so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a man who got promoted but lost his job soon afterward because of a financial scandal. The film focuses on how he struggled to provide for his wife and son.I found this film rather boring. The film really dragged on despite being only 90 minutes long. Many of the scenes were redundant and would not have affected the story at all if they were completely cut out. There were far too many scenes that were meant to be funny and were not. I got rather fed up watching Jim Carrey doing funny faces and strange movements for almost half the film. The final scenes in the big financial institution (I won't say which) were the only scenes that were truly entertaining.If you have nothing else to do, it is OK to watch. Don't expect too much though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are so bad they're good. This is not one of those movies, it's just bad.Too many of the scenes that were funny are in the preview. What wasn't in the preview mostly wasn't very funny and seemed pointless. The preview showed a lot of scenes with them robbing places, but that was actually a fairly small part of the movie. The first 1/2 is about Jim being an annoying butt-kisser, losing his job and being desperate; there's a few scenes of them robbing places; and then the last third turns into a mediocre con plot that doesn't even make sense.Also, I had trouble empathizing with the main characters because they were so unlikable. They make so many bad choices financially etc. that it seems like they made their own bed, so when they avoided lying in it by turning to crime I didn't feel like they were justified.Not the worst movie I've ever seen but there are a lot of better movies to spend your time on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In one of the many remakes to come out this year, Fun With Dick and Jane certainly isn't the best (King Kong), nor the worst (The Amityville Horror), it just is.Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni star as Dick and Jane Harper, two upper middle class working stiffs who think they have they're big break when Dick gets promoted to a VP position at his company, leading to Jane quitting her job as a travel agent. Joke's on them when they find out that Dick's company just went under in glorious Enron-esquire fashion. In order to keep their house, they sell everything they have, take any available job, and then resort to stealing. Then the opportunity arises to get back at the President of the company (Alec Baldwin) and steal millions of dollars from him.In standard Jim Carrey fashion, hilarity ensues, in a broad physical manner. What I liked about his performance was that it showed he had really grown up. His first few movies showed a very sophomoric sense of humour. Then he went four for four in drama, and a disappointing comedic return with Bruce Almighty, where it seemed more like a person doing a bad Jim Carrey impression, rather than actually Jim Carrey. But this movie marks his return to comedy, in my book, and it shows that the time spent doing dramas really rubbed off on him, and shows off a matured comedic ear. Big kudos to him.Tea Leoni is falling victim to being the go-to comedic yuppie mom. Alec Baldwin plays his second "Head of Failing Company" character of the year, and lampoons George W. Bush the whole way through.The writing was standard, which is disappointing as this was Judd Apatow's follow up to The 40 Year Old Virgin, though he was working sans Steve Carrell. Every joke was predictable, the story was your usual offering. It was almost below his talents, Jim Carrey's too.I wasn't expecting anything spectacular with the direction, and my expectations were met. There was nothing spectacular about it. It was a standard comedic offering. Since when has a director broken new ground with standard comedic fare? Never, really. Standard seems to be the key word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obvious spoof of Enron-type corporate greed, comes across as a bit too slapstick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie. I like Jim Carrey in most of his roles, but my favorites are his 'serious' roles in movies like 'Truman', 'Eternal Sunshine', and 'The Majestic', although I hold his role in 'Dumb and Dumber' as one of my favorites of any movie. I also like Tea Leoni, she has a real gift for creating roles, either serious or comedic and here hers is my favorite in this movie. Alec Baldwin seems to have defined himself as a 'heavy' and does justice to his role here.Here's the premise. Dick Harper (Carrey) is very successful and as the movie begins appears he is headed for a big promotion. He is so taken with the prospects of wealth that he convinces his wife, Jane (Leoni), to quite her job and spend more time at home, being a mom of a young boy. But everything turns upside down when his company does an 'Enron' with the stock going to worthless and everyone losing their jobs. The CEO, Jack (Baldwin) has apparently cashed out, selling all his stock right before the crash, which was motivated by news that he had sold out and profit projections were shams. (Timely, as just a couple of weeks ago right here in Houston Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling, former Enron CEOs, were convicted and are headed to prison.)There are lots of good laughs, but Carrey has a tendency to go too far over the top at times. Leoni is always just right in her acting. While enjoyable as a light comedy, it could have been even better. The end credits thank Enron and other failed companies, a nice touch!SPOILERS. Unemployed and getting poorer each day, selling everything they own, getting the new sod repossessed from the lawn, and no jobs to be had, Dick and Jane resort to stealing. Each heist, their technique improves, until they almost get caught while doing a bank, and Dick's former coworker comes in to steal at the same time. Finding that crooked Jack is planning to transfer his $400Million to a foreign bank for safe keeping, they figure out an elaborate scheme to have his money wired instead to a newly created fund to give money back to all those former employees who lost everything in the company's collapse, leaving Jack with nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slapstick with Dick and Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1970s was a time of making movies about the antihero, the person who breaks the law with the purpose of sticking it to the man and wins. Fun with Dick and Jane is a favourite movie of mine, and I felt a little worried about the idea of a remake.I am in 2 minds about the new version which sees Dick losing his job from Globydyne and company which now one really knows what it does, and whose collapse is based on such examples as Enron and World.com.This update is intelligent and far better researched than the 1970s version. In fact the structure of the story is superior to the 1970s version in many ways, and I would consider it to be very intelligent.When Dick and Jane turn to crime, while living in a rich house, it actually makes sense. They are not greedy, the simply have no choice, the loan for their house now exceeds the value of their property.Eventually they turn to the big one, taking revenge on their boss with the purpose of also getting rich.This forms a basis for Jim Carrey to be Jim Carrey. This wonderful slap stick element is in fact quite funny, it also reduces Dick and Jane to being too cute and nicey nice. Which is lovely in one sense, but out of place with the intelligence of the rest of the movie.All in all, lots of good stuff, unless you really hate Jim Carrey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dick (Carrey) and Jane (Leoni) and a married couple doing pretty well. Things start looking even better when Dick gets his long sought promotion, until it turns out he's just being made the face of a major corporation disaster. Pretty soon Dick and 6,000 employees are out on the streets looking for work. Seeing as there's not much work going in the small town, people start getting pretty desperate, taking crummy jobs or turning to crime.After a string of kicks in the guts Dick sees no way out other than to turn to minor armed robberies. Pretty son Dick and Jane are back on their feet and have to decide whether they'll keep up the crime or return to living honestly.Not brilliant, but held together by a few great scenes (see "Dick's first job interview", "Dick's ride to the boss's office" and "the robot robbery" for examples). Also a great cameo from that guy who played the Pool Cleaner in that great "Seinfeld" episode.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a poor movie partially rescued by spirited performances from Jim Carrey (Dick), Tea Leoni(Jane) and Alec Baldwin. It's a remake of a mediocre 1977 movie with Jane Fonda and George Segal. Dick is a VP of communications and corporate front man who enjoys the good life in the suburbs. He has everything: nice house, beautiful wife, BMW and a Mexican maid. They even find time for sex on Saturdays. Like Enron and Worldcom, Dick's company implodes amid financial scandal and he becomes a fall guy. The CEO (Baldwin) makes off with $400 million while pleading poverty. Dick can't find another job, so he and Jane take to armed robbery to pay the bills. We learn that the suburbs are inhabited by petty, competitive clones with a deluded sense of their own importance. The movie sneers at their pretensions. Leoni is an underrated actress and comedienne but she is wasted here. Jim Carrey is a matter of taste. The director, Dean Parisot also directed Bakersfield P.D., Northern Exposure and the movie Galaxy Quest.Dick and Jane are just too nice, naive and dim for the story to hang together and the jokes are too weak to carry the movie. This is a feeble excuse for a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jane (Leoni) quits her job after Dick (Carrey) gets his promotion; then Dick loses his big executive job with an Enron like company and is considered a scapegoat for the accounting practices. With the prospect of losing everything they turn to a life of crime.Tedious, boring, unfunny, and overacting by Carrey (duh? What else is new?) are just a few of the descriptions one can employ regarding this mess. What does it take for Carrey to stop acting like Fireman Bill (his character in the TV show In Living Color) in every so-called comedy he appears? Here he is a one-man show with Tea Leoni left to gather her credulity any way she can. She is no match for this one-man show. What she was allowed to do, however, was good. Can't blame her. She does have a good sense of timing unlike Carrey who needs to go back and watch the old masters of comedy until he gets it right. The man is just not funny?.at least not to me. He is the same one-trick pony over and over again. Yes, what does it take? However, he is good in dramatic roles. The director must have seen the mess this was turning into and decided in the last 15-minutes to make amends. The last 15-minutes were very good by all concerned. I had to ask myself, why couldn't this have been maintained from the beginning. There was enough material here to keep everyone in stitches for a long time. Why indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun with Dick and Jane, a remake of a 1977 comedy starring George Segal and Jane Fonda and whose title comes from a popular children's book of the time, is uneven and underwhelming, although it does feature some amusing performances by the current leads, Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni.Dick (Carrey) is excited because he's finally gotten a huge promotion at the gigantic conglomerate at which he works, so he encourages wife Jane (Leoni) to quit her job as a travel agent. And then the big company is sunk by unethical behavior on the part of its CEO (Alec Baldwin), and suddenly the Harpers are without jobs, money, or prospects. Desperate, Dick decides to turn to a life of crime - and, as it turns out, they're pretty good at it! When the duo runs into the former financial officer of Dick's old company (Richard Jenkins) they decide to try to get back the money that the CEO had swiped (i.e., the pensions of all of the lower-level employees). A scheme is hatched, and madcap hilarity ensues.About 45 minutes elapse before the Harpers begin to rob businesses, which is about 35 minutes too long, in my opinion. I mean, the premise of the movie is that they have to become criminals in order to survive, so why waste half the film leading up to it? On the other hand, maybe there's only so much one can watch of the Harpers robbing Starbucks and head shops before one's head explodes.The laughs are generally scattershot. Carrey comes off best, because he's always excelled in playing manic, exuberantly broad characters. He's well cast, and so is Leoni as his equally flighty-funny wife. Because the actors are such good fits for the roles, the movie's not altogether unentertaining; they do much more for the movie than it does for them. Adding able support is Baldwin as the heavy and Jenkins as the disgraced CFO, now a lush. An interesting running gag has the Harpers' son speaking with a Spanish accent (and occasionally in Spanish), thanks largely to his being raised by their Spanish-speaking nanny.Dick and Jane is amiable enough, but it's not as consistently funny as it should have been.</fullReview>

If this movie was just a comedy, it would have been brilliant, but when you bring in a serious undercurrent, you're thrown back. there are a lot of things i wish this movie would have done.

		<shortDescription>Unfun with Dick and Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I am a Jim Carrey fan. Jim Carrey is probably second only to the great Buster Keaton in his ability to use his body to express comedy, and his considerable physical talents are seen here with dancing, pratfalls and his trademark rubber face but somehow they just don't elicit a laugh in this film. This is the fault of the director and the editor who don't capture what he is doing. This movie is not good, a combination of a poor screenplay and incompetent directing. Directing a comedy requires that the director understand timing and this director does not. Some scenes are shot from too far away when they should be closeups and the editing of the film is absolutely incompetent. Tea Leoni is terrible and does not seem to have any clue how to play opposite Carrey. She seems to be sleepwalking through the film. There are ample opportunities for laughter in the film such as the failed string of attempted robberies the couple tries to pull off wearing various costumes but the scenes just aren't funny, once again the fault of the director. The attempts at satire fall flat also. I dislike the director so much that I will watch out for his films in the future and avoid them like the plague.This could have been perfect material for Jim Carrey but Dick and Jane is not fun at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrey's back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a new version of an old film and a big smile on his face, Jim Carrey is back; and it is great. Carrey produced the film, because he found that kind of role that fits him perfectly. Unfortunately, his second intent as a producer didn't end up in a very good movie like "Bruce Almighty", but ended up in showing the man at his best and giving a lot of laughs."Fun with Dick and Jane" is the name. The movie starts off with smiley Dick (Carrey) going to work, kind of like when Truman Burbank woke up in that masterpiece "The Truman Show". He says goodbye to his wife Jane (Téa Leoni), another very happy person, and his son Danny who spends a lot of time with the Latin maid and practically speaks Spanish.Dick works in a communications company and he is going to be promoted. As he goes up the elevator to meet his boss, he starts singing "I believe I can fly" as he dances and we are grateful for the existence of Jim Carrey. He arrives to the 51st floor, where Jack McCallister has just left, so he talks with Frank Boscombe (Richard Jenkins), the company's vice-president.McCallister is played by Alec Baldwin, who earned an Oscar nomination for "The Cooler" three years ago but now seems to be working for fun. "Along Came Polly"? "The cat in the hat"? Appearances in "Las Vegas"? It sounds amusing, and it's easy when you always put the same voice and basically don't talk. That Baldwin I'm talking about is the one that has fun with Dick and Jane here.The movie, directed by Dean Parisot ("Galaxy Quest") and written by the growing comedian Judd Apatow and Nicholas Stoller presents, I assume, an updated vision of what the original (which I didn't see) had in mind. The screenplay clearly makes fun of the enterprises and companies and its employees, helped by the direction that ridicules the characters most of the time.What's probably the only good thing about the film (besides some performances) is that it knows it's not taking things seriously, and it fools around; once the viewer understands that, he can enjoy. Enjoy the happiness of Dick when he leaves a store without paying a soda; or Jane's admiration when Dick plants a garden made of stolen plants for her.Jim Carrey, last seen by me in a performance that should have gotten him an Oscar nomination, made me realize that the last time I had laughed this hard was while watching "Bruce Almighty". The man is one of my favorite actors, in comedy and in drama; and he causes that effect on me. Several lines are worth waiting for, like: "Oh my god, this lady has just fainted". You'll see.Téa Leoni, fresh from "Spanglish", achieves another solid comedic performance that doesn't excel but respects its limits. Richard Jenkins is the other revelation. He probably wasn't drunk onset as Billy Bob Thornton decided to be in "Bad Santa", but he seemed pretty ruined. You should catch the man in "The Mudge Boy" to appreciate his range. Meanwhile, I'm expecting better from Carrey next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Craptacular remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do yourself a favor. If you're thinking of seeing this, stop. Or see the original with Fonda and Segal - it's a lot better and has some truly unexpected laughs. This remake is quite possibly the worst Jim Carrey movie ever. Wait, that's not a strong enough statement. If I had paid three dollars to see it in a theater I'd feel ripped off, unless my three dollars also included a couple shots of liquor. And I can think of a lot of other things I'd rather do after a couple shots of liquor. Jim Carrey is not capable of redeeming this movie, and that's not a statement about Jim Carrey. Sometimes humor works, sometimes it doesn't. The original FWDAJ movie had some truly great laughs at unexpected times. This was one of those where you just keep waiting for something to redeem the movie, with your eyes glazed over until the credits. Then you realize you've just wasted a couple hours of your life. You didn't laugh much, you didn't cry, you know nothing you didn't know before. But your brain is dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Jim Carrey. He's very funny. All of his movies are funny, especially The Mask and Bruce Almighty. Spoiler Alert! Spoiler Alert! I took my two kids (9 &amp; 14) to see this and I felt it gave them the wrong message that crime does pay. Both kids mentioned to me that the main characters got rich and they didn't have to pay. Maybe it would have been better that Dick and Jane went to jail at the end even with their boss being set up as a hero. My husband felt that Dick and Jane were criminals and those people that were robbed were hurt. Business owners struggle for survival and robberies can hurt owners just the same way Dick and Jane were hurt. Also they give no thought to the danger of the robberies where their kid might lose his parents to jail or worse. My husband liked it otherwise but was no match for other Jim Carrey movies which were truly hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the worst Jim Carrey movie ever. It has no script, it's too short and it feels like Jim is making a big effort to make you laugh. He looks kinda' pathetic. I don't know what else to say. It's too bad to be commented. I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey, but still...I had the feeling that they've made this movie just to give Jim a job. They've tried to remind us how funny he used to be, but they failed !Tea Leoni is also a wreck. I taught maybe i wasn't in the mood for this movie, but then i realized there is no mood for it. Big disappointment ! I hope Jim is going to come back and make us laugh again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie yesterday in cinema and i had a very quit evening, and that is not to good for a comedy because almost nobody laughed of the jokes made in this movie. I have to agree with other commentators on this, you might wan't to rent it for a kids birthday party but you don't wan't to see this so called comedy in cinema. The story runs from one unfunny episode in another all carried out by our big friend Jim Carrey. I am not a anti Carrey fan, i liked Bruce Almighty, but i have to say i am quit disappointed in this one. I hope his next movies are fun again because this on wasn't. Or maybe it's time for a new and fresh comedy with Joey in the main role. I made the mistake not watching IMDb before watching this movie, a mistake i won't make again because then i would not have wasted my euro's on this waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmmm.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in to this film with high hopes, intrigued by what had potential to be an interesting and funny movie. However, leaving the cinema I was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons.Firstly, the film doesn't seem to have enough plot to fully fill the time it takes. It seems to me like three quarters of an hour of plot have been stretched over a much longer time and it made me wonder when the story was going to start moving. The plot line is very basic and very predictable, which is a huge disappointment because it had the strength to go much further. Also, I won't tell you the ending but I personally found it an extremely poor ending that left me feeling confused. In certain films the ending used could be brilliant but here it just wasn't pulled off. Soo basically, the film is sparsely plotted with a huge anti climax of an ending. It is a very predictable movie with most jokes being unoriginal, Jim Carrey clichés.There are certain saving graces from which this film earns it's five point and those are a good soundtrack (any film with 'What I got' by Sublime is worth a few point in my books) and although they are few and far between,this film has its moments - Carreys performance of 'I believe I can fly' and the trying to kiss with badly bruised faces bit to name two.So on the whole this is a very watchable film but it is weakly plotted and let down further by an even weaker ending. If you like Carrey a lot your sure to enjoy it but don't expect a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel that the film was overall, a reasonable effort but not however, altogether great. I feel the acting from Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni, create a good chemistry and atmosphere and was at times funny, however the acting was average, not great.The plot itself- was quite unrealistic and handed I felt quite badly, for what the plot and storyline actually was, it could have been much funnier and more humorous however it wasn't and in parts it was actually quite dull and boring yet in other parts lightly humorous.The Genre- Was comedy, and for comedy, the one liners and situations were quite good but could have been better, I feel. Good funny though.I feel that overall, despite being boring in parts and the acting being average, the plot could have been better and could have hit its genre better with more comedy and funny situations. Overall, I give this 4 for being lightly entertaining and a reasonable effort at a film. Nowhere near as good as expected however.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As It Should Have Been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there any fun with Dick and Jane ? Well there is some to be had but it's very patchy the movie opens well commenting on his rise through the company and the couples materialistic life style. But then it begins pull it's punches and not going for the easy target of corporate living and control but descending into some muddled slapstick. There is a good movie here but the makers were just not brave enough as the issues are never really resolved like their son speaking Spannish better than English due to being brought up by the maid as they have so little time for parenting. There are competent performances all round but no one really stands out and I was quite disappointed with Alec Baldwin he didn't seem to have the free reign to go wild like in Glengarry Glenn Ross or even Along Came Polly which was a shame.Overall pretty good, nothing great but a good alternative to the current Oscar hopeful films crowding out the cinema screens. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello Moviegoers, Fun with Dick and Jane - was not fun. It does have six laugh out loud jokes. But waddaya call a comedy with six laughs in ninety minutes, badum bum, a bore. I really wanted to see Breakfast on Pluto at the Palm but couldn't squeeze the 9:15 showtime into my schedule and Marsha wants to see the Producers together so I had to bite the bullet and watch Fun with Dick and Jane just to have fodder for this review.Well I did enjoy the six jokes, I'll say that for it. I like Jim Carrey, I thought Liar Liar was excellent and I've enjoyed many of his other movies. And Tea' Leoni, I've loved since Naked Truth, her erstwhile TV show, I'm totally jealous of David Duchovny.But this movie, Fun with Dick and Jane, okay it's not as bad as Ishtar, the gold standard of bad movies, but it's bad. No fun with Dick or Jane. Run away Run away.This is K PIGThis is KYNS</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of the movie starts off being the image of a "perfect" family and all is well until the company Dick works for falls through and Jane quits her job. They then live off their money whilst dick tries to find a job. They run out of money and from then on the movie is long, boring and incredibly dull. I sat in the cinema wondering if it was rude to walk out half way through. There are some funny parts to the movie but they aren't nearly enough to make up for how boring it was. If you are a Jim Carrey fan like me (I love Ace Ventura especially) then I think that you may be disappointed by this movie because i certainly was. The Trailer makes the movie seem much more interesting than it actually is. Fun with Dick and Jane was at the top of my must see movies but now i wish i hadn't wasted my money on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to Jim Carrey!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey used to play roles that make use of his extremely gifted talent but in this movie it looks like he probably was forced to make the movie cause he owned the director some money and is just going through the process. Coming off the "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events" as Count Olaf, in which he carried the whole movie, we get Dick Harper which looks like its played by his untalented twin brother (like Eddie Murphy's char in bowfinger). If not for the most beautiful actress comedic actress, tea leoni, the movies simply falls flat. Also the crime spree did not even begin until after 1/2 way through the movie and that only lasted for a while, which is unfortunate cause that was the only funny parts of the movie (even then Tea Leoni carried the scenes). They simply spent too much time in showing the downfall of Dick Harper.If not for my love-struck-one-way-relationship with Tea Leoni (U LUCKY BASTARD David)since her Naked Truth TV series, i would have stopped watching the movie long before the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a good idea for a remake and a good remake, but it was probably the least funny Jim Carrey movies I've ever seen. Both Jim and Tea put forth decent performances as well as a good supporting role for Alec Baldwin. It was a good idea and the story was told well, but I ultimately didn't like the movie. It simply wasn't funny enough to hold my attention for the duration of the film. It wasn't a very long movie, but it still found a way to be boring in parts. There were also a few small things that didn't feel right to me regarding the maid as the movie went on. I wouldn't discourage people from seeing this, because there are entertaining parts, but if you're looking for a real side splitter, go rent anything else with Jim Carrey in it.</fullReview>

And they work well together, but the movie has so many faults I had to turn it off and come back to it because it insulted my intelligence. It's not smart. That's the lament way of putting it.

		<fullReview>Dean Parisot is a genius as the Director of this comic gem. Jim Carrey's comedic talent is only enhanced by Tea Leone's reactions. Her timing, facial expressions and good sportsmanship, for letting the makeup artist distort her face in the botched chemical experiment, is what truly made this movie. By strategically keeping Leone in most of the scenes with Carrey brought this sappy remake of the 1977 classic to a much higher level. Imagine Entertainment should not only use Parisot directorial skills again, but should deeply consider contracting Leone for many more movies. Run don't walk to your local video store to rent or purchase this flick if you are looking for a cheerful pick-me-up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the movie was sub-par. The acting was good but not great, the story was funny but did not come out that way. The director dropped the ball on this movie. It was not James (jim) or Tea. IMHO it was the music that killed it. There is a scene where things go down hill and Jonny Cash music is playing - man was that depressing (not funny) killed my mood. After that the movie could not recover. The deportation scene had potential funny situation, good acting good set up - I even smirked but the music again was unsuited to the scene. The music kept me from being pulled in to the movie.I say it had potential but was poorly done, i would even say rushed into final production. Kind of reminiscent of the prequel to the exorcist: the beginning. The theater release was good, I though so after watching it, but the movie release exorcist:dominion was a helluva lot better. Same story just different director. Same should be done here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be Retitled the Art of the Steal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of the movie's low rating is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure. While this is good for drama, in comedy, we know the pains it need not be emphasized. As a result Fun with Dick and Jane is not an appropriate title and I was just plain disappointed failing to see any fun with Dick and Jane. It is true that this is a copy from the movie of the same name, but it fails on the execution and the title was not appropriate for the story line.However, if the movie was retitled to be "The Art of the Steal" and the emphasis on bungling slapstick comedy more takes on the robbery and the plans to steal (stupidly of course) would have given the movie a major boost. While, at the same time the movie should show the CEO at least in the beginning to be a crook, so it will be easier to project the pains to someone responsible early on and just leave it at that. The movie suffers a viewpoint issue and with that in mind, a comedy cannot work if the viewpoint is not done properly. A scheming husband character who is that of a Wile E. Coyote on the Road Runner would be more funny, including the slapstick comedy. But in this case, a steal instead of the capture of the bird with complicate contraptions would be extremely funny here. I mean you can make many of these and put them in the movie. But since the viewpoint was done wrongly, the robbery part had to be limited.You will enjoy the movie the first 15 minutes (during Jim Carrey's great rise), but to make the problems they had to faced to be more comical since it is a comedy, that is the part that needs a major overhaul. It can be funnier, if problems were faced more like John Travolta's Civil Action during the downfall. That movie was a serious one but the problems they faced were somewhat comical.</fullReview>

They should have either made political satire the main thrust, or left it out completely. The result is that the film is neither one thing nor the other.Having said that, I still really enjoyed it as a fun movie where not too much thought is required.</fullReview>

Wouldn't you at least think about doing the very same things that Dick has to do to unsure the existence of his family?!?!

		<shortDescription>Poke fun at Dick and Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big Jim Carey fan I took my seat in the cinema with optimism. After all, Fun With Dick And Jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another Carey success. After the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in. The idea that a charming, charismatic, top V.I.P employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible. The actors seem confused with the situation as well. Of course, the stereotypical, rich, uncaring head of the operation doesn't struggle one bit to pull off his one dimensional character but for Carey and others around him the job is a whole lot harder. One minute Dick is seen as a cocky office pro, obsessed with possessions, the next minute he's a bumbling mess who can barely string two words together, and ultimately he becomes a petty thief who is able, quite happily, to put a gun to another man's head. Jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really gets going. The idea behind the story is such a good one and it is a shame that this film has not managed to make it work. The odd moment of laugh out loud comedy can be found but it is usually more physical humour than anything witty or clever. Carey tries his best in parts to save a sinking ship but his comic talent can never flourish in a character that has so many gaping holes to his personality. Carey shines when he is presented with a strong, daring character (Man on the Moon, The Truman Show, Ace Ventura) which this film never presented him with, despite its best efforts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that Jim Carrey (producing and starring) and Brian Grazer have worked on together, but bits of it are definitely worth a look for laughs. Basically Dick Harper (Carrey) thinks he is being promoted to a better job. That's until the company of Dynocorpe sinks and closes down. Now Dick and his wife Jane (Téa Leoni), and their son of course, are in trouble with money. No matter what they try, they can't raise the kind of money they really want. So they start robbing a few places. And then they decide to rob the guy that set Dick up, his ex-boss Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin). I think the most laughable bits are when Carrey's in the elevator singing "I Believe I Can Fly" and the bit when he ties up someone in a robbery, and is speaking with a voice changer (he sounds like a crap robot). Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Run, Dick, Run!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was, perhaps, one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films I've seen in a long, long while. To be fair, I was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula, but I was anticipating to at least be entertained. With such low expectations, how could I manage to be disappointed? Jim Carrey, possibly my favorite actor (not sarcasm), did little more than tread water in this film. He seems to have temporarily returned to his funny-face-making roots and created a character no different from his Fletcher Reede from Liar Liar. This new character, Dick Harper (a.k.a. Fletcher 2.0) is a poorly rendered and miserably written whelp. If you find yourself smiling while watching this pitiful and essentially boring character, it is most likely because Carrey is trying so hard to bring a third dimension to him. Carrey's outlandish posing becomes humorously awkward--and, ultimately, sad.Tea Leoni as Jane does little more than provide the Abbott to Carrey's Costello. I typically find Tea Leoni refreshing and underused, but not in this case. Jane Harper could have been easily played by any actress from age thirty to forty-five, and it is in that non-specificity that the character of Jane becomes uninteresting to watch. She simply has no defining trait other than her following of the movie's general theme, which seems to be that... Wait, no, this movie has no theme. Unless you count "Big Business Is Evil" as a theme. I thought that was more of a given.Richard Jenkins and Alec Baldwin both deliver believable (though tired) supporting performances, but neither man seems truly invested in the role they're playing. It's very clear that Alec Baldwin was putting about as much effort into playing his role as the sinister C.E.O. as he puts into eating a sandwich (which he seems to be doing a lot of lately).Slight tangent, but has Alec Baldwin played any roles in the past few years that hasn't required him to be a powerful jerk in a suit? Anyway, take my advice if you haven't already witnessed the horror for yourself: save your money. This is the one to catch on HBO in a few months. Dick and Jane are present, but there's no fun to be had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shun This Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies like "Fun with Dick &amp; Jane" (1977) should never have been made in the first place. In the second place, the remake of "Fun with Dick &amp; Jane" should never have been made either. The original "Fun with Dick &amp; Jane" cast George Segal as a sacked aerospace executive who embarked on a crime spree with homemaker wife Jane Fonda to preserve their white-collar lifestyle in suburbia. The new Jim Carrey &amp; Tea Leoni remake casts Carrey as a clueless Vice President of Communications of a World Com-type corporation. He loses his job after his greedy CEO bankrupts the company. Like the original protagonists, our hero and heroine resort to crime to keep up with the Jones. Neither as funny nor as amoral as its satirical predecessor, "Fun with Dick &amp; Jane" the second time around combines low-brow slapstick with high-minded altruism. Fans of the elastic faced "Ace Ventura" comic may split their sides roaring at his knuckle-headed shenanigans, but virtually every joke in this tedious retread is as old and worn-out as Milton Berle's shoes. (Jewish comedian Milton Berle was to TV audiences of the 1950s what Jim Carrey is to contemporary audiences.) Carrey revives old routines that Berle recycled from his vaudeville days for early TV audiences. Two things make the "Dick &amp; Jane" remake occasionally amusing. First, the writers have done an imaginative job of updating the plot's blue-collar crime premise. Second, our heroes' Hispanic housekeeper speaks with a hilarious lisp, so that every time she addresses Dick as 'Richard,' the way that she says 'Richard' sounds like 'retard.' Sadly, even this joke wears thin before long.As "Fun with Dick &amp; Jane" unfolds, we find protagonist Dick Harper (Jim Carrey of "Bruce Almighty") conducting tours at Globodyne, a mega-media corporation, until the big wigs upstairs decide to promote him to the prestigious position of corporate spin-doctor. In reality, sleazy CEO Jack McCallister (Alec Baldwyn looking like a dead ringer for Bernie Ebbers) hires Dick as a fall guy and dispatches him to appear on a nationally televised TV show to brag about Globodyne's projected profits. Unfortunately, Dick melts down during a hostile interview as revelations about Globodyne's scandalous business practices come to light. Earlier, our happily promoted protagonist had convinced wife Jane (Tea Leoni of "Bad Boys") to quit her thankless job at a travel agency so she can stay home with their young son Billy (Aaron Michael Drozin) and supervise the contractors installing their a hot tub in the backyard. Dick spends three months searching for a new job. During that nerve-wracking time, he watches unhappily as the landscapers roll up the front lawn like carpet, the power company shuts off their electricity, and the bank threatens to repossess their house. When Globodyne tanks, the Harpers lose everything, including their life savings. Briefly, Dick takes a humiliating job at a Walmart-type department store where he greets irate customers. Eventually, Dick and Jane turn in desperation to crime. They rob a Chinese restaurant wearing Bill &amp; Hilary Clinton masks in a clear-cut rip-off of the Keanu Reeves &amp; Patrick Swayze crime thriller "Point Break" (1991) where the bank robbers wore presidential masks. Meanwhile, Dick watches as his fellow Globodyne friends try crime as the same route and wind up behind bars. At mid-point, our amoral heroes decide that crime isn't the answer, so they go after Jack McCallister who landed everybody in dire straits in the beginning. "Fun with Dick &amp; Jane" shifts gears suddenly from a slapstick dumb-show about idiotic amateur crooks to half-witted hucksters out to sting the biggest con artist of them all.Unquestionably, Jim Carrey ranks as the funniest fellow alive. However, not even he can breathe enough life into the egregious gags in "Fun with Dick &amp; Jane." The best that he can do is incidental stuff, like donning an electrical dog collar that stuns him when he tries to bark. Many of the slipshod pratfalls that he performs here look like deleted scenes from his better movies, and some predicaments appear positively tame compared with the 1977 original. In the first movie, George Segal got his pistol jammed in his pants at a drug store during his first stick-up. Meantime, the sympathetic druggist mistakenly sold him a stack of condoms, because the latter figured the former was too shy to ask for them and instead played a charades routine gesturing repeatedly at his own crotch. In the remake, Carrey brain-freezes himself at a convenience store slurping an ice-cold, slushy drink before a giant bald-headed cashier chases him off the premises when our hero refuses to pay up. The funniest thing about their criminal antics isn't their misguide machinations, but the midget-sized hatch-back of a car that they careen around in frantically during their jobs. Shun "Fun with Dick and Jane" unless you're really and truly desperate for a chuckle or two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is the matter with America and its so called sense of humor? Nothing funny about losing your job, your life savings, and then as a last resort turning to crime using guns and violence etc.Although a few partially amusing moments in this film, it leaves me uneasy since making fun of those criminals who used the likes of Enron to steal billions and then also to try to find something funny about the victims of such a fraud is not my idea of comedy. Why not a musical of 9/11?Or what about a comedy showing the events of Virgina Tech? Dear oh dear....</fullReview>

There were all sorts of funky things going on and almost every gag was lame. Like their kid speaking Spanish - unfunny! The nanny calling Dick a retard - out of place and unfunny! Like when Dick held up the convenience store or the head shop - unfunny! There's more and more. Tea Leone tries hard and obviously is beautiful but she's again - unfunny! I always thought I could find something funny in any comedy movie but this one left me aggravated not happy. They could have done a lot more with the concept of revenge on Enron, Worldcom and Tyco's company officers - like make a quality movie for starters! I wish I could get my money back.

I am tired of Jim Carey's over the top ham acting. The supporting cast was no better. While this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under, the vehicle for this would have been better served another way. I actually disliked the leading characters (Dick and Jane) so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic. I am trying to recall one scene where I or anyone I was with laughed and cannot.

		<shortDescription>Fun With Jim Carrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie FUN WITH DICK AND JANE is a remake of the 1977 movie of the same name, with George Segal and Jane Fonda. This time, Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni play Dick and Jane. Alec Baldwin, no doubt the most talented of the Baldwin acting clan, is well cast as the corrupt corporate CEO Jack McCallister. In the post-Enron America we live in now, this skeptical and satirical plot line is applicable, and suitably timed. I found it disappointing that it did not do better at the box office in it's theatrical run. I only hope that it will find it's well-deserved audience in the DVD market. Dick Harper (Carrey) is promoted to VP of Communications for the Globodyne Corporation. On the way up the elevator to the mythical "51st Floor" Dick sings a hilarious rendition of R Kelly's "I Believe I Can Fly", along with the cheesily composed elevator-music version. Dick accepts the VP position, and is immediately thrust onto a TV show called MoneyLife to announce Globodyne's quarterly projections. The company folds, while CEO Jack McCallister unloads his stocks, and gets away scott-free. Dick is left out there to take the embarrassment, while all the employees are now unemployed, with no pension fund to speak of. Jane has already quit her job as a travel agent, assured of her husband's terrific new spot in the company, so now they are both jobless. In the comedy madness that ensues, Dick and Jane have to try to make ends meet any way they can! Their lawn is repossessed, they have to shower using the lawn sprinklers, and pay their nanny in appliances from their kitchen! Dick loses his wallet in a crowd of illegal immigrants waiting for work, and gets rounded up with the rest by the INS. He is forced to cross the border back into the USA, at night, in a hysterically funny scene! Jane is there to pick him up across the border, but her face is swelled after a paid cosmetics test that went wrong! Then they try some nefarious ways at bringing home an income, until they decide to go after Jack McCallister himself, who has put this whole thing comfortably behind him, with all his many millions of net worth. A Jim Carrey film is always enjoyable. This one is especially fun, and you will be pleasantly surprised at how good it truly is. Lots of laugh-out-loud moments, with an enjoyably twisty, energetic plot line. Téa Leoni keeps up with Jim Carrey's comic timing, the chemistry truly tangible. If you have enjoyed any of Jim Carrey's films in the past, you will most certainly enjoy this one! Rated PG-13.</fullReview>

This should have been a spoof, but it took on a realism that corporations had a lot to answer for.Jim Carrey after all the work he has done is still Jim Carrey and his comedy does not get any better, his co star was not able to back him up. Their son in the movie was invisible.The life of crime was a blink, and that was the missing link of the movie. The film showed 2 or 3 robberies and they were richer than before, that where it lost it for me.I did laugh in some parts butthrough the whole not good enough, AlecBaldwin I felt was there to add some weight to the film. His character was not strong enough. There were just too many gaps to make this a smart and tight movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>{spoilers}:I'd give "Fun With Dick And Jane" an 8 out of 10. It's not quite Jim Carrey's best but I'd still highly recommend it because it's worth seeing if you're a fan of his. The real fun with Dick and Jane begins when Dick gets fired from his job and what he does about it when he's down on his luck. It only gets better when he and Jane {Tea Leoni} try to get other jobs after Jane quits her job when things only seem to be getting better for both of them. Overall a fun movie to see if like Jim Carrey and/or Tea Leoni. Pretty good stuff. I wonder what else he's soon planning to do like this. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it a satire, comedy, or social commentary? Well it is certainly not a satire. Much too over the top to be taken seriously. Comedy? Only for immature, easily entertained audiences. Social commentary? Maybe a commentary (criticism) of the movie going public. If you are over the age of 25 and thought this was a great movie, do not read on.The Humor- jokes were not funny and mostly idiotic, ex. a heaping plate at a buffet when, obviously, one can go back for as much as one wants. Jokes were funny only when combined with weird facial expressions which detracted from the script and injected silliness instead of humor. I guess you could laugh at Jim Carrey trying to portray an all-American idiot.The Characters- I could never accept Carreys' portrayal of your typical corporate drone; he was just too silly. In the beginning of the film, trying to come across as "normal" he smiles inappropriately, makes weird gestures, and acts like no normal human in these same situations. Tea Leoni is just plain dull as his wife. There is no real feeling of emotional attachment as husband and wife. It seems as if their son came with the house, pre-packaged for a typical Hollywood family. He appears/disappears constantly throughout the film. You never get the sense that this is a real family.The Story- nonsense. He can be smart enough to afford a $600K house and expensive life style, get and keep a high ranking job in a major corporation and yet could not get a job at any fast food joint? Too inane for words. Another silly attempt to show that crime stems from economic, not moral, choices. They, against all advice from any financial adviser in the country, put all their eggs in one basket and lost it all. Sorry, hard to feel sympathy for them. And without sympathy for the characters there is no movie.You could do a lot better at the DVD store. If you are looking for semi-intelligent humor, stay away from this load of pseudo-propaganda.3/10</fullReview>

The ridiculous. lame swipes at WalMart, non-union workers, George W Bush and the stock market not to mention the intentional GWB accent that Balwin's character uses in the film just makes him look silly and bitter on screen. As the credits roll the sour grapes continue as "Special Thanks" are given to Ken Lay, and other CEOs from Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, and IMClone. Let me clue you in to something - if you put all your money into one company's stock YOU'RE AN IDIOT. We don't need this excuse for a movie to tell us that. What a waste of Jim Carrey's talent - from the trailer I expected a completely different movie - what I got was a 90 minute DNC commercial on how to scare people into not investing for their own future, keep them stupid, and keep them dependent on government. No wonder Hollywood is in trouble and can't make a decent movie anymore - maybe you guys could get an original idea and put it on screen for once...although I shouldn't be surprised since Jane Fonda was cast in the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Jim Carrey. He is the best comedy actor ever, no doubt in my mind. But the reason for this is not a film like Fun with Dick and Jane. His Character is this kinda normal boring guy that goes a little nuts when he nuts, when it turns out he's bank robbed. Now that's kinda funny for a while. But not funny like Ace Ventura, The Mask, the Joker from Batman, his character in Dumb and Dumbere and so on... Where has that crazy guy I loved gone? Why is he replaced by a moderate funny guys like Bruce Noland, Count Olav or Dick Harper? I mean it's fair that he wants to do more serious parts from time to time. Like his Luke replacer from the majestic and in some way also his Andy Kaufmann character. Here he makes outstanding serious performances. But when he's meant to be funny, why not do a Jim Carry part like the ones I've loved since my childhood. I miss them. 5 stars from me. The plot is old, the story is not thrilling. But Jim Carrey is in there goofing around from time to time, and that's all I need to give it a medium score:-p</fullReview>

I looked forward to this movie for months, thinking it would help end this dismal movie year on the up swing. It failed on almost every count. Alec Balwin certainly had his moments, but they were too few and far between to save this movie. All of the laughs were telegraphed too far in advance to still be amusing when they finally came. It also seemed that straight comedy and moments of sappy sentimentality were battling to fit into the same scenes. All around it was a long sit for a few laughs I had already seen.

		<fullReview>A very lazy and uninspired effort. Jim Carrey's choice of comedic projects continues to slide downhill. As always, his decision when confronted with a subpar script is to start freaking out and trying to steal every second of his scenes. You would think he would get offered better movies than this. Tea Leoni is cute but has little to do. Alec Baldwin seems to phone his part in; he's played this unsavory boss role several times before and seems bored with it this time. The gags are tired and uninsightful...rich CEOs are heartless, bloated and have weird hobbies; Mexicans cross the border illegally and wacky hijinks ensue. There's not enough bite for this ever to approach black comedy, but nobody could seriously root for these main characters either; they steal so they can finishing building their hot tub, for the love of Mike! I should know by now that the big-budget comedies that get saved for the end of the year probably were too lame to compete earlier in the year with ACTUALLY FUNNY MOVIES. I simply don't believe the people below who claim to have liked the movie, unless they were provably high on something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this funny movie last Friday and I really have enjoyed this picture. I laugh a lot, and Jim Carrey uses one of the forgotten comedy techniques: the physical humor. Jim is a wonderful and versatile actors nowadays, he can be the funniest man in movies like this one or Ace Ventura (when he takes his humor to the limit), have an excellent contained comedy (as Eternal sunshine of the Spotlees Mind) or a surprising dramatic actor (Thruman Show or Man in the Moon). This movie touches a very sensible theme: empresarial corruption, a subject that, get lost with the comedy and doesn't leave something for being analyzed after the movie. Tea is not a great actress (as a matter of facts, in my opinion she spoils Spanglish) and Renee Zellweger or Reese Whiterspoon could have done a better role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation Dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal, and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find jobs, the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of poverty.I've always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It's been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy. The last one was Bruce Almighty which was pretty good. He has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element. Fun with Dick and Jane proves that he still has it. Even though the film was funny, it was still kind of disappointing. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. It's worth watching once though unlike most of Carrey's movies, it doesn't have a good repeat value. Part of the problem is the script. I was surprised the script was weak since this is the same guy that made The Forty Year Old Virgin. Some of the jokes just fall flat and other times they seem to be trying too hard. If Jim Carrey wasn't in it, than the film would have been a lot worse.Next to Jim Carrey is Téa Leoni. She's an okay actress but she just isn't very funny. She doesn't match up well with Carrey and she seemed to be phoning in her performance. They should have gone with someone else. The supporting cast includes Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Michael Jenkins. The latter plays Billy Harper and he actually gives a decent performance. He wasn't as annoying as most child stars are. Alec Baldwin was okay and Richard Jenkins tried too hard to be funny. To be honest, I'm a little bias here. The film altogether was pretty average but I liked it more because of Jim Carrey's performance. Fans of Jim Carrey should enjoy it but that's about it. In the end, Fun with Dick and Jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes but its not very memorable. Rating 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Abomination with Dick and Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why, but there is a certain sect of people who are infatuated with pain. More specifically, they are obsessed with masochism, or the desire to inflict pain on oneself. They have been known to cut their wrists with razor blades, jab themselves with pencils or nails, and in the most extreme cases, stab themselves with knives. None of these activities-no matter how severe they seem-are as painful as "Fun with Dick and Jane". Let me preface this by saying that there might not be a bigger Jim Carey fan. Hell, I sat through bootleg copies of "Duck Factory" simply to see the flailing funnyman whip himself up into a frenzy. But now, after baring witness to this horrific concoction, I must first wonder if this was meant to be a joke. Perhaps Mr. Carey is such an unbelievably unprecedented comic genius that it was his goal to make the most unfunny movie possible so that he could sit back and see how many people could be conned into the theater. Then, sitting on the deck of his palatial estate, he could sit back and laugh and laugh when the box office numbers came in. Perhaps that is the only explanation why the star/producer would allow himself to be sucked in to a remake of a sub par movie. This film has exactly three (3) laughs, and none of them are particularly memorable. Without spoiling them, one involves a funny voice, one involves a quick visual gag, and one occurs about twenty minutes into the film when you realize you're trapped and your only reaction is to nervously chuckle for fear of insanity. Heed this warning; Hollywood has tried to force-feed us trite before, but it has never been so vile and so horrifying. Lastly, should you accidentally find yourself in a seat and the lights go down and you see the credits for this film, RUN! Run like you have never run before. In the end, you might as well watch a test pattern, or worse, The Family Stone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable and therefore boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what is supposed to be a comedy, I was bored all the way through. The pacing, the gags, the plot, the style were all completely predictable Hollywood. The actors' performances were all very competent -- JC continues to be a genius at physical comedy -- so the problem was with the script and the director. The film never surprised me once. I was so disappointed. Save your money for better films! I wouldn't even recommend wasting money to rent it on DVD. A real shame, because a biting satire on the Enron scandals and greed in America would have been great. This movie just isn't it. We all know the American Dream is BS, and that unless you're one of the lucky few who manage to own property (without being mortgaged to the hilt), life in America can be *hard.* It's almost impossible to live in the US on what most jobs pay. The major problem with this movie is that it was dull and predictable, but a minor problem was that there was something insidious about making light of the economic plight of most Americans. Poverty, the movie says, is about not being able to afford a Mercedes, not having a big-screen plasma TV, not having a hot tub. Yes, it said this tongue-in-cheek, but not really. The premise that "things have really gotten bad when upper middle class people have to resort to armed robbery to support their lifestyle" somehow manages to say that it's really only the problems of the rich that matter, and it ignores what real poverty is like and how common it is now. If this was supposed to be a comment on white collar crime, it was grossly unsubtle.</fullReview>

Basically the story is weak and mostly unfunny, but Carrey saves a few scenes with his physical humor, but honestly, Jim Carrey wasn't very funny in this movie, and Tea Leone might as well have been there just for her appearance because she wasn't funny either. This is just another example of Hollywood banking off franchise actors with a lousy unoriginal story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun With Dick and Jane Living in the comfortable suburban life, Dick Harper (Carrey) and Jane Harper (Leoni) are looking forward to a spectacular future when Dick gets a promotion at his corporate job. Unfortunately, the job lasts less than 48 hours, when his boss (Baldwin) takes the company down with him in a scandal that sends all the employees into bankruptcy. Unable to find suitable work, they resort to selling almost everything in their house. Eventually, however, that plan runs thin when they run out of things to sell. With no food and practically nothing in their house, Dick and Jane turn to robbery and crime to pay their bills.I'm sure the everybody involved in the production of this movie knows there's a good movie in here somewhere, but nobody seems to find it.In a world filled with remakes, sequels, and sequels to remakes, here comes Fun with Dick and Jane, a frantic, discordant remake that only stays as passable due to Carrey's wacky and cheery sense of comedy. He does his best to keep the material light and funny, but he falls short unfortunately.The major problem is Dick and Jane doesn't have the timing or goofiness to work as slapstick, and isn't clever enough to work as satire. While the movie is goofy, It's goofy in the wrong ways. You don't laugh when they fall or trip over something because the situation and timing is all wrong. The best thing I can say about the movie is: yes, I did laugh at several parts. Not not enough, not nearly enough with the plot and actors involved.Dick and Jane: 2.5 out of 4</fullReview>

And the female co-star was so obviously overshadowed by Carrey that she did not have a chance to act. One New Year's resolution came as a result of the wasted time. From now on, I will not watch a movie that is not personally recommended by somebody I trust. The trailers for the movie made it seem hilarious. It is not. It is stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rafter Dull Movie About the Accounting Scandals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was an older film of the same name starring Jane Fonda, as well as a kids book that I read in primary school when I was learning how to read. I suspect that the only relation that this film has to the book is the name because I have a feeling that the kids book is not about a married couple running around committing crimes. I have not seen the Jane Fonda film so I cannot comment on that as well though I suspect that the story line is the same, namely that a married couple find themselves without a job so they rob banks to survive.This film came about after a raft of accounting scandals resulted in the collapse of a number of high profile firms, including World-com and Enron. This film, though, was set before these scandals, and I suspect that this has something to do with the joke at the end where somebody drives past Dick and Jane and tells them that he has a new job in a new business that trades energy (and we all know what happened to Enron).Basically, Dick is a high profile salesperson for a technology company and is promoted to vice president only to discover that his company has collapsed and that the owner has then ran off with all of the money leaving the entire staff without any money and without any income. As such the high profile life (and the expensive house) of Dick and Jane comes to a complete halt. After trying numerous jobs (and failing) they decide to go into a life of crime, but after coming very close to getting caught, give that up as well.I guess this is one of those 'wouldn't it be good' type of movies, namely wouldn't it be good if the corporate CEOs that scarpered off with all of our money were forced to give it all up and pay us what was owed to us. Well, Dick and Jane get away with that, but unfortunately in the real world this did not happen. The CEOs of Enron and Worldcom were never forced to give up their money, and the ex-employees were simply left destitute.However, what I have learned from all of the cafuffle is that even though one should save for a rainy day, and not spend all ones money on luxurious living, putting all of your savings into company stocks and a company pension fund does not necessarily protect you. While I do own stock of the company that I work for, I diversify my holdings, and I believe that my pension fund is held in an independent trust and not within the company. I don't think that necessarily happens in the United States, but I guess one way of protecting yourself further is that here in Australia, with compulsory super, is to put it into a fund that has not connection with the company that you work for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i did laugh enough times to enjoy it, but as i said i can't recommend it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although i had some laughs and i did, this movie is not meant to be made at all as it lacks all the needed things to make it something you like to see again or want to ask someone to go see.The movie is based on Fun with Dick and Jane by Gerald Gaiser.About Dick who had a high-paying job; he and his wife Jane (Tea Leoni) live in an expensive house in the suburbs, with their son Billy and housekeeper, Blanca (Gloria Garayua).Their life crashes head-on into reality when the firm Dick works for turns out to have been losing money but have been lying to everyone to make matters worse they made Dick the fall guy for some of their dirty dealings.Now broke and with no money and losing everything Dick and Jane start getting involved in anything they can even using guns to make money.The problem with this movie is the script and then the screenplay, some events in the movie are too ridiculous to be even considered that there were added at all. If you now add that to the acting skills of Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni and Alec Baldwin you have great actors doing a good job acting some really stupid scenes.While filming the coffee shop robbery scene, Leoni seriously injured her shoulder while sliding on the counter. During the scene where Carrey jumps into the ceiling and hangs above the bank desk, when he was stepping down, he accidentally fell and smacked his face on the floor. This painful blooper made it into the film.Fun with Dick and Jane came out after Series of Unfortunate Events, now series was a wonderful movie while this just fell through the cracks.Dean Parisot directed this movie and he will also be directing RED 2.Now this movie actually was a financial success, and i did laugh enough times to enjoy it, but as i said i can't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun with Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to share an experience I'd while watching this movie yesterday. I'd just come back from office, flopped on the bed and took out my shoes while flipping channels on the TV at same time. Just then, one of the channels began to air Fun with Dick &amp; Jane. The moment I saw the opening rolls showing Jim Carrey sprinting out of his house, I became rooted to my bed. He's one of my all-time fave actors.Throughout the 90mins(the channel didn't even give an ad break), I didn't move an inch, not even an inch! I didn't even want to change out of my office wear fearing that I might lose even a small moment of comedy from Carrey or Tea Leoni. That's how entertained I was with this movie.So many funny scenes of Carrey and Leoni that I can't pick a favorite really. Both give a great performance. Didn't realise that Tea Leoni could pack so much fun in her, after watching her very serious character in Deep Impact(1998). Every other cast here were just kinda normal supporting actors for these two guys, including "The Shadow" Alec Baldwin. Ya, he was just a shadow here too :-) Maybe the ending could have been a bit more lively. I felt the state of shock that Alec Baldwin's character goes through in the end wasn't portrayed convincingly. The whole shot that included Baldwin, Carrey, Leoni, the media &amp; crowd of others felt a bit weak to me.Verdict: Still, a great comedy, great direction, great performances. That's it, review over!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun With Dick Only !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it's a remake. But let me hate that else time. The movie is nice; however it didn't utilize many chances to make more laughs. For big instance, the second act; where the thefts are, was a bit hasty and not interesting (The Egyptian copy of Dick and Jane, named "Esapa Hamadda wi Toto", is better in this matter). And for small instance, the leads' kid was nearly unused. The movie ends pretty short. 90 minutes seemed not enough or cut off. Maybe (Carry), the producer, wanted this into the point with no longer time.Moreover, while (Carry) is doing fine in his rationalized phase, where he's not dumb or dumber anymore, (Téa Leoni) was the wrong choice altogether. She got nothing to do with comedy, nothing to do with comedy (My anger just confirms!). Watch this movie to know exactly what I'm talking about, noticing the tragedy of having a comic star as (Carry) beside her all the time too. Albeit nothing is more tragic than her legs, Ugh !! They're ugly to creepy extent, so why to show them naked for half of the movie ?!!!! I WAS SICK, REAL SICK. When I read that (Cameron Diaz) was set to play Jane, but bowed out shortly before production I MOAN. (Diaz) is a real comedienne, lovely beauty, who also has long unforgettable pair of legs, Not mawkish ones that can make you vomit !On the other hand, using The Enron disaster was smart. It is way better than reusing ready-made event from the 1970s movie, and it shows good, rather bitter, touch with today's reality. I loved situations like mistaking the lead for illegal emigrant, trying to steal a stranger who turns out to be acquaintance,? etc. Or swift moments like the one in which they mock at George W. Bush (Alec Baldwin's character talks to the media with grief about his staff during a duck shoot as same as the previous president talked about the war and then invited the press to watch his golf swing!). And when it comes to the scene of (Carry) threatening (Baldwin) with toy gun and tears then it's the best one at all as writing and acting. Then, look at you at the end; we eventually forgive the 2 leads for what they did of steals, not due to their miserable crises or desperate need, but for getting revenge of a huge unfair tycoon who was living untouchable. That's one of the movie's secrets by the way; get the big ones; namely the corrupted businessmen who always get away with it, not the money (or more than it anyway).Among 2005 movies, and from my own lists; as a man &amp; woman's buddy-movie it's better than (Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith). As a heist, kind of, movie it's better than (Domino). And as a remake it's another nail in the coffin of originality, yes, but at least considered more creative and amusing compared to the other, many, remakes lately. Generally it works, yet on the "not so great" level. For me the only great thing about it though is seeing a comedian like (Carry) doing fine without wacky stuff, and crossing from a phase to another successfully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I quite liked this. As a Jim Carrey fan I am glad to see that he is showing off his acting skills lately instead of just doing that silly thing he did in Ace Ventura (which is funny, but I realise not to everybody's taste). Carrey does act in this but does a little of what he does normally, like in Bruce Almighty. Tea Leoni does what she always does but is also funny and has good chemistry with Carrey. The plot is simple but funny. I have to say I did laugh a good few times and if you don't laugh I think you will be hard-pressed not to smile at the ending. Sure it's not the funniest or wittiest comedy ever but it is enjoyable and fun to watch with all your family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remake of the movie about an upper middle class that encounter problems. Instead of working them out, they run amok and ineptly commit crimes.Sum it up? Think Bonnie &amp; Clyde if they never hurt anybody and talked like the Three Stooges. Jim Carey does his usual manic slapstick persona, and Tea Leoni balances the exaggeration of her character while managing to stop short of apish over-acting. The scripting is very weak in this film, but the two leads do the best they can with it. A corporation gets in trouble for scurrilous business practices, and CEO's and other baddies take off, leaving our heroes.Then Dick and Jane go on their rampage. And that's it. Carey does a lot of his mugging routine, and if you like that, then you might like this (at least for a while).See Dick run. See Jane run. Better yet: don't.</fullReview>

The original film had real acting, funny lines, and chemistry between the stars. plus, as a recession movie, it was very well timed. The remake has watered down histrionic Jim Carrey, clichéd bad guys and a wholly illogical plot.

		<fullReview>This is a simple formula comedy engineered to allow Carrey to do what he does best. He plays a normal guy, a bit quirky of course, but without the extraordinary or exaggerated 'trait' that drives the plots in his other comedy work. He is a spin doctor by profession, but this is not leveraged very well.But we can laugh because Carrey is a funny guy with funny and endearing expressions. The broader context doesn't really matter. The story is just an excuse.Unless you bring expectations to this one, the presumption that Carrey's career is steadily progressing, perhaps, then you probably won't find it offensive. You might even enjoy it, although you've been on the same ride before, many times.</fullReview>

But when you have Jim Carrey and a good script, you can't go wrong. I haven't seen the original. So this won't be a comparison. Actually, I think this one touches some really have issues but it does it by not taking itself seriously in an extremely well. Unemployment, corruption of companies, bosses who only think of themselves are not certainly only American. The search for a job that's worthy of his abilities and education and holding his determination, giving in to much less awarding jobs, and what happens when desperation hits two educated, modern and most importantly nice people... It's hilarious &amp; thought-provoking. Alec Baldwin is great as the crooked boss.Tea Leoni makes a great partner in crime, and the Spanish-loving kid is just adorable.</fullReview>

The movie is good and some bits had me in stitches as Jim Carrey really made the movie a go for me. Surprisingly I did not like it as much on the 1st time as on the 2nd which is strange. Overall I think that the movie deserves to not be called a flop but a sub comedy that Jim Carrey made good so I rate it 69%.</fullReview>

Here is one of the world' most naive, downright stupid idiots to ever hit a screenplay. This guy makes Moe, Shep and Curly look like atomic physicists yet he is a vice-president at mega-corp Globodyne?! No wonder the company went broke! Forty minutes into the film I just wanted this jerk to go to prison and shut up. When characters repeatedly do the dumbest things imaginable, it just isn't funny. I couldn't even finish watching it.

		<fullReview>The film in my opinion... Isn't Jim Carrey's best effort, there are many funny films he's starred in, (Ace Ventura, Dumb and Dumber, etc) but this one is just struggling to make us laugh. I felt uncomfortable through the entire film. the film has it's good moments, and it's probably Jim's comic acting, such as acting like a puppet in the bar and singing in the elevator, Dick's son got a couple of laughs from me, especially at the part where Jim loses his ID and calls his son who is speaking in Spanish to the immigration guy. Some gags just fell flat, like Dich getting punch and apparently sounding like a Mexican (shince when Doesh shpeaking like thish shound Mexican?!), Jane having to experiment lipstick and getting a swollen lip, the the ending was just so obscure to recognise in an instant (I had to look it up on the internet to understand the joke). Although it's a Comedy, it starts to get too romantic during the end like 'Bruce Almighty', although that film blew this one into pieces. Just don't bother okay.-Kieran</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't recall what led us to order this movie from Netflix: Jim Carrey has never appealed to us. However, we watched it and, out of inertia, let it continue to the end. And then the credits rolled with the nod to Ken Lay of Enron and the other crooks and malefactors that looted their companies, causing them to fail and ruining the fortunes and lives of the employees and investors (often one and the same). That WAS really funny and made me less unhappy than I had been about watching 90 minutes of overly-strenuous -- and generally unsuccessful -- efforts to generate laughs.

Carrey is great in 'Liar, Liar', 'Truman Show', but this one was just bad. Carrey's best is when he's rubber-faced or when he plays the normal guy caught in a terrible situation. He was also great in 'Majestic', but this is so bad, we just walked out. Most Hollywood films are getting worse and worse. Run by 20 year olds who think 'they' know how the world turns. This is a shame for any movie goer.The only thing I like about this movie is the Alec Baldwin scene, but that's it. It's too far- fetched and stupid. Overall, don't waste your energy or money in seeing this movie.</fullReview>

Then, as the movie progresses into the meat-and-potatoes of Dick and Jane fighting for survival, it becomes painfully unfunny and very tedious."Fun With Dick and Jane" falls flat on its face.

		<fullReview>This is very light comedy - more on the charming side of a family-level movie - not really a good comic flick.What was most interesting about the movie was not the humor or the story - but rather the scenes of suburbia, the big corporation and how sad it is to go from "having it all" to losing it all.The story itself was pretty boring - a nice fellow who finally gets a top VP job at major corporation loses it the next day when the company fails. Sadly, his wife simultaneously quits her job thinking their money concerns are over. Then we follow the two as they remain essentially jobless from month to month as things get worst. It seems there would be some great opportunity for humor, but there really aren't any strong laughs - most of it is just kind of a depressing story.There's really not much to be gained from seeing this movie - except if you use it to go to sleep at night by. It's harmless enough for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Extremely average are the only way to describe this. Even though Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni make an okay screen couple, the movie relies too much on its plot - two people, that are hit by an extraordinary amount of bad luck.The beginning is almost completely identical to another Carrey film called "Liar, Liar". The production company, Imagine was responsible for both films. There is also an enormous amount of wasted screen time detailing how the company that Dick (Carrey's character) works for goes belly up. This setup is supposed to give resonance to Dick and Jane's only option of a life of crime, but the setup is so totally unbelievable that you think that you are watching science fiction.There are some funny moments, one being Dick's attempts to find a new job. Look at the way he tries to get to the front office door, a repeat of an earlier scene from the beginning. There is also Dick's first attempt at robbing a liquor store but every gag seems it was lifted from some 70's sitcom. Speaking of the 70's, in case you didn't know this is a remake from a 70's movie but I can't realise the original movie being anything more than fluff either, even though I haven't seen. Why is it that remakes are only made of films from the 60's or 70's? Could you imagine a remake of the Maltese falcon today? Okay, enough already. What we have here is not the greatest movie ever made and I think Carrey is old news by now. But you must applaud him for having tried everything possible to be on top, excluding porn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fun With Dick and Jane" (2005) is a classic example of a comedy-misfire. Directed by Dean Parisot, this film stars Jim Carrey as Dick Harper and Téa Leoni as Jane Harper, as the husband-wife duo who lose their jobs and in the process the good-life they have grown accustomed to. At fault is Dick's shady boss Jack McCallister (played by Alec Baldwin) whom of course they must seek revenge on. What really didn't work isn't the story or script, but unfortunately the acting of Jim Carrey - while I found him funny in his earlier films ("Ace Ventura" comes to mind) - in this film, he seemed dated in his comedic antics. That said though, I still like Carrey and hopefully he makes better films in the future which I will for sure see. A 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

But i do like Tea Leoni, so i thought i'd pick up this movie for her. Boy was i surprised. Of course there were times when Jim Carrey was being too much himself... if only they could tame him down for his movies, i believe he just might be able to act?? Anyway... this was a funny movie (with only a few annoying scenes from Jim). My husband cannot stand Jim Carrey even more than me, and we both laughed quite a bit through this movie and would sit through it twice.. if bored.. with no complaints. (not one for watching movies over and over again). Anyway.. this is a good and somewhat clean movie for those who want something light and funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shortly after getting promoted, Dick loses his job. It's too bad that he told his wife, Jane, to quit her job as well. Now the money is gone and the house if up in foreclosure. Dick, turns to a life of crime to pay the bills, with his wife Jane by his side. I've been a fan of Jim Carrey since I was a kid, he was my idol. I would imitate everything he did. From his catch phrases such as "Spank Me" to dressing up as the Mask for Halloween. Jim Carrey is just a great comedic actor and he is always the first person to go to when you want a wacky off the wall character. In Dick &amp; Jane, Carrey is limited by his usual crazy self, as he must play a family man. Carrey does get a couple of laughs, but the movie as a whole just doesn't click with the funny bone. Carrey and Leoni work well as a comedic duo. They play off each other as husband and wife quite good. I could see another film for the two in the future. One of the comedic highlights featuring the two is when Dick is trying to rob a bunch of different stores throughout the city, but fails at each attempt. Jane thinks that he's just joking and seems to be having a fun time with his failure. The rest of the film finds it's laughs in what Carrey brings to the table, but one man can only bring so much and here it isn't enough.I haven't seen the original, so I can't make a comparison between the two, but it would seem that it's not only the chemistry that's needed to make the film work, but the events that happen as well. The events here make you crack a smile or two, but not a gut holding burst of laughter. Dean Parisot film Galaxy Quest was quite funny and I enjoyed it very much so. The cast had perfect chemistry with each other in it and the story itself was interesting. Everything seemed to fall in place there and Parisot had a success on his hands. Dick &amp; Jane is the opposite. With the except of the husband and wife chemistry, nothing else really works here. Baldwin adds nothing to film and Richard Jenkins of the Farrelly Brother's films is drunk for a good chunk of the film.Is there a moral of the story at the end? Yes, but it's presented is clouds of grey. Dick and Jane never get caught with their illegal activities, so the message is lost by the time the credits roll by. I found myself just sitting there more often then laughing. I wanted to laugh, I wanted to enjoy myself, but ultimately couldn't bring myself to. On a bright side, with other comedy remakes, such as Bewitched and the Honeymooners, Dick &amp; Jane is the best of the bunch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FWDAJ was a good picture with some great moments. My favourite scene has to be the first job they are on, when he panics and run off without paying for the brain freeze. The music in that scene is perfect, anyone know it? The man behind the counter is so not bothered with this guy walking in. Jims many faces are great in this scene. The silent hi when he enter, with that expression on his face is a killer and the counterdude with the brainfreeze remark. Another good scene is the one with Jeff Garlin being robbed robo-style. But anyway, i fracking hate Tea Leoni, she would be better off breastfeeding aliens than make movies. And for Baldwin... bomb the Baldwins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and it mostly does what it promises. That's all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey is playing in his standard way, this time a suburban dad and husband working for a large corporation. Tea Leoni plays his bored suburban wife. It all looks nice, Dick gets his awaited promotion and the family's social status seems to be on the rise like never before. But Dick and Jane corked the champagne too early. It's all a big sick joke where Dick is sent on a TV-show to discuss the company's blossoming business situation. One of the funnier scenes in this film. It all went down the drain, the company's executives pulled an 'Enron-type' financial scam and Dick is nothing short of embarrassed on the show.The movie looks like a mix between Requiem for a Dream, with some elements of Pulp Fiction and Carrey's previous role in Me, Myself and Irene. There's just too little originality to make this film hilarious and too little of the same to make the robbery scenes look thrilling. It's just,... fun. It's fun to watch Jim Carrey act like a monkey in the elevator, it's fun to watch him get embarrassed on TV, it's fun to see others laughing at him, it's fun to see his son talk in Spanish when they call at his house, etc... So the movie fairly does what it promises. Alec Baldwin gave an okay performance as the rich and careless executive, living in profusion while the rest of the region lives jobless and without fake lawn grasses in front of their houses. All presented in a funny and non-painful way as it really isn't. One of the utterly funny scenes is when Carrey gets drunk and stands on the bar-table. The film does nicely pass over between bad consequences and making them look amusing. It's all concluded with a few exciting incident's at the bank and with a fun and happy ending. So it more often does what it promises, nothing more. No shiny awards for this one, except at maybe the DVD market. And that's all that really matters. This corporate parody even proves it....... -3/5 ......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Much Fun with Dick and Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that Adam Sandler is turning into a mediocre actor is a compliment of the highest order. To say the same thing about Jim Carrey is a tragedy for American Cinema.Not exactly a "boring" movie - but Fun with Dick and Jane does not possess enough substance to squeeze out an entertaining review. Somebody wake me when this typing is done? An upwardly-mobile family suddenly find themselves in a downwardly-spiraling tailspin. Both Dick Harper (Carrey) and his wife Jane (the simply stunning Téa Leoni) are out of work and so down on their luck that they turn to crime to pay the bills and retain their yuppie materialism.We don't need more than one hand to count the "big" laughs in this remake of the 1977 film (which starred George Segal and Jane Fonda). Veteran television director, Dean Parisot, with writers Judd Apatow, Nicholas Stoller and Peter Tolan, move the film at a breakneck pace, which leaves no time to question the childish plot or examine the one-dimensionality of the characters, coaxing about as many nervous titters and strained giggles out of viewers as your average TV comedy would (more through giving the actors their due for "reaching" for gags that get away, than for actual humor).And there lies the problem: this IS "your average TV comedy" writ large and tedious. Key word: average. Mediocre. Nice. Unexceptional. Okay. Beige. Vanilla.To this point in his career, Jim Carrey has not insulted us with "average" in any of his diverse roles. Even the seemingly mundane *The Majestic* saw him produce some of his finest "straight" dramatic moments on film. In Dick and Jane he is floundering in a script written for a lesser comedian - maybe someone mid-beige, like his co-star from the devilishly wry *The Cable Guy*, Matthew Broderick, but not quite as American Ugly as a Rob Schneider or a Tom Arnold.Carrey's talents are still potent, evidenced in snatches like the Hendrix air-guitar-voicebox scene, and a scene where he plays a puppet, while drunk (on half a beer), these scenes only highlighting his lack of anything to do in the rest of the movie. He even spoofs his own acting talents in a scene where he reaches such a level of desperation that tears well up in his eyes as he tries to exact reparations directly from his CEO at gunpoint. Not one minute after the intense moment, he is laughingly boasting to his wife, "Did you see how I made my eyes water?" There are intimations that the recession that is hindering Dick and Jane finding gainful employment is a George W. Bush phenomenon. But the movie is not a Bush-bash - if you blink, you miss the allusion. There are grander issues at stake here - snide contradictions about morality and the ethics of crime.For one brief moment, the characters contemplate prostitution as a means to get by. Of course, in a PG-13 film, the female character is required to act outraged at this suggestion - then she turns to burglary without a moment's hesitation! Correct me if I'm wrong, but burglary is as illegal as prostitution, as immoral as prostitution, and as demoralizing as prostitution. Like prostitution, it is a felony. Like prostitution, one would feel remorse after the act (providing one were a Good Christian - as these two desperadoes are painted to be). The same "Christians" in the viewing audience who would - like Jane - frown on prostitution, readily embrace burglary as a viable comedic lever. Yet, if Dick and Jane are set on the route of immorality - "immorality" as denoted by their society's strictures - they might as well have gone the way of prostitution as a means to an end, for with Jane being such a magma-hot tamale, she could have easily clocked thousands of dollars a day escorting high-class businessmen, thereby achieving the goal of Quick Cash more succinctly.The movie tells us - snidely, of course - that dressing as a Blues Brother and robbing a bank, or stealing a car and driving it through a jewelry store window is less reprehensible and more moral than selling your body. But there is no distinction. Immoral is immoral - as you yourselves have decreed.It also tells us that since the CEO was stealing money from his corporation, it is okay to steal the money back from him. Two wrongs DO make a right! And are we to applaud Dick and Jane for being so attuned to each other's criminal proclivities? One would imagine that if a married couple were thrown into destitution and one partner were to suggest burglary as a way out, the other partner (if they harbored a shred of decency) would protest to the point of defection in the marriage - yet these two are as ideologically bereft as each other, actually enjoying themselves to the point of playing "dress-up" with such outlandishly flamboyant costumes, we not only question their pragmatism, we wonder at their apprehension of morals at all.In this frenetic film, many other actors somehow also find nothing to do: Alec Baldwin (as Dick's CEO), Richard Jenkins (as Dick's supervisor-turned-bum), and Jeff Garlin (out from under the protective skirts of Larry David, as an Office Manager type).A simple comedy for the simple-minded. See Dick? See Jane? No. See Carrey, see Leoni - but in something else.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well fun with Dick and Jane dosen't really stand up to the title.....cuz there is no fun element. Rather I would rate it as one of the wackest Jim Carrey movies of course after The Cable Guy. You would laugh in the movie just for the sake of the costly ticket or the name Jim Carrey. Never ever in the whole is there a link neither is anything hilarious but worst of all it gets the audience yawning a number of times. There was total chaos in the directors mind, i.e. whether to give the audience situational or loud stupid comedy. Rather gave them both and ended up getting nothing. So on and all Fun with Dick and Jane is totally disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was intending to go and see Steven Spielberg's Munich tonight but instead was forced to go and see this.As i had heard bad reviews of this movie i didn't expect much and i didn't get much in the way of entertainment.There is a simple fact Jim carrey's movie's can be either hilarious or just awful.This movie falls under the second category unfortunately as the only laugh i got out of it would be Jim carrey's wacky humour which probably wasn't in the script to begin with.This is definitely not as funny or as entertaining as it should have been which is why i would give it a 4/10.Although it isn't the worst movie i've ever seen it most certainly isn't the best.If you want to see an funny movie with Jim carrey see something like Dumb and Dumber,Ace Ventura or Bruce Almighty.If you want to see an average comedy that isn't very entertaining see this.</fullReview>

Jim Carey was good in this but i think back to all his movies and say liar liar and Bruce almighty were better than this one. i think Jim has the capability to do funny movies but sometimes chooses badly and does bad movies such as this one and eternal sun. come on Jim, bring us the funny. yes i got a chuckle or two from this movie but it was gut splitting funny. but again he can afford to do thats cause Jim Carey is worth millions . but keep up the good work Jim. so if you want to go to a movie and are not a Jim Carey fan then take your girlfriend to see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this movie was pretty funny but Jim Carey wasn't at top of his game. I mean I laughed but I think Jim Carrey should try thinking of his roles more carefully, and work with Tom Shadyac again. Bruce Almighty is By far my Favourite Jim Carrey movie. And Liar Liar isn't far behind. This movie was light hearted and all but I just think it could have been a lot better. Don't get me wrong i liked it but Just not the best. Like at the end I thought it Just could of had a bigger and better ending. Its just that i Thought everything was just a little bit Watered down and it could've been crazier and Funnier. Not my favorite But u should go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like slapstick, stupid and Jim Carrey humour more of a 6.5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit it I have a Major Confusion with regards to what to expect from a Jim Carrey movie, on some days i may fall of my seat laughing and on others i may find him annoying and stupid. In fact even when watching the same movie twice I've laughed once and cried on the other occasion.Well i went to the movie knowing this and I'm happy that it was one of those days where i laughed my ass out.This movie is really funny in parts and in some scenes i literally fell of my seat laughing. The humour is slapstick mostly but is also intelligent in some parts( i think i read somewhere Jim Carey has the highest IQ in Hollywood).The only problem i had was with the ohh so nice ending; and a personal problem maybe with the way their family financial position gos from bad to worse,( even though I'm Indian and we don't buy assets or for that matter anything personal with loans), I know it was trying to have funny look at these things but I'm sure for many people who faced this problems with their companies going under, these scenes and this movie as a whole would have been quite distressing. I know saying this is against my nature, but the movie could have sympathised with these people in the end when they credited those responsible for enron, worldcomm etc.All that being said i recommend watching this movie on a good mood day because I'm not quite sure about Jim Carey's power of enlightening a bad day.Great movie to watch on a good day. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I just had to go to the cinema. A new Jim Carrey movie! I went expecting not much because I had not read any reviews of it before I went. So I just expected fun with Jim Carrey. And that was that. I loved it. A story about big bosses that screw the workers. But at least here a couple get revenge. I loved the jokes about Enron and companies like it. Because that was the main story of the film. I really do not understand how Enron could do what they did. It is not possible in Norway or Europe. Are Americans easy fooled? Do they really swallow every thing any VIP says as long as they make money? How stupid can you be if you put your whole pension into stocks. I mean no one does that? except Americans it seems. In Europe we love this film, it just shows the enormous stupidity that some people can do. Pension into stocks! I mean... my God that is just hilarious. hehehe. If you did that in Norway or Europe everyone would laugh of you. Only in America! is an expression we all know. But it is sad of course that because this is VIP's that knew things where going to hell and still tricked their workers. But still no one should put their whole pension in company stocks. At least save as much that you need and maybe use some to gamble with in stocks. But not all of it! Sorry for all the Enron workers, but really shouldn't anyone seen that coming? Stocks are a gamble, and you do not gamble with your pension! period!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Having a little fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall seeing the original of this film when it first came out, and found it to be a good plot, which was for the most part adhered to, with an interesting twist on the finale.The names, of course, are a play on the 'Fun with Dick and Jane' series of children's books. In this film version, they even have a dog, Spot - see Spot stop barking (in quite an interesting manner, and yes, I sat through the film to make sure that no animals were harmed). This updated version of the 1977 original film adds elements of the modern American corporate world to the basic storyline, which still works nearly a generation later. In the credits, inspirational credit is given to Enron, Worldcom and a host of other corporations whose financial outcomes did not live up to the fullness of the American dream.Dick is a mid-level executive with a multinational corporation. His wife Jane is a travel agent, who seems to only attract the customers from hell. When Dick gets the promotion to senior executive, vice-presidential level, Jane sees the opportunity to let her job sail away, and becomes a full-time housewife. Meanwhile, Dick's company does a dot-com bubble burst fast enough to generate a sonic boom, leaving both Dick and Jane without a job in a corporate town where suddenly everyone is unemployed.The furniture, the car, even the lawn gets sold or repossessed, as Dick and Jane variously look for ways to make ends meet with odd jobs and gray-market tactics. Finally, Dick has had enough. He decides to rob a convenience store. After a few abortive attempts, he finally succeeds in a small score, and both the cash and the excitement propel both Dick and Jane into further and further escapades. However, this is small-time items, and when another couple from the same corporation is caught doing the same thing as Dick and Jane, the couple decide that it is time to retire, but not before making one last retirement heist.Enter here the twist - in the original film, Dick knew of a safe upstairs in the corporate office that held lots of undocumented cash. In the modern version, Dick discovers a sort of modern equivalent, that being off-shore accounts. Can Dick and Jane find a way to take the loot? The ending here is in some ways predictable, but has a very interesting twist which shows both a generosity of spirit and a justice-will-be-done aspect that is truly well done. Would that the same could be done for the real-life corporations mentioned in the end! Jim Carrey and Tea Leone make a great comedic duo in this film; Alec Baldwin plays the not-quite-as-stupid-as-he-seems corporate leader with good flair. The slip from success to unemployment to armed robbery is not seen as shocking, but somehow natural and understandable in the modern world (which is in and of itself a frightening idea).Nothing deep or profound, and the script is serviceable if not brilliant, but there is fun indeed with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The comedy falls flat at times, but its heart is in the right place.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should first point out that I never saw the original movie with George Segal, so I'm not rating it to that, just in its own context.This film took a bit of a slating in most of the reviews I read. To tell the truth, I was dragged in to see it really. But I was surprised, the jokes fall flat at times, and its not the laugh out loud comedy as provided by films like Team America and so forth, but underneath it all there are subtle undertones of a really clever comedy.Jim Carrey, obviously noted for his comedic abilities pulls this one off well, although you do get the feeling he's holding back at times. Perhaps its the feel good ethic of the movie he's trying to uphold, perhaps he's just tired of being seen as the rubber-lipped funny-man. Its a similar kind of role to the one he played in Bruce Almighty, but he doesn't quite hit the high notes he hit back in 2002.I rate Tea Leone very highly as an actress and she too is on good form. Alec Baldwin is superb in his pastiche of corporate America, in particular his little homage to George Bush Jr. (Fans of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911 will get it).All in all, despite a little stuttering in the middle where the plot seems to lose its way a little and the movie descends into funny costumes and ludicrous situations, it finds itself at a very clever ending which raises your opinion of the film as you're walking out the door of the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Fun with Dick and Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of a 1977 comedy of the same name, an update of the same premise of your happily married couple who found themselves in debt and having to rob in order to pay the bills.Starring Jim Carrey (who produced this movie) and Tea Leoni, they're Dick and Jane Harper, who are living the American dream, with nice house, nice car, nice kid, nice housekeeper, and nice family dog too. A promotion to Vice President of Communications in a conglomerate makes Dick Harper arrive. But only for a day as his first task is to make the televised announcement of his company's finances, and found out that the company is in dire straits.So begins the barrage of comedic situations where Dick and Jane struggle to sustain their livelihood with the minimal amount of resources, with situations even as absurd as getting deported. The jokes are not laugh-a-minute, and at times seemed too contrived, even for a Jim Carrey movie. We know what he's capable of, but in this movie, he's somewhat restrained in his delivery, perhaps having to share screen time with a partner in Leoni made him cut down the antics? But the movie's obvious jab is on the recent spate of corporate scandals, and in that it does quite well, working them into the movie with no holds barred. It even had the cheek to give special thanks in its credits to the executives at Enron, WorldCom, and had a direct reference to the shredding episode of now-defunct auditing firm Arthur Andersen.Alec Baldwin certainly had a field day as the villain of the movie, the CEO of the conglomerate Globodyne who siphoned off every penny from the company before it collapse. Is he going on the decline, having to play supporting roles, and the "bad guy" as well, the latest in recent memory being another CEO in Elizabethtown? Hmm.Is this comedy memorable? Sadly no. It's OK for the occasional laughs, but absolutely nothing to make you laugh in tears. Fans of Jim Carrey, you'll lament the good old days. Bring them back!</fullReview>

I know I only gave it a 6, but I'm one of those fan-girls that leaves the 9's and 10's for the change-your-life type films. Honestly, if I'm bothering to write this comment, I must have liked it.

		<fullReview>I thought this was a fun movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the slapstick and the acting. I was really impressed with Tea Leoni. She wasn't afraid to take chances and look goofy in parts. Alec Baldwin as always was a hoot. He is one of my favorite character actors. I believe his Saturday Night Live shows that he has hosted are among the funniest they've ever done. From beginning to end his skits are always funny. Whether he does comedy or drama, like his great performance in "The Cooler", he is just plain fun to watch. Jim Carrey is his old self and seems to have fun with his role. There was a scene where it seemed like a highlight reel of his special goofy comedic talents just like the interview scene in "Mrs. Doubtfire" when Robin Williams performed one impression after the other. I enjoyed it. This movie wasn't meant to be taken seriously which was what my wife and I wanted when we went to see it. We've had enough drama in our life recently and just wanted to laugh. This movie did that for us. I've read that the previews showed too many of the funny moments. We never saw any previews but I believe there were way more than two minutes of laughs in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well Folks, this movie was a good chunk of mindless entertainment. Jim Carrey does his common stuff and makes a fool out of himself. I don't mind Jim Carrey and his antics, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, was great, he was hilarious and he was original. Ace Ventura : When Nature Calls, not bad but still the same kind of stuff, then there is of course the Mask, Liar Liar, Bruce Almighty, a lot of his comedy is very much the same. The only thing that really saved this movie was some of the silly comedy in it like the last line, "There is a great new Company, good benefits, good pay, it's called Enron". The other thing that saved the movie was the fact that there was actually a storyline to it, after the collapse of Globadyne Dick and his Wife begin trying to find some work. Until they turn to a life of crime. They in the end wind up getting revenge on those responsible, and of course the typical American Ending.... It's a happy one. But as I said before, not a bad movie, worth a watch if you want some mindless entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. This was one of those times I expected a typical bubble-gum comedy, and walked away impressed. The small, subtle touches were what really made me laugh. You can tell that there was a great deal of imagination in the writing and directing in this movie. The acting was well-done, too. Téa Leoni was excellent, and her character had surprising depth for a comedy. Usually I'm not a big Jim Carey fan, but he toned it down for this one. I think this is some of his best comedy work yet.

		<shortDescription>Corrupt at Every Level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to go on at any length about this frenetic remake of what was originally an only mildly diverting situation comedy in the first place. Guilding the lily? Maybe -- but guilding the Queen Anne's Lace? The action here is ratcheted up to almost unbearable levels as is everything else about the movie. The original had some physical comedy but this is virtually nothing but action. It's exhausting to look at and listen to. The number of times someone falls on the floor is uncountable. People punch each other in the face and tackle one another on the run and smash into each other's cars, none of which was present in the 1977 original. The editing is rushed. Each shot lasts just long enough to register on a tachistoscope at its higher setting. Jim Carrey, unlike George Segal, never stops moving. He's manic. When he's not imitating a puppet while standing on a table (for no reason) his eyeballs roll around like the ball on a roulette wheel. Robin Williams is hyper too, but Robin Williams provides parodic laugh after laugh while Carrey is just silly. The score is all junk rock and thrown at us with the tempo of an Uzi. Even under the credits, somebody is shouting a fast version of "The Best Things In Life Are Free" -- and he's imitating Louis Prima. There's not an original idea in the movie. Certainly, "squeezing another buck out of a remake" is not an original idea. Not anymore. About half of what appears on screens these days is a remake or a sequel. There seems to be a hole in the noosphere -- right over Hollywood.Oh, well, I guess there is one good joke. Alec Baldwin plays the corrupt head of the corporation that has just gone bust, fired its employees, and bankrupted its shareholders. He's being interviewed by a TV reporter while striding through a field in hunting gear, along with his associate. Asked how he feels about the pickle his former employees find themselves in, he stops and produces some boilerplate. "I'm heartbroken for these good folks," he says. "I'm all het up over it." Then he whirls around, lifts his shotgun, and shouts, "Now WATCH THIS SHOT." (I take this to be a parody of George W. Bush being interviewed on the golf course in a Michael Moore movie.) There. I've gone and given away the good part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stars at Full Power with an Ultimately Tiresome to Problematical Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One who is not a fan of Carrey's crazy antics must really set their standards low for FUN WITH DICK AND JANE. Though, Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni really seem to really have chemistry in the scenes they are in. The execution of the story leaves a lot to be desired but it eventually works because of the two main celebrities.This publicly-lambasted remake of the 1977 film sees husband and wife Dick (Carrey) and Jane (Leoni) living the typical suburban upper-middle-class lifestyle with Dick climbing the corporate ladder. But when the company Dick is involved in becomes the center of a scandal right after Dick is promoted, he is robbed of his job. When Jane voluntarily quits her job, the two turn over to a life of comical crime sprees in order to pay for their mounting debt and decide to rob the one man behind the disaster, Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin).If any other stars would have replaced Leoni and Carrey, FUN WITH DICK AND JANE would have been not worth watching and it would just be a bottom-of-the-barrel unfunny and very tedious comedy. About three-fourths through the story, the screenwriters loose us and we find it difficult to stay in our seats. There are a few unsystematic and messy gags here and there but it's all just so dull to be able to work. However, the charismatic Carrey, who gives us a business-as-usual performance, glues us to our seats regardless of what's happening in the story. And Leoni comes off as one of Carrey's most memorable comedic leading ladies. The greatest scenes in the picture are the scenes with Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni committing crime because the two leads are able to stand out and do all these kinds of ridiculous actions even when nothing is really happening. Die-hard aficionado of Carrey, Leoni and physical slapstick and cultural-reference humor will find this film to be a gem. Regular fans will have a pleasant time at best but those who despised FREAKY Friday (2003), ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE (1994) and SPANGLISH (2005) will surely find themselves sound asleep watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First time I like a Jim Carrey Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I entered some minutes after the movie began, Dick and Jane were already searching for jobs. My first thought was: Thats a movie about showing the results of the Bush government. Later after knowing what happened with Dick in the beginning I knew it is not directly this reason, but well, maybe it is nevertheless. However, It is the first time I liked a movie with Jim Carrey. I don't know the original, but it's FUN. (At least if you do not stay in that situation yourself or someone you know...). Of course there is a morality problem with the movie, it shows robbery that does not result in negative consequences, they steal money and do not go into prison, they have a bad life until they get criminals and everything is going better ? thats not a good message.</fullReview>

The movie is good, there is nothing great in the story but you hardly need one in a comedy movie.Unlike other Carrey movie here he does not pester you with his crazy facial expressions. The comedy in the movie is situational so even if you cant follow Jim's tongue you can enjoy the movie. The movie has good message and its been told in a convincing manner. Every one has done a decent job in the film and that does include Alec Baldwin who plays a small but important role.All together it's a good movie that you can enjoy with your family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake lived up to all my expectations, and then some. I heard that Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni were great together, and they certainly were. It's been a long time since I laughed out loud this many times at a movie theater.I have a copy of the original in my movie collection, so I obviously found it enjoyable. But this one will be there soon too, and I know I'll be watching this version much more often. The situations presented here are really well grounded in the hi-tech and corporate meltdowns that have been in the news over the last few years, and aided me in getting pulled into the plot line.Nice to see a movie worth spending a few bucks to see, for a change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really thought this movie was great. Not long (less than 1hr 40 min) not preachy, not boring, but a lot of fun. Jim Carrey keeps himself at bay, not going too far into the Ace Ventura persona, his comedy is subdued but still him. Tea Leoni is also wonderful. She is vastly underrated as a performer and even more so as a comic performer. their chemistry is perfect, never did I want to be David Duchovney so badly, at least since season 7 of The X-Files.this film is political and topical, without being preachy, which in today's Hollywood, is fairly hit and miss. While the film does seem to take a partisan stance, they at least chose the right side. Yes, I am biased, but then this isn't some article in a newspaper, it's a comment about a film on IMDb.com, so lighten up, Francis!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i recently watched this film and i first thought it would be a boring film with no funny comments but i was very wrong. I enjoyed this film with its witty comments and jokes. This was a brilliant re-enactment of the dated film. This is a very good film for the family and there was generally a really good storyline. You might ask why i gave the film a good comment and u should but the main reason i did was, firstly, i enjoy these type of films when they are real (Fun with Dick and Jane was a sort of documentary on Enron, which the same thing happened to them as Globodyne).Secondly, the comedy factor. Again, there was some hilarious comments and the way they started to rob the shops were outrageous.</fullReview>

It had stuck with me as a fun time, even though I couldn't remember what it was about. A few minutes into the movie, it all started coming back.My wife hadn't seen the first film with Jane Fonda and George Segal and wanted to see the new one. I was a little reluctant, as watching really old movies years later is usually a disappointment. Not so here. I think that this is Jim's best movie. I am not a Carrey fan at all, but he made me laugh more than once. Overall I think that this film was very well done, and was worth the time. I would definitely recommend it to others. Every one needs a stress reliever, and this film qualifies in that department.</fullReview>

Jim Carrey, violence, old beat up cars being driven like Ferraris, (I don't know why I find that funny) and drunk people doing stuff that gets them into big trouble. This movie is definitely one of the funniest movies I have seen all year. I am very glad I saw it too! I thought Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni were perfectly cast. Jim Carrey's acting in this movie was excellent by the way. I thought one of the funniest scenes in this movie was when Dick is working in the Cost Mart and that really strange lady walked in and asked where the cigarettes were. I laughed so hard that I almost peed my pants. I brought one of my friends with me to see this movie and he laughed through the whole movie.my verdict: Go see this movie.

This is a very funny movie, Jim Carrey gives a great performance, yet I think Tea Leoni is the true star of the movie. She gives an outstanding performance right alongside Jim Carrey, at moments he may outshine her, yet she never goes to the background. The disguises worn by 'Dick' and 'Jane' are hilarious from Bill and Hilary Clinton to Sonny and Cher. This movie was awesome and funny, even though I do not condone stealing.

		<fullReview>Think what you may about Jim Carey, but he is the current ruling king of Physical Comedy. In Fun with Dick and Jane, Carey does what Carey does best, slap stick. The movie was not the best I've ever seen but it had me, and everyone else in the theater, rolling in the aisle. Téa Leoni gave a good performance as his wife/accomplice. Richard Jenkins was believable as his Enron like boss. The movie was a good stage for Carey to display his talent for physical comedy. His facial contortions and spastic movements were reminiscent of his work in Ace Ventura. Over all it was an enjoyable picture where you didn't have to think to much, but just keep the tears of laughter out of your eyes so that you could see the next scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now THIS is crisis management for couples!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Fun with Dick and Jane was my Christmas movie this year. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and encouraged. I heard some critics say that they found it difficult to root for a couple that would rob small businesses. But really the movie was so light hearted that it didn't take too much suspension of disbelief to excuse this minor slip-up. After all, they could have just as easily robbed big name gas stations and big name coffee shops. And in the end the robberies' role in the movie wasn't all that big. Besides, the couple commented that they would try to give back to society, which they did in the end, sort of.I went into this movie thinking that it would be all about these two committing dozens of robberies, like a comedic Bonnie and Clyde duo. But it was actually more about how they coped with the Enron like situation they were in. I felt that this movie illustrated very beautifully how a husband and wife should cope with hardship. Now understand that I don't mean that couples today should start robbing neighborhood mom and pop shops. What I mean is that couple's should look to each other for strength. The beauty of this movie was that no matter what happened, the couple remained unified. Very refreshing for a Hollywood movie.Everything that affected one spouse affected the other spouse. Each situation that came up, they handled TOGETHER. When Dick got his promotion he encouraged his wife to quit the job she hated. It was so beautiful. I felt such love when Dick brought this up. And she was so appreciative that he could provide that for her, even if it didn't work out in the end. Hmmm... Why couldn't she get her job back? They didn't explain that. But let's get back on topic.The couple showed more and more love and unity the more desperate the situation got. The most disconnected the couple were was when Dick robbed the neighborhood lawns of patches of grass so he could have his own lawn back. But this event actually displayed an already strong sense of unity. When Jane woke up in the morning and Dick showed her their new lawn, he treated the entire grass crime spree as if it was a wonderful present for his wife. It was almost as if he did it all for her. It was a very touching moment.And finally, later on when Dick decided to go rob a store for the first time, she jumped out of bed to tag along, jokingly saying, "I have to see this. You need a wheelman don't you?" Hilarious. It might seem a bit thin of an excuse to explain why the wife tagged along for a robbery when most wives would try to stop her husband. But really it wasn't so out of place. They really laid the groundwork... they spent good time to develop the desperation necessary to convince me that this couple WOULD resort to crime to pay the bills. It took only a small leap to force them over the edge. Granted, Dick's leap was a bit more dramatic and logical and Jane went over the line much easier when most wives would be more resistant, but really it didn't bother me all that much.My only real complaint is that the bad guy didn't get it in the end. Yeah, he lost money, but he wasn't arrested or even embarrassed. He was actually a hero in the end. Not good. He's the bad guy for goodness sake! Oh, also Dick and Jane didn't really seem to make amends for their crimes.To sum up, this movie was about a strong unified couple dealing with crisis. It used a rather Cliché device (Enron) to give the story some rather unnecessary relevance, but I'm sure many victims of the Enron scandal got a lot of release by watching it, and it did give a good backdrop for the story. The flaws were few and minor and overall the feeling I got from this movie was very positive because the duo and chemistry between Dick and Jane was very good. I believed that they were married. I believed that they loved being married to each other and I believed that they would grow through struggle. 7 stars from me. And that's pretty good for a comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun with Dick and Jane is a fun movie that never takes itself seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dick (Jim Carrey) works for a big company in corporate America. One day, he gets promoted to the position he has be dreaming about for years. He comes home and tells his wife Jane (Tea Leoni) to quit her job because of his new position. The next day, Dick goes to work and finds out that his boss (Alec Baldwin) is stealing from the company and making the company go bankrupt. So now Dick and Jane are out of a job and have no way to pay the bills. So after trying several low paying and embarrassing jobs, Dick and Jane decide to turn to a life of crime in order to get their life back. Fun and Amusing times ensue? When watching this movie I was thinking to myself, this director (Dean Parisot) must have been screwed over by Enron or Worldcom because this movie was seriously geared towards the big crooks in corporate America in the past few years. I really liked what the movie was about and I really thought the movie was actually pretty creative and unique.Jim Carrey is good in "Fun with Dick and Jane" but not great. Reason being is because this movie is a comedy and the only great movies Jim has done are dramas like "The Truman Show" and "Eternal Sunshine". But on Jim Carrey's scale for comedy, this film ranks as his best comedy (besides Liar Liar) and he plays his role as Dick Harper perfectly. Tea Leoni also does a fine job as Jane. Leoni and Carrey had on screen chemistry which helped make the film and their relationship seem more believable.While this film is rather silly and fun, it does attempt to take on or address some serious issues that seem to be happening more and more in today's society like greedy corporate CEOs robbing their workers out of money. This movie shows (in a silly way) what it is like to struggle and lose a job. The movie never gets to serious (which I think is good) but at times the silliness does get a bit too much as most of Jim Carrey movies do. They tend to go over the top but luckily here the silliness never gets to the point where you just say this is just so stupid that I can't watch it anymore.My favorite part of the film consisted on short robbery spoofs where Dick and Jane would dress up like characters such as the Beatles, Sonny and Cher and Bill and Hilary Clinton in order to rob them. I guess I liked the pop culture humor. I think on a whole this movie provided a very decent amount of laughs and I can safely say it was a very amusing flick.In the end, "Fun with Dick and Jane" seems like a big revenge film for all those people who got screwed over by Enron and Worldcom. I personally liked the fact that it showed people going after the cooperate fat cats and I think people who were actually a part of the whole scandal that happened a few years back will really appreciate this film and it's message. "Fun with Dick and Jane" is one of Jim Carrey's best comedy roles and I was amazed that not only did he star in it but produced the film as well. In a time where so many comedy movies rely on sex gags and gay jokes, this film feels like a breathe of fresh air for the comedy genre. I recommend this film to anyone who wants a fun film with some good laughs.MovieManMenzel's final rating for "Fun with Dick and Jane" is a 7/10.</fullReview>

There is plenty of serious points in the movie to suggest the director wanted to reach adult audiences more-so than a younger crowd who can not identify much of the issues brought fourth in the movie. Tei and Jim are a great pair, and play their parts splendidly. The setting is such that they could be living and working in any major suburb across the US. The plot is very real to anyone that has worked for a big company and has moved up the corporate ladder. The fears, and concerns that develop as the plot progresses 'feels' very natural and lifelike.

		<fullReview>Now, I haven't seen the original version of this film, so this is strictly my view of this as a movie and not as a version of the original. The movie had perhaps one or two good jokes which had already been beaten to death in the trailers. Jim Carrey has slid down the slippery slope. I used to enjoy his movies, but this truly could have been much better. The writing, the acting, and the direction all seemed rather forced and it seems that those involved had no idea what they were talking about during those scenes that are heavy in business jargon. Surprisingly, the film doesn't focus much on the crime aspect which was pushed heavily in the trailers, acting as a sort of trap for moviegoers looking for a crime-comedy. On the bright side, Tea Leoni was a joy to watch and seemed to breathe a bit more life into her character than her co-stars. In conclusion: Just watch the trailers. You'll get the funniest parts for free.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey is the King of Hilarity!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2006's Fun with Dick and Jane is a remake of the one that was made in 1976. This hilarious movie stars Jim Carrey (How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Liar Liar), Tea Leoni (Jurassic Park III, Spanglish), Alec Baldwin (Pearl Harbor, The Aviator), and Richard Jenkins (Cheaper by the Dozen, The Core), in the most hilarious film of the year.Jim Carrey plays Dick Harper, who has a tough job and has a wonderful family that includes himself, his wife, Jane Harper (Leoni), and Billy Harper, their son. Blanca is their Spanish housekeeper, and loves Billy a lot. Anyway, Jane Harper (Leoni) also has a good and tough job that she quits after her husband tells her to after some mild kissing on the bed. At around the same time, Dick gets promoted, and then suddenly the company he works for, Globodyne, crashes. Now they have no money, and they are going to be evicted by the police in 24 hours! Now, Dick and Jane are hilariously robbing stores and houses, so they can keep their house and find new jobs. They realize that Jack McCallister (Baldwin), Dick's new boss, is behind all of this. I will not tell you any more of this awesome story, but I will tell you this. DO NOT listen to that 5.9 you'll see if you scroll above my comment a bit. This movie is a definite 10 out of 10.I would not recommend letting anybody under the age of nine to see this movie because of the language and rude humor.Original MPAA rating: PG-13: Brief Language, Some Sexual Humor, and Occasional Humorous Drug ReferencesMy MPAA rating: PG-13: Some Strong Language, Some Sexual Humor, and Occasional Humorous Drug ReferencesMy Canadian Rating: PG: Coarse Language</fullReview>

I prefer Jim Carey in this kind of role. Two other movies of his that I always enjoy watching are Liar Liar and The Majestic. I like having the feeling that us common folk can win it over those that are power hungry, greedy and don't care what they do to anyone. I also feel that Jim Carey is getting too old to be doing silly stuff like Dumb and Dumber and maybe he's decided to do movies that have more meaning to them. As a fellow Canadian, I am proud of Jim Carey in this role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie not only contains all the elements of classic comedy, the ending is what will make Dick and Jane so memorable. My husband and I personally lost a vast amount from Enron and MCI. This may have made us biased to enjoying this movie all the more. As we watched this story line unfold, we had to push pause to replay some scenes to help heal those wounds. And to laugh and stop again because we both laughed to tears. There are great parodies of other movies that back the story line admirably. The cast is an amalgam of perfection and you can't help cheering Dick and Jane on to "get you some" back. The real world scenarios between neighbors and inter office hierarchy are right on. Normally, you can tell why they are called deleted scenes, but the ones here are worth previewing. After all, you can't laugh long enough at today's business world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plagerism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The move was humorous and very well done. the acting was quite good too, the only thing that made me give it a low vote was because I saw that they copied part of it from a British T.V. show. At the part where Dick and his Boss are having breakfast at the bosses house there are a few lines that were copied when the boss says "as my grandfather would always say ... " he then pauses and says nothing in Little Britan which is the show the part is stolen from there is some dialog that goes like this "well I guess i should not be to choosy because as i always say..." then also says nothing. I think that plagiarism is bad enough but when its from a show that barely anyone in North America watches I just think that is even worse. that one part just made me hate the whole movie. that part aside the movie was quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dick y jane, good remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And it is that Dick and Jane are a film of difficult cataloging, in fact its greater problem (and perhaps its better virtue) resides paradoxically in which we are not before a wild comedy that bets by that miserly and voluble cachondeo, but before a product that turns out to be more honest from which pretends. It does not mean that the film lacks humorous moments, more on the contrary, without looking for the easy joke will maintain the smile to us during great part of the metraje, a much more placentero effect that the one to regurgitate a pair of dry outbursts of laughter in two hours. Dick and Jane contain certain airs of black humor and an exaggerated cynicism at the time of treating a as present subject as unemployment and the unfruitful vicissitudes to find a job. The film never considers to reproach the unexpected profession of the protagonists, who will return to their old life of rich class thanks to the robbery, but that simply is limited of I avoid and with a estrambótica moral to emphasize the slope "Robinhoodniana" of the white glove. After all, the origin of its performance must to the apathy of ricachón egoistic to which the poverty state slips to him in which it has submerged to his old employees. The tape is divided in three acts differentiated clearly. First, extended in excess, it exposes the desperate situation of Dick and the reasons that lead to him to the robbery. The knot of the film develops to the robberies of the pair protagonist, but it turns out to be too brief and it could have given rise to many more laughing situations. The final part (with the classic premeditate robbery) is unmarked of the rest of the film in a valid but equally cheating attempt, to praise its "feats" in which it is a critic to Capitalism, in the end excessively light, inclining by "happy end". The best thing of Dick and Jane is its simplicity and mainly the untiring succession of events, connected one behind another one almost without pause, which maintains to the spectator in a constant interest (not in vain the projection as soon as it exceeds the ninety minutes). The creator of all it is Parrisot Dean, television director that until the single moment had directed for the screen clay the infra valued Galaxy Quest. Parrisot take refuges in the law of the minimum effort to demonstrate how a film of most likable without estridencias can be done, and although he is unquestionable that could have dedicated something more of time to determined parts of the script, has preferred once to make agile the action without harming in excess the argument thread.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jokes from the 90's are still somewhat funny..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did like Jim Carrey before this movie - and I still do.The story is much like you've seen before - what happens when rich people get poor. How far will people go to live the way they want to.Loosing your job, having no money, living in an empty house and being royally screwed by everything and everyone, should make most people go mad. I realize this is a comedy and therefore wouldn't go to lengths of "Falling Down" with M. Douglas - however, I would have liked to see them really hit rock bottom before making their "comeback".I thought the best touch in this movie, was to have their kid speaking Spanish. Really told a story in itself.But this was a good movie, not great, just good. It made me laugh several times in the dark of the cinema - and it was probably just the first of many feel good movies i'll see in 2006.Carrey does an excellent job of holding the movie together, and Baldwin is actually a lot better being mean in comedies, than being mean in thrillers like Mercury Rising.To sum up - a good comedy, but don't expect to laugh as hard as when you saw Dumb &amp; Dumber, The Mask, Ace Ventura etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See "Fun with Dick and Jane" get mediocre results!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See Dick act (Jim Carrey's performance as an unemployed suburban husband who turns to a life of theft crime to make ends meet was at times filled with the good old comedic Carreyism which laughs up your belly; but it did had its sporadic monotonous moments ,no thanks to the crappy screen writing that did not have too much fun with Dick.) See Jane act (Tea Leoni as Dick's wife partner-in-crime Jane was no match for Dick. Leoni, who was marvelous in "The Family Man", looked aloof and remote here as if she rather be playing with another mechanical dick. Let's just say she has been more vibrating in other films.) See Dick cry (Carrey who also was one of the film's producers must not be too happy with the film's mediocre box office results. However, Carrey must be proud of his Dick because he stole some of the show with his comedic antics in some of the robbery scenes. However, his Dick was not big enough for me to recommend this film.) See Jane wonder (Tea Leoni must be wondering what made her take on this Director Dean Parisot project. Dean is definitely not the Dean of Directors. His past film "Galaxy Quest" was also a dreary flick. Judd Apatow, who did such a stellar job in writing and directing "The 40 Year Old Virgin", scribed "Fun With Dick and Jane" but with unsatisfying results. Maybe, he was focusing too much on the virgin and lost track of the dick.) In all, you will have a few guffaws with Dick and Jane but it will not be an entirely fun time. *** Average</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are quite a few moments you find yourself laughing, but within seconds you will think it wasn't actually that funny. Jim Carrey is good in this, not his best film by any means.The plot is very simple, not much thinking needed. Which is a good thing, but when you begin to question it then the film gets kind of silly. But hey, it's a film, no need to follow logic too much, but i rather if it had a tiny bit more to be honest.This film is decent but nothing which will be remembered after a few weeks. Yes, there are funny bits but nothing which we haven't seen before. Worth watching? yeah. Not a YEAH! but a yeah. If you like Carrey and you have a couple of hours free, then I think why not. While watching this film, it's best if you don't think too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Difficult Kind of Comedy that Basically Succeeds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey, Tea Leoni, and director Dean Parisot (Galaxy Quest and Home Fries), had a difficult movie to carry with the idea of a comedy about nice people turning to crime after a corporate executive takes off with its money. Yet besides a little uneven pacing and a few awkward moments in transition, the comedy team pulls it off including a few brief flashes of emotional drama that Jim is capable of. This mostly entertaining and sensitively handled comedy with elements of drama managed to skirt over the land mines and bombs that this movie had to negotiate through to pull off a movie without offending or losing its audience emotionally or sympathy. The plot is thought threw with relative taste in the descent and decline into poverty with turning into a drama. Oftentimes a comedy can easily transition into a drama that by the end ends up turning off everybody. In this movie, the script manages to turn things around (sometimes barely) and keeps its characters above water comically speaking while still retaining its substantive drama, the small amount there is. Jim continues his balance tight rope walk between his over the top comedic antics, a more sophisticated, subtle humorous performance, and his dramatic abilities - not completely without stumbling at times. Overall, this movie succeeds to the end in providing the audience with a comedy entertainment that was its intention while providing some semblance of serious commentary about corporate greed and the plight of the impoverished. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay. Not great, not terrible, but enjoyable and amusing at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I don't review movies after only seeing them once. I may edit this review after seeing it again.Anyway, I must say that I might be biased in this case as I saw this movie for free, so I can't really see it from the viewpoint of someone who saw it and had to pay (if that really matters at all).Anyway, I found this movie pretty enjoyable. I judge a comedy like this: the ratio of hits to misses, and how many moments made me sit there and think "That didn't work for me", all the way up to making me wince and think "Why in the hell did they include that in the script?".COMEDY SPOILERS! I found the hit to miss ratio about even. There were only two moments during the film that made me wince, once each by the two leads: Carrey in the elevator, and Leoni in the Tai-bo-thingy class.Other grievances I had with the film included: the Harper kid. I'm not a fan of child actors, and at times he was just irritating. Some other scenes that didn't work for me were Jim in the convenience store, and other scenes where they tried to get humour from the characters doing embarrassing things.However, there were quite a few moments that made me laugh, some of which I have to say surprised me because I found them funny. These include Carrey as Cher, the dirty hand print on Leoni, and Carrey's revenge on the fat-man from "Curb your Enthusiasm".END SPOILERS! So, in summary, this is a good film for a laugh, but certainly not a great film. I can't judge yet whether it's worth reviewing.I guess something in it's favour is that unlike most sequels and remakes these days (a dime a dozen it seems), this one is justifiable, considering the original's plot and recent corporate events like Enron.It's just like the title suggests, it's fun. It could've had a better script, but the director (best known for "Galaxy Quest", a personal favourite of mine) and stars try their best. They make it almost worth appreciating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light comedy that deserves a rental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun With Dick and Jane is exactly that...an hour and a half of fun with Dick and Jane, a married couple who seem to have it all until everything goes south for Dick Harper and he loses his cushy 150 grand a year job. The trailers and plot outlines of this film would have you believe this is about Dick and Jane turning to a life of robbery to support themselves but that's really only one very small point in the film. The film is really just about their survival and their desperate attempt to put their life back where they had it before he loses his job.Jim Carrey does what Jim Carrey does best...comedy. He really holds this movie together and for what the plot does it's pretty necessary because otherwise without Carrey it would be very slow moving and probably not nearly as funny. He pulls out all the stops (without being over the top) and makes his performance as Dick Harper very funny. Any of the real gem moments in the film are definitely scenes with him in it. His flip out at the upscale bar is hilarious, and his first attempt at robbing the convenience store, his chasing customers when he lowers himself to working at KostMart...hilarious. Téa Leoni is also very good as Jane Harper, and as Carrey's counterpart she holds her own. They have a very good chemistry, and are very believable together. She doesn't have quite the comedic timing as Carrey does but he's a pro and she does very well all things considered. Alec Baldwin plays his usual role as the overbearing, sleazy boss. I just like seeing him in movies...there is something about the guy. I think he's kind of overbearing and sleazy in real life but hey...what can you do. It's the exact same role he played in Elizabethtown but he's good at it so why not. More than anything else this is a Jim Carrey vehicle and it's been a long time so I was more than happy to see that. He's a comedy legend without a doubt and this is a fluffy, light and actually very family friendly movie.TV director Dean Parisot takes the helm as director and he does a decent job but I think the film called for some slapstick, and physical comedy although there was some the laughs were few and far between and it dragged a little bit. Fun With Dick and Jane is just a fun little movie that will do very well but I think it would be more rewarding as a DVD rental, relaxing at home on a Saturday Night, it's not quite big screen material although Carrey does his absolute best with the script. A valiant effort and worth your time to watch. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great comedy because of the broad spectrum of laughter. I think some great acting took place that really livened this comedy. The plot of the movie was also a good catch because it gave it's viewers a different perspective on corporate life and who gets the short end of the stick most of the time, which are the employees not management. After the CEO of the company sold off it's stocks and left his workers to work for themselves Dick and Jane found it hard to get honest work because of the facts of competition and decided to earn it the easy way. I expected this movie to be very funny and it had me laughing about 80% of the time the rest of the time it was either action or drama. I think the director did his job and acting was great on it's own. Movie goers who complained about it were the ones that felt it was a waste of time at the end when all was said and done even though those are usually the ones that spend money to go see movies like Monster In Law and never brag about it - even though this movie laughed at it's paying viewers without us knowing and expected us to like straight crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK a lot of people around are reallying bashing on this film for no apparent reason. The movie itself is a well acted and well shot film. The problem is a lot of critics are comparing this new film to the one made in the 70s with Jane Fonda. This is not a very appropriate way to judge this movie. Jim Carrey was not over the top and was placed very well in the role. The choice of actors like Alec Baldwin and Walter Addison was very good to complement Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni. The script is funny and the movie doesn't drag on. There really are no parts in it were it lacks and carries on. I highly recommend this, a great movie to kick off the new year of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly a good story, not as funny as expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie having heard mixed reviews. It definitely was not Jim Carrey's funniest movie, in fact it may not be in the top 5. What it lacked in laugh-out-loud humor, it made up for with a good story. This film mocks corporate America and namely the Enron and Worldcom fiasco's from a few years ago. There were only a few funny moments in the film that I can remember and that were not in the previews, therefore I will not ruin them for you. Basically, they involve solo comedy acts by Jim Carrey. If anyone else with a comic pulse joins Carrey in this movie, it would be much better. That said, wait for this one to come out on DVD, and watch a real good comedy such as Wedding Crashers, or The 40-year-old virgin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Rental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story about a husband loses his job right after he compels his wife to quit hers. A perfectly set up tragedy for an already seen comedy. The plot has been used before but this comedy provided some new and entertaining characters and socially forward events, like the young son who knows how to speak Spanish. Also by bringing in some real life events, like the Enron incident, this story brings laughs and good feelings that are almost worth going to the movies to see it. It is a good movie to rent when it comes out, which I think will be sooner than expected, or when you have had a depressing work day or you just want to kill your boss, I think you will find it brings unexpected hope to your overstressed soul.Jim Carrey, who plays Dick Harper, does a good job adding his usually hilarious self to the story. He always plays a good crazy guy and I saw the movie because he was in it, however my expectations fell short. I was expecting an Ace Ventura Pet Detective funny, but I got a How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Playing next to Carrey was Téa Leoni, who I have only recently seen in Spanglish, did a surprisingly good job. She brought a different level of funny away from the "always going to go bad" comedy that usually follows Carrey. I can not see someone else playing her part, she fit it well, but she fit into a weakly written story.I had my expectations to high, I was expecting more jokes more stupid incidences, just a little more funny, but if you like Jim Carrey and are in the mood to be slightly amused go see Fun with Dick and Jane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the first place, the only reason I will sit through any comedy is to appease my kids. I took them to the movies last week and fortunately (for me) "Cheaper By The Dozen 2" was sold out, so we saw this instead. I figured it would be less of a burden for me to endure, and I was right.Though the movie wasn't funny throughout, there definitely were some very funny parts. I found myself laughing which is very uncommon for me. If you enjoy comedies, I believe you will appreciate this.Because the theater was crowded, we had to sit in the third row, which was too close. There was a lot of action to follow, which was hard to do, because of our proximity to the screen.Everything considered, I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dick and Jane Harper are living the American dream until Dick loses his job in a kind of Enron debacle. Their standard of living deteriorate, until finally they're driven to robbery. And then things slowly start to work out for them. Surprisingly enjoyable comedy manages to touch on some of the darker sides of the story (at one point Dick is reduced to day labor and Jane to medical testing) without getting all preachy or maudlin about it. It's genuinely sweet, in fact. Carrey is his usual assured self; I'm an admirer of Ms. Leoni and thought she was an effective foil. Falls apart a little bit at the end, as genre constraints make it fairly formulaic, but it's an enjoyable trip to a familiar destination.</fullReview>

But it gets right into it the whole out of work but it does take him a while for him to start robbing and such. Jim was great but it wasn't his type of comedy he was still great but not that silly dumb comedy we saw him in before. But the funniest movie of the year by far!!! The Wedding Crashers was terrible and so was The 40 year old Virign that just sucked it was the humor i always like but not this time i just hated it. The movie was full of laughs thats what kept you going it just kept coming and there were parts were you just simle and parts were you scream and cry with laughter it kept me going. There were parts that were just dumd like when hes singing "i believe i can fly" that was dumb. They also gave some really funny parts in the previews but who doesn't.

If you do not like Jim Carrey comedy then you will not like this movie because he is staring in it!

		<shortDescription>Well, it's certainly fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey seems to have been trying to be something different than what he used to be recently. He's stretched his dramatic wings in movies such as Eternal Sunshine and The Majestic, and has gone almost unrecognizable in fantasies like A Series of Unfortunate Events and The Grinch. Bruce Almighty is really his only normal Jim Carrey movie of the millennium, and that one outright sucked. Then along comes Fun with Dick &amp; Jane, a seemingly filler comedy, but at least it seems like Jim Carrey back in regular form. Whether that is a good or bad thing is a judgement call, but either way, FwD&amp;J is a great way to kill a couple hours.Dick Harper (Carrey) and his family are fairly well off. They live in a nice suburban house, have a maid, drive a BMW, et cetera, et cetera. He has a nice job at GloboDyne, while his wife Jane (Leoni) has a terrible job as a travel agent. One day, Dick gets promoted to VP of communications, and with the new salary he predicts, he gets Jane to quit her job. His first task is to go on MoneyWise to announce GloboDyne's earnings. In the middle of his appearance, the unthinkable happens and GloboDyne tanks right before his eyes. Now, with both of them out of work, they need a new way to find money. With masses of people unemployed thanks to GloboDyne and Dick's public humiliation keeping him from getting anywhere fast, the two decide to resort to robbery to keep their checkbook balanced.Oddly enough, it is before they reach this conclusion that the movie is the funniest. Watching their lawn get repo'd is just about as funny as movies can get, and Dick getting it back is the most insane I've ever seen Jim Carrey (which is saying a lot). The bits about the son begging to keep the TV or the maid getting paid in appliances are also very grin-worthy. The fired GloboDyne employees rushing to a job interview is one of the most inventive and hilarious parts of the movie. The movie does slump a little when Dick becomes a superstore greeter (though the training segment of it is pretty funny) and Jane tries her hand at being a fitness instructor with no training, but it bounces back in no time with Dick's next job (the ensuing chaos of which I will not reveal because it is just too priceless).The scenes where the duo put their training wheels on for robbery are exceptional as well. The whole sequence is over fairly quickly, but it leaves a good impression. Their minor excursions in the beginning are also good, mainly due to Carrey going far over-the-top. The comedy drops somewhat in the end (as it does in all movies) when they go on a revenge mission against GloboDyne CEO Jack McAllister (Baldwin). Still, it has the occasional laugh, and is a fitting end.While the plot may exist just to show us these sequences, it actually is fleshed out decently. The only major plot hole is one involving Dick getting indicted, which is mentioned once and never followed up on. Other than that, the plot works fine in all aspects. The only thing about it is that maybe it just doesn't go far enough, and could have been a superb political spoof as opposed to the simple slapstick it resorts to.Jim Carrey is a pretty good fit for Dick Harper. He can definitely do the whole corporate ass thing, as well as the suburbanite who is growing insane. It becomes a bit of a problem when he just goes too over the top. The real low point of the movie is one scene where Carrey, with a voice scrambler, torments a tied up executive he just robbed. It is just way too far over the top as he does the robot dance and speaks in gibberish. For the most part, he is just insane enough to make us laugh and enjoy the movie, and the movie would not have worked without him.Leoni is usually there to be a wall for Carrey to bounce his insanity off of. At least, that is what you are usually meant to think, as she does offer some great subtle humour to counter-play Carrey's off-the-wall insanity. When she does get a chance to go a little insane herself, whether it be teaching aerobics or getting a botched botox injection, it never seems as crazy as Carrey, but more laid-back and normal. It's refreshing to see someone not try to match Carrey, but rather go in an opposite direction to co-exist.Besides Baldwin, who does a nice job as the smiling corporate villain, the rest of the minor characters are mainly meant as running gags. The best one has to be Jacob Davich as the son who speaks better Spanish than English thanks to growing up with the maid. How it plays into one plot point is simply genius and hilarious. The maid really doesn't get to do much for the movie other than mispronounce Richard, which by itself is pretty funny. Richard Jenkins is also good as the alcoholic former executive of GloboDyne.The movie winds up with the reference we had been waiting for the whole movie, which really sums up the point about corporate greed. It is a little disappointing that the rest of the movie relied on Carrey's insanity rather than the corporate spoof that could have raised the comedy one step higher, but alas, what we are given is exactly what the title promises: fun. Sure, it's not as scathing as it could have been, but it is a fun, slapstick movie that is sure to please fans of Carrey. This isn't something to rush to the theatre for, but it is worth checking out on video.Overall Rating ? 76%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrey &amp; Leoni are funny and this movie's got a message!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was great! It was funnier, more entertaining and just better than I thought it would be. Jim Carrey was funny, but it was all in the delivery of some well-scripted scenarios, rather than his "Ace Ventura," talking-ass comedy. It delivers very well. He was funny without being 'too Jim Carrey,' if you know what I mean. Carrey &amp; Leoni work very well together, their timing and delivery just seemed natural together and that heightened the comedic value of the film. Just as Carrey was not 'over-the-top' Jim Carrey, Alec Baldwin was also good in this movie by being himself, but not overly so (if any of that makes sense). This is the story of a guy who works for a big company and then suffers at the hand of the demise of that company - a demise he unwittingly accelerated by a TV appearance the first day of his new assignment. The movie then takes you through what happens when desperate (white) people do anything to keep their home. This movie is simply funny (on different levels), has a great cast and is well worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would you do if you had just been promoted to Vice President and then within the course of 24 hours your company's stock plummeted and you were left holding the proverbial bag? Dick is faced with that very situation. His company, GlobaDyne? Yeah, it's now GlobaDead. Or GlobaDone. Pick the lame pun you like best. As panic sets in with the employees, the only place that CEO Alec Baldwin can be found is hopping aboard his helicopter to get the heck out of Dodge. Or whatever city this is set in. I can't remember. Nor will I look it up. Anyway, the point is that the employees are left in the lurch.But Dick remains optimistic. However, as the months tick away with no legitimate job prospects, desperation understandably sets in. The family loses their electricity, the lawn is repossessed (!!), they downgrade cars, they must pile their plates at the $2.99 buffet "Michael Moore Style" (i.e. they pile the plates HIGH), and they bathe in a sprinkler. When he finally reaches the depths of his hopelessness, Dick declares, "We followed the rules and we got screwed." Having, in his mind, run out of options, Dick decides he must do whatever it takes to keep food on the table and to prevent eviction.When "whatever it takes" turns into robbery, well, we don't mind partly because we feel sympathetic to Dick and Jane, but mostly because their misdeeds deliver increasingly funny results. If only real life crime were this much fun! Their use of voice manipulators (what in the world is their official name? modulator?) is particularly hilarious.Fans of Jim Carrey and Judd Apatow (he wrote the screenplay) won't be disappointed. The laughs are consistent, and often out loud, and the performances are spot-on for a comedy of this nature. This is yet another fine example of Jim Carrey doing what he does best, so if you're not a fan of other similar Carrey efforts such as "Liar Liar" and "Bruce Almighty" then this may not be your cup up green tea (with Ginseng root). Alec Baldwin seems to have found a niche in playing the sleazy boss/CEO. Looks like he knows how to bring his real-life persona to his characters.Pay attention for subtle jabs at two-job households (the child speaks with a Spanish accent because he spends more time with his Spanish nanny than he does with anybody else) and not-so-subtle jabs at Enron-like scandals. The "thanks to" section at the beginning of the closing credits is especially clever. Just a little social satire for those of you who like that with your comedy.Another aspect I like about "Fun with Dick and Jane" is that I was genuinely interested in the story's resolution. The laughs are never forsaken for story, but by the time Dick and Jane decide to hatch a plan to foil Baldwin, the details are intriguing enough to keep your attention engaged. No, it's not "Memento," but it's fairly intelligent for a comedy plot line.After the movie, I was giving my feedback to the screening rep and a few other moviegoers stopped by to discuss the film and its relevance in light of current corporate scandals. By the time we finished our conversation I closed with, "Who'd have thought a Jim Carrey comedy would create so much thoughtful discussion?" Don't let the "social commentary" aspect scare you; the movie's number 1 priority is to make the audience laugh, and it certainly succeeds. Crime and robbery has never been so much fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the comments claim that the film was not as funny as they thought it could be, but it must be remembered that the main characters are dealing with losing everything in their lives but themselves and their son. I think the movie wasn't about Jim Carrey's comedic skill but more about the message about the sad corporate events over the past years. I don't think any audience should be able to go in and simply laugh at what is happening to the main characters. Overall, the film was rather simple but still carried a good message and made anyone who paid the least bit of attention think about what is going on in the corporate world. I think the message was poignant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as fun as it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't go into this movie with high expectations, so I pretty much got what I expected, a forgettable comedy that's a few notches above mediocre. Jim Carrey can "occasionally" be really funny, but at other times be incredibly annoying. But his boisterous, over-the-top comic style isn't to blame in this film. Even a better comic actor couldn't overcome the weak, sitcom-level script. As I'm typing this, I can barely remember anything about the film, since there's barely anything memorable about it. I certainly didn't hate it and certainly didn't feel tortured during any moment of the film. But it's by no means a comedy that'll be remembered years from now. Alec Baldwin has a few funny moments, but he only has a small part in the film. There are moments where I laughed, but I never laughed hard. And there are quite a few moments that simply fall flat. I could've done without the crude racial stereotypes. In typical Hollywood fashion, all the Hispanic characters are portrayed as either maids, gardeners, or day workers. So much for crossing barriers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Occasional fun with Dick and Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are we to believe there is insufficient comedy writing talent out there that they have to re-make yet another seventies movie? The original wasn't exactly the greatest crack-up ever filmed.Carrey tries his hardest to reprise his LIAR LIAR appeal but these days is looking more and more like Anthony Perkins propped up in reception at the Bates Motel rather than a wannabe goof-ball. The film strains for humor in the first thirty minutes or so and despite the odd sight-gag that works, is at best a poor man's THE MASK.On the credit side, Leoni is very likable and quite obviously she and Carrey had quite some rapport going on location filming. The film lifts in the middle, by the time Dick and Jane sink to the level of suburban mayhem, but it is really too late to save a film that never had the legs in the first place. Tragically with different writers and production team - this COULD have been one of Carrey's best. As it is though, it is merely a passable time-filler despite two scenes that might fairly be described as full-on hysterical.The less said about the political overtones - the better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When it's bad it's really bad, but when it's good it's hilarious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:The laughs come almost immediately in this fun remake starring Jim Carey and Tea Leoni. This really isn't a great movie but it is actually very funny and isn't a bad movie going choice.I'm all over the map on Cary. I am not a fan of his early films but think he's absolutely wonderful in some more modern ones (Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine, Bruce Almighty etc). This is neither the best nor worst of Carey. As Dick, he gets to ham it up, there's a lot of the "face mugging" factor but he carries it off here and mostly carries the film as well.Leone is good as Dick's sidekick but Carey's got the best lines. And Alec Baldwin is appropriately vile as the corrupt boss. The whole cast was actually very good.Fun With Dick And Jane isn't a great movie and isn't as good as the original, but it's got charm, humor and also important, a very sad element of realism. In today's times, and considering the actions of certain prominent companies, what's buried under the laughs and zany lead characters is the fact that there really are a lot of people like Baldwin's Jack and that's a sobering fact that shouldn't be dismissed despite the fact that this movie is essentially a comedy.Although the laughs are present in the movie(Mercedes Off), that is it's main appeal. There are elements as well that are not as funny as the movie thinks they are and the story itself is very unstructured and for all the moments of comedy, there are also a large number of annoying moments. It takes to long to get to Dick and Jane becoming outlaws and some of the things that happen to them along the way are very drawn out and try to hard to be funny when they aren't. The funniest part of the movie, for me, is the different disguises Dick and Jane wear, that brought down the house when I saw it, people were hysterical and I must admit it was very creative.The end was absolutely great-very Ocean's eleven Like in it's cleverness, though clearly not at that level. And the closing credits were awesome and worth a point all by themselves.In closing-this isn't a great movie but it is worth seeing and I'm guessing will do pretty well at the box office. It also is the perfect length and the fact that the material succeeding in being what it was, definitely had something to do with having the right cast. My vote's 7 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From A Three Piece Suit to A Hand Gun and Ski-Mask. Dick and Jane Harper Make the Best of A Desperate and Destitute Situation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dick and Jane Harper live a very peachy life. They both have jobs they really like and their son Billy is happy, though he was raised by their Spanish housekeeper, Blanca, so all he speaks is Spanish, but life was good. Dick works at Globodyne, a multi-billion dollar corporation, and on this day the executives on the 51st floor wanted to see him. He meets with senior executive Frank Bascom who tells Dick he is in for vice president of communications. He was to meet with the CEO, Jack McCallister for orientation. It went off without a hitch, until Jack has Dick appear on a stock report show called Money Watch. Dick made a fool out of himself and then learned that Globodyne stock took a massive plummet and now the company had crumbled. It was defunct. Finished. Folded up. Frank Bascom drank his problems away while Jack McCallister fled the building in his private chopper. Things looked really down for Dick, and they were about to get worse, for Jane had taken Dick's advice and quit her job as a travel agent. For a while they got along alright, for about a month. Dick managed to land a job at KostMart, but lacked panache and was fired. Jane got a job at 24 Hour Fitness, but proved to be a lousy exercise instructor.To make matters worse, Dick had to trade in his Bimmer for a slightly more run down automobile. The Harpers' lawn was repossessed and they had to auction off their furniture. Dick had an interview at an executive brass type company, but found out it was a sham. Blanca's cousin tried to help Dick land a job as a painter but someone else literally beat him to it. Dick was even deported when INS showed up and he misplaced his wallet; Pretty soon, enough was enough. Dick went out and stole patches of other peoples' lawns in a vain effort to replace his own; To make matters even worse, the bank threatened to foreclose on their house. Dick was tired of playing by the rules and decided that crime was the only answer, so he grabbed Billy's toy gun, dressed as the Unibomber and tried to hold up a convenient store, with Jane waiting in the car. The robbery proved unsuccessful. But they do manage to rob a head shop. And so it began. They bought new disguises and held up places all over town, all kinds of disguises ranging from Sonny and Cher to the Blues Brothers. They slowly regained their assets; Dick and Jane learn that former Globodyne employees were going to be indicted, Dick included. But former CEO Jack McCallister was still sitting pretty. Something wasn't right.Dick met Frank in a bar and tried to stick it to him for screwing him over, until Frank, who was suffering as much as Dick, offered to help him bring down McCallister; Jack McCallister was due to deposit some hefty bonds at the Grand Cayman bank. In the sum of $400,000,000. Jane would have to perform the old switcheroo with McCallister's paperwork and then all that money would be transferred to them. After a series of mishaps, including Dick losing the fake application and having to acquire another, Frank rear-ending a secretary's car and Jane causing trouble with a receptionist, they pull off their scam, only to be caught by McCallister. With Dick's quick thinking, he gets McCallister to write him a check. With McCallister's signature in their possession, they pull off the ultimate scam that would help everybody, and still make McCallister seem like a hero: they used the $400,000,000 to fund a Defunct-Corportation-Employee-Relief pension. They let a bewildered McCallister take the credit so now, Dick and Jane were once again sitting pretty and all was well. Fun With Dick and Jane. Jim Carrey, you've outdone yourself again! A major improvement over that ridiculously stupid Lemony Snicket film you did last year! Yech! Jim is back at his comic best since Bruce Almighty! Tea Leoni is here as Jane, and she's good too. Alec Baldwin is that despicable Jack McCallister, fellow Me, Myself &amp; Irene co-star Richard Jenkins is Frank. This movie was very funny and it had a very good message. It makes you think; This is a remake of a 1977 movie of the same name starring George Segal and Jane Fonda. If you like that one, or you're just a Jim Carrey fan, then I recommend you see Fun With Dick and Jane today! The most fun you'll have at the movies this holiday season. It comes recommended by me! -</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FUN WITH DICK AND JANE There's really not much to say in regards to this movie. My negative feelings towards the movie were very minor, and it's not the kind of movie I watch to be picky... but at the same time, the positive feelings towards the movie were minor as well.In the end, it's a formulaic Jim Carrey comedy in the vein of LIAR, LIAR... BRUCE ALMIGHTY... ME, MYSELF, &amp; IRENE. However, what once seemed fresh and new in LIAR, LIAR now seems like a retread in FUN WITH DICK &amp; JANE.It's a solid enough film. It has good production values, clever comedy bits, clean editing, and an appealing cast... however, it was never gonna be better than a "Jim Carrey vehicle". Jim Carrey has always done this style of manic, physical, and outlandish comedy better than anyone else. He shows he's still at the top of the game here, but it's simply not as impressive as it used to be b/c we expect it now. Though Carrey gets brownie points for also being able to give stellar performances in more risky films while never losing his mass appeal comedic touch.FUN WITH DICK &amp; JANE is a pointless night at the theater with some laughs and no effort required from the audience. Just sit there and enjoy. But if you are someone that is at all cynical towards these "harmless entertainment" films... this certainly isn't for you.Tea Leoni and Jim Carrey make a nice comedic pair, and the highlight for me was the sequence in which Carrey is trying to carry out his first robbery. Their chemistry in these scenes is incredibly well played... however, two game comedic performers can't elevate the film beyond what it is. High-gloss, well-produced formulaic filmaking.And I suppose I'd rather have high-gloss, well-produced formulaic filmaking over boring, unoriginal formulaic filmaking.... C ...</fullReview>

Jim Carrey makes it totally amusing and easily digestible. There's a lot of 'slapstick' comedy-and a lot of 'funnys' you would find in a Chaplin film. I went with my Grandma and my 11 year old cousin and we all thought it was funny! By far Jim Carreys funniest films since 'Liar Liar'. Everyone was cracking up in our packed there. Did you know Jim carrey produced the movie? pretty cool huh? Jane (from the movie) looks a lot like the Gamine from Chaplins film and acts like her too!

Leona is annoying, Jim Carey overacts especially in the elevator scene which wasn't even remotely funny. i haven't seen the original, but this has put me off bothering. maybe the scene with the weird microphone things they wear was kind of funny, but it doesn't make up for the fact the rest of the film is utter balls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dick and Jane Harper have the life; a nice house in the suburbs, Dick is finally receiving the promotion to Vice Presidency, so he will make enough money for Jane to be a house wife, it all seems perfect. The day after Dick's promotion, the company belly flops and is bankrupt. Hundreds of employees have lost their job, and Dick's life has spiraled out of control. Unable to find new work, and the bank about to reprocess their house, they become desperate. Dick and Jane have turned to criminal act of robbery, and their finally getting their life back on track, but not without their last heist. They plan to steal the money Dick's boss embezzled from the company; all four hundred million dollars.What made this movie so unique to start off was the intelligent political satire of corporations and life in the suburbs; taking a lot of punches towards Enron. This was so refreshing to see, as it does hit hard on the corporate heads and their hubris attitude, seeing only BMW's in the parking lot, and the cut throat world of job hunting and employment. The suburban life is shown so well, that people are very unwilling to leave that carefree life, that their status is shown by their assets and possessions. Then at mid point, the movie flips, from intelligent satire on corporations to physical slap stick humor. It's when they resort of robbing this change happens. While it doesn't really drop the laughs, it does lose the satire bite which they spent so much time to build. They could have made this a double edged blade of great satire and physical humor, yet the seem so far away from each other.Jim Carey is one of the best physical comedians there is. While at times he can take go to far in some roles, he does restrain himself here, giving a more focused performances; especially in the first half of the film. Téa Leoni is perfect as Carey's counter part, they are great together. Leoni shows she can do the physical comedy just as good as Carey, stretching herself to bring a wonderful performance. The supporting cast doesn't reach the level of Carey and Leoni; Alec Baldwin does a very uninteresting performance, but Carey and Leoni pull up the slack.Fun with Dick and Jane is a great political satire that has more merit to it. It does fall towards the end losing that satire edge, but the fast paced humor keeps you laughing. A fun time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to "Fun with Dick and Jane" expecting a stupid movie with little or no plot and maybe a couple witty one-liners. I was pleasantly surprised with a really enjoyable, quick flick that kept my attention the whole time. Unlike blockbuster hits like King Kong--which in my opinion dragged on forever--"Dick and Jane" was fast and funny, and just the kind of movie I wanted, and had waited, to see. Jim Carry is brilliant as always, and his co-actress, Tea, fits the part perfectly. They were believable as a couple and in their actions. 8/10 I would see it again. Hopefully there will be more humorous movies with plots, rather then the stupid, plot less movies like Cheapest by the Dozen 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Jim Carrey. And it's not because I can relate to him as a fellow Canuck. His style of physical humour originally caught my attention. But his eventual and subtle transformation into a more dramatic - fine, let's go with the term serious - thespian that has impressed me. After Carrey's first few popular movies playing wacky and offbeat characters, 1996's 'The Cable Guy' started to reveal a more serious side. Even though he portrays a wild and crazy cable repairman who is seemingly trying to ruin the life of one individual, Carrey's character is eventually unmasked as a psychologically messed-up loner whose only source of attention growing up as a child was the TV set. Not the most earth-shattering or dramatic of revelations or performances, but Cable Guy at least showed a more sensitive side of Carrey. Further attempts were followed in flicks such as 'The Truman Show', 'Man on the Moon', through to 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.After seeing Carrey's latest, his progress as an actor has regressed back to the old material. And that's not necessarily a negative. There are moments where Jim shows compassion for his family and former co-workers vis-a-vis some sort of financial matter, but that's not what the movie is about. His comedic struggles to regain employment and eventual forays into a hilarious life of crime with his wife are the main focus (hence the title). As viewers, we see and understand the problems faced when money is at a minimum. But when Jim Carrey is set before us on the screen in this situation, we're expecting him to do a 180 and do something off-the-wall to remedy the dilemma. And he doesn't disappoint in that regard.Where this movie fails to deliver is, oddly enough, in its comedy. Quick one-liners and sight gags are plenty, but there is no fluid and consistent delivery of the material. Carrey admittedly does his job adequately, but the other main actors give questionable performances. Any female lead could have been substituted for Tea Leoni in her role as Carrey's wife. Alec Baldwin's unaffected CEO of a toppled mega-corporation hearkens back to (read: ripped right from) Dubya as seen in 'Fahrenheit 9/11' (the 'watch me hit this shot' line was almost repeated verbatim) and adds little to the overall mix. The only character that at least comes close to providing a solid comedic boost is veteran actor and Farrelly Brothers retread Richard Jenkins in his role as the alcoholic and nervous, yet idiotically cunning, ex-CFO.Personally, I would've liked to have seen more out of 'Dick &amp; Jane' in terms of overall substance. But I sorta gave up in the second half and resigned myself to watch the rest without any further expectations. A few chuckles, a couple guffaws, but nothing qualifying as laugh-out-loud. A good 2-hour break from staying at home, but probably not worth your movie dollar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We might be in a pickle Dick" During the holidays, movies are made for us to laugh, and for us to enjoy ourselves, even if that means seeing funny man Jim Carrey and ladylike Téa Leoni make a fool out of themselves, which sometimes can mean good things.Carrey plays Dick Harper, a successful businessman that works for a highly rated stock and investment company. His wife, Jane Harper, played by Téa Leoni is a travel agent. They live in a modern house, as they also have a young son who is babysat by a lovely, amusing Hispanic housekeeper, Blanca. The movie then takes off from there, as Carrey's company goes under and Leoni quits her job (under Carrey's persuasion after learning he's going to get a promotion), and the president of the company (sleazy bug Alec Baldwin), escapes, the two are incapable of having a life. In the midst of trying to find a job, Dick and Jane are forced to sell all of their belongings, and try and live on the lamb, and go from time-to-time jobs. That is, until Dick decides that robbing, stealing, and taking money to try and pay off bills and retain their old life gets into their path...Overall, not such a bad movie, but certainly one for the smart businessman.Have fun.</fullReview>

Usual funny man Jim Carrey has lost his comedy mojo, as usual taking things too far just to get a laugh or in this case a possible chuckle. Another dull remake off the 1977 movie where company man Dick Harper (Carrey)'s company has just sold him out, leaving him and his wife Jane (Leoni) out to hang. So instead of starving they decide to stick it to the man by ripping off "Bonnie and Clyde" by robbing convenient markets and Dick's former unruly boss (Baldwin). Another typical Carrey movie where he pushes things to far and just won't let it go. Leoni of course being a serious pain, and Baldwin's career seems to be falling faster than normal.

If you follow politics at all, you will see all sorts of shots at the Bush Administration. Bush wasn't even in office in 2000 (the supposed year in the life of "Dick and Jane"). Let me see, Alec Baldwin (Mr. Angry in real life) makes an attempt to sound just like Bush. It was a dumb and offensive movie. Actually, I made a vow to never watch Baldwin again--after he said on "Conan O'Brien" that we should track down Henry Hyde (impeach Clinton congressional overseer) and kill him, his wife and his children. They sneak Baldwin in and don't really let you know that he is part of the movie until you've paid your money are are sitting with popcorn in hand. I give this a -10 rating.

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey Does It Once Again!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that Jim Carrey is my favorite comedian, hands down. He can make ANYTHING funny, with his crazy facial expressions and gangly flailing limbs. If you don't find Jim Carrey funny (I really can't see why some people don't), you probably won't find the movie funny. It's that simple.Onto the review! Jim Carrey shines here like he does in everything else as Dick Harper. Carrey being the everyman that he is, he slides right into the role. His manic insanity is ever-present, especially in a scene where he has to literally chase down a customer he didn't greet at the door of his new job. Téa Leoni does a great job as well, off-setting Carrey's craziness with amusing sarcasm. They have great chemistry together, which adds to the movie's charm. In one scene where they rob a car dealership, I was laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes! All the supporting characters are good, especially Richard Jenkins as Frank Bascom, the drunken superior to Dick. Alec Baldwin is also good as the seedy CEO of Dick's company.A great deal of the movie is physical comedy, which Carrey handles wonderfully. The movie really kicks into high gear once Dick and Jane start robbing people. Watching them get back everything they lost by robbing such places as Starbucks and Chinese buffets is hilarious.The music was well-done, adding a lot to the movie. I also enjoyed the poke at Enron at the end. Go see it.The Bottom Line: A funny, over-the-top romp with almost non-stop laughs. With Jim Carrey you really can't lose!</fullReview>

After playing by the rules and getting burned, Dick has an idea: If stealing was good enough for his boss, then it's good enough for him. Using his newfound skills, he and Jane decide to exact hilarious revenge and teach big business a lesson. Jim Carrey steals the show once more, but Téa Leoni fails in her attempt to live up to Fun Jane Fonda's very funny performance in the 1977 original. Dean Parisot, best know for TV shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm, gives a lovely job at directing, but fails to show the more sympathetic side of the characters at the end.Also the robbery scenes are fantastic, one scene with the low fat muffins is amazing, you will laugh endlessley.The original is not a classic, either is this one, but did you really expect it to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serious themes, shallow movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is shallow. The story is shallow. The acting is shallow. As a parody, it is flat, and lacks the cutting edge that could have made it into a great movie. The story just does not lend itself to slapstick; the story is essentially one of tragedy and betrayal. These are not funny themes. Jim Carrey's gesticulations are out of place in what is a grim story about people who are screwed over and then scapegoated. The desperation of the two protagonists is shunted aside in favor of a silliness which belies the seriousness of their plight. These people are victims yet it is difficult to feel empathy for them because they're part of the system too. It was just their turn to be pushed over the cliff, and if anybody thinks that is funny, then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike many others who found this film not entertaining or funny, i will stand by my view by saying Fun With Dick and Jane was funny and sent a valid message as well. As an indirect hit to the companies such as Enron and Worldcom who screwed their employees, Fun With Dick and Jane goes great with Carreys antics and screen presence. I loved his performance here as Dick, he totally carried the film. Tea Leoni was decent as the other lead but not at Carreys level, although she did have a few good scenes as well. I also like Alec Baldwin in his impersonation of a rich republican like entrepreneur. All in all, this was a great film for laughs, and very entertaining to me, i don't see why some hate it so much. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went and saw this movie not too long ago, and it was pretty good. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Tea Leoni and Jim Carrey make a great couple...maybe not as a married couple, but one hell of a criminal team. And the way they pull it all off...WOAH! But, I am not going to spoil it all...you will just have to go and see it. The movie kinda made me think of Enron and how this could have really happened with a lot of people! But over all...with Jim Carrey and Alec Baldwin, it made a pretty awesome movie....I give it an 8! In my opinion, I believe that younger children can see this movie. My sister went and she laughed a lot during the movie, and with there being no severe violence or heavy nudity, it makes for a pretty good movie for about nine and up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well i thought the movie was absolutely hilarious!!! I found it full of laughs and i sure wasn't the only one in the cinema who was laughing (the cinema was packed by the way). Even though this movie has been criticized (check spelling), i found refreshingly funny and does have some serious, heart tugging moments. Jim Carrey is, as always, a comic genius, and although it has been slightly toned down, it is still very funny. I think anyone who didn't laugh in this film, needs to seriously stop sucking on lemons and take a happy pill. So thats what i think. Also, i thought that the various costumes worn by Dick and Jane were quite hilarious, once they got into the swing of robbing banks. OK, thats all. Have a nice day!

		<shortDescription>Not dark enough...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The subject matter this movie is hitting is quite timely and provocative and could have made a much bigger impact if, let's say, it had a smaller budget and been geared to the art house crowd. Nevertheless, the writers really do attempt to bring a very complex message to an audience which probably will never truly understand or appreciate the type of corporate malfeasence which is destroying their lives. This movie attempts to be a polemic on what it means to live in a post Enron/Tyco world, where customer, employee and stockholder considerations are ignored, or worse, abused to make an overpriced buck. When Carrey's character fights off a former fellow employee for what they both believe is a legitimate job interview, after months of unemployment, only to find that hundreds of other displaced workers are desperately trying for the same job, you realize you aren't dealing with a standard Hollywood film. The underlying tone of desperation, the sentiment that all could be taken from you, within a matter of months, that no matter your work ethic or support of the status quo won't get get you anywhere when you aren't wanted, was so close to my life and so many others that I know, that I realized part way through that this movie was attempting something few big budget movies have attempted in last few years. The film does a very effective job of describing, in layman's terms, the kind of corporate financial ledgermain which will leave millions without the pensions or savings which was the safety net they had worked all their lives for. BIG kudos for the writers and producers in attempting to broach this subject. Where the film fails is in attempting Carrey to be Carrey in a movie such as this. I understand that humor/satire is an effective way of trying to push a political message, but some of the devices and scenes were simply trying too hard. And that to me is the downfall, it simply tried to hard in places to wrench humor out of situation in which it didn't flow and in turn became forced and ineffective.</fullReview>

I laughed a lot through this movie, sometimes so hard I probably missed some scenes. Jim Carrey's comedy is so loaded, I will need to see it again, I am sure to catch all of his antics. I did not get as much out of it as I expected though, lots of promise, not enough story line. I believe Alec Baldwin is a good actor but needs better lines, his part in this movie should have been a lot deeper than it was.

		<shortDescription>'Dick and Jane' is fun enough, but insults its own intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun with Dick and Jane: **.5*(2.5)'Fun with Dick and Jane' appeared to me as another popcorn movie, and I was not wrong- it is a seasonal money maker, and just like popcorn, its fun to eat up. I didn't go into 'Fun' with high hopes for a great movie. I was right again. This is not a great movie, but it is a marginably good movie that if nothing else does not insult your intelligence and offers some chuckles. Jim Carrey plays Dick, an employee of a huge corporation who happens to get a huge promotion just a day or so before his company goes town the pipes. Dicks wife, Jane, is played by Tea Leoni. She is a travel agent who finds her job overly stressful and after news of Dick's big promotion, quits her job. Dick is charged with the task of going on a financial television show to talk about his company's fiscal stance, unprepared for what he is going to find out about his boss's with drawls over the last year and while the stock meter plummets on the ticker tape to the side. From here on out Dick and Janes lives go down the monetary drain and unable to find any way to make an income, turn to theft and robbery to make ends meet. The plot mixes and matches and its actually a surprisingly long time before they turn to stealing (so long that I actually forgot that they even take this option, which is obvious for obvious reasons, and wondered how they were going to get out of this "pickle"). This was the most interesting part of the story and, frankly, should have been the whole story. 'Fun' is clever enough to be its own film, not a remake. It could have been wrote in the spirit of the original, but in inspiration only, and made its own path. Sure the robberies held some good laughs, but are these laughs really necessary? For the good of the movie I don't think so. The thefts which are s supposed to make ends meet not only do this but go much further. It makes the upper class ends meet and left me feeling like there could have been a morality tale met here. We watch their son cry over their massive TV and see all these things replaced and there is no mention anywhere that its okay not to have these things. They plot is spoiled and only concerned with upperclass things and, I can't be sure on this, might leave some people feeling that unless you have all these "necessities" (crap) then you're not as good as those who do (crock). This was one problem for me: Why do they have to go back to being exactly as they were? (Even in the end they receive Dicks large pension and benefits) Would it have been so bad if they learned the lesson that to live with less is still living, and this living is still worthwhile and such life is Worth just as much, if not more, as the upper class life? The movie should have focused more on aspects like this I think and it would have had more impact and been a better film. This said, that last little robbery of Dicks boss is fine! Well, would have been if it hadn't been schemed up in 2 minutes. Another disappointment is Jim Carrey. No No, his acting is not bad, its good as usual. But I'm disappointed because after such fantastic and deep performances as Eternal Sunshine its sad to seem him back in old comedic slap stick mode. Perhaps this is not fair, because he does to a fine job with Dick, but it just seems like a step backwards for a great actor such as Carrey. Now, this film clearly had its own mind and there are some clever bits of satire to be found in here. Rather than being little cameos to the plot, these things should have played more of a role. For example, this is clearly an attack on Enron-like companies. (The Enron crack at the ends, and in the dedication in the closing credits) There was also the Alec Baldwin character (Dick's boss). Much of his mannerisms, when on TV and in meeting mode, are paralleled to US President George W. Bush, and the Enron Bosses. Most notably is the scene where the press follows him out hunting: He makes a seemingly passionate, yet subtly misleading and erroneous, speech about the situation of his former company and then asks everyone to "watch this shot!" We all know where this found its inspiration - Thanks Michael Moore and Dubya. I loved these little things! And that is why this movie, in the end, disappoints its own material! There IS cleverness to be found here and this story could have been nurtured and reshaped and been a much better movie!'Fun with Dick and Jane' is fun enough, but in the end frustrated me. Maybe for less demanding or less experienced movie goers this wouldn't be the case. All in all this is a fairly funny movie and thus, its OK. Its not really a good movie, but it does what its been promoted to do- offer some laughs and a enjoyable enough way to kill some time. And, in spite of insulting its own intelligence, 'Dick and Jane' get a pass, but a marginable thumbs down.It gets a (generous) 6/10. (reccomended only for DVD)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World", "Dr. Strangelove", "Wag the Dog" and "Bulworth", "Fun with Dick and Jane" shows that comedy is the best way to deal with political issues*. Playing off of the corporate scandals from the past few years, the movie has Globodyne executive Dick Harper (Jim Carrey) and his fellow employees getting laid off after the company declares bankruptcy. With him and wife Jane (Tea Leoni) out of work, they have only one option: turn to crime. But soon, they realize that CEO Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin) is still living pretty, so they decide to do something to him.They really must have had fun filming this. Whether it's Jim Carrey's facial expressions or any of the sight gags, I don't understand how anyone could find this movie boring or otherwise unpleasant. But overall, I think that it shows how you don't have to make up situations for humor; just look at some of the things in the real world. During the credits, they even thank Enron, Adelphia, WorldCom, etc. A comedy in every sense of the word.*When you think about it, "It's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" is all about greed: it shows how people will do anything for money.</fullReview>

I felt that the writers had no right to specially thank certain corporations when they did not truly know what had happened. As an individual who grew up in Coudersport with Adelphia, what happened in the movie was nothing like what happened to Adelphia or to John or Tim Riggas. I understand that the writers probably thought that it was funny to lump any and all corporations who had failed into that section as one last sad attempt for humor, but it was not effective for everyone, and to some (like myself) very offensive! What happened to Adelphia and the Riggases was very difficult for the entire town and someone's "bright idea" to make fun of it was not appreciated by this individual who was personally affected by what happened!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fun movie ... combining a wicked sense of humor with incisive social commentary. The former was in evidence in the trailers &amp; ads I saw, the latter was not. I guess the marketers were recognizing that most folks (definitely including me) will be much more attracted to see a Comedy without Preaching than Preaching with Comedy. And, to be honest, the movie does get just a bit preachy at times. And if anyone by the end of the movie has somehow managed to miss this feature of the flick, the final "credits" of "bad corporations" make that very clear. Me, I'm not at all against the social commentary; just not crazy about the sneakiness involved in omitting from the ads an aspect so prominent in the film. To me this comes close to false advertising.Having said that, though, I did like this movie very much. Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni were wonderful ... Jim Carrey's quick-fire antics were a blast to watch, as always. Tea Leoni I at first had a hard time seeing in this part, but she performed with excellent assurance and splendid acting without over-acting. The trailer focuses on the suburban-husband-and-wife-crime-team-contrast motif, which sort of sounds like a knock-off of Mr &amp; Mrs Smith, but it wasn't at all, as far as I could see. For my money, a good comedic sit-com and all-round great flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read several reviews of "Fun With Dick and Jane" and they were mixed. Having just seen the movie, I agree with the positive reviews. Jim Carrey (Dick Harper) and Tea Leoni (Jane Harper) work very well together and are really funny. Especially in the first part of the film, when Dick's company and then his life fall apart. Dick is made VP of communications for his company, GlobalDyne, just in time to recite misleading information immediately prior to its demise. Dick can't find a new job and loses almost everything, except his wife Jane. Desperate, Dick and Jane turn to crime. His crime spree is not as funny as his collapse but there are humorous incidents. Finally, in cahoots with GlobalDyne's CFO, Dick and Jane exact revenge on Jack McAllister, the CEO for ruining so many lives. Jim Carrey is probably movie's best current comedian. This movie is not as funny as "Dumb and Dumber" or "Liar, Liar" but is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun with Jim and Tea'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great "fluff flick". So outrageously unbelievable that you cease any and all thoughts of realism. Too many of us can identify with Carey's character, Dick Harper, who is faced with the sudden demise of his company and must find work elsewhere. The ensuing story is one that might not make you laugh. Indeed, if you have never actually experienced what Dick goes through as a husband, or what Jane goes through as a wife for that matter, you might not catch all the inside jokes that really set up some of the laugh out loud moments. But, I digress and move on to the review.I gave it 9 out of 10, and here is the scoring breakdown.Minus 2: After Dick loses his job they spend a little too much time on the downward spiral. It does contain some gold nuggets of humor but let's not kid each other. We're here to see Dick and Jane turn to a life of crime and the hilarity that follows the obvious amateurs. I would have liked to have seen more capers. At a 90min runtime I think there was definite room for growth.Minus 1: No real believability here. I always mark off for this when the story is so outrageous that it defies even the suspension of disbelief. It's funny, but it just doesn't have enough seriousness to it make you fall in love with the characters or boo the villain. I like audience participation, but the only thing you participate in this is laughing at Jim Carey.Minus 1: As previously mentioned, the running time is only 90 minutes, which means that there are many things left untouched, which means lots of questions are left unanswered. We call these "plot holes" and there are far too many to not count off for them.Plus 1: Cameron Diaz? Are you serious? Considerate it our Christmas miracle that Diaz backed out and opened the door for Leoni, who is the far superior actress. The overrated Diaz would definitely have tried to steal some scenes, and Leoni does an excellent job of just being her character and not trying to do too much. That's not her (Leoni) style, and Diaz is just horrible at it.Plus 1: The pop culture involved here is well placed and really adds to the feel of the time frame of the movie. It "feels" like today's market conditions. You almost think the director and actors are reading your mind as to what innuendo should go here, and what inside joke should go there.Plus 1: The movie, as a whole, is one of Carey's better films. Many long-time Carey fans will disagree, but there has long been an outcry for him to take his comic genius and repackage it in a not so "in your face" manner. Ther is a time and place for Carey's trademark brand of humor, and he gets kudos here for realizing when to use it in this film and when to settle down. This is not an Ace Ventura-like film and should win him some fans to replace the posers who decide to call him a sellout because he is growing as an actor instead continuing to be completely over the top.Bonus (no point awarded): There are only two things I can remember so far as product placement goes, and that is Mercedes and BMW. That means they did a good job of being subtle, which is something Hollywood is not exactly known for. Feel free to open your eyes during this movie without being bombarded by ad after ad after ad...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I probably went to this film expecting too much. Being a fan of Jim Carrey, and seeing that his last major comedy was Bruce Almighty in 2003, I thought the time was right for his next big performance.The acting was good, but a number of the jokes seemed forced and undeveloped, sometimes lacking spark. The movie had its funny moments, but not quite enough to drive the film into the laugh-out-loud genre. A portion of the material is dry and there were scenes were the building climax would abruptly end, leaving questions about the main characters unanswered at the end of film. While the movie is enjoyable, I didn't get that great movie feeling upon leaving the theater. While the film has a good concept for a remake, with a good cast, this is one of Carrey's weaker films. I think Jim missed some expansion opportunities for not doing sequels to his more successful films with established characters. This film makes it evident that he is not always being able to build from scratch.</fullReview>

Don't believe all the financial promises of the big employers because the savvy people know that the corporations are run for the benefit of the executives. They skim the money out of the company and then dump it and depart. Alec Baldwin played this same role (the corporate executive who jumps ship from the failing company) in another movie that I saw this year - oh, the one about the shoe designer: Elizabethtown.

You have to be old enough to remember Enron and all the other major big company screw ups. You have to be old enough to understand why it was funny. This movie was not built around Jim Carrey like so many of his other films are. He produced it. This means he thought it was funny and he wanted to be involved. Carrey and Tea did work well together. Alec Baldwin was the bad part. I'm sick of seeing him play the same exact roles in movies. He has no depth whatsoever. All of his brothers have more talent, depth and personality overall. The plot is funny, especially considering the current status of the business world. If you understand the work world you will like this movie. You will relate with it.

		<fullReview>This was a good flick, not one for the ages but entertainment just right for the holidays. Suspend disbelief a bit about the highs and lows that Dick and Jane experience as their fortunes are dragged down with the implosion of Globodyne Corporation (Enron in disguise). Don't expect much character development, these two are already known to us, Carrey, the manic genius and Leoni, the driven beauty. They work up some chemistry together, helping the film to succeed, but the focus is never on their characters as much as the ends they go to seek justice revenge. And there is a very satisfying finish there, which I should not give away. HOWEVER... I was bothered by a LIE, early on in the movie, which had clear political motives and which betrays Hollywood's typical liberal bias. The movie is set in the year 2000, and we see president George W. Bush on TV, speaking about America the land of opportunity. Soon afterward, the corporate scandal breaks, so of course Bush is the cheerleader for this corporate corruption. Anyone with a memory should recall that Bush did not take office until January 2001. Not only was it the Bush Justice department that investigated the Enron and Worldcom scandals, but most of the crimes committed by these corporations occurred under Clinton's watch!!! So much for media impartiality.</fullReview>

Jim Carrey was definitely trying, but for as much of a Jim Carrey fan as I am, it generally seemed he has done it all before, and it was better the last few times he did it. Tea Leoni was not bad, but did not add much to the film, either. And Judd Apatow must have used all of his good material in the 40 Year Old Virgin, because I only got a couple of laughs out of this one. Although I would say that there was a bit of laughter around me in the theatre, so some folks must have enjoyed it. This wasn't a bad movie, maybe worth watching on HBO if you have nothing better to do. Just not worth the price of popcorn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, that last posting is completely baffling to me - did we see the same movie? Maybe he/she is a studio plant, I don't know... Simply put, this is a terrible movie. Jim Carrey actually looks like he is drowning in certain scenes - I felt so badly for him, because he really is an incredible comic actor. Boring, lazy, poorly written, poorly plotted, uninspired, insultingly unfunny....just a terrible, terrible movie. Even Alec Baldwin, who is typically brilliant in supporting roles, is saddled with some sort of here-then-gone-again Texas accent which further underlines a lazy effort all around. Rumor has it that Sony's president of production will be losing her job over this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrey disappoints in lame comic effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, is this film a huge disappointment. I mean, with Jim Carrey's track record, along with supporting stars Alec Baldwin and Tea Leoni, this would figure to be hilarious.Right?! Well, don't always believe what you hear, especially when it comes to this remake of the midling 1977 film (starring George Segal, Jane Fonda and Ed McMahon).And while "King Kong" was a movie worthy of a re-deaux, that picture did not deserve such an effort. Still, it would be hard to imagine Carrey &amp; Co. not being at least somewhat funny here, but that's what happens.Dick and Jane Harper live in a nice home in the suburbs which they are fixing up day by day. They have a dog, Spot, a Mexican housekeeper and a little boy who only seems to speak Spanish. Dick is a successful promotions expert at Globaldyne Technologies, while Jane is employed at a travel agency.Just when their ship is starting to come in, however, and the day Dick becomes a vice-president, his company tanks. A clever scene does take place as he is questioned on a CNBC-type financial program about scandals in the organization he had no knowledge of. As he speaks, graphics announce the death of the company, how top officers have been accused of corruption and that the stock is taking a major dive.On the same day, Jane quits her job (not knowing, of course, what is happening at Globaldyne), so they are really in a pickle. Dick tries different jobs (including a clerk at a "Cost-Mart" and a day laborer ? he even gets deported), but he evidently has no skills necessary to now support his family and Jane is suddenly unable to work, either.They sell most of their possessions, let the maid go and trade in their BMW, but they still can't make ends meet (have they thought of unemployment?), so to avoid losing their home ? and here is the supposed funny part ? they turn to robbing people and stores to get money.I guess we're supposed to laugh when these two clowns, wearing a variety of disguises, including Sonny and Cher outfits and Bill and Hilary Clinton masks), commit strong armed robberies all over the place.Soon, they are living it up again, even getting most of their furnishings back, but a close call at a bank (yep, they were now going to rob a bank) persuades them to go after the real big bucks, Dick's old boss (Baldwin).A complicated scheme is put into the works to force him to turn over $400 million to the duo, but, of course complications arise. One of the major complications was that this movie was nowhere near humorous. I'm a pretty big Jim Carrey fan (with the exception of the two "Ace Ventura" films), but I hardly cracked a smile here.The situations just were not funny. For instance, they stick up a Starbucks and order a couple of coffees to go. Stupid. Sorry, but comedies by their very nature are supposed to make us happy. The only thing I was even remotely pleased with about "Fun With Dick and Jane" was that it ran only about 90 minutes.Thank goodness for small favors.</fullReview>
