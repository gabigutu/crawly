		<shortDescription>Charming and charmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What a Girl Wants" is a re-tooling/re-telling of William Douglas Home's "The Reluctant Debutante" with the devastatingly charming Amanda Bynes in the title role; in fact 'charming' is the operative word here -everything about the movie is charming, and charmed.The casting: impeccably superb. Amanda never hits a false note throughout the proceedings, creating a character who is genuinely believable, lovable and worth cheering for (there was a LOT of clapping in the theatre at various points in the film - I clapped AND whistled, myself); Kelly Preston is radiant as Daphne's mother Libby, a musician who still deeply loves Henry, Daphne's father, but has gone on with her life, and Colin Firth (as Daphne's father, Henry Dashwood) is a revelation here, in that he literally becomes more and more attractive as the tale unfolds - as he becomes more and more who he really is underneath his repressed exterior (the scene where he dons his black leather pants and prances in front of the mirror to the horror of his prim prude of a fiancee is priceless), and Oliver James as musician Ian, Daphne's love interest, makes a memorable splash here as well. Everyone else is perfect in their roles too (even the dog rocks). The screenplay and direction: completely on the mark. Never gets heavy-handed, contrived, mean-spirited, cloying or tedious, believe it or not. The charm is sustained throughout in a dazzling balance of comedy, heartfelt emotion, conflict and growth, culminating in one of the most satisfying resolutions I've experienced in a movie in a long time.Occasionally, a movie can have predictable elements without that being a bad thing; sometimes predictable elements can be pleasurable -- you realize what's going to happen but you also realize you're in such capable hands that you actually anticipate the playing-out of the scenes you know will occur. Sometimes it's not WHAT is done in a movie but HOW it's achieved, and WHO is doing the achieving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, like lighten up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The folks banging this movie have to get real. It's about an average girl (Bynes) who gets to meet her dad, who's in the process of running for major political office in England. It's not about Yankee superiority over the Brits (sheesh!), it's a simple fantasy about the effect a teenage girl has on her once-stuffy dad in stuffy society. If you're politically offended by this movie, imagine Amanda as a carefree Portugese girl visiting her long-lost dad, a member of U.S. Congress from Massachusetts, and chill out. That being said, Amanda Bynes is a cool and attractive leading lady/girl and plays very well with the other characters in this film. It's all been done millions of times before, and it's not Oscar material, but it was a pleasant diversion for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What this girl likes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I love this movie. It's sweet, it's simple, it's cute, and fun. It's clever and well put together. The scenery is great (what's not to love about London)? And Firth and Bynes were adorable. Colin Firth is great no matter what movie he's in, but Amanda Bynes (I've been a fan of hers since she was on Nickelodeon) was fun to watch and a perfect fit for the role of fun-loving Daphne. The rest of the cast was good as well, I loved the jokes that were thrown in and the silly/cute subplots going on (Peach and Pear). I appreciated that this movie didn't take itself too seriously, yet was certainly not all fluff or nonsense, either. I loved how this movie primarily dealt with a father-daughter relationship (so refreshing from other so-called teen movies that often only deal with a teenage romance) and I also loved how the main character, Daphne, was not angry or angsty, she was refreshingly fun and optimistic. Overall this is a good, clean fun movie that can be appreciated by all ages and audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun kid film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting a really bad, boring teen film like the Lizzie Mcguire movie, but this movie was entertaining. It's about a girl in America, Daphne, who goes to England to see her dad for the first time. He's a Lord, who is running for political elections, so of course, his handlers don't want any bad publicity. He takes a liking to her, but his finance and snooty soon-to-be stepdaughter don't like her. Daphne turns out to be a hit with the poparazi and has a lot of fun. After going to so many fancy parties, she starts to forget who she really is, but her new guy makes her realize where her true values lie. Along the way Lord Dashwood sees he's missing out on adventure and his true love, Daphne's mom. Will he give up the political dream to become an adventurer again? Watch to find out, but since this is a light-hearted film, you probably know the answer. There are some funny scenes throughout. And I liked the music.FINAL VERDICT: An entertaining clean, fun film that all ages can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute movie with a good message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a cute, clean movie that you can sit down and watch with your kids. Daphne has never met her father, so she takes off for England to find him. She discovers he is in the middle of an election for some public office. Daphne has to choose between becoming what he wants her to be and staying true to herself. And dad has to make a choice about what is really important.In response to the reviewer who slammed the movie as being anti British, and saying it was trying to say the American way is better, that is utter nonesense. This was not a typical British family--they were royalty and associated with people like them. Do you suppose the real Queen would find someone like Daphne amusing? Daphne's boyfriend was a decent young man who was also a bit off the wall and his own person--but he was an ordinary English kid, not a member of any royal family. There are circles here in America where Daphne's free spirit attitude would be frowned upon, too. Every country has "classes" that are snobbish and uptight and every country has "Daphnes"--good kids who just want to be themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming movie...Colin Firth makes it worth the admission price!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as I'm concerned, this movie gives us the perfect 'time out' from the daily grind. It's sweet, charming, and has a fine cast. Outstanding, of course, is Colin Firth. The reviewers who claim that this movie is great for the "under-13 and over 80" crowd just don't get it. There are many of us who will love Mr. Darcy forever, and who are in dire need of more Colin Firth movies. He is, of course, absolutely gorgeous in the movie, and has a lot of screen time. I would pay to watch and listen to him read a telephone book, so I will see this movie again and definitely will be among the first in line to buy the DVD.It was strange to see Anna Chancellor as his fiancee, a part which she played in much the same way that she portrayed Caroline Bingley. Her character wasn't good enough for Mr. Darcy, nor is this one suited for Lord Dashwood.Although numerous people have criticized the sweetness of the movie, I, who am hopelessly romantic, loved its ending. I left the theater feeling better than when I entered. (I felt the same way when "Bridget Jones's Diary" ended. Actually, I couldn't wait to see it again, since the final kiss was probably the best kiss I've seen in a movie. I digress. Sorry.) Although I realize that this movie isn't going to win any Academy Awards, it is still a wonderful way to spend an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was actually surprised by this movie. Yes, it was probably conceived by a marketing team. Yes, it isn't very original and yes, some of it is embarassingly obvious. That being said, I was very entertained by this movie. I thought it was well directed, and well acted. I wouldn't be surprised to see Amanda Bynes start taking on more serious roles in the future with great success. This movie does what it set out to do: entertain teenage girls. Anyone who is a fan of lighthearted tween comedies should check this movie out. It is better than most of the teenage girl movies out there and much better than that stupid Big Fat Greek Wedding movie. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trailers stank, Movie shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the theater today expecting a good movie. I was wrong. Why was I wrong? Because this was a GREAT movie!!!The trailers made this film look INSANELY cheesy. Since I know from experience that trailers are highly inaccurate, I was expecting a PARTIALLY cheesy flick. But what I saw had almost no cheese to it at all. What A Girl Wants, despite its unfortunate title, is what a LOT of people want, combining drama, comedy, romance, and self-discovery in an hour and 45 minutes of enjoyment.I didn't say insight, mind you, I said self-discovery. This is purely a narrative, not a deep thought movie, and it wouldn't have worked any other way. Kudos to Dennie Gordon for not trying to accent a theme that we're already familiar with, rather, she just throws it into the story, almost casually, so that we see the message of individuality but aren't repulsed by an overly blatant moral.Many of this film's detractors say that it's a rip of The Princess Diaries. Not true. Yes, it's an adaptation, but it's based on "The Reluctant Debutante", which was around for DECADES before Diaries was even conceived. Besides, while it is a little formulaic, there are a few twists.Many say it portrays inaccurate American/British stereotypes. Not true. Daphne and her mother are CLEARLY presented to be NOTHING like the average American, and Lord Dashwood only behaves so properly because of his political position.Amanda Bynes as Daphne Reynolds finally gets a chance to show of her incredible dramatic skills. (Moody's Point had too much of a satirical tone to properly show this.) Bynes has her glory moments of comedy alongside her touching moments as the girl who wants to understand who she is.Colin Firth as Henry Dashwood. Come on, who didn't already know Firth kicks butt? He is the center of every scene Bynes isn't in, and he carries that weight well.Eileen Atkins as Lady Dashwood does a tremendous job with her supporting role, who is far more crucial to the plot than anyone expected.Oliver James handles his theatrical debut well, showing much more emotion than the previews indicated. Libby Reynolds isn't a fully round character, but that's the script's fault, not Kelly Preston's. Both are capable singers, and considering that Bynes's one major performance flaw is lack of musical ability, I'm glad these two sang instead of her.In fact, basically the entire cast here was superb.See it, you'll be glad you did. Fine entertainment for almost everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfies the target audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie with my mid-teen sister who's exactly the target audience of this film. Now there are many films that are not for everybody, they do not excel in acting, directing, screenplay or effects to be called a 'good movie'. They are meant for certain part of the audience who, if it sticks to the specific formula, just love them. Now I wasn't meant to love "What a girl wants", but I guess, thinking from my point of view, it's a good diversion from me.The script is above the level I was expecting and young Amanda Bynes acted quite well. Colin Firth seemed a little wooden. There are bits of little innocent humors in places that makes it a relief to watch. The shooting locations and the sets are fine. The soundtrack too is catchy. So even the storyline is very very shallow, one should not complain or analyze too much about such films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's ALL about Colin :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read several reviews of this film, and I have to say that men just aren't going to "get" this one. Our local paper's reviewer said he just didn't get the "stars in the eyes" of the women leaving the theater. His review didn't even MENTION Colin Firth. Well, I will! Colin is what is going to attract women to this film, and he does not disappoint. He is the best thing about the movie. Amanda Bynes is cute, and I enjoyed her too. The rest of the cast is quite good too...Anna Chancellor (Caroline Bingley, for those Pride and Prejudice fans...), and Eileen Atkins, particularly. I found the storyline about the daughter longing for her father and the father who just discovered her quite sweet and moving. Yes, the script was a bit sloppy and the humor often falls flat, but overall, Colin Firth's performance made it worth seeing for me. This is definitely a chick flick, though :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it isn't even funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is a shame that Colin Firth agreed to appear in it, although at least we came to see a lesser known part of him: that of the leather-clad arm-swinging Angus-Young-style-jumping former rock musician.Sorry, but Amanda Bynes can't act. This would not be so noticeable in your average teen flick; the problem here is that her "charm" supposedly makes her be the object of attraction for a whole bunch of lads - even a cranky old princess gets fond of her, although the lady seems to like no one else, apart from her lapdog. Mmm...I immediately distrust any movie in which the transformation of a character is shown not by virtue of the plot or acting skills, but simply by a change of wardrobe and hairstyle. Scene #1: Amanda Bynes in jeans and T-shirt - the "free, fun and relaxed" teenager. Scene #2: Amanda Bynes in long evening dress - the composed young miss with a circumspect expression on her face. She has changed! Has she? Mmm...This brings to mind a previous comment by another user: "why does Amanda Bynes insist on one of those crap 'dancing like a berk while trying on clothes' montage scenes in every film she's ever made?" Yes, in fact, why are these 'trying on clothes' scenes in so many teenage films? Probably it has to do with the 'transformation of character' I mentioned before: the theory of filmmakers is that, as a teenager, you express yourself through what you wear. And since teenagers are still building their personality, this is symbolized with rapid, successive changes of clothes. Convinced? OK, right, maybe it is just because you need 90 minutes of film and only have material for 80.Oh, and those awful "everything fits perfectly" parts of the plot: mom appears at the ball exactly when she has to, perfectly dressed for the occasion; sudden boyfriend Ian is ubiquitous and has 'chosen' to perform all kinds of low-profile jobs, although he attended the best schools and therefore (very convenient) has at least a piece of the necessary substratum to be rightfully considered a peer by "Britain's snobbish upper class"; etc.Better see something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a stultifyingly dull and inept portrayal of Britain! This movie was obviously written by an American who doesn't understand our country, and has probably never even been here (at least not for any length of time).There were so many inaccuracies, not least the total misrepresentation of our political system, and the hopelessly outmoded portrayal of our "class culture".This is an England that does not exist, and has never existed!Worse still was the plot, which presented a nauseatingly sentimentalised picture of family life, not to mention a hopelessly unrealistic adolescent relationship.If you want a good British movie, you'd be much better off with "The Ghost of Greville Lodge", or "One Against the Wind".</fullReview>

Don't know how many "woww" "ahh" and "woohoo" sounds she made, but her shrieking frickin' annoyed me.The story was tame, and so done before, and done better I might add! Girl grows up without her father, wants to see her father, but of course he's some snobbish aristocrat moving in circles she doesn't belong in. Drama, drama, drama! Naturally, as always, things turn out alright. Colin Firth instills some awe, but then: he always does.To be fair, haven't seen Miss Bynes in any other films so don't know if she always sucks this bad, but based on this one: go find another profession!Overall, *YAY* Colin Firth; *AHHH* (horrified scream) for the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinderella and Old-Fashioned Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say from all the movies that I have watched in the last few weeks with Colin Firth since I recently became enamored of his talent in the A&amp;E production of "Pride and Prejudice," this movie is perhaps the best one that I have seen.It has all the elements of a good movie and Firth at his best. I love the characters and relationships and how they interact with each other. Daphne (Amanda Bynes) is perfect as the teenage daughter searching for the other half of her being and life and finding her father. Her cute little smile and perky American approach no matter what is happening to her portrays her "can do" attitude and determination in being herself.And I just have to say that this is Colin Firth in his element! He is fantastic as the Henry Dashwood character (hmmm . . . name seems Austen-ly familiar, don't it?) who suddenly finds out he is a father after 17 years. He is tender and sweet and unsure. Probably one of the best scenes ever in the film is during the "midnight snack" of Coco Pops in the kitchen where he learns that his wife didn't leave him for another man and had always been his even after all the years between. The emotions and thoughts rush over his face as if he is speaking them out loud and the viewer can see his internal struggle to remain calm with the overwhelming feeling of the bitterness he had experienced for all those years.There are so many perfect and good scenes in this movie with very little bloopers that it really can touch a viewer's heart. The areas especially with Henry and his daughter are extremely special.The last part of the film is symbolic when Henry Dashwood has a heart-to-heart with his mother, withdraws his candidacy, hits the man who had affected his life so extremely, and then walks into the bright sunlight with a deep breath. The viewer realizes that it is more than just being outside in the sunlight but that he finally came out of the dark after so many long years. He has finally found who he is and what he wants to do.Firth basically took my breath away. With the subsequent scene of him winning back his daughter and then his wife, the viewer has realized that this is one of those pictures that are forthrightly, just a deliciously good picture. This is one that makes you believe in old-fashioned love and fairy tales which seems to be so non-existent in today's film making industry.Firth has tremendous talent in saying something extremely vital by NOT saying something. Each scene where he was having discussions with Libby (Kelly Preston) either on the phone or in person, the viewer could read both characters thoughts and feelings and the amazing chemistry that existed after all that time apart.It was also better for the plot to have this international relationship struggle. If it had been in America ? especially these days ? the press would have made a big deal out of the girl's "native" upbringing but it probably would not have affected the father's political life.Everyone excelled in this movie and kudos to the director and screen writer for bringing such a sweet story to light.One last word is that no review of this movie can be complete without discussing the amazingly hilarious scene of Firth squeezing into his "old" black leather pants and t-shirt ? and earring? ? and dancing in front of a mirror. Each time that particular part plays, everyone bursts out laughing! He was just perfect! And lastly, Darcy was a gooder but Dashwood beat 'im hands down! Maybe it was because Dashwood can laugh at himself, sees the funny side of things, and chose to come into his own self-discovery of who and what he was and wanted to be.I still love Darcy but in this case, I'll take Dashwood!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely Oedipal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amanda Bynes is not the best actress in the world. Check out her TV shows to see what I mean.Transplant her prowess to "What a Girl Wants," and we have a strangely oedipal performance between a forty-some year old Brit and a teenager who neither talks nor looks anything like him. (No, Bynes does not have Firth's eyes, as the latter claimed in the film.)Both characters have on-screen relationships with other people. But the Bynes-Firth dynamic overshadows them all. They share infinitely many moments together. Firth's character tries to one-up Bynes' boyfriend after seeing them ride on a motorcycle. This tension that is supposed to be the result of a seventeen-year, father-daughter separation comes off too romantic, too adult. Blame that on the bumbling Firth and the overly mature Bynes that effectively destroyed their age difference.Not that it matters at the end. After all, nobody watches "Agent Cody Banks" for its special effects, or "Lizzie McGuire" for its intrigue. In the same way, "Girl" is an excellent vehicle for Bynes in her million different styles and dress-ups.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dennie Gordon has directed this comedy with sure hand. The play by William Douglas-Home was a hit in the London stage and it was filmed before as The Reluctant Debutante with Rex Harrison, Kay Kendall, Sandra Dee, John Saxon and Angela Lansbury in the cast. This new take on the same story is fun basically because of the cast that was assembled to play the main characters.Amanda Bynes has the right amount of charm to make her Daphne an endearing teen who is in search for a father she never knew. Colin Firth is a very good as the father. Kelly Preston has very little to do and it's a shame. Eileen Atkins, as the would be grandmother doesn't fare better, as it's the case with Jonathan Pryce.I recently caught up with it on DVD format and all that can be said is that it was mildly amusing as a typical comedy of this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Put an attractive, young tv-star in an airplane to Europe and you got your movie-hit. Where Hillary Duff went to Italy and became a singer, Amanda Bynes tries out England to meet her father, some big hot-shot up and coming politician. And those are just two movies from last year. The complete list of comparable stories is endless...We've all seen it before. Nice mom, cute girl, mean stepsister, father is about to mary to wrong woman... or maybe he doesn't? It's as cliched as it gets, but 'What a girl wants' wasn't as bad as many of those movies, nor as irritating as the 'going to Europe' 'Lizzie McGuire' movie.The big plus for the movie are it's main characters. Amanda Bynes is perfect in her role as young American girl discovering London, and Colin Firth is always a pleasure to watch (even though he played in the dreadful 'Bridget Jones' movie).A couple of things bugged me though. First off, those Englishmen have a serious security breach, with Bynes breaking in the house of a Lord and later breaking in at a fashion show with Prince Charles attending. Somehow I guess not...Biggest problem though was the 'Ian' person. We all think Bynes is gonna fall for him but she doesn't phone him, and later on she goes back to America without even saying goodbye... such an odd thing to do for a girl in love.The story isn't mindboggling whatso-ever, but I'm sure it's 'what the girls want' who like the Bynes show in the USA. Way better than the Duff movie, that's for sure. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The stereotypical plot, the stereotypical script, the stereotypical teenage chick flick. Well, it is, except for two elements. The first, Colin Firth is on a rampage as the new quintessential British aristocratic leading man and he nails this one yet again. Second, Amanda Bynes' character is written up with a surprisingly down to earth, non-self centric and in fact cheerfully bright and enthusiastically altruistic disposition, that is neither air-headed ditsy, not standard issue bitchy, self obsessed and vanity driven nor even an overtly docile, shy and demure type. This refreshing characterization is far more realistic than stereotypical characterization, which sort of streamlines teenage girls into only one or the other, which in reality, like all other people, they too have a bevy of emotions, intellectual needs and altruistic abilities. That's why this movie still can climb and triumph over lots more of its contemporaries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Daphne Reynolds is a girl who wants the one thing her life has been missing: her father Henry. Her mother met Henry in Mongolia when she was trying to hitch a lift and fell down a sand dune. They got married, and Henry took her back to England to live happily ever after. However, fate wasn't so kind. Apparently, British people are snobs and they hate Americans with a passion. (At least they got the second point true) Heartbroken, Daphne's mother leaves England and gives birth to our hero, Daphne. Since then, Daphne has always been passionate about meeting her father. That's exactly what a girl wants. And what does she do? Bugger off across the Atlantic! Off to England!Daphne finds her father's beautiful mansion and proceeds to get into the property by climbing over the wall. But whoops! She takes a tumble off the wall. The next line deducts an instant 25% from this film. A woman in the mansion sees this and says, 'Did you see that? An impossibly large bird fell from that wall.' Daphne finds her father and gives him the shocking news that she's his daughter. Obviously, this is a big shock to the family and they want to keep this story safe from the press so they decide Daphne should stay in the mansion. With a roof under her head, she's ready to turn Britain upside down and give them the cultural shock of a lifetime. England, forget al Queda. Judging from this film, Amanda Bynes is the number one threat to European society.A random fashion show turns for the worst when Daphne accidentally gets on the runway and has to pretend she's a model. With guys gawking and Willa Ford's 'I wanna be bad' playing, Daphne struts her stuff. So far, so good. But what's going to happen? She hasn't screwed up the show formally. What will happen? If you guessed, 'fall off the runway', you are correct! For those curious (and brave) enough to rent this one, I'll leave some fill in the blanks. This kind of genre is way to overdone that it's best not to whine on and on about the clichéd plot. I'll skip to the recap.Throughout her misadventures, Daphne tries to prove her new family and the press that Americans are down to earth, fun loving people who just want to fit into the world. Through her struggles as a fish out of water, Amanda Bynes has a certain charm that makes her character likable. A surprise highlight is seeing Colin Firth trying to bust a move in black leather pants. The movie isn't 'bad' but it's worth a late night if you're curious. Amanda's spunky and quirky performance is lovable and the English lad is easy on the eyes. Rent this if your bored but don't expect anything new at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let me just say that finding the star from "All That" and the worldly televised, "The Amanda Show" appropriately named after the star herself...who by the way, can't really act to begin with, must have been a difficult challenge for the makers of this film. To star someone with such raw talent, and inability to actually act different from the way she does on her show. Pathetically I have seen it, only on days when there is still nothing to watch after 500 channels. The film itself was badly written, and it could've been an actually good movie, had they spent some time researching what they were doing, before they started out on the project. Everything was too crammed together. For instance, she [Bynes] meets Ian [Oliver James] at a hotel, and two minutes after that they're walking along a bridge in the city together, talking as though they've been friends for years. It's a little too unrealistic. The only thing that made me stay for the film and actually held the film together, the glue if you will, was Colin Firth of course, who was really the only star next to Kelly Preston, (who don't even get me started on what I thought of her acting ability-or lack there of in this film-if you could even call it that.), and Anna Chancellor who was in my opinion even better than Firth in this project. You may remember (which I had a hard time with) her from Four Weddings and a Funeral. In this film, she played the soon to be (and already evil part) evil step-mother. Chancellor's daughter, which was played by Christina Cole, which was also not bad, compared to Bynes, who's character, frankly, could've been played by anyone. I will say one nice thing about Bynes though. She certainly has a figure. She is a very pretty girl, and that will probably lead to more roles and more films, however, I just hope all those directors and film makers are prepared for her acting styles, how little she might have. One last thing, as bad as the movie was, I'm still a sucker for happy endings, and this one was nothing less than that. As predictable as the ending might have been, I really liked it, and won't lie. I had a few tears filling up. So if you're just like me and a sucker for happy endings, try out the flick. You might be silly....and actually like it. I give this movie a 5 out of 10 (10 being the highest) and that's being kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie shows teenagers, guys or girls to not be afraid to be themselves no matter what others say about them. Other people around the world don't understand our way of life, so they laugh because we are different. In the Movie Amanda does a great job portraying Daphne as a cool American teen who wants to learn more about herself. What teenager doesn't want that?! Its not insulting its trying to show people what America is about, being an individual. It was a great movie that I enjoyed. I'm 17, my brother's girlfriend saw it, she's 16 and my sister saw it and she's 13, we all liked it. My two guys cousin's saw it too, they are 14 and 13 and they laughed so hard they cried. Therefore I think this movie is one anybody at any age can see and enjoy. Unless you're super sensitive and believe everyone is out to make Americans look bad. I give this movie a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was a joyless outing. no real laughs to be found. did I read that right? did one the other reviewers mention Lucille Ball and Amanda Bynes in the same breath?? NOT!!! Amanda is an attractive young girl,but I wouldnt say she's anything "Hot". Her acting here fares a little better than BIG FAT LIAR in which she was dreadful,more posing than acting,although there are "dress up" and "watch me dance" segments in here as well. She has a free spirit Mom who tells her of the well-to-do father in england she's never met. even though 17 years have gone by Mom hasnt dated or married anyone new,and Dad,well he's not as celibate,but you can just GUESS how the movies gonna end(especially ifd you've seen PARENT TRAP) this movie had implausibilities like Swiss cheese has holes,but even with far-fetched plot devices aside,you just couldnt find anything to love. BORING. Go see FREAKY FRIDAY instead.</fullReview>

The story has an unbelievably false plot. Besides, the jokes are incredibly stupid, I would not go so far as tosay this movie is a comedy, it is some weird hybrid between a extremely bad movie and and lame pseudo comedy. Don't watch it it is a waste of both time and money.The only good I can say is about the main character, the girl, Amanda Bynes,. she is quite a woman, but it does not help much with this kind of bad movie she is acting. I would not even compare this movie to some Hollywood classics or good comedies. Mayvbe this movie would be for teenage girls</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film on a plane, which perhaps gives some indication of its overall quality. However, it has its moments of clarity from time to time.The main problem with the film, though, is the horrible casting decision of selecting Amanda Bynes to portray a "free spirit." This presents a huge stumbling blook to the audience -- how are we supposed to believe that such a doe-eyed girl is a street-savvy New Yorker? Her hair is too straight, her wardrobe too designer to be a really down-to-earth girl. (Also, she's got bank! How else could she have skipped town, on Virgin no less [I wonder how much they paid for that snippet], without getting any money from her mother?) Hearing lines 'you were born to stand out' describing Bynes' character provokes laughter... As if any girl who wears a Kangol hat now and again is cosmopolitan!Apart from that minor (I jest) flaw, the movie isn't terrible. A few of the characters are mildly interesting, enough to keep me somewhat attentive. The film could certainly stand to do without the cheesy "I yam who I yam" moralizing, but, in the end, the film was entertaining, I stayed awake, and I guess that just about says enough.</fullReview>

I saw it for free with my media class - there's no way in hell I'd pay to go see a movie like that. I wanted paying just for sitting through it!

		<shortDescription>May be remembered as her best work - charming, almost impeccable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review written in late 2013 at a time when Ms. Bynes career seems to have derailed and we wish her the best. In her career to date, the two most accomplished works she has left for us are this film, WHAT A GIRL WANTS, and the work she did a few years later, SHES THE MAN. Will deal with the latter first. SHES THE MAN is one of a small sub-sub-sub class of Hollywood products that attempts to build a movie around the notion of a woman disguised as man. There are at least a dozen of these floating around the IMDb. The writing in SHES THE MAN is way above average, and the supporting cast is perfect. But it is Bynes who steals the show there, possibly doing the most impressive male-female switch in film history. And speaking of stealing the show, that is exactly what she does in WHAT A GIRL WANTS. (The title never seemed a good match to the actual film, which builds slowly and successfully to a satisfying conclusion). Playing opposite a stellar cast (Colin Firth? Wow!) Bynes provided the perfect mix of energy, youth and charm to move this movie into a class of its own. She "owns" the role and once you have seen the film, it is hard to imagine anyone else doing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A princess story that stands tall, v 1.00</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have noticed a genre that might be termed 'late-ish teens princess story' and until now I could not really like the ones that I have on disk. So, if the genre was widened a bit to include Trachtenberg's Ice Princess then yes, and there will be many okay stories in such a wider genre. I consider the wider genre to be too relevant, best not maimed in this way. The traditional princess story is a very ancient genre and I prefer to link this sub genre to that. * Then I obtained the two disk set of Mandy Moore's Chasing Liberty (2004) and Amanda Bynes' What A Girl Wants (2003) and this genre was suddenly different. Both of these stories stand tall. True, technically the word Princess does not fit here, but it is close enough, even though Amanda's character is only 39th in line to the throne and Mandy is only a USA style temporary princess? That is all that I need to know about either story. These are stuff that I can really like. More. What A Girl Wants breaks with tradition. Amanda is 16 playing a 17. Not a 20 playing an 18 or 15. Not an 18 playing a 15. So unusual. Director commentary: Real princesses were used as extras at the Henley scene. Detail to hope to ignore: The last of the scenes set in London. What sort of UK political party would display the flag in this way at a political meeting? This is made for an audience with USA type understandings, not UK? Unless this is a comment re UK politics? In England this is equivalent to Amanda's dad, Lord Dashwood, having been working to be elected to parliament as a member for a UK type K.K.K.? I personally consider UK politics to be askew but that does not feel like the right parallel, though it does hint at too far to the right. With the possible exception of Hairspray, all the Amanda that I have, so far, end in disaster if I interpret them literally from the cues that I notice. That is likely just me, a private language sort of thing. For me, the most subtle is the ending of She's The Man and that is only a box of Gouda that has me wondering if that magnificent story really ends in disaster. I get that by considering a 1980's horror story called ET. For me, the ultimate Amanda scary ending is Love Wrecked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rich are bad, the poor are good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually liked the beginning of this movie, but as it goes on, the bashing of the rich just turns embarrassing. The message is not cleverly introduced with stealth and guile - it is driven home with a sledgehammer in every single scene. All characters who are rich and comfortable with it are BAD. All characters who are poor, or who are rich but side with the poor, are GOOD. Example: Daphne and her mother, poor, good. The servants, poor, good. The love interest, poor, good - gives wise speeches about how wearing a long dress and not listening to trash is "betraying yourself". Henry Dashwood and his mother, rich but like the poor better, good. On the other hand: Anna who Henry is going to marry, rich and doesn't apologize for being so, bad. Anna's daughter, rich and doesn't apologize, bad. Anna's daughter's love interest, rich and doesn't apologize, bad and racist and ridiculously self-centered.When Daphne decides to stop being a child who makes a scene wherever she goes, a dark veil is pulled over her pretty features. From then on we see a collection of scenes with Daphne in fancy clothes and walking instead of running - naturally with no smile, sad, soulless. How terrible to wear a long dress and matching earrings! It sucks the soul out of you! Away, away upper-class ways! Only the bohemian is wise and human. High heels are hell heels.No, this is not a very good story. The propaganda takes center stage and never leaves, and from the moment Daphne meets her father - I guess I should call him "her old man" lest I sound too upper-class and therefore evil - you know exactly what is going to happen. It is light versus darkness. Warmth versus cold. Good versus evil. Poor versus rich. Slave morality all the way - and nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Third Short of Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What a Girl Wants" is a FAIRY TALE (insert "Parent Trap" here) so those who do not like that type of story need not watch, but just being a fairy tale is no basis for criticism. It is an updated remake of 1958's "The Reluctant Debutante" starring Sandra Dee and Rex Harrison, which itself was based on a 1956 play by William Douglas Home. Home is partially credited with both screenplays although he died in 1992. The basic premise is even older as the humble child who discovers a royal parent is a staple of ancient fairy tales.The current version is a pretty decent effort, you could even say that it is 2/3's of an excellent movie. It starts off nicely and proceeds in a very entertaining manner well past the midway point. You are just about to conclude that this is an extremely underrated film when the wheels fall off (insert Colin Firth whisking his daughter away on a motorcycle), from that point the film wobbles lamely along until it thankfully recovers its balance just before its final scene.The only other major problem is the cliché Yank-Brit characterizations and the exploitative use of the Royal Family in several scenes. Yanks are fun and funky, Brits are staid and stuffy, most upper class Brits are evil incarnate-with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. You are warned about it going in, this general stupidity is reflected by the promotional poster of an American flag t-shirt between the British guards. The exuberance of Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) would have played better if the other performances were toned down a few notches. Doubles of and references to the Royal Family are completely unnecessary and simply distract from what is supposed to be a father-daughter-bonding story.The best scene happens early, Daphne and her mother are working a local wedding when she discovers the missing groom passed out under a table. She puts ice down his shirt and when he emerges frantically twisting around to remove it, Daphne signals her mom's band to play "Shout" and then mimics the groom's movements. I see no basis for the criticism of Amanda Bynes in this film. She plays her high energy self and successfully ratchets back a few notches for the serious scenes. In essence director Dennie Gordon has her play two characters which is the basis of the story's theme as her character must reluctantly conform and work at being someone she is not. Under Gordon's direction and working with a skilled ensemble Bynes nails the character so well that it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role. She is not on Brittany Murphy's level yet but she progressing nicely. Two similar scenes really play to her strengths, the fashion runway scene and the grand entrance to the party for Peach &amp; Pear, the film is worth watching just for those moments.The widescreen edition DVD is a great value as it has some excellent special features including an unaffected commentary by Bynes. They had a lot of audio problems during production and Bynes provides very good behind the scenes information about what the actors had to do to correct this after the actual shooting was completed.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

It was not stupid, or ridiculously contrived like Lizzy McGuire or the remake of Parent Trap, or even the absurd Princess Diaries that leave you wondering why Julie Andrews couldn't see through the lame plot.

		<fullReview>7.5 / 10 ****'A good film. By no means is this film intellectually taxing, or complicatedly structured, but then, it doesn't pretend to be.It's a simple teen romantic comedy which features all of the expected codes and conventions for the genre. Anna Chancellor and Jonathan Pryce shine as the 'villains' of the piece while Eileen Atkins excels as the archetypal British Aristocrat. I can honestly see the appeal of the very talented Oliver James, especially to the young girls in the cinema when I saw the film, his presence on screen is very convincing and his musical talent is outstanding. But, is it bad that I now fancy the Father character more than the romantic lead?! Colin Firth was wonderful as usual. His charisma lights up the screen and his portrayal as the rebellious Lord was wonderful, however, it was watching him trying to get into a 1970's pair of trousers which stole the show. Well done Mr. Firth.All in all, an enjoyable easy-going film, well worth the hour and a half it takes to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>***1/2 out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew from the moment that I heard the line `No hugs dear I'm British, we only show affection for dogs and horses' that I was in over my head, as the jokes don't get much better with patience. So maybe I will hate myself in the mourning but at the same time What a Girl Wants is a film that is so nice, modest and organized towards what it needs to say that it would be my great dishonour to renounce it for having a happy ending. Films like this are often taken for granted because of unbelievable stories, continuity problems and characters who if not falling under the sweet category, fall somewhere between wicked and annoying. But I think somewhere a film this focused on happiness needs to be regarded to some extent. Still it is not of my interest or that my readers to sit and pick apart what should have been done better, what should have not been done at all and any basic principal in story for that matter. In truth it is senseless to pick out formulas in these movies because they all follow the same basic pattern, if you?ve seen once...you've got the idea. In reality, the conclusion that I bestow upon you all is that in a world that needs a positive touch, a warm hand on the shoulder can't do us any harm. So although this film may be far from perfect, its over exertion to care with such precision and dignity is what makes it worthy of the time. Amanda Bynes has the eyes in which all the curiosity of the world is stored, giving her the exact note in which to draw from to bring her character Daphne to life. Daphne's story would be a sad one to any teen girl living it, but her gracious smile indicates that she will receive no less than what she bargained for in the first place. So what is her story anyway? Daphne is a girl who has a father but has never met him and in turn he is not aware of her existence. It comes as quite a shock when she runs away to Britain in search of not only her father, but that mysterious figure that inherits her dreams. The problem is that Daphne is a simple American girl and her father, Henry, is a posh British politician. As circumstance would have it, Henry to be engaged to the largest snob a movie studio could dream up. And if there is one cliché I can't stand more than the irritation of a snobbish fiancé, its that of a snobbish step child, whose nose appears to be so far in the air that I'm sure she can smell the clouds. Those young girls who have already saw the Princess Diaries and Cinderella know where I am going with this and to everyone else, rest assured your deaf ears have probably already taken the better part of your interest out of this film. With formulas already set in, it comes as no surprise there are many teenage difficulties that don't check out at the boarder, for without them a story could not survive, and a young audiences attention span would be stretched to the limits. Most noteworthy of the problems is the pressures of conformity, if I should be so bold as to dare think that this film's target audience would understand such a statement. In turn our beloved `ugly duckling' is plagued with the guilt of being the odd one out even though through either irony, or poor writing, she seems to bring nothing but goodness to all that she touches. Indeed this royal family believes that she must smoothen those American edges and become a proper young lady but in a scene of obligatory sentiment effective to those willing to invest in it, she is told `it's not the crown that makes the queen, it's in the heart.' So maybe this film has been made before under a different name with different actors and different purposes but what draws ones attention to its own sense of urgency is how much it cares about the success of its characters. Writers Jenny Bricks and Elizabeth Chandler realize that sending a teenage girl after her dreams adherers to no unhappy moments because when you are a teenager in search of something meaningful, dreams are the ones with the most magnificent imaginations. What a Girl Wants is the kind of film that mothers with gladly take their daughters to see because it was smart enough to realize that family values have more meaning than ideas of them. Many directors can show a happy families, but Dennie Gordon creates one. The problem is that the politics of them family seem more a concern than the benefits, a shame because in a world of fairy tale dreams coming true, the only leaders should be the mind's determination to succeed. So what exactly is What a Girls Wants many of you may be wondering? It's unlikely, and pretentiously flawed but at the same time, a delightful showcase of such light-hearted nurture and care that, well, it's probably exactly what any girl would want.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a Girl Wants (2003) Amanda Bynes, Colin Firth, Kelly Preston, Eileen Atkins, Anna Chancellor, Jonathan Pryce, Oliver James, Christina Cole, D: Dennie Gordon. Reworking from the same pedigree as THE PRINCESS DIARIES and THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE, a seventeen-year-old girl (Bynes), raised by her equally free-spirit mother in Chinatown, N.Y., has dreamed her whole life of finding her father after always hearing the same story of how her parents met in Morocco. When she goes to England in search of the well-off aristocrat she's never seen, he is surprised to hear of his unannounced daughter.Bland but cute Cinderella fairy tale should play well for a young girl. Also showcases an expert British cast and the perky actress, who's the host of her self-named TV comedy show on Nickelodeon, and goes to show that she does have the screen presence and likeability of Sandra Lee.Running Time: 105 minutes and rated PG for mild language.** ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie fun to watch and thought the story moved along at a fairly decent pace. The shots of London were great as were the interior shots of the elegant houses. Colin Firth is always great as is young Oliver James...absolutely yummy. He will definitely be one to keep an eye on in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Girl Wants is heartwarming and very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not offensive to Brits, I'm a Brit and in the movie all of the characters act how they're supposed to act, with the bad guys acting bad and the nice ones acting nice. There's hardly any awful accents or Hollywood misconceptions of Britain in there. Sure it might seem that Glyniss and Clarissa are unbelievably snobby but some upper class people are like that and I think the actors have got the personalities down to a tea!It's comical, which is why it can get away with using stereotypical British personalities, it makes you laugh. Yes it's predictable, but in a movie like this predictability is something that doesn't matter. What a Girl Wants is heartwarming and very funny. It's definitely one for the girls but it's also good as a family movie. Amanda Bynes gives her greatest performance yet and Colin Firth is the only man who could have played Henry. He plays a good role in the film as does Kelly Preston, Oliver James, Eileen Atkins, Anna Chancellor, Christina Cole and most of the other cast. A pleasing fairy-tale plot that will leave you pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a girl Wants was a good movie because many people can probably relate to Daphne's situation. I thought this movie was good because it was different. Her father never actually got mad at her and their relationship was sweet. They had so much in common. Amanda Bynes plays a very fun character who makes you just want to be her. Oliver as "Ian" was good too. People are easily drawn to his music and his voice, but his actions make you want to stay. I thought it was weird how Ian says "Why are you trying so hard to fit in, when you were born to stand out?" and then after that she changes into someone who actually does fit in and is basically boring. Wouldn't you think she'd be that way in the beginning and change into a more fun person in the end? But it all worked out well and they were a good match. Every role was well played out. I give it 4/5 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)Amanda Bynes gives a forgettable performance as Daphne Reynolds, the girl whose always wanted a father. Colin Firth gives a forgettable, but quite worthy performance as Lord Henry Dashwood, the father she always wanted. This movie is absolutely terrible, and the editing could have been loads better. Without the many, many tedious song-and-dance scenes that filled the writing gaps in this movie, I expect it wouldn't be more than forty-five minutes long.</fullReview>

The story is cute, lotsa laughs; especially the part when the political Lord Dashwood (Colin Firth) danced in front of the mirror in his tight leather pants.But I'm wondering if Kelly Preston really sang those songs or from records?Good movie, I'll get the DVD as soon as it release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This lighthearted tale starts with Daphne Reynolds(played very well by Amanda Bynes) who is living with her musican mom(Kelly Preston). But really wants to find who her birth father is. When she discovers that her father is a British Polition named Herny Dashwood(well acted by Colin Firth). When Daphne goes flees England to try meet him. She soon discovers, that trying to fit in to his lifestyle is actaully quite complicated. A well done movie. That seems to remind you of The Parent Trap and The Princess Diaries. A perfectly well written story. And perfectly well acted by Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth, and everybody else. If you're in the mood to see a lighthearted movie. Then you'll love this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film with Amanda Bynes is a step up from her pathetic acting career on Nickelodoen's "All That," but it is still simplistic and run of the mill. it is a cinderella story that is all too perfect and it is a bad example for the young girls watching who will be able to think life works out that perfectly. As an emerging actress, Bynes has her moments, but for the most part the movie is amateur and lacks any real substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful surprise that endears while you cheer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The camera loves Amanda Bynes! Her girl-next-door good looks and effusive smile shine through the lens and light-up every scene of `What a Girl Wants.' The director uses Amanda's vibrance effectively to contrast the staid, stiff English aristocracy of which her father, Lord Henry Dashwood (Collin Firth), is an up and coming politician.Daphne arrives in England to meet the father she's always wanted but never knew just as Henry is poised to become England's next prime minister. Her arrival is none too welcome in the eyes of Henry's plotting fiancé, her sinister daughter, and her father who, as handler of Henry's political career, stands to gain significant social stature if Henry is only kept away from that bloody American trailer trash. The movie spends most of its time resolving the conflicts between these characters, Daphne's mother, and a love interest played by heartthrob Tom Harper.`What a Girl Wants' admittedly shares some plot lines with other movies in this genre including `Parent Trap' and `The Princess Diaries.' What endeared me to this movie, however, were two authentic performances, first by Collin Firth as the manipulated father robbed of the knowledge of his daughter for the past 17 years, and second, by Amanda Bynes as the daughter without a Dad seeking to put the missing pieces in place. There are some very touching scenes to go along with all the laughs.`What a Girl Wants' is easy to recommend and is sure to please any but the most tired and crusty of critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Combination Cinderella with Henry James Plot Aspects Added</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking the film for what it was, I found it to be pleasant, diverting entertainment. The Cinderella aspects were self evident; the lead character, Daphne Reynolds, even makes comments to this effect. This film is a remake, so, alas, I cannot comment on the similarities and differences between remake and predecessor. Nevertheless, the new version seems to owe a debt to Henry James.For most of the audience, the film's debt to Henry James is not evident. Henry James, an American novelist living in Europe, portrayed expatriate Americans interacting with Europeans. James often contrasted the innocence of Americans with the more worldly Europeans. For example, in James' book, "The American," the wealthy American businessman, Christopher Newman, cannot discern how an amateur Parisian artist's copy of a painting is inferior to the original in the Louvre.Daphne is not as naive as Newman, however the young American teenager learns much about her father and her life during the course of the film. Most of the films' jokes center around the contrasting outlooks of the vivacious (but socially inexperienced) Daphne and her British upperclass father. As usual, Colin Firth is very good at playing these overly reserved British stereotypes. Amanda Bynes exudes the liveliness one expects of a young woman of this age group.As with most films aimed at teenagers, there are numerous rock and pop tunes. The present film contains a perfectly acceptable instrumental score by Rupert Gregson-Williams, but his original score is relegated to accompanying scenes which portray the stilted behavior of the British. Except in the most capable director's hands, the use of pop songs with vocals in movies tend to detract from rather than to enhance the action on screen. The popular music placement in "What a Girl Wants" is less obnoxious than in other movies, so one cannot consider this movie to be an "illustrated soundtrack."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>100% cliche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing it twice at the movies (free tickets, don't ask) I have to say I have mixed feelings for 'What a Girl Wants.' I feel like I've only seen half the movie or I've been ripped off. Amanda Bynes's character, Daphne, could have been developed far more than she was. She perhaps wasn't as extreme as she could have been... sure, she was sort of "rough around the edges" but she could had more of an attitude or wild personality to make it more interesting. Amanda Bynes had some convincing moments, but as a whole it seemed like she displayed much less emotion than she could have.However, it wasn't all bad. I enjoyed the inside joke of Anna Chancellor (Caroline Bingley from the BBC version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice) playing Henry Dashwood's fiancée. Colin Firth, as usual, did an excellent job of serious-exterior-but-warm-hearted Dashwood, with a couple of good one liners. Oliver James was very well cast also, he seemed genuinely very charming and believable. The movie had a few very amusing scenes that will get most people laughing (think slap-stick humour.)Overall, only see this chick flick if you're a Darcy-lover or pre-teen. Some lighthearted entertainment, a bit of fun, but expect nothing more than a corny, predictable script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Teenage Cinderella Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daphne(Amanda Bynes) has always dreamt about meeting her father and when she finally turns seventeen, she goes to london to search for him. Her father Henry(Colin Firth) is a wealthy british politician and Daphne's free-spirited and outgoing personality might not be the best thing for him. Daphne is not well liked by Henry's new wife and snobby stepsister and now Daphne must not only get to know her father but also her own true self-identity. I thought this movie was like a modern teenage cinderella story added with a little bit of humor. It's a entertaining little movie, but not everybody will enjoy it, it's aimed more into the teenage audience. I think Amanda Bynes did a great job, she is a very good actress for her age and she is also very cute. Anyways, back to the movie, I would give What a Girl Wants 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was a nice way to waste time, and I will probably buy it on Dvd when it is released. Its sweet and harmless, and funny. It is not too original, but I really do not care and I enjoyed the actors on the screen and just a release from the daily grind and being able to watch a movie without too much vulgarity and vioence. Plus Ian wasn't too bad to look at either. This film is not going to win any Oscars, but I don't think it ever wanted to. Its just a nice chick flick to watch on a rainy day.

		<shortDescription>One stereotype after another</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a silly movie that contained every possible stereotype of the British upper class that exist. They all live in huge guarded mansions, filled with masterpieces of art and gilt furniture. None of them have the ability to show affection, except to dogs and horses (even stated in the film!). There is always one royal who loves uninhibited Americans with bad manners. Their families will disown them if they marry outside their class--and of course the lovers will always be blissfully happy, though poor as church mice and produce charming, balanced children. The wicked stepmother/stepsister are always snobbish, social climbers. British politicians can always find the right words for the public but cannot manage a coherent sentence in their private lives.There are plenty of American stereotypes as well. Hippy mothers are perfect, drive silly vans, etc.What's with the obsession with Jane Austin? Why is Firth's character named Dashwood? I can't believe I am the only person to notice this!Acting critique: Firth over-acted to the point of being laughable. The wicked steps were one-sided, silly characters. Amanda was cute, though, which is what I guess was the point of the movie. Bottom line--harmless drivel, a film to share with your romantic 10 year old, if there isn't a good Disney film available.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie delivered much more than what I was expecting out of it from the trailers. I have never seen Amanda Bynes in anything prior to this, I have only read the good and the bad comments about her on the internet. She was outstanding as Daphne, the main character who goes out in search of her British father. I also just picked up last week's TIME magazine, where they compare her to the likes of Lucile Ball and Gilda Radner. Those are definitely some huge names to compare a 17-year-old to. I think Colin Firth great. I thought this was an odd pick for him to take, but he was wonderful in the movie, as Lord Henry, Daphne's father. Kelly Preston also adds to a decent cast as Daphne's mother. The movie had a good plotline and was fun and enjoyable. Not too dramatic, yet still light hearted and fun to see. On character that I thought was so fun was Lord Henry's mother, played by Eileen Atkins. She definitely made you laugh in almost every seen where she's on screen. Overall, If you are in the mood for a light comedy it's a good flick for you to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only thing that manages to save this After School Special is its charm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must be getting sentimental. A movie like this should earn a scathing review. It's a fluff piece; syrupy sweet with fantasy frosting. Enough to give you a mouthful of cavities by the time you leave the theatre. And then there's the underlining drama, which really isn't all that dramatic.But then, seventeen-year-old Amanda Bynes, with her silky long hair, puffy cheeks and baby doll eyes is able to draw our attention away from such details. The all-American girl, she breezes through this movie, almost dancing, with a delicate grace that pacifies us, an energy that makes us smile.But Amanda is unhappy. She has been raised well by her mother but has never met her father. While catering weddings with her mom, she's seen her share of Father-Daughter dances. As she watches, she is reminded that she'll never enjoy such a moment. It breaks her heart.So she decides to hop a plane and pay her old man a visit! In London! Let the hijinks ensue!Along the way, she meets Oliver James, a young British heartthrob who gives a fine performance as a mysterious bad boy musician. She falls for him. And there's Jonathan Pryce, who is wonderful at twirling a mustache--if a bit obvious. Too bad he's underused. Kelly Preston also makes a few appearances as Amanda's wedding-singer mom, but again, not enough of them.The real compliment to Bynes (as is intended) is Colin Firth. He's great as her long lost dad, who just happens to be a British Lord. He was once a carefree spirit who threw caution to the wind. Now he's a stuffed shirt with a stiff upper lip. And guess what! He's engaged to be married. His fiancé is equally uptight with a daughter of her own (can you say "evil step sister?").The story isn't new. In fact, it's the latest in a long line of "Reluctant Debutante" knockoffs. The fairytale concept is all too familiar: beautiful young girl from modest upbringing seeks out long lost father. Will he accept her? Can she find a place in his life? Will he want her to change? Will she change him? (Will she knock evil sis on her royal butt?) Will they live happily ever after?I dare not reveal! No! But then I really shouldn't have to. The plot is predictable. The characters: cliché. The only thing that manages to save this After School Special is its charm--there's nothing reluctant about it.2.5 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes charm is enough to carry the day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All movies are not masterpieces, nor were they meant to be. Light, escapist entertainment has its place, and sometimes it can be just what you need.In a week filled with war and destruction, an annoying head cold, college rejections, car dent repair, and an unexpected tax bill running to 5 digits (!), escapism was definitely something the doctor ordered. And that is just what What a Girl Wants provides, critics be damned.Yes it's predictable and corny, yes it's derivative and heavily influenced by The Princess Diaries, yes it strains credibility, yes its production values are suspect, and yes it must have have run out of money when it came to creating its opening titles, BUT sometimes charm is enough to carry the day, and charm it has up to its American and English ears.The lead actress Amanda Bynes plays cute and perky so effortlessly and naturally, you can't help but like and root for her, regardless of the lame things she might have to do and say. And there are not one but TWO Prince Charmings - newcomer heartthrob Oliver James as her boyfriend and the thinking woman's heartthrob Colin Firth as her long-lost dad.Oliver is just as cute as Bynes and as nice and sensible as a cool guy can be, and he can actually sing, too. If this role is a good indication of his charm and appeal, he has a pretty bright future ahead of him.Colin Firth plays his role with the depth, sincerity and integrity you've come to expect from all his performances. He actally succeeds in making you believe he really could be a man who finds the love child - of his one true love - that he never knew he had, and that he could change his life for them. In the hands of a lesser and less charming and attractive actor, the man would have been little more than a corny plot device. But Firth provides the heart and heft of the movie and makes his character someone you grow to like and really care about (and maybe fantasize about, too - as the fantasy father or husband, depending on your demographic).As the title makes clear, this is a film for girls, so everyone else beware, (unless you have an Amanda fixation). But it's also for girls of riper vintage - note the TWO Prince Charmings - who should be more than willing to succumb to their princely charms.Don't go to this movie expecting the wit of Clueless or the intelligence of Ever After. It's a lightweight modern-day fairy tale which sometimes misses its mark. But it provides a diverting ninety minutes of escapism, megawatt charm from its stars, and smiles, laughs, and awws aplenty for its targeted audience.</fullReview>

However, I was quite astonished at the drama that balanced out the foretold comedy. Colin Firth and Amanda Bynes gave extraordinary performances within a limited field. Both actors were given an opportunity to display their talents by demonstrating a spectrum of emotions within their respective characters. A person watching the movie goes through a wide range of emotions. Yes, this storyline is a bit over used. But who doesn't want to find fulfillment and happiness in one's own family?</fullReview>

It isn't a very original script but all the actresses and actors are good and have good chemistry together! Amanda Bynes has a show called the Amanda Show its really daft and full of nonsense so it was good to see her play a realistic role and it has a mix of humour and seriousness in it! You may not want kids below 7 or 8 to see it because they won't understand it and they may get bored. I really enjoyed this movie! If you are having a sleepover with a few friends this is definitely recommended! By the way, it has Oliver James who is like, really gorgeous!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What a Girl Wants" had elements of "Cinderella", the "Princess Diaries", and "The Parent Trap", plus probably a dozen others that don't come immediately to mind. Still, the idea of a son or daughter looking for their long-vanished mom or dad really never gets tiresome if it is done well. I watched this with my sis, Natalie, while waiting for 5PM to attend my 40th high school class reunion. The following summary contains SPOILERS so I hope no one reads further.Mom and dad had a brief romantic fling in a foreign country almost 20 years ago, he of royalty brought her home to his elaborate estate in London, but his manager found out she was pregnant so it was arranged to look like each wanted out of the relationship, she went back to the USA, he bacame a powerful politician, never knowing that he had a child. The child now 18 and out of high school, knows who her father is so goes to London to find him. Lots of situations develop, many around her dad's plans to marry his manager's daughter, who also has a mean daughter (wicked stepsister!). Mom eventually shows up, they find out that the manager had falsified the communications almost 20 years earlier to get them to split, he was put in his place, mom and dad realized they both never lost love for each other, they all end up as one happy family, dad stating that his family was more important than his political career. Hokey, but moderately fun. Best audience would be teenage girls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, Delightful Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This above average comedy about growing up improves on its predecessor pushing the envelop between comedy and drama, smoothly combining both elements making this movie a much more intelligent, mature, and delightfully entertaining movie. Both the teenagers and the adults in this movie get equal time and the ending isn't the result of the teenager's initiative but of the adult. The physical comedy is funny, except for the obvious take from Miss Congeniality and Sandra Bullock's fall on the carpet. The ballroom dance scene almost gets out of hand in stupidity but makes up for it in its dramatic flourish at the end. Overall, this is a well balanced and funny, dramatic movie that is a solid impressive movie. The ending is even a balanced compromise, a reflection of reality, and one that is not seen in most teen comedies. Bravo. Eight out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not That Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was prepared to hate this movie because of Amanda Bynes and her awful Nickelodeon show. However, I gave it a watch and I actually liked it. Colin Firth did an excellent job as the English Politician. It's not as bad as people say it is, they probably hate it because they think it will be like the Amanda show which it is not. I think teens can probably relate to how Daphne (Bynes) feels when she does not have her dad. I felt like it was a bit like the Princess Diaries. I would not say i loved it but it is one good movie. I recommend it to teens because they will appreciate this sort of movie more. Overall, not bad some parts were very sad and some very funny. A good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching father/daughter dances is just another day in the life for Daphnie Reynolds. She works as a server at weddings, while her mother Libby is a wedding singer. With each blessed event in which another couple says "I do," there is another father/daughter dance, and Daphnie's heart breaks a little more, because she has never met her own dad. She knows that he is a famous public figure in England...but that's about all.The curious teenager decides to do something about this. She saves her money and when she has enough to make the trip... Well, let's just say that Lord Henry Dashwood, diplomat, running for Prime Minister, is in for a real shock. The thing is, so is Daphnie's mom Libby..."Henry, is she there??"A very sweet family comedy with a little something for everyone. Some of the comedy and storyline is a bit candy coated and far fetched...but this is easily forgiven because of Colin Firth being in the leading role, and Amanda Bynes heartwarming performance as Daphnie. We appreciate her uniqueness, and are able to root for her from beginning to end. I personally loved this film because little Amanda Bynes ("Ask Ashley" from "All That") proves that she's all grown up now, and does an amazing job! She holds her own with Colin Firth, and keeps viewer interested in her character from start to finish. A bonus for me was all the sights of England in the film...Westminster Bridge, The London Eye, the buildings of Parliament, red double decker buses. I almost felt like I was there myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Every Father and His Daughter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this would be a boring teens comedy but it took me by mighty surprise. I'd wet eyes by the end, I think that explains it all! On the outset, it's a story about a daughter who grew up without her dad's presence in her life, and how she leaves her home looking for him and the trials &amp; adventures she face on making contact with him again. Although it does sound nothing out of the ordinary, the way the story came live on screen deserves to be appreciated. The movie has one too many touching, emotional moments that makes one feel the strong bond between every father &amp; daughter, the love that never fades despite the decades of separation.Surprisingly the best performances are not from the main cast but the supporting actors like Eileen Atkins(as Colin Firth's mother), Anna Chancellor(hilarious as Colin's power hungry fiancée) and Jonathan Pryce(superb as Colin's politically ambitious aide). Colin Firth, to me, was quite wooden in many scenes and it's not necessarily because he's playing a stiff upper-lip royal character. Amanda Bynes as Colin's daughter is fun &amp; vivacious.I really liked the movie despite feeling that the acting could have been more convincing among the lead cast.Verdict: A must watch father-daughter movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disregarding the very strong connection Colin and Amanda had..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very touching.I am currently concentrating on the father-daughter relationship while rating this movie. To be honest, I liked this movie much more when I was younger. Everything was funnier back then. It goes to show that the humor in this movie was targeted towards a younger audience. But aside from the humor, the romance between Daphne &amp; Ian and the father-daughter relationship between Henry &amp; Daphne was very heartwarming.The thing about Henry and Daphne's relationship is that it is very realistic. There are many people in this world who have never known at least one of their parents- whether it be because of an unfortunate death or an ending in a relationship. Here, we are introduced to Daphne who- because of her determined mind- meets her father for the first time in 17 years. We see their relationship blossom slowly, but beautifully. Relationships take time to build, especially if you're forming it with a relative who you've just met- like say a father or a daughter. The relationship between the two was done perfectly in this movie.However, Colin Firth is just too good lucking to be seen as "just a father". Hit me all you like, but I really could sense some hidden sexual attractions there. It was almost like a romance film! But with Ian, I guess that saved the day. But seriously, if you looked at it carefully, you'd see it.Good movie. Very heartwarming. It makes me look forward to my father-daughter dance in my future wedding. :)</fullReview>

The story is about a girl named Daphne(Bynes)who tracks down her father who turns out to be a Democrat in London England. So she decides to go to London to see him as he apparently left Daphne's mom(well I tell ya later in the review). Her biological father never knew he had a daughter who is now engaged to some woman who is a right pain and her spoilt daughter who is quite posh.As he Henry(Bridget Jones's diary Colin Firth)and Daphne spend some quality time together he realizes what he was missing out on for the past 16 years.

		<shortDescription>Cute Family Movie (?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What does a girl want? You might recall some things like fame and fortune, but according to this movie it's a father. A simple, yet fun, chick-flick directed by Dennie Gordon stars Amanda Bynes as Daphne Reynolds, a wild funny girl next-door trying to find her missing father. And Primetime Emmy Nominee, Colin Firth as Henry Dashwood, a well educated wealthy British politician.The movie starts out a scene with Daphne as a child, asking her mother the story on how she and her father met. The film then forwards to a 17 year old Daphne being a waitress at a wedding, feeling sad as she could not attend another father-daughter. She then decided to find her father in England. The fun starts then as she is unable to cope with her surroundings.Amanda Bynes plays another funny-fun teenager, in a comedy movie. It is not very likely to see her in a serious movie and that makes me wonder, is she not confident enough in her acting skills to take up another challenge? Or is she just smart enough to keep focusing on her current fan-base? Colin Firth on the other hand is definitely one of the up points of the movie. You might recall some of his amazing movies, "Love actually", "Nanny McPhee", "Bridgette Jones' Diary" and of course "Mamma Mia". And he has also shown another great performance on this movie.This movie is definitely worth watching. And even though it might be classified as a family movie, I don't think that even my little brother would be caught alive watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story for "What a Girl Wants" is touching. It is about how Daphne goes to the other side of the world to find her father, and she tries to have a really good relationship with him, but it just didn't work out because Daphne was a city girl from New York, but her father was all perfect and was trying to become the prime minister of England, and he was all proper. I loved the end when Daphne was at a wedding, clearing the tables because she was a waitress, because her father unexpectedly showed up and told Daphne how much he loved her. And, it was so sweet when she told him that she loved him, too, and she called him Dad, unlike Henry like she called throughout the entire film. Then, she and her dad went to the dance floor to finally have the father daughter dance that she was hoping for throughout the whole film. When I walked out of the movie theater, I nearly had tears in my eyes, and I was only in third grade when I went to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American view of Britain?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'What A Girl Wants' narrates a series conflicts speeding to an inevitable explosion that could have been resolved by common sense communication. Vivacious young American Daphne Reynold's (Amanda Byne) comes to Britain to find her reserved aristocratic father Lord Henry Dashshwood's (Colin Firth) however her arrival come at a difficult time. Henry who never knew of Daphne's existence following the unexpected departure of her musician mother, Libby (Kelly Preston), is 17 years on newly engaged and has just declared his candidacy as Prime Minister of Britain. In some ways each character is reacting to his/her own uncertainties, the political expectations of Henry's upcoming election is a hard burden on a young girl still trying to find her self and wanting to know her father in a foreign land. This contrasts with Henry's carrying the weight of 6 centuries of family expectation. Following a series of social disasters, which the Press record effecting Henry's electoral chances, Daphne attempts to change her self artificially. In reality Daphne is never told she must change (after all, she could simply moderate her behaviour in public settings) whereas she crushes her vibrancy. Henry has to appease the expectation of a political party and the voters. He simply does not know how to say no, in reality he is not leadership material, but is blindly a puppet to his conniving adviser and future father in-law Alistair Payne (Jonathan Pryce) , fiancé Glynnis (Anna Chancellor), and future daughter in-law Clarissa (Christina Cole) who desire to be a part of the British establishment but are threatened by Daphne's presence. Added to the mix is a young friend Ian Wallace bitter at the establishment of which his mother had once rejected. Well intentioned, Ian lacks expects Daphne to drop everything. For example, he expects her to drop the Queens garden party and go to a concert. It is loosely based on the 1958 comedy The Reluctant Debutante starring Sandra Dee. The play and 1958 screen play were written by William Douglas Home, the son of the 13th Earl of Home whose oldest brother was Prime Minister and 14th Earl Sir Alec Douglas-Home, and who was obviously in a position to understand British aristocracy. Sadly the movie seems to stereotype Britian, presumably with a U.S. audience in mind so much that it makes blatant cultural errors in its presentation. For example, when Henry resigns his candidacy as Prime Minister before the Party faithful British flags are spreadeagled behind him in anon British manner. In the Amanda Byres commentary it is revealed that any British person who saw this would be "upset" with it. Although not British, I felt that in criticising those who exploit society to get ahead, it perhaps unintentionally criticises British establishment for an American audience. In this respect it reminded me of Princess Diaries II dig at royalty. But then British films often have subtle send ups of American politics (e.g. Love Actually). Another humorous error is the claim made by Henry's mother Jocelyn Dashwood, Countess of Wickham, that the Dashwood family motto is 'Qui Patitur Vincit'(He who suffers conquers/He who conquers endures) or as she states "It means, ducky, hang in there and you'll rock!" It sounds good for the story, but in reality there is none! (Atleast according to the knights and heraldry website). Both Colin Firth and Amanda Bynes are perfect in their contrasting roles of uncertain, British idealism and American vivaciousness. I am particularly impressed with the performance of Eileen Atkins who plays the family matriarch Jocelyn Dashwood. In a scene consoling Henry she caresses him and yet also withdraws her hand advising him not to follow the family sacrificing itself to the battlefields of Europe lest he "sacrifice your heart, Henry." Her reservation of physical contact captures the essence of a conserved Brit. The fears of parenthood are nicely expressed by Libby when Henry panics when their daughter unexpectedly goes out with Ian: Libby: "Strange how easy it comes isn't it?" Henry: "What?' "Worrying." "Does it ever go away?" "No."On the other hand, I found the 'us and them' contrast between two cultures two obvious annoying, as I did the youthful lack of balance of the character Ian Wallace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those very first few movies I watched on cable after my father subscribed to it was this one. That was like earlier this year. I have to kind of admit, the Colin Firth factor was one of those reasons. I know.Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) is this free-spirited American teenager who is from New York, and found out one day that the biological father she had never knew of till now is actually a prominent British politician. Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) did once met Daphne's mother before. But he has no idea that his American daughter is coming to visit him and chaos almost ensued the moment Daphne arrives at her biological father's house.But the thing is that, Daphne is not ready the lifestyle and culture of being a British politician's daughter. Naturally, Henry's legal wife and teenage daughter were not too pleased at Daphne's sudden arrival. Comical events soon began to follow and Daphne eventually learnt to behave like what people often though of the British to be, maybe.But, this is an American teenager trying to find out who she is really. And even the father she soon came to know and able to understand and relate to.Now maybe the whole movie is what maybe some may say - predictable, but overall it's just a light-hearted movie and to just watch some of the comical antics unfold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i like the movie because of the way the heroes where portrayed. Different from most of the fairy tales were the stars always get mistreated and abused and still remained humble and kind and passive, the stars here fight back.it's that drive that made the movie so intriguing that you don't want to skip any scenes or you might miss something. Daphnee(Amanda Bynes) was cute and full of guts not to mention sexy. she knew what she wanted, did it, and stood with it. the things she did shown her what she wants best and it's all but just to be herself. Collin Firth is sensible. He got dual personality. The one is the dignified aristocrat/politician and the other is the cool guy in him that wants to go rock. Kelly Preston was so wonderful playing the martyr mom and girlfriend. Daphnee's grandma she met only when she crushed her dad's mansion was admiring too. she even can go rock. Daphnee's boyfriend got a handsome face and did contribute a lot in the story. But the story won't be what it is if not for the antagonists. i like the role of the fiancée and the step-daughter (sorry not familiar with their names). they really are aristocrats. Aside from Collin Firth who speaks in American accent, stars who played British really got British accent. Everyone in the movie got hearts and spirits and their's is something different.</fullReview>

He pauses a lot before he speaks which really makes you believe he is thinking before he speaks and really sometimes doesn't know what the heck to do. It is truly what a girl wants, a father who really is a father. It is so rare to have a father like that. I know I fantasized about it as I grew up, and I am sure most people did.

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, Hilarious, Wickedly Satirical, and Sentimental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just so funny! The film works because of snappy direction, perfect casting of Colin Firth, and as his daughter the delightful Amanda Bynes, who really makes it. The story was originally filmed in 1958 with Rex Harrison in the Colin Firth role and Sandra Dee as his daughter. It bore the same title as the play upon which it was based, 'The Reluctant Debutante', and was written by William Douglas-Home, who died in 1992, aged 80. It is amazing how well the social satire targets of the 1950s have held up as viable in this new version half a century later. Of course, now they are seen to be fantasies, whereas in the 1950s they were real. It is actually better and more effective that this film, which is essentially a fairytale, attacks fantasies rather than real social issues. Douglas-Home was the brother of the Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home, and he was personally familiar with all of the social occasions which he satirizes, such as Buckingham Palace garden parties and the Henley Regatta. These define what used to be called by socialites 'the Season'. People 'did the Season', as they are required to do in this film. But today this is all a joke. Although garden parties are still held, the Regatta still takes place, and so on, none of it means anything anymore because the social importance has wholly evaporated, and all of the events have become marginal. A handful of people may go to these things 'to be seen', but they are a dwindling and insignificant coterie nowadays. Social snobbery has long since been replaced by money snobbery, so that England is now little different from America, where money is the measure of all things, and no other standard exists. Strangely enough, people in the USA often do not appreciate how things have changed in Britain, as shown for instance by Dan Brown in his novel 'The Da Vinci Code', where he naively imagines that being called 'Sir' means anything anymore. Nowadays, to be a lord means nothing, and to be a 'sir' means even less. In this film, no one takes reality very seriously. After all, the film starts with 'Lord Dashwood' renouncing his title so that he can enter the House of Commons as an MP, and then for the rest of the film he continues to be addressed as Lord Dashwood anyway. So much for script continuity! But it is all just in fun. William Douglas-Home may have had serious satirical intentions half a century ago, but this is the Disneyesque version of all that, and it is enormously funny and enjoyable. As for Amanda Bynes, in this she is a perfect gem.</fullReview>

Based on that, this movie is up there! Amanda Bynes is cute and likable, Colin Firth and Kelly Preston are perfect, and Oliver James is a a delight. Yes, it's predictable, yes it's a formula romance, BUT, who cares? Every movie doesn't have to be cutting edge and innovative. (I enjoy that, but definitely NOT all the time. Sometimes you just want to watch something nice). Every scene isn't perfect, but there are some real gems (not listed, in order to avoid spoilers). Just watch and enjoy!

		<shortDescription>What a romcom fan wants, absolutely, that is, a funny, touching story and, oh, Colin Firth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daphne Reynolds (an enchanting Amanda Bynes) lives in Chinatown with her lovely mother, Libby (Kelly Preston), a smalltime wedding singer. But, although she has never met him, Daphne's father is Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), a Britisher who was briefly married to Libby 17 years ago. It is possible, shortly after the happy nuptials, that advisers to the lord privately arranged for Libby to be shunned and sent packing, due to her being a hippie-type American. Lord Dashwood does not know he has a daughter at all but, things can change. Daphne is determined to meet him and, leaving her mother a note, she flies to London on her own. Naturally, the lord is astonished to learn he is a parent but his surprise is nothing compared to that of his stuffy fiancé and her equally snobbish daughter. Soon enough, Henry embraces and welcomes his daughter into his circle, despite the fact that he is running for prime minister and the free-spirited Daphne could be a liability. But, with the same advisers in place, will Daphne be sent packing, too? And, does Henry truly love his intended or does he still harbor feelings for Libby, being unaware of why she left him in the first place? This is a lovely, funny, touching story with fairy tale elements. Who would not want to suddenly go from a walk-up apartment in Chinatown to a stately mansion, complete with servants, deep pockets, and titled relatives, in London? As the buoyant and sweet Daphne, Bynes turns in a wonderful performance. She gives American girls a good name and, sister, can she dance! Preston is likewise fine as the bohemian but lovely mother and Firth, well, he is utter perfection as the sophisticated aristocrat who, nevertheless, knows the true value of a person, not a heritage or title. The rest of the cast, including Jonathan Pryce and Anna Chancellor, is quite nice, also. Understandably, the London setting is beautiful and the production values are high. Especially noteworthy are the costumes, for they are very well chosen, with the sunkissed Bynes looking lovely at every turn. If you thought this film was for teenage girls only, this viewer urges you to give it a try, most certainly if you are a big romcom fan. It has two love stories to tell, one for the younger set and one for the older, and after a humorous, meaningful tale, it finishes with a joyous bang that will satisfy most any soul.</fullReview>

I could only be considered middle aged if I expected to live to be several decades past the century mark!) Still, it was sweet and charming with a disarming innocence that was totally refreshing.The plot has been more than adequately synopsized. And yes, it is formulaic in its way. Still the performances are excellent all around. You pretty much know what will happen - or at least you know what you'd like to see happen, and the script doesn't disappoint. Everyone is excellent. Amanda Bynes (who I'd never heard of before this film) more than carries the production on her amazingly mature shoulders. Others have noted that Colin Firth as her dad is "wooden", but that's part of the point of the film. Even the minor characters are all pitch perfect. The actors inhabiting even the smallest parts make their screen time memorable.If you're not too cynical, this is an enjoyable, charming film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What A Girl Wants is a great family/teenage fairy tale film, about a Girl finding her self, and what she wants.

I couldn't think of anyone better to play Daphne then the awesomely hyper and sweet Amanda Bynes. She portrays her role very well, and Does greatly at adapting her father-daughter relationship, along with the great acting of Colin Firths of course. Along with this role she plays a very good 'American Teen Girl' very well, and the connection between her and actor Oliver James who plays sweet struggling singer Ian Wallace. Although admittedly Amanda Bynes Great Acting Skills is what supports her and Oliver James in these Girl/Guy scenes.Best scenes have to be, Henry talking about the Chandelier with Daphne...a pretty sweet father/daughter moment.The fashion show, were Daphne wins the crowd on pure confidenceAt the beginning of the movie were she finds the groom of the wedding she and her mother are working at. She works out a way to resolve it by putting ice down his top then turning his struggle into a dance and saving the wedding.When here and her father are eating and the pompous finance is watching them doing the exact some thing with there food.Best linesHenry Yes... it's ass numbing dull (?)Henry "I don't give a flying fart in space", both done in his great British accent Also when a stuck up girl asks her what college she is applying Daphne?Noelle!-What are you doing here? -I'm clearing the chicken cacciatore.My God, that is so funny!Guess what! I'm interning at Jenkins and Taylor...before I go to Duke, prelaw.What's next for you?The dessert, a selection of sorbets.No, where are you going to college?That would be the University of the Undecided.Is that in Ohio?Undecided, Ohio.Basically i love it.

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest movie, but not a waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. Perhaps every single thing in it isn't realistic, but you have to admire the attempt. I liked the relationship Amanda Bynes' character had with Oliver James' character. I adore both James and Colin Firth, and wish that they had given... more to both story lines.In response to one review "he has just sacrificed what he's been working for his whole life... It's possible to do so if the movie would have pointed out that he didn't like his life.. This movie has a point which is that you shouldn't have to sacrifice your life to get happiness or something like that.... well they make that perfectly clear when it comes to the girls... but the guys have too leave everything they worked for, isn't that called sacrifice???"They do show in the very beginning that Henry, Firth's character, enjoyed being a bit of a rebel. He rode motorcycles (which, in America at least, isn't what a "respectable" family would do), he ran about foreign countries, saving and marrying traveling musicians... It showed quite clearly that he didn't want to be a Lord like his father.And once Daphne comes into his life, he clearly enjoys doing things that remind him of who he was before his father died.In response to the "his fiancé already has a kid" post, have you ever heard of this little thing called death? While I don't recall them going into why Glynnis was no longer married, I assumed that due to her father's ambitions, that she wouldn't have divorced, and that her husband had died. Some women do revert to their maiden name once their husband passes on, and I assumed that she chose to. Of course, it shows that the film makers might have put a bit more thought into her and her daughter's stories. But it's not unrealistic for an unmarried women to have a daughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a very good movie to watch. I saw it a few Sundays ago. It shows how much it takes to be someone else - just to please someone. Be yourself and never pretend to be someone else - you'll regret it. Daphne is American - not British. She can't be British and perfect for her dad she has a free spirit. Her boyfriend is a musician. Daphne is beautiful and has a good idea of who she wants to be. Daphne and her mother know that everything can't be suited for everyone - there will always will be a scene or an uncomfortability. Dphne and her father will always have the traits that show that they are related and Daphne's boyfriend likes the wild Daphne not the prim British one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Girl Wants is a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie from Warner Bros and Gaylord Films called "What a Girl Wants". As you can see, the movie, "What a Girl Wants", released in 2003, is about a talking camel (voiced by James Earl Jones), who dons the voice of Thurl Ravenscroft, and he likes to sing, romp, and frolic throughout the deserts of Morocco. Accompanying the talking camel is a talking snake (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried), who follows the talking camel around. The people of Morocco got terrified of the talking camel, just by taking one good look at him, and spread the news from village to village, thinking the camel is possessed by a demon. The king of Morocco (played by Omar Sharif) wants the beast to die, and sends his hunters to search everywhere, and track down the talking camel. At one point, the talking camel sings "Poor poor Joseph, Whatcha gonna do? Things are bad for you. Hey, Whatcha gonna do?" and he spits. The talking snake then sings, "Poor poor Joseph, Sold to be a slave. Situation's grave. Hey, Sold to be a slave." At this very end of this movie, the talking camel got killed, and the people of Morocco are safe and sound, so is the country, and they had a big celebration in honor. This movie's story is somewhat like a reminiscent of that of the Disney cartoon, "The Whale who Wanted to Sing at the Met", as part of "Make Mine Music", and this movie is directed by Dennis Nolan (of "Big Pig", "Monster Bubbles", "Alphabrutes", "Wizard McBean and his Flying Machine", "Witch Bazooza", "Llama Beans", and "The Joy of Chickens"). I recommended this movie, so to speak, a fantastical 100% A+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to know how many different countries this was filmed in, because although it's portrayed (presumably to American audiences) as England, much of the exterior, and virtually all of the interiors, bear no resemblance to anywhere in Britain that I know of! That, and the formulaic, stereotyping of the Brits (stiff upper-lip, arrogant toffs, and laughably posh, cockney cheeky-chappies) being infiltrated by cool, fun, down-to-earth American princess-in-waiting (all been done many times before) make for a rather yawn-and-vomit-inducing experience for the more enlightened (from both sides of the pond, I imagine.) All this is hampered further by poor lighting, direction, and script.So it's definitely one to miss, then? Well no, actually. Such is the brilliance of the casting of the unknown (to most Brits) Amanda Bynes opposite Colin Firth, I forgive this movie all it's sins. Bynes is simply delightful - a cute, bubbly, beautiful, electrically-charged ball of charm and energy. Firth seems to feed off this, and the scenes involving these two work just perfectly. There are some other very accomplished actors on show, but they have been fed scraps here by comparison. It's as if all the best scenes were reserved just for Firth &amp; Bynes. It's a shame because, despite the rather low-budget, familiar, safe, family-friendly feel to this movie, it shows signs that it could have been something quite special.Firth excels in parts, showing some real depth. Bynes gives a mature, show-stealing performance, and she alone makes this movie worth watching. If ever a movie owed so much, to so few, then this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all this is a great movie. I really like the choice of actors. Amanda Bynes really gave this movie a finishing glamour. With her humor and her stuning beauty she really fits in her role as a young American teen. The choice of songs also fit perfectly to the story and give some scenes more humor or emotion. The plot is written funny and entertaining. Or example the scenes where you discover the things Daphne and her dad have incommon or do things the same way. Also the love-story between Daphne and Ethan is written and acted believable. Of course you know that there will be an happy-end but the ending is also truly enjoyable even if you might have guessed it. So enjoy watching this great movie, maybe with your loved ones or your whole family!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Synopsis: This is the story of a 19-year-old girl (Bynes) who has been raised in New York City by her mother (Preston), a professional singer, who decides that she wants to find her long-lost British father (Firth) in London, who's part of a very hoity-toity British aristocratic social circle. Once she gets there, however, it doesn't take long before her hip American lifestyle disrupts his entire life. Can she find a balance in the relationship between her two parents, find her own piece of mind, and along the way, possibly fall in love as well? Perhaps most importantly, does she have a chance at being the Debutante of the Year?Ein's Point of View: It's nothing very innovative, but in a world full of mediocre, hyped, and talentless celebrities, it so wonderful to see young talent such Amanda Bynes, Oliver James, etc can really act. It's also good to know that they still make it a good movie. This is just a great dream for anyone who thinks about getting that wild hair and doing something outrageous and meeting that perfect guy and having everything work out in the end. A bouncy comedy about a New York teen who runs off to England to connect with the father she has never met.The cast was simply magnificent. Amanda Bynes finally gets to show the world her long-dormant (yet fully potent and operational) dramatic abilities. Colin Firth does the great job that is usually expected of him, it was fun to see Collin Firth in a different roll than pride and Prejudice. Kelly Preston and newbie Oliver James deliver some decent punch into their pint-sized roles, and Eileen Atkins shows some major-league scene stealin' brilliance. Really, the only BIG flaw I can see here is the title.Bynes shined as Daphne, the girl who wants more than anything to know her father (Colin Firth as Lord Dashwood. There was depth there that Bynes doesn't usually get to show as she's know for her slapstick comedy. The whole cast was bloody brilliant, each character adding a mixture of light and dark layers over the usual Cinderella story. Bynes is an appealing and energetic leading lady and Firth is always watchable, and manages to pull moments of real humor out of a basically bland role. Preston does a credible job both as mother and a singer, and newcomer Oliver James makes a sweet impression as the hard-working bloke who falls for Daphne as soon as she sets foot on British soil.The Story: The teen is Daphne Reynolds (Amanda), raised in funky Chinatown digs by her free-spirited musician mother Libby (Kelly Preston). Dad is Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), a former free spirit now living by the stuffy conventions of his aristocratic roots. He's also running for office, under the guidance of Alistair Payne (Jonathan Pryce), the same adviser who separated Henry and Libby in the first place. Henry is engaged to Alistair's daughter Glynnis (Anna Chancellor), who expects her own daughter, the snooty Clarissa (Christina Cole), to reap the benefits of Henry's position. Together, Glynnis and Clarissa do their best to humiliate Daphne, who appears to be happily humiliation-proof, no matter what.</fullReview>

This film is also based around love, all different kinds, love between a girl and a boy, a father and a daughter, and mother and a daughter, and a father and a mother. overall this film is fantastic and entertaining i love to watch it over and over as it makes clear how families and friends can love each other.</fullReview>

Kelly Preston is amazingly beautiful, and the chemistry between she and Colin Firth is palpable. It is a great "feel good" movie no matter what your age! It is a great boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy seeks out girl, and they all live happily every after kind of film. The twist is that the "boy-girl" relationship is between a father and his daughter. That is what is so beautiful. I found the connection enchanting.</fullReview>

And when he says to his adviser that he doesn't give a fart in space for his opinion. He says them so quickly and with the English accent that the lines I think are sometimes overlooked.

But, as previously quite unknown, actor Oliver James has a starring role, which he plays fantastically. I am not the type of girl to swoon, but when I see him, and hear him play his guitar and sing, I really do melt. This film had a very fairytaley plot. It was not totally obvious as to what the conflict was going to be, but it seemed like a movie that needed a happy ending, so I was not too worried about the conflict. I admire Amanda's character, Daphne. She was so free, and so outgoing. She hardly got embarrassed, and was just full of fun. Something Oliver's character, Ian, could not ignore, and not help but fall for.</fullReview>

I don't like that Oliver guy whatever his name is because he looks like a little pretty boy. For one thing he has no body hair or facial hair, which makes him look like he's 12 years old.

		<shortDescription>Pure sophistry!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "secondary" point of this story is laudably about the palpable value of a girl's father, in terms of establishing her male-role identification, especially during those critical years of early adolescence. Unfortunately, the "primary" point is more sweepingly ontological, offering egregiously superficial strawman situations in support of popular but misleading theories of what it means to be an authentic and "real" human person. Absurdly, we are given to believe that whatever it means to be real in that sense has only to do with remaining the same, where anything like developing in terms of maturity or social responsibility could only render one artificial and fake.The girl is given as a sixteen-year-old, where it is assumed that whatever she thinks and believes by that age is for that reason real and authentic. Hence if she dresses and acts like all the "other" girls of her age in America, who mostly seek to emulate their MTV idols, that's what it means to be different and true. In other words, going along with the crowd, snapping one's fingers to the music, getting a tattoo, and so forth, marks her as being somehow unique and therefore special. On the other hand, those who might seek to rise "above" the vulgarity of popularism and fads are presented as two-dimensional, cardboard stereotypes of priggishness, snobbery, and privilege. No one else could possibly object to the cheapness and sleaziness of American popular culture, and hence the message is clear. Being "different" -- just like everyone else, is more authentic than changing in any way that might conflict with the prevailing fads and presumptions.Push the point back ten years and even a rebellious teen can see it. Imagine the six-year-old who didn't want to learn the lessons needed by a sixteen-year-old, and her culture promoting that idea on the grounds that being already a fully developed real and authentic child, it would be fake and artificial for her to change? Yet that's the sort of trendy bias this story seeks to promote, except that the girl is sixteen and not six, and what is being rejected as fake are the lessons she will need in becoming an adult. Ultimately, she returns to being just another clone of the "youth" culture. In terms of "What a Girl Wants," evidently it is not a dad who will help her to benefit from "his" experience, but rather one who is willing to benefit from "her" experience, and hence the sillier argument is presented as though it were the wiser.</fullReview>

Themother, Kelly Preston, was alright, except for: "Don't touch mydaughter, or you won't get a scene, you'll get a Broadway musical." . That line bugged me. So how could any film with this many flawsbe "good"? Well, the story is nice. Colin Firth is very good. Thechandelier scene is excellent!

		<shortDescription>No, this is NOT yet another Hollywood bash at the British aristocracy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It really helps to put this movie in perspective if you know a little about the author. William Douglas-Home is the younger brother of Sir Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home, 14TH Earl of Home, Baron Home of the Hirsel of Coldstream, who, in October 1963 (8 years after the writing of the play from which this screen-play was adapted), disclaimed his peerages for life, took the name Sir Alec Douglas-Home, and succeeded Harold Macmillan as prime minister of England. The plot, therefore, is an insider's look at an outsider's view of the traditions, the glamour, and of course, the pain and hypocrisy of the British upper class. As such it succeeds remarkably. Sterling performances by Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth are ably complemented by a truly brilliant Anna Chancellor, who manages almost to make you like her "wicked stepmother" character, or at least feel sorry for her for being so shallow, and an excellent backup from Christina Cole as the evil step-sister-to-be.This is billed as a teen flick, but it's well worth the price of an evening's rental as wholesome, cute entertainment, no matter how old you are.Just for fun though, do pay attention to the gross continuity bloopers with the taxi license numbers. Someone's head must have rolled for these!</fullReview>

Most of the movie is entirely implausible, but the actors are so charming, we don't really care.

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny to me to read all the negative reviews of this movie see how angry people get. Lighten up. This is not intended to be a work of art. It is entertainment. Yes, it's obvious. Yes, it's not that original. And yes, I quite enjoyed it. If you take it for what it was meant to be, without looking for deeper meaning than you actually get caught up in the story and characters. I found myself just letting go and enjoying the ride. I can understand that this is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you want to chill and have a good time then this movie certainly delivers. The direction was good and the cast did an admirable job playing their roles. I laughed out loud several times during the film and found the ending to be very moving. It does what it is suppose to do and for that it achieves what it set out to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Feel-Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thoroughly enjoyable romantic comedy! Amanda Bynes was excellent as the teen daughter, with a wonderful impish smile and a very mature performance for a youngster. Colin Firth was good in a "Hugh Grant" style part, but played very well and very believably as the father. There were some genuinely tender moments between him and Amanda Bynes, as his daughter, and also with Kelly Preston as his estranged "wife." The soundtrack was foot-tapping with excellent songs by Kelly Preston and especially by Oliver James as Amanda's boyfriend, Ian (singing his own compositions).A very under-rated movie with some laugh-out-loud moments. I'm very surprised it didn't rate higher with IMDb voters!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have seen this movie thrice, and not even on the big screen, and each time my eyes were glued to the screen. okay, so the storyline was a bit not-going-to-happen-to-me-ever, but hello, this is supposed to be a fantasy!! and that's exactly what it was. a fairytale. it was really dazzling and beautiful, and i started crying at the last happy ending scene. very well done!!! the whole thing was unreal. there were the funny scenes, the romance angle, the grand palatial scene...i would LOVE to see this again!!! colin firth played the stuffy British lord whose career matters most perfectly, amanda bynes WAS free-spirited, be-yourself Daphne Reynolds, her love interest was really interesting, and the evil stepsister and her 'escort' were well casted. teens are going to love this movie, and you never know, it might even bring out the fairy-believing kid in adults. if you have some time to relax, maybe you should watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I curled up with my 13 year old to watch this movie expecting a "typical chick flick". I was mightily disappointed. The script was the typical pattern. Girl meets boy, they have a fight, they get back together and live happily ever after. What charmed me were Amanda Bynes and the myriad of expressions that flicked over her face, almost faster than you could name them. I was charmed, amused and involved in the characters. After all what girl be she 13 or 33 not want her Cinderella story to happen to her. Reminded me of all the John Hughes feel good, be happy, everything will work out OK films tossed in together with a good soundtrack, pretty faces and a universal message. Well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's Not To Like?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie in the theater, own the DVD, and now it is appearing on television. For my money, this movie has it all: talented cast, great music (I also own the CD), young fresh talent in the person of Oliver James, seasoned veterans, Kelly Preston and Colin Firth, not to mention a wonderfully talented supporting cast to Mega-talented Amanda Bynes. When I watch a movie more than once, it is because I feel uplifted by it and walk away with a smile on my face. I find this every time I watch "What a Girl Wants". I felt Oliver James deserved better billing as I thought he was the pivotal character in the movie. For his first outing I thought he did a marvelous job. There was a little magic going on between he and Amanda and would like to see more of them in the future. I believe this movie has something for all generations, youngsters, teens, parents and grandparents. Loved it and will watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What a Girl Wants" begins in New York with Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) and her mother Libby (Kelly Preston). Her mother had always told her the story about her father and on each of her birthdays' Daphne would wish for her dad to come find her. She desired to know him, so after she turns seventeen, Daphne goes to England in search of her father. While looking for her father, she met a teenage musician Ian (Oliver James), a love interest. She finds her father, Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), and he is of royal descent, deep in politics and social customs. Henry says Daphne can stay for the summer, but the reunion is not without troubles, because of Henry's finance and her daughter. There are two ideas presented in this film: one being, that as people, our basic need is to be loved, especially by our parents. Daphne is yearning to have a relationship with her father, when she is looking longingly at the father and daughter dance. The film makes this clear and also makes the viewer want Daphne to find her father. The other idea is a person is a product of their environment because Daphne tried to live like a debutante. To live in her father's world was impossible because she needed to be herself. The film clearly showed this message of keeping our beliefs and being ourselves. The film made a distinction between New York and England. The scenes of London were great and the inside of the castles were elegant, showing how the British upper class lived. The music contributes by setting the mood to get the message across. The dialogue was funny in places, and some situations were amusing. The movie answers the question in the title by ending the way the viewer would want it to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinderella in Culture Clash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amanda Bynes as Daphne Reynolds Dashwood is a wonderful American Cinderella to her British would-be stepmom and wicked stepsister. As handsome a couple as is her father Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) and her mother Libby Reynolds (Kelly Preston), family pressures drive them apart before their Moroccan marriage can be made legal prior to her birth. Daphne's quest to know him surprises her father during his campaign to be elected to the legislature, and sends his blue blood Brit staff/fiancee, both power hungry and status seeking, into a panic when Lord Dashwood accepts his daughter and asks her to stay on for the summer season in the royal court.Not only is this clash between American and British cultures and language, but also the difference between aristocracy behaviors and common freedoms we Americans enjoy. Daphne embodies the best of America: that a money poor but culture rich girl from New York can genuinely affect the hearts of those who surround her, she who is also a graceful person, well articulate and poised, quick-witted and charmingly beautiful. Every one of Daphne's relationships are a positive thing in her life, she truly is a role model. Genuine is her affections for her mother and for her father, as well as for her grandmother, Lady Dashwood (Eileen Atkins) Henry's mother, whom is the catalyst for Daphne's family reconciliation.A comedy of manners, a social strata education, a family reunited, and friendships abounding throughout the summer; Daphne contends with the coming-of-age crossroads with her father and new musician boyfriend, Ian Wallace (Oliver James), and the battle of wits/for her father's affections with her father's trusted advisor, Alistair, and his family--Henry's fiancee and soon to be stepdaughter.People from all ages will definitely enjoy this film. It is wonderful to see family struggles overcome, and the family preserved by love and truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brit's view of Hollywood's view of England</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I've just bought myself a one-way ticket to the Tower of London by admitting this but in fact I really loved this film. In fact, it was one of the most entertaining I've seen in months (and believe me, I see a lot of films).Okay, so some of the standard ingredients in a Hollywood view of England are present and correct. There is the obligatory tour of London taking in all the traditional sights. Then there's the use of cockney rhyming slang (apples and pears = stairs, frog and toad = road, etc, you get the picture) by the locals to establish that we are in England. Perhaps it's just me but I've never heard anyone speak like this (perhaps I should get out from the palace more). Mercifully at least in this case, having quickly established that we are in England (by the sightseeing tour and the cockneys speaking cockney), the locals then start talking normally - well at least what passes for normal in England. Most of the Brits are portrayed as being eccentric upper class and repressed or crashing patronising snobs.And yes, all the characters are portrayed in the broadest of strokes with the bad characters being irredeemably bad with no saving graces whatsoever. Poor Anna Chancellor draws the shortest of short straws as the evil stepmother-to-be (is there ever any other kind? If any oppressed minority gets a worse press than the English, it's stepmothers and stepdaughters - they're always evil). The problem here of course is that having become engaged to marry such an awful character whose appallingly bad character traits must be obvious to everyone shows exceedingly poor judgment on the part of Colin Firth's character, Henry.However, on the other hand, it does get some things right. (1) A Lord cannot be elected to the House of Commons without renouncing his title (a surprisingly small detail for a Hollywood film to get right) (2) Henry rails against the gutter press, name checking several actual British tabloid newspapers `The Sun' and `The Daily Star' (3) Jonathan Pryce's treacherous political spin doctor is named Alistair (well it made me laugh, especially as Tony B. Liar's own press secretary Alistair Campbell is big news in England at the moment for spinning stories even more fantastical and unlikely than this one) (4) Clarissa advises Daphne not to be a `plonker' (possibly the first time I've heard this word used in an American film - do Americans know what this means?) (5) Daphne's love interest is Ian Wallace (Oliver James), a young Englishman who is neither too upper crust or repressed or a forelock tugging cockney geezer. In short, a relatively normal person (also a first for a Hollywood film - Harry Potter excepted, of course).However, the one important thing which this film manages to get right is the one that many others fail at, namely, it manages to make you care about the characters. From the moment you see Daphne looking longingly at the fathers and daughters dancing together on the dance floor at the wedding at the film's beginning, you want her to find her father and after listening to her mother's story of how her romance with Henry was so cruelly ended, you want her mother, who still clearly loves Henry after all these years, get back together with him. Okay, so this is a fairy story and the ending is never really in any doubt with both the good and bad characters getting what they deserve. But then this is not a film where you want to be surprised by the way it ends. You want it to end the way you expect and you'd be disappointed with anything less than a happy ending.And while most of the characters are stereotypes, at least they are affectionately meant in the most part. Plus, and this is important, this is a supposed to be a comedy. It's okay to poke fun at national stereotypes in a comedy. It's much more unforgivable in a film purporting to be a realistic serious drama, such as the vicious church burning back stabbing baby eating one-dimensional sadists in English uniforms in `The Patriot' or the omission of any British contribution whatsoever in Spielberg's otherwise excellent `Saving Private Ryan' (shame on Robert Rodat who wrote both).Amanda Bynes, who I've only seen previously in `Big Fat Liar', is a talented actress and on the strength of this, her first lead role, she should go far and it's great to see Kelly Preston playing a goodie for once after years of playing her own share of evil bitches. Eileen Atkins, as Henry's mother, Jocelyn, is an inveterate scene stealer and gets the best line in the film `No hugs, dear. I'm English. We only show affection to dogs and horses'.But the real star here is dear old Colin Firth, an actor that I've not liked an awful lot up until now, saddled with playing a succession of unsympathetic characters - even as Mr Darcy, dare I say it - with only the other Darcy from `Bridget Jones's Diary' coming close to being likeable). Which is why I think that it's such a shame when I say that I suspect that given the type of film that this is, it is not one that Colin Firth will probably want to count as a career highlight on his c.v. But he should because as far as I'm concerned, he's never been better. The scenes where he lets loose and starts to have fun, is just a new side of him which I've never seen before (although his last film, `Hope Springs' did hint towards this change of direction for him). His best moments in the film, however, those where he says nothing at all, letting his face speak for him. And it speaks volumes.It would be a shame, therefore, if his work here gets ignored by people who see this film as a piece of disposable fluff for adolescent female teenagers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the most part, the story is formulaic and the characters seem pretty familiar, lovable American teen girl meets her stuffy royal British relatives. However, there are two reasons why this movie stands out; Colin Firth and Amanda Bynes. Bynes, the young star of the film is not only lovely to watch but brings a wholesome sincerity to her role that makes you root for her from the very beginning. Playing the lovable American teen girl is not that easy in today's cynical world but Bynes' performance seems to be stripped away of any pretentiousness or deep social commentary. She is simply a girl looking to find her father and to discover who she is. As for Colin Firth, he is simply one of England's finest living film actors and the producers of this film were extremely fortunate to have him. His character, the father who didn't know he had a daughter, could easily have been played with too much anger and lost all our sympathies, or been too much of a victim and left us wondering why anyone had ever fallen in love with him in the first place. Instead, Firth creates a multi-layered character trapped between what he aspires to be, a successful politician, and what he could be, a father. It is his character's choices that kept us interested in this film and in the end brought both my daughter and myself to tears. So, if you have a lovable teen daughter I would highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...you simply can't ingest that much SUGAR without causing someserious (tooth) decay!Ok, the movie isn't all that bad (as I'd expected, to be sure), but Iwouldn't recommend it to anyone over 13 or under 63 (or that hastaste in intelligent films). It's a sugary-sweet tale of an extroverted,American, teenage girl who wants the father she never knew andall the 'wacky' shenanigans she gets into when she goes to meethim in not-so-Merry Ol' England. Harmless fun, typical humour, aformulaic plot, and standard acting that all concludes with anincredibly perfect ending.Amada Bynes, as the loopy and longing Daphne Reynolds, walksthe fine line in her role between being utterly precocious and mildlyadorable. She isn't horrible, but shows no real depth of charactereither. Colin Firth however is excellent as aspiring Britishpolitician, Lord Henry Dashwood, the shocked, reserved andadapting father of a surprise teenage daughter. He plays itstraight, and is the anchor with any form of reality this movie canclaim to own. Kelly Preston (the 'Mom') and Jonathon Pryce (the'Evil Aid') are given fairly paltry and one-dimensional charactersunfortunately, and the bulk of the remaining cast are basic'cartoons' in their forgettable roles.I didn't cringe at any given point, but I certainly wasn't sucked in byanything along the way. I suppose this might be a good family filmas there were no 'boobies', or coarse language, and only onepunch was thrown during the entire thing. Everything goes right inthe right places, goes wrong in the right places for it to be fixedlater, and the right music plays where they want your heart to betugged. Happiness ensues.5/10. I don't expect to see any Oscar nods for this one next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Cotton Candy Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is pure cotton candy: light, sweet, tasty, not too much substance. It was actually a lot better than I expected it to be. I went for the sole purpose of seeing Colin Firth, my favorite actor, in yet another role, and was pleasantly surprised with the rest of the cast. Amanda Bynes shocked me with her likeability, and newcomer Orlando James is handsome and charming enough that I'm sure he will be gracing the cover of many a teen magazine in the near future. The plot itself, about a 17-year-old girl who travels to England to meet her long lost father, is one that has been done more than once before. The difference is that this cast makes it work. Bynes is charming as a girl trying to get along with the father she's never known, and Firth shines once again as Lord Henry Dashwood, struggling to form a relationship with the daughter he never knew existed. The ending is as cliched as one would expect it to be, but at the end, you're so happy for the characters to get what they want that the cliche no longer matters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really surprised at some of the nastier comments on this film but then I remembered my planned review of "What a Girl Wants" before I actually went to see the film. *What a Girl Wants is her one hour seventeen minutes of her life back* And yet - that is not my opening line. Why? Simple. I loved the film! The trailers for "What a Girl Wants" just don't do the film justice - they make the film seem like typical pre-teen fodder, starring a ditzy and sickeningly sweet idiot. However, don't be fooled by lax advertising. "What a Girl Wants" provides many moments of pure, light and highly enjoyable entertainment I wouldn't trade in for all the gold in the world.First of all, the character of Daphne is actually very likeable, and not a ditz at all (well, no more that other ppl). She has a very real longing to know her father and a very touching way of expressing it. I was surprised at how good an actress Amanda Bynes really was. I had heard all the horror rumours of her show, and yet she proves she's actually very talented.Second - there is a character hardly mentioned in the trailers I saw - that of Ian. He was played artfully by Oliver James and provided a love interest for our leading lady. Colin Firth as Henry Dashwood was skilled casting, and I loved him in this film. He gives the film soul. It could easily have become an utter mess if it wasn't for his expert depressed gazes and well timed smiles. Once again, he takes over the film. We switch from Daphne's to Henry's point of view seamlessly. When Henry casts off his carefully cultivated serious countenance we see he is as much of a wild child as his daughter. Scenes between Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth were really quite touching.I disagree that "What a Girl Wants" is only for pre-teens (altho they will enjoy this film) but I go agree it is a chick flick. However, chicks of all ages will enjoy this film ;)There are of course, some flaws in "What a Girl Wants" - some of the jokes don't quite work, and there is a distinct lack of trying to make us believe what is happening on the screen is really happening - but who cares? For a light-hearted frothy film, "What a Girl Wants" does a very good job of uplifting the spirits. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than a fairy tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a sneak preview of What a Girl Wants, and loved it. It was the first movie I had seen Amanda Bynes in and having never watched her on TV, I didn't know what to expect. She was terrific and the chemistry she shared with Colin Firth seemed very strong. Of course, I think Colin Firth is wonderful in everything I have ever seen him in and this was no exception.I was expecting this to be strictly the story of a girl's search and discovery of her father, but found it to be just as much about the father recovering the lost spirit of his youth. There were plenty of silly and funny moments and the movie got great audience laughs, but there were serious times too, which also seemed to go over very well.To have a reunion such as this with a long lost parent would be a dream come true and I guess that makes this a bit of a fairy tale -- but it's certainly one that I would love to live and I intend to go back and see it again as soon as it opens, and often!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My daughters would have asked me to take them to see this. But I took them first as soon as I saw the previews with Colin Firth. It's a very cute movie and HE is PHENOMENAL. The plot is a little formulaic but it moves fast and is very entertaining. Colin, well, if you saw Bridget Jones Diaries, you know him. Before that, mainly typecast in British costume dramas but this is a breakout role that has some VERY FUNNY moments in it!! Great movie for pre-teens, nothing bad in it at all. Some of the previews for other PG-13 films weren't so good, unfortunately. But this movie erased them - great family movie, and I definitely plan to see it again. My daughters liked it a lot too! We are all Amanda fans from way back. It is no slight to her that I am gushing over Colin first. She is good too. See it!</fullReview>

I know it's supposed to be a vehicle for Amanda Bynes and she does a good job and is quite enjoyable but in my opinion Colin Firth steals the show. It's as much about the father as it is about the daughter. He's not been advertised as he should have been so I hope all the Firth fans out there don't miss it.A touching story that is not just for the young crowd, anybody with exceptional taste in men will enjoy this movie, ladies don't let your daughters go to this movie alone!! Join in on the fun!! Colin shows a wide range of emotions and looks as fantastic as he ever has while doing it, he shows off his perfect comedic timing and even dances around in leather pants.DON'T MISS THIS MOVIE!!</fullReview>

I didn't find it a great comedy, so don't think this a comedy by any means but still it is a very moving film that a father could watch with his daughter time and time again. So go out and grab the DVD now and wait for more great film from the young sensation Amanada bynes.Great film 10/10</fullReview>

Remember this was a re-make of 1958 Reluctant Debutante with Rex Harrison and Sandra Dee.I liked the movie much more than I thought I would. Amanda Bynes is a natural. She is very comfortable in front of the camera. Oliver is great in his first performance. His singing was good as well.Colin Firth is so skillful as an actor. He gradually reveals his true nature, which is pure joy! He elevates the level and calibre of this movie. Did I mention how gosh darn hot he was?

I am a bit of an Anglophile, plus over the years I have developed a little bit of a crush on Colin Firth. I remember when the movie first came out that it looked rather silly and it peaked my interest. Well, sitting down and actually watching it certainly took care of that. I thought the movie was Awful! I guess I'm not a huge fan of slapstick and the more stupid things that happened to this girl and the overplayed stuffy/snooty English was just too much. I finally just turned it off and gave it up.

Which, if you have any sense, you will not. The film is actually produced very well. There are fantastic camera shots, suitable music, and the roles are well cast. It is unfortunate then that the story, dialogue and characters are artless to the point of utter frustration.Do-Not-Watch!You have been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We meet Daphne Reynolds - a girl what every girl wants as she was born into a life full of possibilities.But what's surprising is that she still finds herself incomplete as she want to meet her real father with whom her mother shared a whirlwind romance many years ago.But there are many surprises that came along with this goal as she's gone to London and realize that he happens a high profile politician - Lord Henry Dashwood.Upon meeting the daughter he never knew existed,many things happen and the story begins.What A Girl Wants is a movie for teen-agers.A sanitized version of a typical Olsen twins film obviously but it never surpasses the bar of being an average movie as there is nothing surprising and it is just too predictable for adults watching. Too bad that it is too clichéd that Amanda Bynes' charm and performance as Daphne aren't enough because of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American girl helps loosen up the snooty English</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 2003, "What a Girl Wants" stars Amanda Bynes as a 17 year-old who travels to London to meet the father she never knew (Colin Firth). He's of royal blood and has great political aspirations, but his long lost daughter's arrival puts a wrench in the situation. Kelly Preston plays her mother while Anna Chancellor &amp; Christina Cole play the mother/daughter vying for her father's attention in London. Oliver James is on hand as her potential boyfriend and Eileen Atkins has a significant role as the girl's grandmother.It's amazing how easily Amanda carries this film when she was only 16 years-old. She's fun and has a cute face, but a body that hasn't really developed yet. Christina Cole is effective as her nemesis and Firth is a quality protagonist. The subtext about how stuffy "high society" Brits need to loosen up with their rigid class consciousness is great, but I found myself generally bored by the proceedings, especially by the time the third act rolled around. The movie's solid entertainment, but it didn't do much for me; maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for a film like this. That said, if you're a fan of Bynes or looking for a fun teen adventure flick "What a Girl Wants" should fill the bill. However, I prefer 2005's "Love Wrecked;" it's simply a more entertaining Bynes' movie. The film runs 105 minutes and was shot in the greater London area with the opening act in New York City.

		<shortDescription>What a Girl Wants is a Film Experience Superior to This.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a Girl Wants (2003): Dir: Dennie Gordon / Cast: Amanda Bynes, Colin Firth, Kelly Preston, Jonathan Pryce, Oliver James: Recycled teen family film about the importance of good adult role models. Amanda Bynes stars as a girl who longs to see her father who has been absent for seventeen years. She works as a caterer at a banquet her mother sings at. She tells of how her father got into British politics and how she was secretly sent away by his officials. What follows is pure formula as Bynes shows up to meet her father. He is bewildered and overwhelmed while his current fiancé and stepdaughter would prefer that she left. The main joke is that her lifestyle clashes with their culture. An improvement for director Dennie Gordon after making the pathetic The Adventures of Joe Dirt but it is not much of one. Bynes is an absolute delight and holds strong despite predictable developments. Colin Firth as her father is given a good back story before being subdued with standard material that concludes with him learning the truth. Flat supporting roles by Kelly Preston as Bynes's mother, and Jonathan Pryce as one of the corrupt officials. Oliver James plays her romantic interest and he has less personality than a plastic Ken doll. What a girls wants is what everyone needs, and in this case it would be to star in a film of much higher potential than this paper thin charade. Score: 3 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>weak teen girl fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has always been just Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) and her mom Libby (Kelly Preston) in their tiny NY apartment above a restaurant in Chinatown. She always tells her about her father Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) whose British aristocratic family did not approve. The 17 year old runs off to London to find his dad and possibly a missing piece in her life. He's abandoning his seat in the House of Lords to run for office. He's a rising political star and getting married to Glynnis Payne (Anna Chancellor), the daughter of his adviser Alistair Payne (Jonathan Pryce) and mother to Clarissa Payne (Christina Cole).It's a standard premise and not particularly well done. Amanda Bynes is suitably adorable and sweet. She's at her bumbling bubbly best. Colin Firth is terribly stiff and oddly weak-minded. It's a stock character that keeps him from developing real chemistry. It's a teen girl fantasy with a dud prince charming. There's even the evil 'step-mother' and 'step-sister'. It's a silly movie that doesn't really work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About a spunky American Girl in search for her father. The Review discusses the cast and soundtrack of the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film Review: What a Girl Wants In 2003 Amanda Bynes played one of her most infamous roles in What a Girl Want directed by Dennie Gordon. The film is filled with lively and emotional music that enhances the film storyline. While also filled with a rambunctious cast of all ages which brings a great sense of character to the movie. What a Girl Wants redefines the classic teenage romantic comedy putting a new reliability to the audience. Bynes character is an outgoing American teenager who is in search for her long lost father who is a wealthy British politician that is running for office. The movie shows the up and downs of Daphne's characters journey to build a relationship with her father and how she may have to change her wild ways to be accepted by her father and his lifestyle. Gordon does a great job of integrating upbeat music to the light heart scene and uses it as the glue that binds the movie together. What a Girl Wants is a light hearted film that shows the journeys both parents and teens take as they begin to mature. The film's soundtrack enhances the scenes in the movie and helps set the mood for the audience. From start to end the music creates the ambiance in each scene. The film's opening is an emotional father daughter dance scene which Daphne observes as she waitresses the wedding, the song played in the background foreshadows the upcoming story plot to the film. Music transitions the film very well by being intertwined to keep it up beat. Though some may say the songs can be corny and very teen oriented, the lyrics and beat can be masked, by the charm of their singer Ian Wallace (Oliver James), Daphne's love interest in the film. In addition, to that Gordon adds in classic songs such as 'What a Wonderful World', and 'Have I told you lately.' Making this film appealing to all ages and not just teens since Gordon mixes classics and modern day songs throughout the film which make this film the perfect family night movie. Amanda Bynes, Oliver James, Colin Firth, Kelly Preston, and Eileen Atkins this film is filled with a variety of talent characters of all ages. Each bringing a different personality to the screen and making the movie humorous, sentimental, and emotional. Bynes character brings a youthful feel to the movie and keeps it upbeat from her crazy dancing scenes, her messy love triangle, to bickering with her soon to be stepsister, she brings the light heartiness to a film that everyone enjoys watching. James plays Daphne's bad boy love interest who character is essential to any good teen film because teens need something to admire, and his charming personality defiantly wraps in the ladies. Firth's and Preston's characters relates to many parents as the film shows their struggle through parenting a teen and the wild emotions that go through them every time they walk out the door. While Atkins character bring wisdom and humor to the film with her witty British comments while being a source of reason to both Daphne and her son. Her character is truly the Virgil of the film. The plethora of characters is what makes this film appealing to all viewers and makes it a film that enjoyable to many. What a Girl Wants is a film that may be underestimated and looked at as another teen romantic comedy but with Gordon's directing, soundtrack, and cast this film is a top notch romantic comedy. Where the viewer's goes through a roller coaster of emotions and are constantly moving to the beat of the catchy soundtrack. The plot of the movie also has endless turn with character of Pryce (Firth's adviser who wants to get rid of Daphne), and Cole (who is Bynes soon to be step sister and is constantly trying to sabotage her); their characters keep the film interesting. What a Girl wants is a warm hearted film just about girl trying to finally have a father in her life. Though both go through their struggles of trying to adapt to their new lifestyle the core of the movie is the bond a parent and child have. This is why this movie is perfect for the family to gather around with a bowl of popcorn on weekend night and watch together because it truly shows the bond of family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a guy doesn't want, is to watch this film more than once. Is it an all-time baddie? No it is not, but it certainly is not good either. I have read some reviews saying how bad the English look? Trust me, the English Actors Colin Firth ( Lord Henry Dashwood), Eileen Atkins (His mother Jocelyn), and Jonathan Pryce (Alistair Payne), come out best. Spoilers: The best part is when Dashwood finds out the truth about his Daughter Daphne (Amanda Byrnes), and how Alistar broke up the relationship between him, and her mother (Kelly Preston), for political reasons, and punches his lights out. I have read how Ms. Byrnes is a wild child, drinking and going around like another party animal... Lindsay Lohan. Here is the thing, Lohan can't act, but her performance in "The Parent Trap" remake is Oscar material compared to Byrnes in this film. If you have seen both films, and the similar plots (The girl (or girls) searching out a long-lost relative, and parents getting married all over again) you will know what I mean. In fact, it was so Disney like, I thought it was done by Disney, not Warner Brothers. I give it 3 of 10 stars (Mostly for Firth).</fullReview>

Little did she know that her dad was running for presidency and led the life of elite . So it's kinda like a country mouse who went to the city to find her relative who lives in a city . =pI gotta give credit to all the actors &amp; actresses who played in this movie . Even though the ending is cliché &amp; the storyline is undoubtedly predictable, they were able to tell the story with such vibrant, it makes the audiences connect to the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie. I'll admit it followed a formula-but it was a likable formula. In the movie, Daphne (Amanda Bynes) travels from New York City to England to meet her father, whom she had never known. Her father had impregnated her mother while on a fling. She had always wanted to meet him. Her mother was a singer who frequently sang at weddings, and Daphne always got upset whenever the father-daughter dance came up. While in England, she discovers that her father is a British politician who is engaged to another woman who along with her daughter is a bit on the snobbish side and fears that Daphne with ruin the father's bid for office. The bulk of the film follows Daphne's adventures and misadventures in England as she tries to instill life into the stuffy people who live and work with the father(including one hilarious scene at a ball), finds love, does her best to connect with her father, and does her best to have fun. Meanwhile, they try to transform Daphne into a proper lady. She does not like who she is becoming, however.Despite the formula, I found this to be a decent movie with several memorable and funny scenes. You might like it if you like Amanda Bynes, who in my opinion was perfect in the role of Daphne. The film was a good vehicle for Bynes.** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

It is obviously from an American point of view; one line was so untrue it wasn't real "No hugs dear i'm british we only show affection to dogs and horses" (or something to that affect). No wonder everyone comes to england expecting to find a land full of snobs and upper-class know it alls. I found the film predictable and funny in places, a good one for the younger kids with their parents but not that good for teens.

		<fullReview>geez, what better reason do you need to see this movie? he has a lot of screen time and works it well, other than the one sort of channeling-Hugh-Grant-stuttering scene where he's eating chocolate cereal and attempting to bond with his daughter. so it's a cute, fluffy, happily-ever-after deal. so what? the girl is cute, her boyfriend is very cute, it's set in England, so yummy accents aplenty, and we don't see nearly enough Colin Firth on this side of the pond. it could be much, much worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Girl NEEDS!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amanda Bynes may want to be an actress. Perhaps to some she is. But what this movie painfully demonstrates is that what she wants and what she needs are two different and separate things. She may want to be an actress, but she desperately NEEDS acting lessons. She's young, vivacious, cute, but has a lot to learn about acting techniques and projecting emotion. Of course I don't think she is the sole reason why this movie is quite mediocre, the story is transparent and cliché, and the characters are at best two-dimensional. This story may appeal to a pre-teen audience, but for a teen growing up anywhere in the world today, I doubt that they could and would see any similarity between themselves and this girl. If teens today only had to deal with stodgy social rules, but in reality, the life of teenagers is much more complexed and layered. Moreover, they are much more intelligent than this movie is willing to admit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A problem without a problem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing saving this movie was Colin Firth. Though he should never have played such a stupid role! Why does "Mr. Darcy" agree to play this character? Does he have money trouble?The story in this film is based on a problem that would not have existed in the real world. Therefore I give this film 3/10, because it have its funny moments, but as I said before the plot is based on something non-existing.But this is my taste, I don't usually like Amanda Bynes', Lindsay Lohan's or Hillary Duff's films. They're all the same.This film is very predictable, NOT in a good way! But everybody who loves romantic-comedies with a problem non-existing would love this film!So if you are REALLY bored on a Saturday evening and this film accidentally is going and there is nothing else to watch, I would recommend it because of its stupidity.</fullReview>

This movie has it all, there is extremely funny bits when she falls and stumbles, other great moments is when she acts "crazy" at the boring/lame English events or why not pick the great and extremely hilarious talks she has with her almost stepsister. Anyway i would like to give this movie a 10....but on second thought a 2 fits much better (It almost was a 1 but I did see the whole flick so...)</fullReview>

This was like watching the Sims in England.I convinced my son to go because we thought it might be about relationships from a girl's point of view. But, no way. It was a poor imitation of an old fairy tale.. Poor girl finds out she is royal and then discovers the cost of it all.Once again the dad is made out to look like Homer Simpson instead of the way men really should be portrayed. .

		<shortDescription>Loved it..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'What a Girl Wants" : B+I absolutely loved this movie. I was truly surprised at how good it was. Afterall, it was Amanda Bynes's first movie and she was one of those Nickelodeon kid stars.The movie begins with Daphne (Bynes) growing up in New York without a father, always wishing he would come home. Her story truly begins when she can't help but think that she will never get to have a father-daughter dance, triggering her to go on a search for her father, a high political figure (Firth) in Britain.There were many times when the audience would clap and crack up at the high points of the movie, a strong sign that showed the audience enjoyed it; something I don't see too often.As the movie began to progress, I began to realize it wasn't so bad afterall; it was a great movie. Also, I should point out the fact that Colin Firth is Bynes's co-star, who is a wonderful actor. The fact that he chose to do this movie shows that it should have some decency.There is a hilarious scene with Colin Firth dancing, a side not usually shown in his other movies.The movie also focuses on the importance of Daphne's need of a father-daughter relationship. Even if the viewer cannot relate to this situation, one can still feel for Bynes's character as she seems to be growing to be your best friend.Amanda Bynes did a surprisingly, amazing job. She's a fresh, young hott star, as well as another co-star, Oliver James (playing her cute boyfriend).'What a Girl Wants' was a wonderful movie, that everyone will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sappy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a Girl Wants is a feel-good, dreamy, and unrealistic scenario involving a teenage American girl who wants to be a princess and who succeeds in being welcomed into the upper class British circle and being considered 'cool' at the same time. What young girl does not want (look at the title) to be a princess and to be beautiful and admired, very much like Cinderella? Despite being a 'loud American', Daphne succeeds in being adored over her stuck-up soon-to-be step-sister and being the centre of attention, much to the regret of the Paynes who have an eye on her father and his political career and social standing. But, in the end, everything works out for Daphne and her parents. It is one of those happy love stories with a rags-to-riches tale.What a Girl Wants is a film that displays what the typical American thinks of when they think of Britain...a very unrealistic view of Britain and filled with stereotypes. This is what I found annoying about the film, but then it is made for an American audience. Generally, the acting was done fairly well by Firth and Bynes, but the film offers little more.If you are a young girl and like feel-good fantasy films, then What A Girl Wants if probably going to be what you want in a film. I wouldn't think this film would be anything of any interest to male counterparts, and adults would probably regard it as a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Corny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is no doubt made especially for Amanda, cause it is damn silly and senseless, and worst of all it got really corny and tacky story. Just like her show.Story: A girl left her mom stranded to go to England to meet her father (who doesn't know she exist).There are too many stuff in this movie that is really cheesy, like a boy she just met ? she called him Boyfriend, who happen to get every jobs in London, who is also happen to be hired in the Lord's party to sing in the band that can play any song, just ordered!!. Also the soundtrack and the acting suck.And worst of all everything fell into place in the end which is really make it soooo irritating (because everything fell too perfectly).But not everything about this movie is that bad. It got pretty good location, wardrobe has done a pretty good job, they managed to fool Colin Firth to be in this movie, and all the camera did work pretty well.Recommendation: Yes, if you like The Amanda Show ? Don't Watch It, for who don't.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: D)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formula, schmormula...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was not the greatest, through MY eyes. I've seen the same formula in many movies targeted toward the same age group. However, I took my two oldest girls (11,12) to see it. Other girls around the same age were also seeing it. The movie was full of formula stuff that worked for previous generations... To some degree, I don't mind recycled formula. Movies have to be kept current, so kids of today can relate to them. This movie touched my daughters' hearts, and if a movie can touch someone, no matter how sappy it is, then in my opinion, it does work.Yes, they made Amanda Bynes an outgoing, uncontained, accident-prone, high-spirited girl. Unfortunately, that's what they do to try to amuse the younger set. I see a lot of trailers with other similar characters, but the movie is about finding true love in long-lost family. It was a cute fairy tale.I did give this movie a 5/10 because I have seen better, but I would not put it at the bottom of the list either.</fullReview>

How dare they take experienced, proficient actors such as Colin Firth and Anna Chancellor (both of Pride and Prejudice fame) and put them in a little girls' slumber party movie. The plot was cliched and the main character, Amanda Bynes, lacked both acting talent and a certain finesse that the other actors had. Granted, she is rather cute, but anyone who has graduated from picture books into chapter books may find themselves a trifle bored and put out by "What a Girl Wants".</fullReview>

Why can't there be compromises.. I despise this way of trying to hide a feministic message in a movie.. In the end of the movie he says to his girl: I don't want you to change a hair on your body.. Yeah but what about him.. he has just sacrificed what he's been working for his whole life... It's possible to do so if the movie would have pointed out that he didn't like his life.. This movie has a point which is that you shouldn't have to sacrifice your life to get happiness or something like that.... well they make that perfectly clear when it comes to the girls... but the guys have too leave everything they worked for, isn't that called sacrifice???</fullReview>

The message of this film to it's target audience of 8-15 year-olds can more or less be summed up like this: "the rich lead boring, stupid lives, life should be a party, hard work and sacrifice is out, just have fun, be a musician, go to Morrocco and have fun, money is somehow always there anyway... A dangerous message for young people. Let's hope our kids have more sense than we do and do not believe all the bu----hit we are sometimes feeding them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pardon me if I've seen this before, but* free-spirited American goes to * uptight England, where he/she gets * screwed by the underhanded, nasty, back-stabbing Brits, but * wins out in the end anywaydoes sound a bit familiar. Oxford Blues is one obvious previous example of the formula (and probably a hundred times better movie) but there are plenty other examples of Hollywood Takes Revenge for Colonialism.In this case the acting was hammy (just what Colin Firth is doing in this movie is hard to say - probably just hard up), the whole story completely predictable from start to finish, the plot so full of silly holes it got boring - even looked to me like the director was bored.There were some nice gems. Old Lord Whatsisface waffling pompously on about his chandelier raised a smile, and I enjoyed Lady Dashwood's comment "No hugging! I'm British - we only show affection for dogs and horses" (another American misconception: should have been English, British refers to four quite distinct nations, and the Scots are not noted for showing affection for horses) - but in general this really wasn't much of an anything movie. I normally enjoy escapist pot-boilers as much as the next man but this one tried to... well I'm not sure *what* it tried to do, except show us that the English (with one or two notable exceptions) are a bunch of dirty rotten scoundrels. Yada yada, tell me something you haven't said a hundred times before.</fullReview>

She is a complete spoiled brat. There are no likable qualities about her. If anything you want to gouge at her face and kick her in the gut for being such a spoiled nuisance throughout the movie. The three credits towards the film are towards the other characters in the film. I would give this movie one star, but I feel bad for the other actors. Of course, it's not Amanda Bynes fault that the movie sucks. The script sucks. I wouldn't even show this movie to kids--they may think that bad behavior is acceptable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, it's amusing enough and it is something of a modern day fairy tale not meant to be taken too seriously. Nevertheless the film is based on the arrogant and patronizing notion that the American way is superior, the British way inferior and that Britain may yet be saved if only it adopts American bad manners, sloppy dress, vulgar music and impractical proletarianism. I wonder if US audiences would warm to a film that portrayed them as negatively as this film does the Brits. I also wonder if this film has played on British television and, if so, what the audience reaction there was. Having said all that, it did offer a chuckle or two and the portrayals of Prince Charles and the Queen were exceptional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This girl wanted to know why?.why?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care who wrote or directed 'What a Girl Wants'. This movie was horrible and even the act of looking the film up on IMDb would mean wasted time and keystrokes. So why am I taking the time to review it? Well, because I made a promise to myself to review every film I see, and damn it, I saw this one. I only have myself to blame. I watched this film willingly while on a mini-vacation. I liken the film to watching a carnival ride get stuck; you really don't want to watch the horrifying image before you, but you just can't help it. The story (story??) is such formulaic tripe that is an insult to any four year old. Homogenous teen queen Amanda Bynes plays Daphne, a girl who longs to find out who her father is, despite the fact that she's gone without this information and has an artistic mom who affords her a lot of freedom, as all single artistic moms in the movies do. Unfortunately, her mom is played by Kelly Preston, so I can understand why she would see what her other options are. She discovers that dear dad is actually Colin Firth, who is a British politician, so she flies over there and decides to descend on his household; wreaking her own cutesy American brand of havoc on the stodgy British. I'm not sure there is a stereotype left that could show how boring the British are compared to the free-spirit and frosted eyelid-ed American girl who has many scenes that resemble tampon commercials where she dances in front of mirrors while she tries on clothes with some saccharine pop music plays in the background. Honestly, the only thing that kept me watching this train wreck was the continuous speculation as to why Colin Firth would debase himself to appear in this film. Not just appear in the film ? there is a scene where he is dressed in leather pants and playing air guitar in front of a mirror ? for about fifteen long, excruciating seconds. I was so embarrassed for the guy at that point I considered sending him whatever cash I had in my pocket in hopes that it is a start for him to pay those bills that he obviously needed to cover, or else I can't fathom why he would do something like this. It's more interesting to imagine how the story turns out instead of me telling you, and even better, I could give you a Choose Your Own Adventure. Turn to page 47 if you want Amanda Bynes to get hit by a bus by a good actress like Maggie Gyllenhaal. Turn to page 48 if you want to slip $5 to an Intern at the film studio that released this piece of crap and have he or she burn the master print. Or finally, turn to page 49 if you want everything to turn out in the end, as these films always, horrifically do. I hated this movie with every fiber of my being. --Shelly</fullReview>

She's such a brat, you just want to smack her.The whole stereotypical 'American shows Brits how to love life and not be so stuffy' plays out in the stupidest way, especially at a dull party where Amanda shows everyone how to dance. Naturally, they all break into a choreographed dance. Words cannot convey how embarrassing this whole scene is. It just gets worse from there.Even the usually wonderful Colin Firth can't do much to save this film. Surprisingly, the young male love interest is charming amid all the nonsense. If only the film's star wasn't such a deeply annoying brat, the film might have had a chance.</fullReview>

Amanda is an unsympathetic actress, and Jonathan Pryce is as hammy as ever in a role so predictable and stereotypical that his dialogue brought a clanging deja-vu to every thing he uttered. Colin Firth is typecast again. In an awful film AGAIN! All in all this film makes me realise that Hope Springs wasn't so bad after all. At least that had a couple of charming moments among the clichés. What A Girl Wants is simply painful to watch; cinematic root canal! Also why does Amanda Bynes insist on one of those crap 'dancing like a berk while trying on clothes' montage scenes in every film she's ever made? GIVE THIS STINKER A MISS, and if you really want to watch an Amanda Bynes film for the love of God watch Big Fat Liar instead; that at least co-stars Paul Giamatti as 'Marty Wolf', and therefore comes highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A nice little teen romantic romp in England. While definitely a chick-flick, it is quite enjoyable to guys as well. A good little American teenager who never knew her real dad, goes to England only to find out he is a noble about to be married to a gold digger. The girl's real mom left her noble father before she was born as she felt her relationship with a noble would never work out. This little yank works her way into the nobleman's house and charms everyone. Good scenery and good laughs against the stuck-uppishness of upper-crust society life. It's pretty much a Cinderella story, but I found it quite amusing and pleasant to watch. 2 thumbs up from me.</fullReview>
