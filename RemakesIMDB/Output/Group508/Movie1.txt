		<shortDescription>What a nice movie... and such a poor rating...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, ask me why this movie has such a poor rating. Or maybe don't ask me, because I have no answer. The movie is just great. The acting is perfect for this script, DeNiro and Penn are so funny and also serious when is needed. Why such a poor rating ? Maybe because people are not so funny as they were once. For the people of our days a comedy is something like Scary Movie or a movie that makes you laugh every minute because of something stupid. But "We're No Angels" is funny, is romantic, is serious, is educative, is simply GREAT MOVIE. You have to watch it with an innocent eye, you must enjoy the movie. Don't look at it with a critical eye. That's not good for the entertainment. Just watch it to relax and to feel good. It deserves it. And you also deserve it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a little more complexity than you might think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With practically no resemblance to the 1955 Humphrey Bogart movie (nor to the play it was adapted from), film-buffs might find themselves perplexed as how to take this remake: two convicts escape prison and find themselves in a border town disguised as priests. What could be formulaic actually has some grit and ambiance to go along with its slapstick. Demi Moore, as a single mother of ill repute, gives one of her best performances here and works very well with Robert De Niro, while Sean Penn takes a while to get warmed up (and his thick accent is mildly irritating). John C. Reilly has a fantastic supporting bit as a novice priest who worships Penn, and there's a cute little girl in the movie who never acts like a movie kid (she's a natural). Lots of surprises in this critically-lambasted comedy, not the least of which is an extremely moving finale involving a waterfall and a holy statue. It had me transfixed. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film again after not seeing it for over a decade. For all you who are wondering... is it good? is it bad? I have this to say. Excellent cast. Excellent castING. One of Demi Moore's best (yet small) roles (I'm not a big fan of hers.) Great script (Mamet). Great score. High quality filmmaking. They don't make them like this anymore, really. If you don't agree that its a very clever, dry-witted film, then, oh well. That's what makes the world go round. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple, yet funny film, good acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We're No Angels,First-Viewing, owned VHS,(Neil Jordan)- Robert DeNiro, Sean Penn, Demi Moore, John C. Reily, Bruno Kirby, James RussoAn interesting comedy starring two very talented actors. This is the first comedy role I've seen DeNiro in prior to his 90s comedies (analyze this, meet the parents, etc?). DeNiro and Penn play escaped convicts who disguise themselves in a small town. Although DeNiro is great, and in certain scenes definitely shows his superiority as an actor, Penn overall gives the better performance. With a more complex character, yet simple (he is very simple-minded, but a complex character), his performance is very good. Although Demi Moore really didn't have a big role, she was convincing as a local woman in the small town. John C. Reily, once again gives a good performance, in a similar role to that of his in 'Casualties of War'. Overall a good film for laughs and well done by the director and screenwriter. Thought the acting was the highlight, and had some very funny scenes. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant comedy with fine acting and an occasionally laugh-out-loud script by David Mamet. I think its rating deserves to be between 6.0 and 6.6 stars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies become forgotten over the years, and "We're No Angels" is one of them. It's not a great comedy, but it's not a bad one, either. It's far more serious and moralistic than I had ever imagined, and Robert De Niro and Sean Penn essentially run around posing funny faces for the camera throughout, whilst the Catholic religion is used as a structural backdrop. It's a very different sort of role for De Niro, whose comedy is usually a bit more sophisticated. Here he barely talks at all, and when he does, it's usually harsh barking or screaming or frustrated whispers. It's not De Niro's most memorable role but it's certainly an unusual one.A lot of the movie focuses on mishaps and misconceptions, as all of the movies from this genre do. It bears resemblance to last year's "School of Rock," about a loser who was mistaken for a teacher. This time the loser is equal to a pair of two escaped convicts and the teacher position is likewise that of priests.The story all begins with Ned (De Niro) and Jimmy (Penn) escaping from a northern jail circa 1930. After heading for the Canadian border, they find themselves pursued by a ruthless jail warden and a town of do-gooders. Luckily for the duo, right before they come to the Canadian border, they are mistaken for two long-lost Catholic priests, Fathers Brown (Penn) and O'Reilly (De Niro). After given an introduction to the area by a fellow priest (Hoyt Axton), they decide to hide out for a while using their new personas. No one would ever suspect a priest, right?The problem is that Fathers Brown and O'Reilly are supposed to be two of the smartest priests alive, having written a controversial book about the true meaning of the chapter Revelations in the Bible. So you can imagine the fear that Jimmy experiences when he is asked to lead the church in a pray prior to a meal.Meanwhile, the mandatory romance is inserted into the movie, using Demi Moore's single, rough, over-protective mother as the love angle for De Niro's character. Demi spits out an unconvincing northern accent, as De Niro stares at her a lot with critical eyes and tries to get her into bed. The romance is not necessary but it seems a lot more worthwhile than most of the romances in some of these films.The movie is one of the most forgotten I have ever seen; I'd never really heard of it prior to purchasing the newly-issued DVD. But I figured De Niro and Penn couldn't be that bad, and I was right.I think part of the reason so many people like to ignore it is that it doesn't poke fun at religion. It doesn't make the clergymen out to be strange idiots. Rather, it makes the two escaped convicts seem out-of-place in a heartwarming place. The spirituality affects Penn's character, Jimmy, and his final decision on the bridge that separates Canada from America is one that we have sensed was long coming since his fascination in the church grew.De Niro and Penn have two of the best faces in Hollywood, and a movie like "We're No Angels" uses this to its advantage. Making up for the long gaps of laughter, the director, Neil Jordan, focuses more on his two lead actors and their reactions to situations. Most of the time throughout the film, De Niro shrugs his shoulders a lot and emits low, agreeable groans from his throat in response to questions, while Penn looks confused and bewildered. There's a great scene where an eager-to-please clergyman (John C. Reilly) asks "Father Brown" something about his book, and Penn sort of stares at him for a few moments with searching eyes, trying to find a way out of the situation. For some reason, the mistaken identities setup has been a long-time fascination for Hollywood. Just look at "Some Like it Hot," "Tootsie," "Nuns on the Run," "Sister Act," "School of Rock," etc. I think it's because we can all relate to a lot of the situations that the characters go through, and a lot of the embarrassment they suffer. We like to watch them ease their way out of dangerous areas and lie through their teeth."We're No Angels" is one of the better examples of this formula executed quite well. It's not a terrific movie, but the actors are, and the script by David Mamet comes up with its own occasionally hilarious segments that make the movie uneven, but a lot more fun than you might expect. No, it's not great, but it's just funny -- and sweet -- enough to recommend.3.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, in the Manner of '21 Grams'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows what a black comedy is. But is there is such a thing as a white comedy? I think so, and I think this is one of them. In the same way that '21 Grams' works a fairly serious portrayal of a crisis of faith into a tense melodramatic thriller, 'We're No Angels' actually masks some serious thoughtfulness about the importance of faith and hope into a decently funny comedy of mistaken identity. It also illustrates concretely the truth of C.S. Lewis's famous dictum (from the Screwtape Letters)that all men become what they are pretending to be.The movie is very plotty and all the loose points neatly wrapped up. What a lot of the critics have missed is that all of the jokes are thematic, and tied to the central topics of the movie.I am not at all conventionally religious, but I do appreciate faith, and I liked this movie quite a bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Got this DVD as a birthday gift and watched it.It is like "Heaven Help Us" in the sense that the nuances of the religion really are key to the comedic effect best portrayed by a look or a line that is subtle.Sure it could be better but depending on Budget and schedules not every movie can be Titanic, Longest Day, Gone with the wind,etc.If you like Deniro, or Penn...you'll like it.If you are from a Catholic or parochial upbringing you will like it.I'm not Siskel or Ebert; but I liked it.Close to the Canadien border and being set as other than the height of summer I'm surprised there we're ANY daylight scenes. There is a little girl in the Movie who sort of steals the show,A Demi Moore that supports this plot as it builds and Sean Penn makes you believe the ending.If on TV or available for rental; watch this movie for a relaxed comedy.</fullReview>

I found myself moved towards each of the characters, especially Sean Penn, which was an eye opener for me, as I am not much of a fan... yet he's character was a softer, deeper innocence! Demi more plays the buxom strong woman as usual, not that I am faulting her, when it comes to Demi I am a concrete fan, also a great fan of Robert Deniro, who also plays a strong survival character! They all work well together to bring us an education of it's projected time, &amp; a good honest chuckle!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the original and this is a rare remake that surpasses the original. What it really is about is how the Power Of God can improve the lives of four people who really needed him. Ned (Robert DeNiro), Jim (Sean Penn), Molly (Demi Moore), and her daughter. Obviously, the daughter being able to speak and the affect on Molly (Regaining her faith) was most important, but also how Jim was chosen to give a Sermon, and as he said it was the first time he "Ever won anything." This led him down a path that God had planned for him, which is learning how to become a Priest, and influence others in his new identity as "Father Brown." Ned, gains the least of the four (Although getting Demi Moore is not bad), but his role is the most important because he is the one who jumps in and tries to save the little girl and the presence of the statute of the Virgin Mary saves both of them. My favorite part of the film is where the girl speaks to The Translator" (Wallace Shawn), and says they are conv... before going to sleep, and he thought they were converts not convicts. He said is this true? Ned says don't good works count for anything? When he said converts instead of convicts, Ned said we were born Lutherans, and The Translator said "God Forgives You." That part followed by the ending where Ned and Molly go to Canada, and he hints to her about plans, and she says what plans? And he says all in good time, while Ned remains behind to become a monk. It shows the different paths that Ned and Jim will take while still being free. 10/10 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's About Miracles, OK?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this movie many years ago and really enjoyed it. My best friend has recently gotten on a Sean Penn kick, and I suggested he rent this. We watched it last night, and I again realized it's a very good story. Two important comments. First, it's not a comedy, as in a fall-on-the-floor, laugh-your-head-off, side-splitter. If you're looking for that, check out the Stooges, thank you. Second, the story is about miracles. Both the lower case miracles that happen all the time to people, as well as the upper case MIRACLES that may change our lives. The Writer and Director focus much of the action on how we make miracles happen for one another without some divine intervention; pay close attention to the drawing of the name in the lottery. And, if you don't spend time in liturgical circles as I do, you need to understand that the types and stereotypes in the ecclesial environment are real, in particular John C Reilly as the eager young Novice, and Wallace Shawn as the Translator/Master of Ceremonies. Last, kudos to Hoyt Axton, for his sincere, underplayed portrayal of the Abbot (Father Levesque); great men like that really do exist in some communities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well played comedy, De Niro gives one of his choicest performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most enchanting thing this comedy has to offer is the cast?the performers (De Niro, Penn and Mrs. Moore) make very good roles.De Niro got an opportunity here to cultivate his already obnoxious screen persona as a nervous, jumpy, sharp and (at least verbally) violent character, of copious irascibility; his interactions with Mgr Nogulich are delightful, when De Niro threatens him and wins his place in the procession. Penn shines at times; his festive sermon, the 'empty pocket sermon', is a bit disappointing, but that's the script.Mrs. Moore is the courageous, loudmouthed and no?nonsense prostitute.The touches of mysticism belong to the pop religiosity and ready?made sentimentalism (De Niro reaching to Mary in the waterfall; or the previous miracles, with the shoes and the tears), but nevertheless the comedy is never offensive; as you know, the comedy is a remake, so I credit the older script for taking this mild view of the religious life. I also liked the fact that WE'RE NO ANGELS is an amusement, not meant to be 'relevant' in any other way?merely a snappy comedy. The pace is everything, otherwise the characters are wholly _bidimensional and conventional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ain't that funny?" "Yeah, it's hilarious."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, said lines are a quote from the film, and not anything anyone has actually ever said about this comedy.With a regular run of comedic roles in the 90s it seemed as if De Niro was taking a dramatic shift away from his regular persona. However, it's easy to overlook the fact that six of his first ten pictures were comedies, often so-so farces like The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight.After reaching his zenith as an actor and performing his most famous roles (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Deer Hunter et al) it was the dark comedies of The King of Comedy and Brazil that led him back into the genre. The decent but unremarkable Midnight Run followed, then this.We're No Angels has a title reminiscent of some Cagneyesque piece (indeed, it was based on a play and previously made in 1955 with Bogart) yet also sounds like the kind of vehicle you could imagine Laurel and Hardy starring in. Fittingly, it's set in the 1930s and Penn's simple-minded expressions, especially in the final scene, are almost Laurelesque. But even Laurel and Hardy couldn't string an amusing feature-length picture out of two escaped convicts (as the less than great Pardon Us would attest) so De Niro and Penn are on a hiding to nothing.We're No Angels is well acted, well directed and pretty well written. But it's a comedy with no laughs. A dramady, if you will. Yet after years of reading about this as De Niro's nadir, then... it's not that bad. Sure, he does mug a little too often in the vague approximation of a "comic" performance, but never enough to really grate. It's charming at times, engaging at others, and all the cast work well. Just don't expect to crack your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not up to the usual standards for a Mamet script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I managed to miss this movie over the years but now have been able to see it on Netflix streaming movies. I generally like De Niro, and generally like Penn, so had high hopes for this comedy of sorts. I came away a bit disappointed. The beginning and end were most interesting but most of the middle seemed to bog down quite a bit, trying hard for laughs but rarely delivering.It was filmed in the communities in Western Canada near Vancouver, including a community just north of Porteau Cove, where my kids and I spend a couple of days in 1990. Really beautiful scenery.Robert De Niro is Ned and Sean Penn is Jim, they manage an escape from prison and head for the Canadian border. But their journey is interrupted when they are mistaken in this small border town for two visiting priests who had written a popular Catholic book. As they plot their crossing the cops show up with search dogs.A 20-something Demi Moore is also a key character with a young deaf and mute daughter that gets involved. In a miracle of sorts she gains her ability to make sounds and, pointing to the two men, barely says "con ... victs" but the others interpret it as "con ... verts" which provides some humor.SPOILERS: In the end the cops are gone and the escaped convicts are safe, and as Ned begins to cross the bridge to freedom he looks back at Jim who has been motivated by the order of priests and decides to stay with them and start a fresh life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We're No Angels (1989) *** (out of 4) Remake of the 1955 film has Robert DeNiro and Sean Penn playing escaped convicts who hide out as priests in a small town where they try to sneak across the border into Canada. Most of the reviews you read for this film will probably be negative but I've always enjoyed what the movie has to offer even though there's no way of denying that it could have and should have been a lot better than it turned out. I think the biggest problem with the film is the direction of Jordan who just wasn't right for the material. This is suppose to be a comedy yet you wouldn't know it because Jordan handles the material so dark that it's rather hard to get many laughs. We've get some rather strong tones on religion and even some strong violence, which just doesn't sit too well in a comedy. Even the entire atmosphere of the film is rather dark, which is a staple of Jordan but again, that wasn't really needed in this film. What does work are the performances by DeNiro and Penn who are excellent together. Playing dumb is never an easy thing but both men pull this off remarkably well, which is very important since most of the laughs come from them not understanding anything to do with religion yet they're suppose to be priests. The two men's facial expressions is what works the best because the look on their faces when they're put on the spot are just flawless as is their constant begging and pleading for various things throughout the movie. Demi Moore has a supporting role, which brings in more darkness that really isn't needed but Bruno Kirby and John C. Reilly turn in nice supporting performances with Reilly really standing out as another priest obsessed with Penn. The laughs throughout the film are certainly minor but to me the film still works well thanks to the terrific performances. You really don't expect to see DeNiro and Penn in a movie like this but they both pull it off very well and make it worth viewing.</fullReview>

I admire the story, first; I admire wonderful text and phrases and use to quote them; but, what is the most important about this movie, it's really an example of GOOD, nice and gentle, Christian humor. All little miracles in this movie can be considered fun and miracles in the same time. I loved the atmosphere of the movie, and the characters, and again and again, this gentle humor, so you can laugh and think about belief things... This movie I wouldn't recommend to those who refuse all christianity-related jokes. They would barely understand it... otherwise, it's nice, it's warm, it's what I call "good movie".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best "Escape" Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all respects; casting, acting, direction, production and screen writing, We're No Angels is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Not a frame of film is wasted as the sometimes-humorous tension is maintained throughout.The movie has a relentless, if-subdued tension. I was on the edge of my seat, hoping that Penn and DeNiro make-good their escape to Canada, while at the same time, noticing the relaxed, comfortable overall feel of the movie. We honestly like the two main characters, and this is one of the main reasons the film is so compelling. DeNiro's acting is perhaps the best I have ever seen from him. His totally-failed attempts at acting "priest-like" is hilarious, especially as he trades barbs with Demi Moore's irate character.Bruno Kirby is wonderful. John C. Reilly is great. Hoyt Axton is excellent. The plot never loses steam for a second, and we honestly care about the two convicted protagonists. If you like movies with a moral underpinning, that at-once candidly expose the frailty of the human spirit, you will love We're No Angels. At the end of the movie, we are rewarded for our faith in DeNiro's and Penn's characters, for they risk all for a child they have been entrusted with. The screen writing and direction of this movie are exemplary. No mediocre dialogue and no disjointed scenes. Every moment re-inforces the tension and overall effectiveness of script. The ending is unexpected and superb. Congratulations to the director, producer, writer, Penn, DeNiro and all involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Misfire From The Talent Involved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We're No Angels is a comedy that features Robert De Niro and Sean Penn together with Demi Moore,Bruno Kirby,Ray McAnally and James Russo.It tells the story of a couple of 1930's Great Depression-era convicts,Ned and Jim, that were able to escape prison and the death penalty via electric chair that was imposed on them.Both settle on a small upstate New York town near the Canadian border when both disguised themselves as a priests that were expected to arrive at a local monastery.A lot of comedic events happen afterwards especially when they were welcomed by Father Levesque and got involved with the deaf-mute daughter of Molly, a local laundress and prostitute.Neil Jordan directed this remake of the 1955 film of Humphrey Bogart with the same title.Too bad that the film came out to be both simplistic and ordinary despite of the talent involved especially when it features De Niro and Penn,two of the best actors in Hollywood; and Jordan,one of the finest director of the industry.There were a lot of boring moments.Also,it just turned out to be somewhat corny and provides minimal laughter in a lot of scenes.Overall,it was definitely a misfire from the cast and the director involved as it does not live up to its potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We're No Angel is far from being one of the greatest comedies out there, actually, very far from that, but still enjoyable...watchable, at least It's a remake of the 1955 Christmas film of the same name, starred by Humphrey Bogart.Knowing beforehand the religious nature of the film, i forced myself to not care so much about the inevitable cliché situations that would appear In the film, so i believe i didn't felt so disappointed by the downhill this film went in the last 30 minutes. The acting is what makes this film enjoyable. DeNiro brings an extraordinary performance to the film, very underrated i must say. Sean Pean looked like he couldn't care less about the film, in contrast. Anyways, although watchable, We're No Angel is way too forgettable. It don't has any absurd or super-funny scenes which gives you a laugh-out-load moment. 5.5/10</fullReview>

DeNiro and Penn do great work together, having very good chemistry with one another, and it took a risk by going over the line, but managed to keep it amusing and fun. It moves along at a decent clip, with an extremely good opening of Bobby|Russo|, Ned|DeNiro| and Jim|Penn| escaping from prison, it was funny and very exciting. This is also the 1st movie we get to see the potential of John C. Reilly's comedic ability, his bumbling Monk persona often made me chuckle.Performances. Robert Deniro is quite humorous and amusing here. I laughed at the way he got annoyed with Demi Moore's character, or his silly little prayers to get out of trouble, he was a lot of fun. Sean Penn surprised me by giving a decent performance. He was amusing, and added a lot of fun. Demi Moore is not bad as the out spoken Mom. She had her moments to be sure. James Russo is amusing as Bobby, he had good chemistry with Deniro and Penn.Bottom line. This is quite pleasant and passed the time nicely. I would never consider it a milestone in either's career, but it's certainly a decent movie. Worth the watch.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was truly disappointed with this picture. De Niro and Penn were cast right . It was the way they played their characters that was "out of character" for them! They both underplayed their roles as dim-witted convicts and to me , that hurt the picture immensely. I'm so use to seeing them completely annihilate a role with their raw intensity that seeing them barely acting or acting not in their "norm", just ruined it for me.Still it was great to see these two legends act together. Demi Moore as Molly was a little better. As a tough single-mom trying to make a living for her and her deaf-mute child. She over acted but it was okay. She was a little more believable than De Niro in their scenes. Had De Niro acted like he should have, he would have blown away Moore in their scenes. Another thing that for me didn't ring through was Moore's and De Niro's so-called chemistry. There wasn't any! No sparks, no nothing! A big yawn! So the ending does not ring through at all for me.Hoyt Axton as Father Levesque was great casting. He looked the part and his scenes rang true with me. The late Bruno Kirby as a guilt-ridden deputy was a little amusing. Again I found it hard to believe he and Demi were "getting it on" It was more amusing to me to see Kirby and De Niro in the same scene and envisioned them from way back in The Godfather:Part 2(1974) as Young Corleone and young Clemenza.The late Ray McNally, who by the way this film is dedicated to in memory, did a great small role as the warden. He was intense and no BS in his pursuit of the escaped cons. James Russo as 'Bobby' the main bad-guy convict was brilliant. He oozed evil personified. Reminded me of James Remar's Ganz from 48Hrs (1982) Yes he over acted but it was necessary since both De Niro &amp; Penn were so underplaying it.And last but least, Wallace Shawn as the translator and John C. Reilly as the young monk entranced and impressed with Penn's 'Father Brown', were excellent. So all in all these bit character actors made the film better than the main stars! What a shame because had Sean and Robert act the way they naturally do, they would have blown away everyone and stolen the picture. Oh well...there is always the original with Bogart,Ray and Ustinov.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was painful to watch. I'm not sure if it is just because it hasn't aged well but seriously I have never been so disappointed in a movie choice from Robert De Niro or Sean Penn until this moment. And also it was supposed to be a comedy. I thought I was in for an old-time laugh out loud comedy but not so; I didn't laugh once through the entire thing.It looks like from the other comments that the only people who enjoyed this movie have some sort of religious affiliation or belief. To me that is not good enough. A movie with religious ties does not automatically make it a good movie, a solid script, plot, cast and crew make it a good movie.Final recommendation: You have been warned, this movie is terrible and not worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film intends to follow a classic comedy plot that has been done many times. I mean no criticism by that - it is a very good film that is marred by some terrible choices that feel to me like they should be blamed on production/direction, not the material, cast or setting.It could have been great. The message is a serious, decent, inspiring one with extreme comic relief. The kind of thing that Hollywood is usually pretty good at.Superb writing, fine casting (except as noted below), very nice location/construction/set design. How could they fail? I'll tell you.Robert De Niro was very good except for the ridiculous way he channeled Victor McLaglen's lower jaw (don't believe me? Go watch 'Broadway Limited' again) so hard that the jaw should have gotten separate credit. Maybe even a supporting actor award.I don't know what was wrong with Sean Penn. Maybe I just didn't believe that the rest of the characters could really that fooled.Demi Moore plays the cliché, the whole cliché and nuttin' but the cliché. And has to labor under an over the top 'lower class' accent with no back story justifying that she speaks like that. Maybe DeNiro's jaw (Victor's?) got to her. Truth in reviewing - I don't really like her work but I would have disliked her way less if they hadn't pushed her so hard in so many ways.John C. Reilly is very good a role that could have been expanded. Ditto Mr. Axton. Ditto the cute kid. Ray McAnally was a little over the top but not ridiculous.A missed opportunity!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bobby &amp; Sean play Ollie and Stan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once we are past the opening scenes set in what seems to be a coal mine doubling as a prison, this film can be enjoyed as a fable. Many films should be prefaced with the phrase 'once upon a time' and this one is no exception. Producer DeNiro could not get Stan and Ollie so he put himself in the latter role, and chose Penn for the part of Laurel. We keep expecting to see Penn break out into Laurelish tears at any moment, and it is only the sound of the water that prevents us from hearing DeNiro shouting "whooaaaaaaa" as he slides down the falls. And there are so many times I expected Ollie to swat Stanley, but it never happens.Left to their mugging, my rating might be higher, but somehow inserting Demi into the mix spoils something. If the time were 1930, the little girl who plays a key role would have had a much older looking mother, or at least one who looked more bedraggled by her life in that wilderness.Then the storyline takes a disastrous violent turn just after the statute seems to have produced another miracle. Such a scene worked in Some Like It Hot when the killer jumped out of the cake. Here it ruins the mood that is being set. Surely there was another way to get the girl into the water.I have no problem, however, watching it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The interaction between Mr De Niro and Mr Penn is quite nice, the story reasonably well and the subtle humour well-placed. Mr Penn gives a good Stan Laurel-like performance and Mr de Niro keeps on amazing me. I mean, compare this role with the one in, for example, Heat: Mr De Niro knows how to handle it.

		<shortDescription>Lots of talent does not a good film make.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert De Niro, Sean Penn, David Mamet, and Neil Jordan combine their considerable talents to produce this sorry little mess of a film. While the plot has terrific potential to be a good comedy, very little actually works here. There were perhaps two occasions when I actually laughed, and the rest of the time I wore a wan smile waiting for the humor to begin in earnest. It never did. De Niro should stick to dramas, because he does not have, has never had, and never will have what it takes to be a good comedic actor. His primary contribution in "We're No Angels" is to mug for the camera to an extent that would make Lucille Ball embarrassed. Sean Penn is little better, using a wide-eyed, lost-little-boy expression throughout the film in an attempt to convey his character's wise-simpleton persona. Demi Moore can't act -- period. The characters played by Wallace Shawn and Ken Buhay are completely superfluous to the story, and so on. Ray McAnally and John C. Reilly provide nice turns as the prison warden and naive young monk, respectively, but they're not enough to save this production. This film is a low point in the careers of both screenwriter Mamet and director Jordan, and that is a bad combination. Rating: 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angels are in the title...but it was like being in Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People talk about seeing a film and never being able to get that time back. This is one of those movies. If I didn't know better I would say that DeNiro and Penn were deliberately doing bad acting. DeNiro's face is frozen in a mock grimace the whole film is seems like. Demi Moore's character has no decernable character. It is half developed at best. If I had to guess I would say that the actors lost a bet and had to appear in this film. Then I learn that DeNiro produced it. I don't know how these can be the two Oscar winners I know and love (DeNiro for Godfather 2 and Penn for Mystic River) So what kind of film is this really? Is it a comedy? No...it's not funny. Is it a drama...No! It has no suspense. Is it a waste of time for who ever sees it....YES!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the 1955 version of WE'RE NO ANGELS, so I bought the 1989 version on VHS, which might be better titled, WE'RE NO ANGELS GOES TO HELL. This second version is an exceedingly dark film. There is not one laugh in this film. Instead there is crushing poverty and a lack of redemption. Take DeNiro's unhumorous mawkish clown faces, Penn's tongue-in-cheek, insincere innocence, and add Demi Moore's heart-rending desperation, and you end up with two hours it would be more pleasant to spend in the Dentist's chair. This could be Mamet's only comedy, I SURE HOPE IT IS. David, go write some more con artist movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What were they thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is downright awful! It has what could be argued as a great cast, but everything about this film is painfully horrible. I can't believe DeNiro and Penn made this movie. Either the director is at fault for creating this mess, or the actors blew it. You'd think actors of their caliber might have managed to save this film, but DeNiro, especially, sunk it. DeNiro plays himself, badly. In fact, the more I see of DeNiro lately, the more I wonder about his true acting ability. Was Raging Bull a fluke? He's really picked some dogs the past 10-15 years, which is a shame. Sean Penn is pretty much in the same boat. Don't even get me started on Demi Moore. I've seen better acting in 4th- grade school plays. Take my advice and ave a couple hours of your life and pass on this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Method acting maybe? I am referring to the head bobbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More of a question really. Why did De Niro's head keep constantly bobbing around like that while he pulled the old sniffing Mafia Face? did that appeal to anyone out there? it irritated me immensely. Have to score the film low as I couldn't see any finer points as his head kept bobbing around and distracting all else. Penn's Performance seemed sound from what i could see through my red mist and basically saved the film, he also resisted from picking up this head bobbing method under immense pressure to do so, I wasn't so lucky for three days i couldn't keep it still. I wonder did the Director suffer from Star Fright as any other Director would have said something on the first take, like 'Mr De Niro why are you bobbing your head like that? are you OK?'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably bad acting was distracting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was aghast at and distracted by the over the top mannerisms of both DeNiro and Penn in the staring roles. I know that this was supposed to be a comedy/drama, but all that head bobbing was too much. Not that all of the other roles were something to write home about. The priests and monks were caricatures as were the warden and his bunch of deputies. Demi Moore added little but a gratuitous nude scene and a lot of senseless yelling. The ending was a predictable mix of worldly and spiritual resolution, but most interesting to me would be what happens after the end of the movie when all the secrets are uncovered between Demi and DeNiro. Why did I watch it if it bothered me that much? Well, my wife liked it because of the religious underpinnings and sentimentality. I guess between the two of us it averaged a 5 just like the overall rating.</fullReview>

Although the decision to take part in this film must have given her the proper mindset, one is left with the impression that Demi got stuck in her first attempt.Penn is a bit like Stan, but only a bit.De Niro seems to have thought that making faces and funny gestures should be enough for a comedy; it isn't.Why do people participate in a film like this?

		<shortDescription>DeNiro Isn`t Too Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing I remember most about WE`RE NO ANGELS on its 1989 release is the panning it got from critics , with Robert DeNiro`s performance coming in for the most vocal criticism . I have to admit that WE`RE NO ANGELS isn`t a career highlight for the man who starred in TAXI DRIVER , THE DEER HUNTER , RAGING BULL and ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA but he`s by no means bad . Neither is Sean Penn who at the time was better known as a B movie actor who was previously married to Madonna and who liked to punch journalists who took his photo without asking . The only two performances I can describe as bad are Demi Moore who`s even more unconvincing here than she usually is because she`s playing a character that requires acting , and veteran Irish award winning actor Ray McNally who is playing a sadistic caricture of a prison warder . WE`RE NO ANGELS suffers from being a comedy where director Neil Jordan and screenwriter David Mamet`s bring far too much dark oppresive atmosphere to the proceedings . The film opens with an execution and a rather violent gunbattle where people don`t simply fall down dead but leap about with blood splattering everywhere which seems out of place in a comedy . Mind you as comedies go DeNiro has appeared in a lot worse since</fullReview>

Some guy in the execution chamber suddenly produces guns out of nowhere and shoots everyone who isn't needed in the plot later? I'm not surprised the director chose to set this scene up in darkness. It is unexplainable.But that's OK!I can deal with plot streams being abandoned. The warden,determined to bring the fugitives to justice, just disappears from the movie because the guy he is looking for jumped in a river and became a local hero! I don't think so! I can also deal with bad acting;I can also deal with clichéd writing. But I don't want them all in one movie.This gets a high vote in my all time worst!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sure they are no angels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie dubbed on TV in Turkey some two years ago and was shocked to see De Niro and Penn in this rubbish. Firstly, this film is toooo artificial. The popular filmists or rather the lovers of popular cinema would love this film because there is an unusual event and unusual circumstances here which are highly unnatural.Two guys escaping a prison and willing to form a new life because they think they suffered enough. After all, they are no angels, are they?Then they become priests by chance. Ok, this is a movie, and this thing about becoming a priest may be accepted. But what's the significance if there is absolutely nothing to laugh at? Is this a tragedy? No, absolutely not. They have tried to make a feel-good movie but ended up in putting three hotshots in the crew and using a "phonebook as a script" as Edward Norton would quote if he were in this movie. Come to your senses. This movie is pure crap, made for people who like crap, to make money out of crap. But it's natural and acceptable that people like Penn and De Niro sometimes need bull**it. 4 out of ten at most.</fullReview>
