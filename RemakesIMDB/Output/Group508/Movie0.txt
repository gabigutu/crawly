		<shortDescription>A film with charm to spare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stumbled upon We're No Angels one night on AMC. I found that I couldn't leave the TV. I enjoyed the three likeable convicts and discovered that Humphrey Bogart has a knack for light comedy. Peter Ustinov is very deadpan and as a result, some of the best lines come from his character. Aldo Ray is the sweet dumb guy with a heart of gold and a rather dangerous pet. Basil Rathbone is great as the guy you love to hate. A great cast, a good script and good direction by Michael Curtiz makes this a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back when I was in college a friend of mine, the only other person I knew who had seen this film, used to recite lines to each other on appropriate occasions. He was a rugby player, a real rough and tumbly sort of guy, and I was a fairly gentle, studious type; we were two, very different types of people. The point behind this is that, while we were both very different, we both found "We're No Angels" to be a superbly executed film. I recently had a chance to see the film again and it's just as enjoyable as ever. This light-hearted, if somewhat criminal, comedy is warming, family film with an evil streak. It's absolutely fascinating to watch Bogart in a light comedy role, and to see a young(er) Peter Ustinov as a wife-murdering safe-cracker with a heart. And throw in great (if typical) performances by Basil Rathbone and Leo G. Carroll to boot.But in my mind, the three biggest stars in this film are playwright Albert Hussens, screenwriter Ranald MacDougall, and above all, a surprisingly masterful performance by Aldo Ray. Ray treads the line between being dumb, lovable, trite thug and being a brutal, sociopathic criminal with great resolve. In the end it is his smoothly delivered lines that one remembers above all else. As for the dialogue, it too treads lines. This is a film for the entire family, yes. But it does have it's randier moments, and all of them are done in such a way that children will not understand the full implications of them (if they do you have no one to blame but yourself). This translates into a "something for everyone" type of film.Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful, if unconventional, Christmas movie, although it is great fun to watch at any time of the year. As the three convicts, Bogart, Ustinov, and Aldo Ray have wonderful chemistry and camaraderi. Their portrayals are delightful, and are made stronger by the dialogue, which is first rate. Leo G. Carrol and Joan Bennet are touching as married couple, and Basil Rathbone has a delicious turn as the thoroughly unscrupulous and black-hearted cousin Andre. It is on my "Christmas Movies" shelf and we watch it every December without fail.</fullReview>

He shows that he is really a grand comedian. Rathbone is appropriately evil and nasty as the villain.Don't confuse this movie with the other one of the same title.

		<shortDescription>Top notch comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best comedies ever and one of my all-time favorites. I must have seen it a dozen or more times. The cast is perfect and Bogart shows he has a great talent for comedy. Rathbone plays the deliciously evil antagonist Cousin Andre, perfect in his role as the villain you love to hate which he pulls off with his usual deadpan style (has he ever played the good guy in any role?) Ustinov and Ray are perfect sidekicks for Bogart, their comedic style completely complements his. Carroll is perfect as the bumbling husband of the shop the convicts descend upon, initially planning on robbing him. I found the movie had all the necessary elements for a great side-splitting comedy along with some tender moments to show a contrast in the characters involved. I rate this one a nine of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>3 convicts escape from a jail on Devils island during Christmas, they make plan to rob a local store, but befriend the shop keeper and his family.Three great lead characters in Humphrey Bogart, Aldo Ray and Peter Ustinov play the convicts. Bogart plays his character without flaw and surprising to see him in this humorous role, while young Ustinov and Ray also play great characters that assist the shop keep and his family during a difficult Christmas.This movie wasn't what I was expecting especially after seeing 1989 movie with the same name staring De Niro and Penn, but I guess it was far better because i had a smile on my face throughout the whole movie. This certainly is a feel good sense to this movie.With great lines in this movie, you'll be sniggering to yourself and cheering on the 3 misfits. One to watch when you need a smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Special Christmas For One Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We're No Angels is adapted from a French play La Cuisine de Anges which was written by Albert Husson and ran a nice, respectable 344 performances on Broadway 1953-1954. In the roles of those unlikely angel/convicts on Broadway were Walter Slezak, Jerome Cowan, and Darren McGavin. Our three in this film are Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov, and Aldo Ray who escape from Devil's Island and are now among hundreds of other paroled convicts in the French West Indies at the turn of the last century. This was around the time Alfred Dreyfus was in Devil's Island so we know it was no fun place to be. But these three seem to have a light hearted take life as it comes attitude. There's no whining from any of them about them being innocent of what got them there. But they want out and make it.Fate puts them in the hands of a family they first would like to rob for some getaway loot. But hearing and seeing the sad plight they're in they can't bring themselves to do it. Then of course comes the Christmas visit of a tyrannical cousin played with relish by Basil Rathbone whom they work for and the convicts work becomes a pleasure.They are aided of course by a pet coral snake named Adolph that Ray keeps in a straw basket. In many ways Adolph is almost divinely driven to do his duty.Humphrey Bogart who was an unsuccessful embezzler in the film has a nice light touch for deadpan comedy. Too bad he didn't use it more often in films. This was a nice blend of comedy together with Bogey's gangster persona which we see more of in his films. On stage before he came to Hollywood, Bogart actually did a lot of light comedy.This was also Bogart's final film with Director Michael Curtiz with whom he worked often and well back at Warner Brothers. Most particularly in Casablanca which was Curtiz's Oscar winning film for himself and for the film. A lot consider that film the one that firmly cemented Humphrey Bogart as a top box office draw.Leo G. Carroll, Joan Bennett, and Gloria Talbott are the family who get some help on Christmas. The film itself is a great indication how the Deity or the fates do indeed move in mysterious ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never let it be said that Bogart could only play hard-boiled detectives in film noir. He had a great comedic talent, and it's evident in this film. This is a very funny movie; not hilarious, but funny as well as charming. Though the plot gets a little far-fetched, particularly towards the end, the dialogue is great and the acting superb. It's set at Christmas too, so you can add it to your list of holiday movies.</fullReview>

Certainly a welcome change of pace from today's reliance on sex and bodily functions for jokes. "We're No Angels" has few weak points, but they are easily overlooked by the witty dialogue, the strong screen presences of the actors, and by the situations themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Consider the casting for the three leads in "We're No Angels" - Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray. It doesn't seem to work on paper, but in this film, the trio have such a comedic rapport that the film winds up a delight. The setting is Christmas Day 1895, and all three are escaped convicts from Devil's Island with the notion of returning to Paris aboard a ship anchored in Cayenne harbor. What starts out as a casual afternoon to steal some money and kill some time, turns into a mission for the amiable villains. They spot a likely target, the shop of proprietors Felix and Amelie Ducotel (Leo G. Carroll and Joan Bennett). Offering their help to fix the shop's roof, they eavesdrop their way into the lives and hearts of their hosts, which also includes daughter Isabelle (Gloria Talbott). Leo G. Carroll plays his role along the same lines as his Topper character, amiable but somewhat bumbling. It's no wonder the shop makes no money; Bogart's observation - "I got ten years for a better set of books than this". To create just the right amount of tension, Felix Ducotel's cousin Andre Trochard (Basil Rathbone) arrives to take stock of the business, and can find no better fun than to spend Christmas Day going over the books. In tow is his nephew Paul (John Baer), for whom Isabelle has nursed a year long crush. In a mock trial, the criminal trio find Andre guilty and leave it to their pet snake Adolph to carry out the sentence. "We're no Angels" is one of those rare films in which you find yourself rooting for the bad guys. The one liners are brilliant, and shared equally among the three rogues. With deadpan delivery, Ustinov's Character Jules lovingly refers to the Ducotel's - "People like that, how can you cut their throats?". At film's end, the strain of playing it straight with the Ducotel's causes the convicts to reevaluate their plans; it would be much easier to return to prison where they can feel more at home. The dapper trio sport halos as they make their way back, with one more for good measure for Adolph. This is not your typical Christmas movie fare, but I can understand how it could wind up on your list of holiday favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rare Humphrey Bogart comedy, and it works perfectly! Seeing Bogart in the lead role, and the movie being about a jailbreak, I was expecting an adventure-drama. Instead I got a comedy, and a very good one at that.Incredibly sharp dialogue and some devilishly clever and funny sub-plots make this an hilarious movie. Add in the fact that it is set at Christmas, and there is a great amount of Christmas sentimentality and fun involved too.The other things that carry the movie are the performances of Bogart and, especially, Peter Ustinov. Bogart delivers his lines well and cannot be faulted, but Ustinov has a perfect sense of comedic timing. Plus his Englishness makes him seem so much funnier.Aldo Ray is a bit hit-and-miss as the third non-angel. Sometimes you feel he is just reciting his lines without any sense of timing or tone, but others then hit the mark well.Good support from Joan Bennett, Basil Rathbone, Leo Carroll and Gloria Talbott.A must-see, especially at Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spend Christmas with Bogie and Co.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray star in this film about three escapees from Devil's Island and how they affix themselves in the lives of Leo G. Carroll and wife Joan Bennett as Christmas approaches. By way of assuming the roles of handymen and salesmen, they start to help around the house and the store that Leo manages. In fact, their assistance turns out to be invaluable, as they interject themselves in a personal family squabble between Leo and cousin Basil Rathbone who comes to inspect the shop and the accounts, as he is the owner of the shop. I found the film to be very charming and enjoyable, and it has some very funny and clever moments. If I had to be nit-picky about it, I could say it does reflect the original play's pace and is somewhat too passive and slow in parts and is a bit too long. Also, it does have a rather unorthodox and irreverent feel to it due to a hardened criminal's point of view of things, from which is the root of a lot of the humor. But, it also has a very loose biblical feel to it, very loose. All in all, I liked its charming feel and the talented actors are good in the leads. If you're looking for a fresh and original film this December, "We're No Angels" should make for a different kind of family viewing come Christmastime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The setting for this movie is 1895, Devil's Island. The story unfolds around Christmas time and what a delightful tale it is to be seen. Michael Curtiz directs a cast that makes you feel like the characters in the story are family. I know a bit offbeat and with a bit of dark humor at times. The movie shines with real heartfelt emotion. It truly is one of my favorite movies, not just at Christmas time but anytime. If you are a Bogart or Ustinov fan you deserve to treat yourself to this little gem.Aldo Ray is simply wonderful as the muscular backup to our three angels. Basil Rathbone is perfect in his character. If you see the movie you will know what I mean. The song "Sentimental Moments" is such a sweet little song. I wish it this were in circulation on TCM or other channels.It is a Christmas classic in our house, maybe it will be yours too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly delightful, astonishingly well-acted, and beautifully directed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautifully adapted from a French play La Cuisine de Anges, fresh off its brilliant success on Broadway, We're No Angels is one of my favorite "overlooked" films of all time. Villainously remade in 1989, the original "We're no Angels" is a lyrically beautiful tale of the most unlikely sort.Three escaped convicts on Devil's Island plan to rob and murder an innocent family until they become absorbed in their comically desperate lives. Maintaining a light comedy throughout, without once devolving into farce, "We're no Angels" is wickedly charming and deviously funny, owing in no small part to the epic talent of its all-star cast."We're no Angels" stars Aldo Ray, Peter Ustinov, and Humphrey Bogart, all marvelous and at the peak of their prowess, and is directed by Michael Curtiz, whose most notable efforts include not only Academy Award winning "Mildred Pierce", Joan Crawford's triumphant comeback film, but also another Humphrey Bogart masterpiece, "Casablanca." There is a heartwarming Christmas theme throughout the film, but it never gets overly saccharine. To the contrary, the convicts remain unrepentant and incorrigible to the end, despite their dubious good deeds. In a nutshell, the Ducatel family runs a shop for their absent relative, who shows up unexpectedly to audit the books and, most likely, discharge the hapless shopkeeper family. But things begin to go seriously awry, thanks to a reptilian interloper, Adolph, with a ruthless ability to do what is unthinkable to the rest of the cast. Adolph is never seen, nor is any violence or menace, and the film ends up being perfect for family viewing, despite its dark themes. In fact, I include the charming gem in my Christmas traditions, and I highly recommend it for yours.The supporting cast is almost too good to be true. Leo G. Carroll is the shopkeeper, delightfully muddled and well intentioned. Joan Bennett, whom most will remember as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard on television's "Dark Shadows", is his slightly put-upon wife. Basil Rathbone plays the evil cousin from France with villainous aplomb.Why this film is not better known escapes me. It is utterly delightful, astonishingly well-acted, and beautifully directed. It leaves me with a warm feeling worth its weight in gold, and certainly worth a watch if you've never seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1955's "We're No Angels," directed by Michael Curtiz, proves once again that Humphrey Bogart was as adept at comedy as he was at drama. Here he's joined by Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray. The three of them are escaped convicts from Devil's Island who become involved with a store owner (Leo J. Carroll) - at first planning to rob him - but find they care too much about him, his wife (Joan Bennett), their daughter (Gloria Talbot), and the impending visit of the horrible uncle who controls the purse strings (Basil Rathbone). They wind up giving the family a Christmas they'll never forget, in more ways than one.This is a wonderful holiday film from the French play "My Three Angels" that retains some of the French sentence structure - which sounds hilarious coming from the lips of the likes of Bogart and Aldo Ray. It makes the film all the more delightful.The acting is terrific from the three stars and also the rest of the cast.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the BIG screen &amp; with an audience, it is delightful! Much better than watching it alone...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here are my notes from introducing the film... WE'RE NO ANGELS premiered September 23, 1955 and was produced and distributed by Paramount in Technicolor &amp; VistaVision!This version does not star Robert DeNiro or Sean Penn, that was a sort of remake made in 1989.It was based on the French play by Albert Husson, "Kitchen Of The Angels" and with a screenplay written by Ranald MacDougall. The working title of this film was Angels Cooking.On Broadway in 1953 a droll, tender romp called "My Three Angels." Based on the same French play, was adapted by Bella and Sam Spewack about some nice Devils Island inhabitants and a trio of convicts. When this film came out, the Spewack's sued and the result of that lawsuit was never disclosed.Two key talents of the studio system actor Humphrey Bogart and director Michael Curtiz collaborated four times. Their first was ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES in 1938, a picture that cemented Bogey's gangster reputation. CASABLANCA followed in 1942, capturing the Best Picture &amp; Best Director Oscar for Curtiz and securing film immortality for Bogart. Their third collaboration was PASSAGE TO MARSEILLE a 1944 World War Two action film. So it only makes sense that their final film together would be . . . what else but a light weight Christmas comedy?Bogart plays Joseph a master forger and ringleader of the convicts. He is joined by Peter Ustinov as the multitalented Jules trying to avoid a life sentence as a wife-murdering safecracker. And Aldo Ray rounds out the group as Albert, likewise pulling a life stretch for knocking his uncle over the head?fatally. Albert is inseparable from his pet, a poisonous viper named Adolph that he carries with him everywhere in a little basket. Ustinov had just completed THE Egyptian, also directed by Curtiz.And, both men were looking forward to working together again. On the set, Ustinov and Bogart would become good friends as well, although Humphrey was prone to practical jokes like putting raw liver in Ustinov's shoes, something Peter did not find funny.The main fascination comes from seeing tough-guy Bogart in one of his very few comedies. His character practically drips with sarcasm. Ustinov excels at effete snobbery and gets off some of the best lines, while the gravel-voiced Ray is by turns menacing and charming and sometimes both at once.Leo G. Carroll who plays the shop keeper, a benign and lovable fuddy-duddy will be recognizable from NORTH BY NORTHWEST &amp; The Man From UNCLE. Basil Rathbone plays the sinister store owner with glee, a delightful parody of the villain roles he often played. And Joan Bennett is particularly memorable as the kindly shopkeeper's wife. Bennett, best known for Fritz Lang's film noir classics and as Spencer Tracy's wife in FATHER OF THE BRIDE, had been away from the screen for almost three years after being embroiled in a scandal that effectively blackballed her from Hollywood. In 1951 her husband, producer Walter Wanger shot her lover and agent Jennings Lang in a jealous rage. When the smoke (literally) cleared, Bennett was painted as the antagonist in the lover's triangle and quickly shunned by film society. Bogart, a long-time friend, came through for Joan by recommending her for the role in WE'RE NO ANGELS.The film starts in French Guiana, a few days before Christmas. Bogart, Ustinov and Ray escapees from prison need a place to hide out. They need of clothing and money? the trio makes plans to rob milliner Leo G. Carroll and his family. "We'll cut their throats for a Christmas present", Bogie, remarks. "That might spoil one's belief in Santa Claus" replies philosophical wife-murderer Ustinov.We're No Angels is a curious little comedy, flirting with the macabre, then pulling back to play nice. It's not dark enough to qualify as black comedy, nor is it total fluff either. But it's a seriously good-looking film with an exceptional cast of tough guys enjoying a rare cinematic romp.From all reports, the set of We're No Angels was a happy one, a fact reflected in the warm, engaging performances of its stars. There's not a cute kid or snowflake in sight, but We're No Angels, like It's A Wonderful Life, still manages to capture the essential humanistic message of the best Christmas themed films, with a delightful underlying irreverence and sense of fun.The charmingly hammy performances capture this feeling well and make me wish that all of us no matter how sorded our past could, at Christmas time, at least act like angles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this on Sky listings. Old, vague, but still strong memories of a 'good' film made me watch it this late evening.What a charming film. Clearly from a stage play , but the film direction was excellent, keeping the pace and the interest in 'What happens next' high.I would say Bogart was a scene stealer, but unfortunately everyone else was too! You have to admire the courage of Peter Ustinov then; he was a young unknown, but did his idiosyncratic twitchy thing confidently in front of the Great Bogart. But that was how great new talent came through. They wouldn't let a Ustinov near a Bogart today. Too risky. Best to stick to the bland.There lies the modern day problem.For Bogart (at the time this film was made) to say something like " We'll bash their skulls, gouge their eyes, then slit their throats, but first we'll do the dishes" said a lot about the man. He was willing to put his lucrative tough guy reputation on the line to deliver this script. How was he to know it was going to turn out well?'The Inbetweeners' is flavour of the moment at the cinema. Ask any of its fans to watch ' We're no Angels' and they might look strangely at you. But leave them on their own with the DVD and five minutes in I bet most of them would be hooked (they just would never admit it, not cool you see). Well, I think this is a really cool film. I will watch it again happily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite being fans of 1950's films, we hadn't seen this until we bought it recently on DVD. What a lovely film it turned out to be, with Bogey leading an excellent cast in a charming story with great heart. As we have grown older, we have started to appreciate Humphrey Bogart more and more, and as has been noted, he has a very good touch with light, understated comedy. Leo G Carroll takes it easy as the store manager, and he and Joan Bennett as his wife have several very nice scenes together, especially the one around the piano which reminded me of a similar one in 'Meet me in St Louis'. All in all, a beautifully-crafted film with just the right amount of corn and sentimentality, ideal for those quiet Sunday afternoons. I'm sure I'm not alone in saying 'they don't make them like this anymore' - and isn't that a shame?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joseph, Julius and Albert have escaped from Devil's island, whilst waiting for a ship to take them away, they plot to steal from the amiable Ducotel family. They bluff store owner Felix into letting them repair his roof, from here they plan to execute their robbery, but the more that the escapees observe this family, the more they find humane persona's coming from within.Humphrey Bogart, Aldo Ray and Peter Ustinov take up the task of playing our villains who find hearts, and backed up with witty dialogue amongst the very tidily scripted piece, the result is a hugely enjoyable picture for all the family. The film mainly works because of the interplay between Ustinov &amp; Bogart, Ustinov's Jules is a softly spoken gentile sort of man and this oddly works well against Bogart's Joseph who is gruff and oozing toughness, this of course sets us up for some delightful scenes that leave a lasting impression, for example witness Bogart in a pink apron!. Aldo Ray, perhaps not unsurprisingly, seems a touch out of place and looks swamped by the acting talent either side of him, but he does what is needed and his characters pet snake, Adolphe, is the crucial meat in this films sandwich. Sadly Basil Rathbone is wasted by being reduced to what amounts to little more than a walk on villain part, but a great bonus is Leo G. Carroll as the hapless Felix Ducotel, charmingly oblivious to what is around him, Carroll gets the audience on board with a smashingly effective turn.Perhaps viewed as a Christmas movie by many, it is however a film that can be watched at anytime of the year, a testament to what a good script can do for comedy, We're No Angels is never less than fun, and of course its backed up by a few highly watchable performances. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dialogue is great, witty, and enticing. I just sat down to watch this movie since it was on TV and someone told me I should really watch it. I'm so glad I did! Now I'll have to find it for my video collection. There are very few disappointments in this movie (the only ones I can think of myself are the musical interruptions... they did nothing to further the plot and were kind of corny). Great delay and fun, gentle tension is created by the eloquent dialogue. Adolphe gets and A+ from me! The perfect hero-to-the-rescue. The chicks could've been stronger characters, but considering the time period that'd be a lot to ask. Fun ending, leaves much to the imagination. Overall, a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bogart made two off-beat, under-appreciated comedies in the 50s, Beat the Devil and the gem of We're No Angels. Gloriously sumptuous to look at and listen to with sophisticated dialog that makes you love these thieves and murderers (especially considering how they deal with Rathbone's baddie). They don't make 'em like this anymore (well, a lame remake was tried, but why did they bother?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We're no angels" is that rara avis a perfect film.Please do not under any circumstances confuse it with the appallingly witless melange of late 80's clichés that masquerades under the same title.Mr Bogart was a true movie star,Mr Ustinov a hugely-talented man,too big to be constrained by the parameters of film,and Mr Ray a neglected and ill-used actor whose considerable abilities were overlooked by Hollywood to the extent that he was usually cast as a tough marine/soldier/sailor/detective and disregarded for almost anything else.Michael Curtiz,that wily veteran,didn't make that mistake,and Mr Ray is a delight throughout the film.Compared to the ubiquitous Mr Robert de Niro and the frankly weird Mr Sean Penn,these men are giants. Lovely 1950's colour adds a patina that no amount of laboratory wizardry can reproduce in the 21st century.There is none of the foul-mouthed outpouring that passes for comic dialogue in modern movies ,the script obviously having been written by a person over the age of 14. When I first saw this film in the late fifties I thought it witty and charming,well-cast and heat-warming.In retrospect it seems a masterpiece manque,one of the last comedies that were actually funny,a relic from the days before the cinema was "liberated" ,a cultural revolution that most moviegoers never knew they wanted. The other "We're no angels" is a product of this revolution.Proving beyond all doubt that freedom ain't all it's cracked up to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" . . . you meet a better class of people there," notes master forger Joseph (Humphrey Bogart) at the close of WE'RE NO ANGELS. The purpose of this 1955 flick is to use Christmas as a backdrop to explain how the world works to young people. ANGELS exposes rich people (represented here by Andre and Paul) as society's biggest thieves, out to cheat their "inferiors" at every turn. Andre short-changes his taxi wagon driver 56%. Paul burns an unfavorable will. Both threaten to ruin their Middle Class relatives Felix, Amelie, and Isabel if it will add as much as a nickel to their own hoards of wealth. "Civilization" is depicted here as a legal system with one goal: to let the Rich (that is, the Master Thieves) get richer. As the Kangaroo Court convened by "angels" Joseph, Jules, and Albert rules, there can be just one fit sentence for the Rich: Death! Adolphe, their pet, is a viper or snake--the universal symbol of Evil. Since Evil got Andre and Paul into their riches, it is up to Evil to get them out, and Adolphe makes quick work of this pair of Rich Bozos. Though there are fewer jingling bells in WE'RE NO ANGELS than in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, even Adolphe winds up with a halo at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endearingly Weird and Unique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We're No Angels" is a weirdly endearing, unique movie. It's really hard for a movie to be unique, given how many there are. What makes "We're No Angels" so special: the cast, the black humor, and the setting.For a Golden Age film fan, "We're No Angels" cast is reason enough to catch the film. Almost every member of the small cast is a screen icon, and from a completely different genre: Humphrey Bogart, the quintessential tough guy gangster, Peter Ustinov, famous for his decadent Nero, Aldo Ray, sunny, smiling, cracked-voice blonde athlete and hunk, Joan Bennett, a film noir femme fatale, Leo G. Carroll, famous for playing fastidious gentlemen, and Basil Rathbone, the evil antagonist in swashbuckler sword duels.Here, though, they are merely old pros, trading the film's stagey, black humor lines with calm aplomb. When hunky, escaped murderer Aldo Ray cracks to Basil Rathbone, playing a Snidely Whiplash style villain, "You frighten me," the line is funny enough to be worth seeing the film for.When not delivering their lines, the actors here seem almost to dance with each other; the film is like choreography. Each star has his or her own distinctive body language and it all comes together humorously.The film's very quiet, dark humor and literate script tell a fantastic tale: three convicts, escaped from Devil's Island, fall into a failing bourgeois merchant's household and manage to turn their Caribbean holiday into a real Christmas. The plot has just enough realism -- bad men converted by a young girl's faith, for example ? to convince you to go along for the ride.</fullReview>

Peter Ustinov is puckish and completely captivating; his facial expressions are masterful. Humphrey Bogart's character exquisitely spoofs his own stereotype.

		<shortDescription>I'm in the minority, but I found it boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this one? I guess they were TOO high. First of all, I've often had trouble with the concept of obviously filmed plays? "Noises Off" and "The Man Who Came to Dinner" were two of the worst offenders in my opinion. Static, motionless, tons of expositional dialogue crammed in as fast as they possibly could. And that was my experience with "We're No Angels". (I should note that I was unaware it had originally been a play when I started it? but I figured it out in about five minutes. How did "Arsenic and Old Lace" manage to be so entertaining, since it basically had the same limitations? I don't know, but 'static' is not a word I would apply to that film.) The first fifteen or twenty minutes of this one are basically filled with Bogart, Ustinov and Ray up on the roof watching and listening as the Ducotel family rolls out their long list of woes. How long can you watch someone looking in a window? What worked on the stage doesn't necessarily translate well to the screen. There was no action that I needed to see in order to follow the film, so about the time the daughter fainted for the second time, I went to work on a project in the kitchen and finished the film by listening only. It was so incessantly talky that it was like listening to a radio dramatization? perfect background for a little DIY puttering; not enough to keep me sitting and staring at the screen for the entire running time. I certainly had no trouble following it from the next room.That said, I thought Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray were both excellent; they both presented well-drawn characters and delivered their lines (including some real zingers) with appropriate gusto. Bogart was all right, but I've been much more impressed with him in other pictures. He didn't seem to be working as hard as the other two were.Dull, predictable, nothing special. Wanted to like it more; wish I had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Naive and Theatrical Delightful Movie for the Whole Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Christmas, three prisoners - Joseph (Humphrey Bogart), Albert (Aldo Ray) and Jules (Peter Ustinov) - escape from the Devil Island to a French small coastal town. They decide to robber a store, to get some money and clothes and travel by ship to another place. They pretend to be there to fix the roof, but pretty soon they realize that the financial condition of the family Ducotel is not good. Andre Tochard (Basil Rathbone), the selfish and mean owner of the establishment, explores the family Ducotel. The three convicts spend the Christmas night with the Ducotel and are so well treated by the family that they decide to help them. Their pet will help them to fix the situation.This movie is a typical family entertainment. Naive and theatrical, it belongs to a romantic period where the society could buy the idea of helping criminals and spending Christmas night with them. The viewer certainly will not be disappointed with such a delightful entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "N?o Somos Anjos" ("We Are not Angels")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some films don't age, they start perfect and stay perfect. Three angels came to earth even if they just came down from the roof. Two murderers and a forger are hoping to escape Devil's Island but find themselves swept into the lives of Ducotel family?Felix, Amelie, and Isabelle. The simple joy of the family touches the hearts of the three convicts: even though Joseph (Bogart) insists they are going to beat their heads in and cut their throats; just as soon as they wash the dishes. But when cousin Andre (Basil Rathbone) arrives, the three men are pleased; he is so hateful, they now have a genuine object to plot against. With some assistance from their pet Adolphe, the convicts manage to put things "right" before cousin Andre and nephew Paul have Felix put into prison. Watch the scene wherein Joseph, Albert, and Jules argue among themselves as how to warn Andre before he figures out how to open Adolphe's box to see three masters at work making it look like play. The humor throughout is full of wit, and none of it has faded over the years. Every line spoken seems golden with words filled with irony and double entendres. And there is a lot to say for prison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weird but fine Christmas comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found and decided to watch that film as I looked for a Christmas movie to see during the holidays. I've seen almost every holiday classic so I went for this rather unconventional Christmas film. And got rewarded.A rather unusual trio of Humphrey Bogart, Aldo Ray and Peter Ustinov star as three escapees in 1895 Devil's island who find refuge in a store owned by a family in financial trouble on Christmas Eve. Their first thought is to rob them and flee, of course, but they seem to be rather good-natured and helpful to the family when they encounter their problems. Eventually, they help the family deceive their sinister cousin, brilliantly portrayed by Basil Rathbone, who along with his son try to exploit the situation and take over their enterprise. A pet rattlesnake owned by Ray's character and named "Adolphe" provides help when needed.Although the film depicts convicts, crimes and even deaths, it's a pure comedy. It's a little weird to watch Bogie play in one, but the truth is that Ray, Ustinov and Rathbone are much more funnier than him. Coincidentially, there was another film in 1955 depicting three escaped convicts finding refuge in a house where a family lives, The Desperate Hours, and it also starred Bogart. Of course, the later film is a tough noir with Bogie portraying a lunatic criminal, while here he and his fellow escapees seem rather sympathetic.Only one thing is a complete fail in this film, and it's the final minute. Having solved all the problems, our friends are ready to escape to France via ship, but they decide to return to the jail as they "like it more there". It's clear as sky that this ending was influenced by the Hays Code, which was in force at the time and demanded punishment for every criminal action, including escape. However, telling us that they preferred the Devil's island to freedom in France is, in my opinion, a serious offense to all these people, guilty or not, who lived their Hell on Earth in one of the most infamous prisons of all time.Ignoring this little blemish, the film is a funny comedy and a great choice for the holiday season. A great cast, witty dialogue and some hilarious scenes ensure it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>UNCONSCIOUS WOMAN ALERT: I feel I have an obligation to those who hate movie clichés to let you know that one of the actresses in this film, Gloria Talbot, faints again and again. In reality people RARELY do this unless there is some sort of serious medical disorder and I hate to see "dumb women" fainting on cue in films--a definitely negative stereotype.BAD IDEA ALERT: In this film, a family is aided by three nice escaped convicts. If you happen upon a group of escaped murderers and thieves, do NOT invite them into your home. This, despite the film, is a rather bad idea and is not advisable! The film WE'RE NO ANGELS is odd in that it plays an awful lot like a play and perhaps it was, though IMDb gives no indication of this. The way people walk in and walk off make this seem play-like as does its rather confined manner--it's almost entirely set within one house.The movie begins with three prisoners (Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray) escaping from one of the prisons on in French Guiana. This complex of prisons is known as 'Devil's Island' and once prisoners complete their sentences, they are required to live in French Guiana for the rest of their lives. So, seeing three prisoners walking about free in the colony isn't so unusual--people recognize them as prisoners but mistakenly think they've completed their time.While their goal is to eventually get on a ship heading back to France (why France--why not anywhere but France--where they might be recognized?!?), they need to get some cash. So, they descend upon a poor shopkeeper (Leo G. Carroll) and his family. No, they don't want to kill or rob them necessarily (at least after they get to know them), but see if there is some way they can scrounge up some money. Bogart makes himself at home--and begins selling off merchandise that's just been sitting there for years. Because of this, the family let the men stay--after all, they are helping the shop to finally make money. In some ways, all this is rather reminiscent of the great Edward G. Robinson film LARCENY INC., though this story seems more like a reworking of the older film, not necessarily a remake.While staying with the family, these three very larcenous men seem to become almost like guardian angels for the family--doing little things to help them, such as giving them advice and "finding" a turkey for their dinner. Folks, this is really NOT a good idea. If you come upon some escaped convicts it's actually very unlikely they'll help you straighten out your lives. Murder, rape and/or robbery is actually a lot more likely than their acting like three Mary Poppins wannabes!! It turns out that the family's biggest problem is Carroll's cousin (Basil Rathbone). Rathbone owns the company which owns the store and he is continually threatens to fire him, as the shop makes very little money. When Rathbone arrives, it's up to the three nice murderers/thieves to save the day. And, in the film, this all somehow works out...thanks to a tiny little snake--go figure. Unfortunately, the final lines in the film are rather unexpected and quite dumb! A decent enough film but a terrible finale. Overall, this is an agreeable but not especially inspired film. While a clever idea, the acting is very broad and characters seem a bit too much like caricatures. Not bad...just not particularly subtle or as good as it could be.</fullReview>

He's just terrible in this. Ustinov is OK but if they would have givin him more lines and eliminated the Ray character it could have worked for me. Aldo Ray has mainly played the same character in about everything he did and after watching "Pat and Mike", I had enough of that. When I popped this one in and saw him I thought..."Uh Oh". I honestly think his career was due to 2 things...his good looks and the fact he was in WW2 as a navy frogman. Maybe some producer thought was an interesting take but I think actual acting ability needs to be considered...and I don't think he had much.The premise is OK but it's just not that special of a film. You won't ever remember this over say...African Queen or High Sierra. I think if they would have just concentrated on the family who own the shop it would have been better but what we get is a Bogey vehicle to bring in the movie goers.In the end it just didn't work for me. I wasn't remotely impressed with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't until a few years ago that my family purchased the DVD and sat down and watched this. Since the first viewing this has become a family favorite for Christmas (as well as other times during the year). First of all, it has wonderful acting throughout. Humphrey Bogart is fantastic and shows off his versatility as a comedic actor. Peter Ustinov is superb as is Aldo Ray. The three seem to play off each other so well that it's easy to get lost in the story.Though the movie starts a little slow it picks up the pace fairly quickly and doesn't let up. As the three convicts come undergo significant character change teaming up against a Basil Rathbone (who plays a great villain).I must say that this movie has what I feel is one of the funniest scenes I have seen in any movie ever (a laugh-so-hard-it-hurts scene). Though the movie almost has the feel of a play because of the limited locations, it makes up for it with the humorous story and the fantastic acting. You will never look at Bogart the same again!</fullReview>

But this is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I will add my voice to the overwhelmingly-positive reviews.They just don't come much better than this, and watching the film again (as I have just done, as Christmas is approaching) is a blend of delight and a bit of wistfulness that these fine actors are no longer with us. Each is at the top of his game, and they so obviously enjoy working together that it adds to the energy of the film. The dialog is memorable and witty, but I have seen the stage play and it is these particular actors who have made the words timeless. We are fortunate that they had a chance to come together on this film. The ending is the only sour note, but in the perspective of the 50s it makes sense.This is a film to be enjoyed more upon each return visit, and sharing it with those who have not yet seen it is a great delight. The DVD release is crisp and colorful. Buy it. Share it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top notch comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best comedies ever and one of my all-time favorites. I must have seen it a dozen or more times. The cast is perfect and Bogart shows he has a great talent for comedy. Rathbone plays the deliciously evil antagonist Cousin Andre, perfect in his role as the villain you love to hate which he pulls off with his usual deadpan style (has he ever played the good guy in any role?) Ustinov and Ray are perfect sidekicks for Bogart, their comedic style completely complements his. Carroll is perfect as the bumbling husband of the shop the convicts descend upon, initially planning on robbing him. I found the movie had all the necessary elements for a great side-splitting comedy along with some tender moments to show a contrast in the characters involved. I rate this one a nine of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always liked this whimsical black comedy. It does not take itself too seriously (unlike the 1989 remake with Sean Penn and Robert Di Niro). Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov (with his pet snake), and Aldo Ray escape from Devil's Island, and reach port as the first step to permanent freedom. But they need new clothes and money, so they plan to rob and kill the owners of a store (Leo G. Carroll and Joan Bennett), but change their minds because of their kindnesses to them and their attractive daughter (Gloria Talbot). They end up as unpaid clerks in the store. Then alone comes Basil Rathbone (the actual owner of the store) and his nephew John Baer). Rathbone is at his haughtiest, and Baer is fully supportive of his uncle (who will one day leave him some money, of course). The three convicts do their best to make Rathbone's stay as unpleasant as they can. Ustinov's little pet helps end that visit, and Baer's as well. At the end, they decide to return to Devil's Island, as it is fairly easy for them to get off whenever they could.To me the dialog had some nice bits and pieces in it: Two examples come to mind. When Rathbone is first parading around "his" store in front of Carroll, Bennett, and the convicts, he demands something to eat several times. A fed up Bogart goes into the kitchen and returns with a pineapple. He hands it to Rathbone, who is amazed at getting the unprepared fruit (it is still intact in it's skin). "What am I to do with this?", Rathbone demands. "Swallow it!", says Bogart. Later, after Baer (who was searching the clothes of his dead uncle) gets bitten by Ustinov's snake, he asks them if he should worry. They start chuckling and Bogart repeats the line in the "Summary" line above.It is not the best black comedy film, but it is pretty consistently amusing and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Your Typical Christmas Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a woefully underrated film, if for no other reason than that it's the only film I've ever seen in which Peter Ustinov is upstaged by another actor - in this case, Humphrey Bogart. Bogart isn't exactly famous for his comedy, but he's magnificently funny in this, and while Ustinov is one of my favorite people (as actor, writer, director and raconteur), and while he's in good form in this film, he's outclassed by Bogart. Basil Rathbone and Leo J. Carroll are also first-rate, as usual, and the whole movie has a kind of black charm that makes this a far better film than its reputation (such as it is) would have you believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought and watched the DVD over the weekend and had the best time in a long time watching a film. It has always been a favorite and I think it had been about 10 years since I saw it last, fortunately it holds up extremely well. The cast is perfect and has a nice blend of dry humor and sentiment. I did laugh out loud a few times but mostly I was just enjoying the plotting and the humor of the situation. Very Entertaining and should really be the next Christmas must watch film along with A Christmas Story and the Animated How The Grinch Stole Christmas. In fact I think my friends will each get a copy of the DVD for Christmas. I Recommend this film very highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Comedy Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My family has watched We're No Angels, as a family every Christmas eve since 1979. We have never grown weary of it. My children now watch it with us. My oldest is 9 and now is getting some of the humor and he loves it. Simply put it is one of the finest, most entertaining, and still belly laughing funny movies whether Christmas genre or not. They simply do not make witty movies like this anymore. There aren't dramatic actors who can team with comedic actors and create this kind of funny and charm. Please, do yourself a favor and get this film and share it with your family this Holiday. Do it or my friend Adolph may visit you in your sleep...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic comedy. A witty movie that shows bogart in a rare comic role. Ustinov and aldo ray are great support. Good one liners, several little tragedies, and a happy, if a surprise, ending make this one a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woot, Aldo Ray!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent movie in my expert opinion. the acting and humor are all top notch, as well as the snobby addition of Basil RATHBONE, not Rasibone. The dim yet lovable shop clerk gives off a warm fuzzy feeling while his strong faithful wife gives you a newfound respect for patient women. the daughter, while a little limp in thought is charming to the very end and sweeter than the finest honey. Kinda makes you feel sorry that Ray's character cannot have her. but the ships medical guy is nice enough. My school has considered the play for it's character and moving capacities as next years play. i hope that in future years you will not be so silly as to ignore such a large piece of gold. That and Aldo Ray is a very sexy man and rocks my socks off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>goofy but funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three excaped prisoners on devils island turns into the three Wise men for Christmas. The plot of this film is analagous to a bad librato for an opera or a stag movie. If you come for the music or sex, you don't mind the thin plot. On the positive side, this film has Bogart, Usitnov, Rasibone, and a cast of supporting characters, a great director, and great diverely of clever lines patch together the implausible plot, to the point that the movie is a little gem. If only the trio sailed to freedom, the movie would survice as a notable film. But to go back to prison, particularly for some contrived reason is silly. They had won their moral redemption and right to return to freedom. The last set is regrettable, and an obvious sign of respect for the conservative moral standards of its production year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is my favorite X-MAS classic movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A much better movie than the sappy and over-wrought "A Wonderful Life" with James Stewart, although he is always great. Storywise, "We're No Angels" has a more interesting and realistic premise. Also, there is a bit of sardonic humor which is exquisitely delivered by the three leading protagonists...Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov, and Aldo Ray. I recommend this movie very highly!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amiable Angels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three escaped convicts turn into guardian angels in this screen adaptation of a stage play. Bogart takes a break from his tough-guy roles to yuk it up. He doesn't have to exert himself much in this genial comedy, playing Moe to Ray's and Ustinov's Larry and Curly, respectively. Unlike the Three Stooges, the humor is more verbal than physical. Although somewhat dark, the dialog is not as witty as it could have been. And there is perhaps too much dialog and much of the humor is forced and obvious. The big mystery is how did Carroll, with a face only a mother could love, manage to nab a wife as attractive as Bennett.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorest excuse for a movie I've ever tried to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't alive back in 1955, but upon seeing this film at my birth, I might have re-entered the womb. I was hopelessly disappointed by this silly, asinine plot, which Humphrey Bogart seems to saunter through as if imitating a tipsy Frank Sinatra.The characters' actions are not realistic: not even in my wildest imagination could I have believed that these 3 lummoxes were even on "Devil's Island." This movie can't even copy the antics of the Marx Brothers or the classic slapstick of "the Three Stooges," so why it tried, I'll never know. The trio of actors lopes and shuffles through each turn of events as if they were all on their day off. I saw no drama, suspense or comedy.This dud of a movie should be erased from cinematic history. --A lifeless, boring, pale, pastel bore of a film. I give only one star to be shared by all the actors who got paid less than the three main principals.</fullReview>
