		<fullReview>These guys are anything but the Usual Suspects! They are a total bunch of likeable oddballs who you want to see get away with it,but they are so hapless that there is very little chance of that.No one is better than William H Macy at portraying the man with a big heart but down on his luck.This is probably his best performance since Fargo.Sam Rockwell played the meathead boxer to perfection,and the rest of the gang were uniformly good also.Luis Guzman brought some great comic relief as Cosimo,and George Clooney stole every scene in his cameo role.The heist scene at the end was absolutely hilarious.The direction was also spot on by the Russo brothers.There was certainly a Coen brothers feel to the film throughout and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers.They have a long way to go to match the Coen's but this is an excellent start and I look forward to their next celluloid outing. ......."Yo mutha's a whore"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slight but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picked up on grand theft auto, Cosimo is told of a big job by a lifer. Cosimo goes to his friend Toto to help get a guy to do his jail time for him so he can do the job. After asking around Toto comes up with Pero. However Pero double-crosses Cosimo and leaves him in jail and sets up the group to do the job without him. After they enlist the help of expert safe cracker Jerzy the group start putting down the foundations for a job that has all the hallmarks of disaster.I went to see this with the usual blaze of hype that goes with any movie, the usual OTT quotes from the hacks etc. I didn't expect too much so it was a pleasant surprise. The plot is quite enjoyable and is enlivened by a witty (but not hilarious) script. The comedy of the actual job is great and delivered well. However I will stress that anyone who goes along with the words of Jonathon Ross (`I haven't laughed so hard in years') will probably be disappointed as it isn't a laugh a second.The strength of the film is in the strong cast. There is no real star (although it will be sold on Clooney) and everyone carries the story and the humour. Macy is good, Rockwell is funny as always, Clooney has a good cameo, Washington is solid enough but I prefer Esposito when she uses her normal voice. Gabrielle Union has a very small part but manages to be very seductive in the first of her two scenes ? she is clearly going to be bigger in the next few years or so. For me the star of the film is Michael Jeter. It's such a shame that he died not even a month ago but this is a good film to follow his loss with. He makes many of the laughs with his pathetic yet endearing old man. In some scenes he makes laughs out of nothing and his performance is pitch perfect.On the whole I was tickled by this film and that was enough for me. Many will be let down as they have been told it is a laugh riot. If you go in just expecting a bit of fun with good actors then that is what you'll get. It's very slight but it is amusing enough to justify watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Safe crackers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Welcome to Collingwood" offers some of the most hilarious dialog in recent memory. Watching this comedy directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us of maybe another film we had seen in the past, but since we missed the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to discover that what we were reminded of, was the 1958 Italian film "Big Deal on Madonna Street", directed by Mario Monicelli.The Russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film. Anything with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, in it, can't be bad. Since this is an ensemble piece all characters get an opportunity in which to shine.The film presents us a group of inane would-be safe crackers from hell. No one could think these men could carry on a job like the one they undertake. Whatever could go wrong, and more, is what they succeed in doing. George Clooney makes a small appearance as the master safe cracker who is also seen impersonating a rabbi, only to be confused with a priest by the gang members coming out of Cossimo's funeral.The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax, and let all these small time crooks do their thing. Let their funny lines make you laugh, as anyone can see this gang is doomed from beginning to end!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes my breath away to see some of the uptight and/or pretentious "reviews" of this very funny film that are on this site. "No character depth"? "Weak plot"? Is there a class these people take, called "THE POINT, AND HOW TO MISS IT"??? It's just a well-shot, well-written, well-acted slapstick heist film, for goodness sake - and the characters are SUPPOSED to be shallow idiots! It tells you that on the video cover! Were the characters in "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" deeply developed? And was that not a GREAT film, or did I miss something? I strongly suggest that anyone who is simply after a good laugh should watch this film, and that those who seek high art in everything they see should either learn to relax a bit, or spare the rest of us their tedious opinions! Sheesh...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was recommended to me by a friend. I never saw an ad or a trailer, so I didn't know Clooney was in it and was not bothered by the fact that his role was so small. I thought the whole cast was suitable, and found the film pretty enjoyable, all in all. The opening scene, with the small crew of bandits standing at the side of the road, looking whipped and haggard, caught my attention immediately. It had a way of telling you, "don't go away; this won't be boring", and it really wasn't. It turned out to be an interesting, light-hearted comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in your seat to the very end, but when the ending did arrive, I felt a little bit cheated....just a little bit. The events kept building up so that you expect them to continue building, but at a point that I can't define, it sort of levels out, making the ending a slight disappointment. I reckon I expected a bigger bang of a climax, but it turned out sort of low-key. If you watch the movie with that in mind and you can live without high dosages of George Clooney, you should find this flick very entertaining and well worth watching. Now I'd like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it's probably a rare find in the United States.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's shameful that egotistic, pretentious film geeks need to rip apart remakes claiming that they can't possibly live up to the foreign originals upon which they are based. Foreign movies never translate and those that believe they are fantastic are likely only convincing themselves that is true. That said, I had no idea "Collinwood" was a remake and, regardless, thought it was surprisingly funny, well acted (the cast was phenomenal led by Sam Rockwell's perfectly funny lead) and just a good watch. Was is high handed film noir? No. Should it have won an award? No. Was is an enjoyable hour and change. Absolutely. Clooney, as always, was great in a limited, albeit offbeat role. Macy was fantastic. Michael Jeter was a tour de force as the old dude with the dirty shorts. And Luis Guzman was absolutely hysterical. It's a good watch regardless of what the pompous elite film police think. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny, well made remake of the 50s Italian film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those few great films that comes out these days. I work at a movie theater, and every week I see countless pieces of crap, and so it's great to see a good one come along every once in a while. The film is about a bunch of broke small-time criminals who hear of a job that could make them rich beyond their dreams. The film follows the obstacles they have to overcome, such as how to get in, crack the safe, etc. George Clooney plays a very funny small part as a handicapped ex-criminal, who tries to show the guys the ropes. Other good actors are Sam Rockwell, William H. Macy and Luis Guzman. (Luis Guzman must have a fantastic agent, he's always in these great movies.) I've never heard of these Russo guys before this movie, but I look forward to their future projects!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cosimo (Luis Guzman) ends up in prison for car burglary and there he's given the plan for the perfect heist from a lifer in prison; so he has to get out of jail, fast. He tells his girlfriend Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson) to find a man who will do his time in prison for some money. But no one wants to do the time for Cosimo's crime and yet everybody seems to know a guy who will do that. Soon bad boxer Pero Mahalovic (Sam Rockwell) founds out the details of this so called "perfect job".First of all, I think this movie was very funny and from my point of view I would recommend it to everyone. This movie is remake of Italian comedy "I Soliti Ignoti". I didn't watch the Italian original so I cannot judge or compare those two movies. But "Welcome to Collinwood" is great comedy for itself, about four people trying to rob the money from the vault in one house. Everyone gave their part of brilliance from this movie cast. Really excellent movie for these actors: Sam Rockwell, William H. Macy (great), Isaiah Washington, Michael Jeter (great), Luis Guzmán, Patricia Clarkson, Jennifer Esposito and finally George Clooney gave their share in this project. Maybe to say that this movie is only comedy, isn't fair. This is more then that. Because of one difference. All of thieves in this movie have very small wishes when they are asked: what will they do with their money? It is mostly securing their future in very humble way. This fact goes beyond comedy into the soul of that criminals. And not only them but also cop Babitch, who is presented like corrupted one; so here directors Russo presents us fact that criminals and cop are the same. Actually all in Collinwood are; and not only in Collinwood, cause all people chase money, on legal or illegal way. I don't like all movies were audience eventually likes and cheers for thieves. But, this one is exception. You have to love them all. Riley with his little baby and wife in jail. Toto with his pants. Cosimo with his line: "Your mother's a whore!" and all others. They are just like characters in my favorite comic, Alan Ford. They all trying to make some money, but simply they are out of luck. But they all did one good deed: they gave money to Riley, so he can get his wife out of prison. They are all heroes in my eyes, cause lots of "honest" people wouldn't do that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast. A ton of my favorite actors in one movie equals amazing with out actually seeing it. But this movie caught me off guard. It wasn't what I was expecting at all. It's been a while since I've seen it but I do remember I could not stop laughing!!! And it wasn't just the cast that did it for me. The script was amazingly written. Every time you were expecting something to happen it didn't happen. There were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious. The cinematography, along with the set, was absolutely beautiful as well. I really can't say anything bad about this movie! Expcept, I would have Andrew Davoli a little more screen time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ive just watched this film for the first time and am amazed by all the bad reviews. I thought it was class! Ok so its no Oceans Eleven, but the actors are fantastic and what could be better then watching amateur con-men get it completely wrong! Michael Jeter in particular, is a breath of fresh air, and shows just how much he's going to be missed in Hollywood!!! Sam Rockwell provides the eye-candy but also shows his versatility as an actor producing some of the high and low moments perfectly! George Clooney is fab as the safe hacker, although i'd love to have seen more of him (Im sure most would agree), and the rest of the ensemble are perfect in there own little ways! Id recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed Matchstick Men! Loved it!</fullReview>

Macy; that's about the long and the short of it really ? nothing special but definitely not a waste of 90 minutes of your day either.The boys try to rob a safe because they're all skint. Sam Rockwell has to seduce the girl next door to get into the apartment etc ? the film quickly tumbles into farce ? it all goes horribly wrong ? the various characters crack under pressure at different stages and the gang disintegrates then reassembles with humorous consequences blah blah blah ? one for a quiet afternoon or early evening ? bit of a bloke flick I suppose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment "Uhm... looks good, but i'm not in the mood for that movie." Thus entereth the "Almighty Solo Movie Night"!Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood a rather enjoyable movie. While ultimately fairly forgettable, it does have moments of fun and a few laugh out loud moments. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. George Clooney puts in a humorous and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that, for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every comedy be better if Mr. Clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash off? The cast, all fine actors in their own right, put in a great job, and you get the impression that they had a good time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. Needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original, so I consider it a success! Rent this one for a good time, maybe grab a few friends and a pizza. you'll have a good time.***7/10***On a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear the far under appreciated Paolo Conte used, and it left me humming snippets of the score long after the credits rolled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good remake of a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a "loose", but a precise, faithful remake of 1958 Monicelli's classic "I Soliti Ignoti" with Toto', Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinale etc. And that's the reason is good, it copies all the funny characters and the plot, even in details (like the scene where the photographer steals the camera from the local market).I have watched the superb old version many times and I knew by heart all the gangs and the ending but I still enjoyed "Welcome to Collinwood", which has its own freshness and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how the life and ways of the little thieves in 1950's Italy are adapted to 2002's USA. Things haven't changed much. 8/10.</fullReview>

Worse - they're completely out of their depths as 'film critics'. Bunch of lemmings crying out for attention.This is a hilarious off-beat film with a surprising link to an actual US community. (see the DVD Extras) And kudos to the reviewer who noted the passing of Michael Jeter - he really will be missed. I was so gratified to see him on the big screen again. It was a genuine surprise since I found out about his death only after watching this funny film.Like quirky heist comedies? Don't miss this one. ;-)(edited April 2006) Note: The comments I left are still valid but the placement in the queue makes it seem to contradict the many favorable opinions left after my original posting. My comment is directed to those reviews now found at the very end of the listings - the first comments left soon after the film's release by pretentious idiots passing themselves off as critics .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated comedy heist film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those "little great movies" made almost by low key approach and as art film. It tells the story of few guys planning to rob the safe in jewelry store. Each one of them has the same reason for it. Money. One character, Toto, leaves poorly in abandoned hangar, other guy, black man Leon, has a sister who is soon to be married and he needs dough for the wedding. Riley is also very poor, his wife is imprisoned and he leaves alone with his baby and so on... However, whole point of the movie is that robbery they looking to execute is doomed since the beginning. Only characters aren't aware of this issue. Movie reminds a bit of "Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" in terms of style and setting, but far less violent. Violence happens very rarely or almost never, and when it happens it's played for laughs and when you compare that with running time (86 minutes) you get very lightweight, very easy film. Those two things are only criticism I have. On brighter side, actors did their work tremendously and Sam Rockwell leads. I haven't watched many of his movies, but he is so damn good in this. Very good. Along with George Clooney, who appears in episodic role (3-4 minutes) as safe cracker veteran who teaches our guys how to crack the safe. Of course, it would be unfair if I don't mention late Michael Jetter and Luis Guzman, Patricia Clarkson and Isaiah Washington. Dialogue is well written and locations are realistic. Overall, movie is very enjoyable for anyone who loves crime/black comedy features, except when it ends, it'll leave you wondering why hadn't lasted a bit more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idiots DO make Lousy criminals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Russo brothers first full-length feature film 'Welcome to Collinwood' is a funny slapstick heist flick. The tagline, 'idiots make lousy criminals' sums it up quite well. The story has a European feel to it which shouldn't be a surprise since it's a remake of 'I Soliti Ignoti' but the Americanization is quite well done because it looks American and the jokes work very well. While there is a moderate dose of slapstick, the dialogues are quite cleverly written.The slightly washed out colours and less glamorous contributes to the atmosphere and gives it an old school. The sets look like those of old Western flicks except that the cowboys are long gone. It's apparent that the story doesn't take place in modern time and I'm glad that the writers chose not to modernize it too much. The tension is maintained very well as the idiots go about attempting to carry out their plan.However, the ending slightly disappoints. Given the way the story was building up, I expected to end with a bang. The actual ending is quite lowkey but not a bad one.All the actors do a wonderful job. Sam Rockwell, William H. Macy, the late Michael Jeter and Patricia Clarkson are outstanding. They are brilliantly supported by Luis Guzman, Andy Davoli, Jennifer Esposito and Gabrielle Union.Overall, 'Welcome to Collinwood' is hilarious and I wouldn't mind revisiting sometime in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five guys find out from a locked up inmate that there is money to be made from a robbery at an old building....But, things go hilariously wrong for the gang of misfits.The film does take a little while to build up and when it does pick up momentum it never ceases to stop with great comedic timing.The characters are all lovable in their own way, but when combined they create brilliant scenes, were you will be left breathless...The actual robbery itself is just hilarious, as the gang descend on the building, landing in a pool, trying to climb a ladder and losing Toto's pants!Sam Rockwell, however in my opinion; does a fantastic job portraying the individual who really wants the money as he schemes day and night on how to get the job done. The pairing between him and Jennifer Esposito, was just sweet....One comedy crime caper that should not be missed.</fullReview>

With "Safe Men", "Jerry and Tom", "The Heist" and later "Matchstick Men" this is becoming something of an expertise. To his credit, each time it's a winning act. Let's just hope he's not typecasting himself since Rockwell is clearly capable of a lot more.With him are a band of equally oddball would be criminals, played terrifically by all with William H.

Then there's also George Clooney in a very funny cameo.As with most caper movies, one does not ask for more than to be well entertained and this "Welcome to Collinwood" certainly succeeds in doing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Laugh out loud comic farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this gem of a film at Cannes where it was part of the directors fortnight.Welcome to Collinwood is nothing short of superb. Great fun throughout, with all members of a strong cast acting their socks off. It's a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman) who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison. While in prison he meets a `lifer' who tells him of `the ultimate bellini' ? which to you and me ? is a sure-fire get rich quick scheme. It turns out that there is a way through from a deserted building into the towns jewellers shop ? which could net millions. Sounds simple? ? well throw in all kinds of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have got the ingredients for a one wild ride!! ? word passes from one low life loser to the next and soon a team of them are assembled to try and cash in on Cosimos `bellini' lead by failed boxer Pero (Superbly played by Sam Rockwell ? surely a star in the making) and reluctant crook Riley (William H. Macy) who is forced to bring his baby along with him as his wife was locked up for fraud!!.Based on the Italian film I Soliti ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna street) which also inspired a similar film to `Collinwood' ? `Palookaville'. This knocks spots of the latter effort and although its written and directed by the Russo brothers it definitely has shades of the Coen Brothers about it. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welcome to Collinwood is a lot of things, but it is none of the following:A George Clooney star vehicle Unfunny Un-OriginalAnd yes i know, the basis for the movie is another movie. But as far as Hollywood goes, this may rank with their most authentic outputs this decade - and for me, it does.The movie is from start to finish, an absolute gas. Here's why.There isn't a bad performance in the film. The funny parts are funny. The edgy parts are edgy. The script contains, not a dull moment of dialogue The cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful. And it doesn't conform to the Hollywood norm (you'll see what i mean, when you see the film)When i was a kid, i remember seeing advertisements for the film. This film went under the radar after not grossing much at the box office, and isn't even a cult classic. The reason why Transformers 2, is seen as acceptable by average movie goers, is because they are used to seeing Transformers 2. If film's as original and funny as this were pumped out as often as multi-million pieces of s**t, the cinematic experience would be a much fresher place - When 'they' say they don't make em like they used to, 'they' didn't see Welcome to Collinwood.A fun, mini-masterpiece of caper comedy, that refuses to compromise. One of my favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silly, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable.A group of down-and-outs team up with a "seasoned" crook to elevate themselves out of their poverty. Great idea...if you ignore the screwup factor.Nice to see George Clooney doing something genuinely funny for a change. The casting is perfect and the acting standards very high. Although it could be said that the motley crew subject isn't new, I think this movie handles it in an interesting and unique way. Sufficiently so that it stands out from what has gone before.Very well done guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oddball heist film with quirky characters and big laughs at the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard of this flick despite the connection to George Clooney (whose company produced and he appears in a very funny supporting bit) and his Ocean's 11 director Steven Soderbergh. Worse, we picked this up in a discount bin for $4.99 (Canadian dollars at that!) What a grand and pleasant surprise. But then I'm of the opinion that if William H. Macy is in it you can't be disappointed. This was very reminiscent of those Ealing comedies from England in the 1950s. OK, with more profanity. This is an oddball and at times gut-splittingly funny film. The actual heist made me laugh so hard I was crying. Perhaps the funniest use of underpants in movie history. Maybe it was the low expectations I had going in but I watched with a group of people and we had a blast. Best $5 I've spent in ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Idiotic hack crooks, a babe, a safe, a plan and a baby. Add them all up and you get the best comedy you've never heard of. Even with some a-list star power (at least a-minus...okay, b-plus?) this movie got very little publicity.But that does not diminish its genius.Terrific writing, solid delivery and a believable group of characters. Some truly classic lines, and a fun twist at the end.This is not some watered-down "Nutty Professor" comedy. These are low-life bad guys. They speak low-life bad guy language and they do low-life bad guy things. But they do it for your amusement and entertainment, and they do that well.One of the best comedies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly but fun heist film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of a 1958 film called "Big Deal on Madonna Street" and if you have seen that one than you can predict most of what will happen in this version. If you haven't than you might see this as a pretty funny film loaded with unique characters. Story takes place in a Cleveland suburb called Collinwood that is mainly a poor neighborhood with old buildings. A car thief named Cosimo (Luis Guzman) while in the joint hears from an old inmate about a safe in a pawnshop that holds somewhere around 300,000 dollars. Cosimo needs a "Malinski" which means he needs someone to step forward and confess to his crime so that he can get out and try to break into the safe. He tells his girlfriend Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson) who tells Toto (Michael Jeter) and he tells...well, soon many people are involved like Pero (Sam Rockwell), Leon (Isaiah Washington), Riley (William H. Macy) and Basil (Andrew Davoli). Together they want to do the "Bellini" which means a lucrative job and they hire Jerzy (George Clooney) who is an ex-thief and in a wheelchair for 500 dollars and he teaches them how to saw through the safe. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Pero has to romance Carmela (Jennifer Esposito) who lives next to the pawnshop and is holding the keys while the owners are out of town so he uses her to find out when the shop will be empty. Once the actual heist is to begin everything that could go wrong, goes wrong! This film was directed by the Russo brothers Anthony and Joe and they do a good job of showing how run down the area of Collinwood is and the desperation of these assorted characters. Rockwell steals the show as the boxer Pero but not far behind him is Jeter as Toto. The characters in this film are all well drawn and its the characterizations that (For me) are the best thing about this effort. While this doesn't have quite the level of energy that "Ocean's 11" (Also produced by Steven Soderbergh) generates it's still a funny film loaded with rich and colorful characters. Worth a look.</fullReview>

And it delivered. Overall, the movie is not crack-you-up funny, but there is one scene that really stands out and is, in a my eyes, a classic. SPOILER At the end, where they break through the wall to get to the safe and we see Rockwell and Washington stare at Jeter is just fantastic. This is just as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski where The Dude is using a chair to barricade his door, but forgets the door turns outward!

		<shortDescription>Silent movie with talking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more I watch 'WTC' the more I am reminded of the golden silents, and there are enough similar scenes from movies of yesteryear to warrant this comparison. The only difference is that it's not in black and white, and the characters talk! Have I gone mad - again? I don't think so. Perhaps it's because of the sight of 'Toto'- afraid of heights -being carried along a highrise pipe, and losing his pants (English version) that does it. Maybe it's the lingo which I can imagine being shown in old silent 'speech boxes'. Maybe it's the dusty colour imagery. Maybe it's because 'Toto' (Michael Jeter) reminds me of James Finlayson or Ben Turpin. This is really a Laurel and Hardy movie in disguise. Those debatable points aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this. I accept it's not perfect, but if it catches you in the right mood, and it didn't on first showing, you get sucked in, and it can be really funny. There are many 'catchphrases' and yet I sadly note there is nothing listed in memorable quotes. If I knew how to add one I would...'Your Mother's A Whore' and 'He says it's his Bellini' come to mind. I agree that George Clooney should not appear centr-stage on the poster. This is purely to sell the film. His appearances are brief, but fit in with the storyline. Other than that, the whole cast is good, especially Sam Rockwell. Annoyingly I missed 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', in spite of the fact that it contained Drew Barrymore, so it was my first experience of him. He is definitely a real player with immense screen presence. Somehow, he reminds me of Humphrey Bogart in his delivery. And that can't be a bad thing, in the days of pseudo megastars. Go see 'WTC' and forget all those negative reviews. If this doesn't make you laugh, you might as well rent a blank screen to watch. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>***1/2 out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of film that holds no middle grounds for discomfort. You can love it or you can hate it but there is no middle ground to stand inside and doodle around with confusion over. If you hate it you are going to know why you hate it and if you love it you are going to know why you will love it. This is a hilarious satire of old fashion heist pictures derivative of Oceans Eleven. The film opens with a car jacking gone horribly wrong and Cosimo, the `biggest a--hole in Collinwood' being sent to jail. While incarcerated Cosimo tells his girlfriend of a bellini that will award the two with a grand fortune (bellini means a job with a big payoff in Collinwood terms). The only problem is Cosimo needs a malinski to bail him out of jail (a term that dates back to the post Al Capone days of Elliot Ness that means someone who will take the blame for another crime). Soon word spreads through the underbelly of town and everyone wants a cut of the cash for himself. So leaving Cosimo to rot in jail, a group of five petty criminals attempt to make what could be the biggest heist of their career. Most of the hilarity comes from the setting itself. It is a small town that one would never suspect a huge heist to go down. In numerous pictures of this nature we see highly trained men with little time on their hands, devising a plot to break into a high security institution that seems mortally impossible to breach. What makes this film so funny is that Collinwood is a dump. Calling this place a slum would be doing it a favour, and these five men are a group of the most inept people to ever grace the plains of a heist flick. We don't care one bit about any of these people; they are cruel and heartless. They have too much time on their hands, little skill to their credit and even less coin in their pocket. Because these men are so despicable we have no problem in seeing them fail in their attempts time and time again. In fact we sit and anticipate it. These are people who have become so absorbed in themselves that they find themselves lost in a lost cause. They are a contradiction to each other and function so roughly as a unit that they only people in this world for them is themselves. That is not to say we feel nothing for these characters. This is a film of little emotional bondage, all romance to be seen is played for laughs through satire (the guy finally gets the girl but all she does is assert herself right in the way). The greatest thing about these guys is that they don't humour us. They humour themselves with provides us with the substantial ability of laughter. But it is not their misfortune that is the hot bed of giggles a smirks, it is their situation. The irony that a bunch of low-lives get what could be one of the easiest jobs to pull off and everything that they manage to do goes horribly wrong. But wrong seems to not be an outcome because these men are stupid. Even though intelligence is a scarce offering in this tribe, it is the fact that they are so caught up in how great their lives will be after all ends well that they never take the time to survey their approach and hone the craft to a satisfactory state of well being. Because of this failure is never far from grasp. Hit director Steven Soderbergh who is known for his direction on Ocean's Eleven and Traffic produced this film. It is Soderbergh's big name that got this film the recognition and praise it deserved upon release time but this film owes little to the star and knows it from the get go. Although strutting fabulous performances from the likes of William H. Macy and Michael Jetter the greatest performance comes from other produce George Clooney as a wheelchair bound heist pro, who for five hundred dollars will teach these boys a thing or two about breaking into a safe. Clooney is loud, rude, profane and obnoxious, and ever bit a guilty pleasure to laugh at as anything you've seen in Scary Movie films. I didn't know whether I should split my guts laughing at him or spit at him. Clooney has one of the most offensive scenes I have seen since A Fish Called Wanda in which he dresses up as a Rabbi to spy on an undisclosed characters funeral, funny stuff. The thing about this film that will turn some of the more seasoned film buffs off is exactly this. Back in the 50's there came a movie that has been hailed by some as the greatest heist comedy of them all. That film was A Big Deal on Madonna Street. This film is a `kind-of` remake. The problem is that anyone who has seen Big Deal will have already seen most of the funniest jokes and will simply be waiting for rehashed material. Many of the big jokes, most notably the climatic one, are taken right from Big Deal. If you have not seen Big Deal (I include myself into this category) on the other hand, you will probably be swimming in your own glee as these misfits bumble through misfire after misfire in what could be the best comedy I have seen since Death to Smoochy last year. Directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo this is a film that knows how to use dialogue to its advantage. Although packed with loads physical comedy gags this films shines at its brightest during the exchange of gabs within the group. The Russo's must have been well informed of this because they pack ever line with comedic punch that strikes not to far from reality. Although this is dark and often offensive material it never strikes to far from home because everyone who has ever had big ideas but tries to execute them with little skill or knowledge will be able to relate to these men. Homer Simpson happens to be one of America's favourite blundering idiots, but we don't find him funny because he is dumb we find him funny because we all know we could see our self in him at one point or another. It is that very same logical pattern that makes Welcome to Collinwood the darkly amusing yet wittingly smart piece of satire that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a pale, pale imitation of a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a pretty good cast, but the film has nowhere near the grace of the original Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street" Anyone looking for an entertaining caper film should visit the original. William Macy may be one of our greatest living actors, but here he's put to little use. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I sort of feel sorry for him trying to fill those shoes. Might as well try to imitate Bogart or a young De Niro. The art direction is rich and textured but brings nothing to the story, the extra bits they add to the story feel completely unnecessary and the things they take away are missed. Even starting the way they do seems bizarrely gratuitous and takes away from the surprise of the original. Sam Rockwell has his odd and genial charm and Luis Guzman has that odd charisma, but the love story part of the movie just seems clunky and flat. It's too bad nobody has figured out how to make this movie as well as it was first made, but then again it's too bad we live in a culture where we feel like we need to remake amazing things instead of simply learning to savor the originals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Sam Rockwell since Galaxy Quest, and he didn't disappoint here - and neither did anyone else. The bumbling crooks take on a big heist has been rather played out in the past few years, and this followed mostly the same formula. However, the excellent character actors elevate this above said formula and make it entertaining. The best scene, in my opinion, is near the end, as the characters discuss what they will do with their take of the heist. It was sweet, and the acting was top-notch. Clooney's cameo was amusing, and showed once again that he is an actor as well as a movie star. I'd recommend catching it on cable, but the entertaining-ness isn't really worth a rental.</fullReview>

The group tracks down Pero and does the job together. They recruit wheelchair bound safe cracker Jerzy (George Clooney) but he can only teach them. Pero has to con Carmela (Jennifer Esposito) out of her keys.This is a screwball heist movie. The Russo brothers have filled this with wacky characters but the movie has limited laughs. This is often compared to Ocean's Eleven especially with Clooney. Of course, it's not the same thing. This is the incompetent F-team but there're not so incompetent to be hilarious.

		<fullReview>This film is an enjoyable romp from start to finish, funny, witty and pleasingly entertaining all the way through. All the characters are quirky and caricaturish and genuinely amusing. Whilst it's not typically laugh out loud funny it is definitely chuckle to yourself and giggle out loud.A stellar ensemble cast including George Clooney, William H Macy, Isiaih Washington, Michael Jeter, Luis Guzman, Patricia Clarkson and headed up - to my mind - by the superb Sam Rockwell do the brilliant script justice and the Direction and overall production of the film I don't think can be faulted although it comes across as fairly low budget.In a similar vein to O Brother Where Art Thou? (also Clooney) in terms of humour and oftentimes silliness but also with a point, and an unpredictable and surprising turn of events, this story weaves a full circle from opening scene and flash back to how they got there. Not at all Hollywood, just original and wacky really giving the actors room to develop individual characters. Basically a heist film, some small time crooks hear about a "bellini" (not the champagne cocktail) - the big score that will see them right - and it's about how these misfits get it entirely wrong and into more trouble than the score is worth, no doubt. Some incredibly edge of seat crazy scenes, suspenseful and daft, Rockwell really steals the show as Cassanova, criminal mastermind, fixer and - scarily - the brains of the outfit. This film is what cinema is about, reminiscent of older films that were pure entertainment. Some bad language but it isn't gratuitous or out of keeping. Thoroughly enjoyable.</fullReview>

Of the other players, George Clooney (as Jerzy) stands out - or, would that be sits out? - as an expert the gang of five hires, for $500, to learn safe-cracking. It's quite nice that Mr. Jeter's performance is a highlight, since this is one of his last.

		<shortDescription>So this is how Sam Rockwell and George Clooney met.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell in his directorial debut "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind", they starred together in this movie. George Clooney also was involved with this movie as a producer, along with Steven Soderbergh, which shows that they really believed in this project. In potential this also seems like a fine and entertaining project, that is in the same line with movie-remakes such as "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job" but somehow this movie is only halve successful, or at least it isn't as good as it could had been.The movie its characters are all being played by some fine well known actors but a shame is that the characters are not really given enough room to develop. Even though in their potential they could had turned into fun and enjoyable characters, they are now only characters that mildly entertain because mostly of some of the more quirky sequences that are in the movie. The fact that they are being played doesn't change much to this, even though they prevent their characters from ever becoming a total bore or perhaps even annoying, or anything like that at all.It's of course due to the writing that the characters aren't used to their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian movie "I Soliti ignoti" works out much better than this movie does. The movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytelling.Nevertheless the movie is simply still a very fun one to watch maybe because of that very same simplicity. It's an harmless little caper movie, in which you simply shouldn't to worry much about the story. In that regard "Welcome to Collinwood" is still a movie that works out and simply serves its purpose well.It's a movie that you won't regret watching once you've finished it but it also is a movie you can really easily do without ever seeing.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

The movie that inspired it it's called "I soliti ignoti", it is a classic of Italian comedy, it was shot in 1958 by Mario Monicelli and it featured Vittorio Gassman, Renato Salvatori, Memmo Carotenuto (in the part here played by George Clooney), Carla Gravina, Marcello Mastroianni and the stunning Claudia Cardinale, who was 20 years old at the time... In 1959 Nanni Loy shot a sequel of this movie called "L'audace colpo dei soliti ignoti", same cast but Nino Manfredi is replacing Mastroianni.</fullReview>

The weakest is probably Sam Rockwell; he's the sort of pin-up lead but functions rather like Mark Wahlberg in this situation, in tending to be 2-dimensional.Set piece movies like this need to be tightly controlled. Sequences are too drawn out and the constant low-level soundtrack is no help. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but no Big Deal...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this remake and reading most of the user comments, I thought it peculiar that no one directly referenced the classic Italian comedy that inspired it. By 'inspired' I mean 'every single scene and character take from except all the funny bits'. The movie I'm talking about is not 'Crackers' the lame 80's remake starring Penn and Sutherland, I'm talking about 'Big Deal on Madonna Street' with Gassman, Mastroianni, Claudia Cardinale and Toto. It's Italian name is 'I Soliti Ignoti' which translates as 'The Usual Suspects', a more literal name which fits so well, I wondered why they never used it.The reason why I bring up the Italian original is just that it's so screamingly funny, even if you don't speak Italian. Welcome to Collingwood is mildly amusing, but 'Big Deal' is probably the funniest Italian movie ever made. Comparing the two is a bit like comparing A Night at the Opera to A Night at the Roxbury. The difference is evident in every scene, every line of dialogue, every performance. Toto is magnificent, his funniest movie, and he makes you wonder why they made poor Michael Jeter take his part and give him nothing to do in it.Then there is the last scene of the movie, or rather the last scene of the heist. It is the knee-slapper of all knee-slappers and when I first saw it, it yanked out of me the biggest single laugh of my laugh. A 'Something About Mary' hair gel kind of laugh. If you want to do a doctoral dissertation about the importance of comedic timing, all you have to do is view this scene in Crackers, Collingwood and Big Deal. The first is lame, the second is humorous, the third is gold.That's all I'll say. IMO, skip the leftovers, go straight to the original main course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing comedy but lacking purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's got a decent cast of known character actors but, bar Macy, no real stars feature here (I'll come to this). This is basically a robbery comedy. There's not really a great deal to tell you about, such is the simplicity of the story. One guy hears about a 'big job' word of mouth ensues and before you know we got a team of desperados to collect the loot. Or do we?Anyway, it's reasonably engaging if basically a bit pointless.One note as pointed out by others - in the UK the advertising banner of this movie features Clooney centre stage. Plus his name as one of the principle stars. This is blatant misadvertising. I went to see this because I think he's cool and all his movies are generally half decent - and he's been good in comedy. To find out he has so little screen time was pretty shoddy. The banner is made to sell the film, obviously, but to do it in such a misleading manner is pretty dire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to heist comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and this very much the former. This short caper exacts nothing more than what it gives to the audience. It presents a simple story, told very plainly with enough wisecracks to keep you going, then just gets better and better. Clooney's cameo is funny and very welcome but the leads including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman can easily make it on their own. Likeable and funny, hilariously so towards the end, Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WELCOME TO COLLINWOOD (2002) ** Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, William H. Macy, Jennifer Esposito, Isaiah Washington, Patricia Clarkson, Luis Guzman, Andrew Davoli, Gabrielle Union, George Clooney. Loose(y goosey) remake of Big Deal on Madonna Street with a grotty motley crew of losers and miscreants who team up to score a heist on an antiques shop in the titular suburb of Cleveland in a rather timeless and scattershot comedy of errors. The convention of character actors that appears is a delight yet a disappointment in the sense that filmmaking siblings, The Brothers Russo (Anthony and Joe who co-wrote and co-directed) don't give much for them to do or expand upon its threadbare existence. Executive produced by Steven Soderbergh and Clooney (who has an amusing small role as a wheelchair bound safecracker who instructs the gang on how to break into the vault). </fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Welcome to Collinwood" is kind of a disaster. Considering the people involved, it should've been multiple times better.Watching it, if you're at least somewhat attached to the faith that it'll get better, will probably make you cry. It's one of those movies that had potential, but was robbed of this potential thanks to a terrible script and some bad acting, not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary George Clooney character and the guy who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss but about whom I care so little that I don't even want to know his name.The film's only saving grace is the weird con vocabulary it introduces. I found myself thinking of it time and time again as I watched more crime capers. This is the only reason I gave the film a 3. The plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, needlessly offensive, and highly unlikable. They are in a constant state of agonizing stress and they're all so irritating that I celebrated their obstacles. They yell at each other and swear crassly. The dialogue is insipid at best and insultingly stupid at its low points.I find that Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are to blame for this. They should be tried for war crimes, if anyone actually remembers this crap long enough to care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great fun. I went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film. We came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie. In the first part you just keep asking yourself about this 'malinski' and 'bellini' stuff (there are many more examples of this lingo) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they get funnier and funnier. In search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even wackier than the next. Until half of the film was over we didn't even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing, but we sure had a good time. The house was loaded (appr. 250 people) and I think about half of them didn't like it and the other half loved the film. If you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it. Apart from Clooney This movie deserves a lot better than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has at the time I write this, but when more ppl have seen it I am sure it will go up. 7.0 is reasonable I guess, I would give it an 8 out of 10.

		<shortDescription>Two directors. Two producers. One script. No hope.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of good jokes underpin Welcome to Collinwood. The lesser, why anyone ever thought it worth screening. The greater, why anyone should've paid to see it. Released in the UK on a DVD decorated with tabloid Press endorsements that equate to the yesteryear door-post daubings on the homes of Plague victims (so you enter within at your peril) the wrapper does at least give fair warning of what awaits:Five thieves. One safe. No brain (front cover)Eight guys. One safe. No brain (back over).As that's three characters gone AWOL in the publicity alone, never mind the running time, for what else, by its absence, is Collinwood notable?Well, er. . . Considering that it's almost a scene by scene remake of a celebrated 50s Italian crime caper, writer / directors the Russo brothers aren't exactly big on original thinking. Watch the DVD extras, and they don't seem that big on, um, thinking, per se: though both burble on about the amount of hard work they found it necessary to invest in creating Collinwood's characters (sic) and plotting Collinwood's narrative arcs (ditto) they neglect to mention what they did for the rest of that afternoon.Perhaps not surprisingly, it's that same spirit of omission that pervades the movie. Take one of the key scenes, for instance, where Macy's 'character', after having worn a phony plaster caste on an uninjured arm, winds up wearing a real plaster caste on an injured arm, this the result of a revenge beating en route to the safe cracking at the heart of the film.Irony? Hey. It's a comedy. Laugh? Well maybe, but that's not easy because this scene never actually appears. Macy just, well, sort of, gets a broken arm.What about George Clooney then, co-producer and lead actor (according to the DVD cover?) No. Not much sign of him either, because self-perceived auteur status aside, Clooney evidently had more to do in life than appear in stuff like this.So to get around the problem of being a Big Star playing a safe cracker in a movie about safe cracking but who can't actually spend any time doing any of that, Clooney stays in a wheel chair throughout the eight or so minutes of his filming commitment, and is thus conveniently excused from participating in the climactic safe cracking scene. But then, that doesn't feature, either. So actually, Clooney needn't have been in the movie anyway.Still. It's not difficult to see why he was so anxious to appear. Asked why, in one scene, he is wearing a false beard and a funny hat, Clooney doesn't actually fess up and say 'Because I don't want anyone to know I have any connection with this' but the much wittier: 'You're an idiot'.Wilde, eat your heart out. Ripostes get no better than that. Well, not in Collinwood anyway, -- 'funniest movie of the year' (Sunday Mirror, UK); 'hilarious' (The Sun, UK), 'top notch performances' (Daily Mirror). So. Eight guys and a safe and a brain becomes five guys and a safe and a brain. OK. Clooney's out, so that's seven. Who else? Well, the guy who sets it up: run over by a bus, this being in every sense a transport of delight as it prevents him from saying 'your mutha is a f--- whore' for the hundred and seventh time.Right. Six left, and now it's the turn of the character largely responsible for bringing all the thieves together: he decides the movie's not worth risking his career on ? sorry, the safe's not worth it, either ? so exits to start a new life as an exotic dancer in Rio de Janeiro.All right, all right. He doesn't. He goes off to work in a factory. As a joke, that's much funnier than going off to Rio de Janeiro, unless, of course, you've ever worked in a factory. As far as screen writing goes though, that's like having Michael Caine leaving the original Italian Job to go open a grocer's shop in Oldham.Characters and scenes are not the only elements to vanish from, rather than being welcomed to, Collinwood. Entire sections of script vaporise, too, most memorably in the case of Isaiah Washington's character, who though introduced by someone else as being 'seriously weird' is from then on the most consistently normal person in the entire proceedings.Explanation must be that all the weirdness supporting material ? scenes, dialog, action ? got left on the bus that ran over the chap who could only say your mutha is a f--- whore 107 times, or alternatively it was all pocketed by the character who ran off to Rio. Correction: to work in a factory.So. . . Welcome to Collinwood. Two directors. Two producers. One screenplay. No hope.Rating: 1 out of 10 (the point goes to the late Michael Jeter for at least trying to transcend the material). Plus: 10/10 for the DVD extras: so narcissistic, so infantile, that for a blissful moment you wonder if Chris Guest has arrived. Then realise: nope. These people ? Clooney, Soderbegh, the Russos, the cast ? they really do. . . Believe.</fullReview>

You might get a laugh here or there, but it's like watching an old 3 Stooges comedy, that will also make you laugh at the same stunt that you've seen a thousand times before.

		<fullReview>This is one of the movies I tend to like: no major/minor characters, but a real team work; all parts played by memorable distinguishable actors; no really good or really bad characters, no "black-and-white" approaches. At first, the plot was not moving fast, but this was compensated by the really funny burglary procedure when I found myself openly laughing. Unlike most of similar movies, the outcome for the thieves is different. All actors are at least good, if not more, and even George Clooney's looks was ugly. William H. Macy has always been one of my favorites. Recommended to everyone fond of sophisticated crime comedies. But it could have lasted longer than 1'20".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Welcome to Collinwood" is about a thief getting the plan for the perfect heist. The trouble is, the thief is in jail, and the crime cannot be carried out until they find a jail replacement. No-one wants to do time for the crime, but everyone seems to know a guy who will - but for a price. A group of 6 friends are soon looking to get their filthy hands on a piece of the action!The directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo create this film in a great way, making you laugh the whole way through. It is a spin on "Ocean's Eleven" (2001), but with double the laughs! The film is made up of Top- Notch performances, making it the funniest comedy of the year!The film features George Clooney as Danny Ocean, a retired US Army soldier, who is an expert at cracking safes. He doesn't feature in the film much, but is performances are amazing as always. Even though his appearances aren't huge, he still plays an important part in the film.The film successfully puts crime and comedy together to create the perfect film. It clearly demonstrates how 2 completely different genres can be added together, and work well. It takes us about half of the film before we fully understand the story and catch on to the humour, but when the film ends you will be laughing hard, and wishing that the humour could have gone on for longer.Overall I would recommend the film to anyone who is into comedies. It is energetically written, and the effort has clearly paid off. It is truly a masterpiece of humour.8/10</fullReview>

For once criminals are shown as real people that can be human as they make mistakes but also very compassionate. They aren't perfect as depicted in most heist movies.It was so refreshing to see likable characters. Wait a minute,is this a heist movie.Yes,it is. But don't expect anything spectacular apart from the acting. It is the acting that gives "Welcome to Collinwood" it's edge. Had there been lesser actors this movie simply would not have worked.When this movie starts it doesn't have the appearance of a fully fledged comedy.

		<fullReview>This to me must be one of the most underrated films ever made. I fantastic cast, colourful characters, a great script and wonderful soundtrack. It has a Cohen Bothers beat and feels like it could be at home on stage. The film follows unsuccessful lowlife criminal, Cosimo (Luis Guzmán), who lands up in jail and learns of a "bellini", a once in a lifetime job, from his lifer cellmate. He wants to pay a 'mullinski", someone to take the fall for him, so he can get out of jail to pull the job. His girlfriend begins to enquire around and in doing so ends up letting more people know about the bellini forcing the team to grow. Eventually Pero (Sam Rockwell), a second rate boxer, attempts to take the fall but things don't go according to plan and Pero finds out the details of the job and leaves Cosimo in jail. Pero is forced to let the others in and the fun and games starts as the motley crew attempt to plan and execute the caper.It is a wonderful, well thought out script. The style of the story and directing have a Cohen Brothers feel and that is not a bad thing. It is light and humorous and has plenty of laughs. It is silly, but not far from stupid.The casting and acting was superb and everyone puts on good performances, but Michael Jeter as old man Toto was the star of the show and it is one of the most memorable performances I have seen. George Clooney seems totally at home in this style of movie and was excellent too.If my film collection was burned and stolen, Welcome to Collinwood would be in my top 20 and always delivers a warm smile.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Produced by George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh, this little crime caper with some good people in it sounded like an average film, and I had nothing else to do. Basically Cosimo (Luis Guzmán) is arrested for attempted theft of a car, and while in the clink an old guy tells him a perfect heist, the kind of job you only dream of, so he wants to get out of prison quick. He tells his girl Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson), and she spills the beans to a small gang of crooks who will relish the job. These crooks: Pero (Sam Rockwell), Riley (William H. Macy), Toto (Michael Jeter) and Leon (Ghost Ship's Isaiah Washington) plan their raid on the jewellery store and its safe, but of course not everything can go smoothly, so expect plenty of mistakes and near catches during the job. Also starring Andrew 'Andy' Davoli as Basil, Gabrielle Union as Michelle, Jennifer Esposito as Carmela and George Clooney in a little cameo as Jerzy. It is a little boring with loads of chat and made up words, e.g. "Bellini", and it has to be said that the funny moments are really when they actually try to do the job, and fail miserably, but I guess it's okay to see once. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a huge disappointment. It was set in Cleveland, and attempted to capture the grittiness and earthiness of this city. However, the movie was far inferior to Buffalo '66 (a successful attempt to capture the gloom of Buffalo, NY). None of the characters were very likable or interesting. They all seemed to be in and out of prison. Even William H. Macy's character was rather dull and one-dimensional. The lack of charisma to the characters completely destroyed an ability to develop any depth to them, in order to send out a societal message. Instead, we just have a bunch of laughable, pathetic characters who aren't very bright. One has no empathy for them or understanding of their failures in life. The characters are so pathetic that they can't even successfully rob a house without destroying it. Basically, one is left with the indelible impression that there is no real point to the movie. One has to guess that the point of the film was that these characters tried so hard to get out of their plights, but in the end failed. But without an in-depth understanding of what made these characters tick, this message was severally compromised. In the end, I felt that it was a movie that one could laugh a little at, but not really feel that it was memorable in any way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flat remake of a brilliant original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh once said that if you are going to remake a film you should always choose a not very good one, because a remake of a good one will never live up to the original, good as it may be. One wonders, therefore, why he should produce (under the banner of the Section Eight company he has with George Clooney) a remake of "Big Deal on Madonna Street", a film generally regarded as one of the great classic comedies, about how a crew of clumsy, incompetent losers take on the perfect heist. This is especially strange because brothers Anthony and Joe Russo 's take on the material is both reverently faithful to the original and also strikingly and surprisingly unfunny, which is a bit of a paradox since Mario Monicelli's 1958 classic was a riot. The actors - a motley cast of some of Hollywood's finest character and supporting players, with full marks for Sam Rockwell, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Isaiah Washington - are not at fault, since they're evidently having fun with the stylized neo-noir dialogue and relish the opportunity of playing a bunch of well-meaning but utterly dimwitted losers. It's the writer-directors that seem unable to give the film the lightness of touch and speedy rhythm their way of dialogue desperately needs. Even at a trim 90 minutes the movie seems longish and predictable, especially if you've seen the original; but if you haven't it's very likely "Welcome to Collinwood" won't pass muster anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully unfunny (to me at least)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the worst films I've ever seen that was made with legitimately talented people. I can't believe that there were actually people who liked it. But, as I've always insisted, our sense of humor is the most individualistic sense we've got. No matter how closely any two people might agree in taste, there will inevitably be something that one finds funny and the other doesn't. So just because I found it tasteless and heavy-handed, that doesn't mean that there won't be viewers who will find it hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What? This is a 'good' movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read about 10 comments of this movie and decided that it must be good, all gave it 4-5/5. For starters the reviews must have got their heist movies mixed up, the good one with George Clooney is called Oceans Eleven, got that? Eleven, and that is set in Vegas not some dull, rubbish, run down place in America that no one has heard of. The major problem is the words they use, what the hell is a Bellini or Kapihnick? did they just make up some random language that England has never heard of just to annoy us. It does nothing to the heist genre and to be perfectly honest, nothing to movies anywhere, besides showing people how not to make a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utter rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to rent this, the box was covered in four and five stars, hailing it as the film of the year etc.One hour and 18ish minutes later, I was sat dumbstruck. What a load of rubbish. Weak plot, no character depth, and a dire ending.Why do film companies pump millions into drivel like this? If this film brings you one ounce of pleasure you need to get out more. Avoid at all costs. Oh, and as for sticking a large picture of George Clooney on the cover (UK edition), don't be fooled into thinking he's in it - blink and you'll miss his very brief appearance (5 minutes or so). </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthless film about worthless people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it was done in Cleveland and that's hardly a hotbed of cinematic genius.This is an appallingly bad film about worthless people in a blighted neighbourhood. They and their movie lack morals, intelligence and character. Neither the characters nor the plot have a single redeeming feature. They are senselessly violent with each other, they smoke incessantly and whats more, they do all this with a small child present much of the time. A film should leave you questioning things. This one certainly does that. You question why anybody would produce such a horrendous piece of crap!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time i watched this film, it was a crowded room, and we all sat down to watch it, and ended up turning if off, and selling it, but after surfing ebay, i noticed this title again, looked at it, read about it, and looked again at the cast, and thought i have to give it another go, and I'm pleased to say i did! it's an amusing film, with some very funny parts! George Clooney might be on the front cover, but his part is not big at all, he appears 2 or 3 times, but with the excellent acting abilities, and great humour, esp from Luis Guzmán, and his cracking 1 liner! Your Momma's a whore, makes this film a highly enjoyable 86mins, that i can easily recommended to the right audience. Excellent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but no Big Deal...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this remake and reading most of the user comments, I thought it peculiar that no one directly referenced the classic Italian comedy that inspired it. By 'inspired' I mean 'every single scene and character take from except all the funny bits'. The movie I'm talking about is not 'Crackers' the lame 80's remake starring Penn and Sutherland, I'm talking about 'Big Deal on Madonna Street' with Gassman, Mastroianni, Claudia Cardinale and Toto. It's Italian name is 'I Soliti Ignoti' which translates as 'The Usual Suspects', a more literal name which fits so well, I wondered why they never used it.The reason why I bring up the Italian original is just that it's so screamingly funny, even if you don't speak Italian. Welcome to Collingwood is mildly amusing, but 'Big Deal' is probably the funniest Italian movie ever made. Comparing the two is a bit like comparing A Night at the Opera to A Night at the Roxbury. The difference is evident in every scene, every line of dialogue, every performance. Toto is magnificent, his funniest movie, and he makes you wonder why they made poor Michael Jeter take his part and give him nothing to do in it.Then there is the last scene of the movie, or rather the last scene of the heist. It is the knee-slapper of all knee-slappers and when I first saw it, it yanked out of me the biggest single laugh of my laugh. A 'Something About Mary' hair gel kind of laugh. If you want to do a doctoral dissertation about the importance of comedic timing, all you have to do is view this scene in Crackers, Collingwood and Big Deal. The first is lame, the second is humorous, the third is gold.That's all I'll say. IMO, skip the leftovers, go straight to the original main course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Expected Much More From Such a Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The car thief Cosimo (Luis Guzmán) is arrested while stealing a car. Once in prison, he shares the cell with a prisoner sentenced to life for killing his wife. The guy shares with him the location of a safe full of money 'prepared' to be easily robbed. Cosimo asks his mate Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson) to find a scapegoat to assume the blame for his crime for US$ 15,000.00 and he shares the secret with her, asking for total secrecy with the information. Rosalind shares the scheme with a bunch of losers and brainless small time crooks, trying to find a person to trade place in jail with Cosimo. The execution of the robbery does not happen as planned due to the lack of skills and intelligence of the group of morons. Yesterday I watched this flick with the expectation of being a great movie. The cast, with names such as William H. Macy, Luis Guzmán, George Clooney, Patricia Clarkson and Sam Rockwell among others, promised a good movie. However, the whole story is practically based on one joke only, being boring in some parts, and I was very disappointed with the performance of such a cast. In the end, 'Welcome to Collinwood' is nothing more than a watchable and forgettable low budget movie. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): 'Tudo Por um Segredo' (' Everything For a Secret')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>didn't like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film attempts to be a good character drama disguised as a quirky heist film and never reaches it's goal. It's a laboured exercise with limitted potential because it doesn't have enough wit or demension. The characters are never interesting to me and that hurt when I attempted to enjoy the film. There just isn't enough to build on and the characters seem so beleagured..as does the actors that play them. The only character with any depth is Patricia Clarkson's Rosalind. William H. Macy never seemed right in the role of Riley,an ex con with a kid. I just haven't warmed up to Sam Rockwell as a star. He is put out there to be the leader of the pack of misfits,but always seemed like more of a secondary member. Rockwell just doesn't have the spunk needed for his role. The most glaring thing that really hurts the film is the present illness of the late Michael Jeter as Toto. His sickness shows the whole way through and barely makes it through his lines. George Cloony has a small part but it seemed to me to be a role that says:LOOK AT ME..BIG TIME MOVIE STAR GOING INDIE. */*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought George Clooney could not make any movies that were worse than is attempt at playing Batman. I was wrong. I cant really provide a decent review since I walked out of the theater, 40 minutes into the *feature* What is so surprising is that William H.MAcy's participation. I know he has a fine, well earned reputation for his portrayel of quirky charactors but really. Even his skills were wasted in this film. George Clooney has producer credit for this film so I can understand why he might want to further tarnish his acting reputation with his appearence. HAving said that, the rest of the cast is made up of relative unknowns. After this bomb, it is possible that they might remain unknowns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't bother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has all it takes to be a great movie. But it isn't. Brothers Joe and Anthony Russo have proved that they couldn't write a nursery ryhme- the script deserves to be burnt. You would've thought with such a talented cast on board and Clooney and Soderbergh producing it that it might be a half decent movie. The story is so weak that you leave the cinema feeling baffled and empty. Using lame excuses to bring the story along completely spoilt it for me. It is also very cheap of this picture to use George Clooney on the front of every poster they have produced when he spends only three of the dire 89 minutes on screen. Sam Rockwell is convincing, however everybody else performs poorly. If you enjoy being bored then this is for you. If not then don't bother. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Welcome to Collinwood" is just another in a long line of flicks about a bunch of people after a bunch of money. An uninspired, lackluster film with a good cast of character actors playing a motley bunch of hoodlums, "...Collinwood" relies on the kookiness of its characters and the quirkiness of its messy plot for comedy. With no drama, romance, action, suspense, titillators, etc. and a simple minded make-it-up-as-you-go storyline, "...Collinwood" is a marginal watch which is best saved for broadcast.

		<shortDescription>It's new AND it's good..if you'd just give it a chance !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Same old story...critics and audiences complain that nowadays cinema keeps on getting worse and worse. Then, when an overall decent and enjoyable film gets released, it's ignored and pushed into stereotype categories. In my country, Welcome to Collinwood went straight to the rental market and it wasn't even a success there because the film is too neutral. So, it's up to you...the more serious movie buff to increase the status of this fun little movie a bit!!Welcome to Collinwood is a long way from being an original or innovating movie, but it contains enough refreshing and entertaining aspects to give you a good time. What makes this movie different (and better) from the others is the portrayal of the characters. Every character in this movie have their own, weird personality elements. When all of them are being brought together, it results is a few very good sequences. Plus, all the roles are played by overtalented and underrated actors. The late Michael Jeter, Lu?z Guzman, Sam Rockwell, William H. Macy...they all give away very good performances. Heck, the entire movie is worth watching if it were only for the small role by George Clooney!! (who also co-produced the movie along with Steven Soderbergh)...I really advise you to give this film a chance. True, you won't be impressed or anything...but you certainly won't regret it neither.</fullReview>
