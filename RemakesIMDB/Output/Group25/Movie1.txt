		<shortDescription>An effective neo-noir that gets a little convuluted towards the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just recently discovering this on dvd, I'm actually suprised I haven't heard much about it before. A modern film noir that's a very loose remake of "Out of the Past" with Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas. The film instead focuses on gorgeous, sunny locations like Mexico and the finer locations of L.A. instead of the dark and grungy look that most film noir's follow. Jeff Bridges stars as a pro L.A. football player that gets cut because of a mild injury. Upset because he has some good years left in him, he attempts to sue the team to no avail. Broke and looking for a job, a shady past friend played by James Woods shows up with a job offer: find his girlfriend who split on him and headed to Mexico. This girlfriend also happens to be the daughter of the woman who owns the L.A. pro football team, a ruthless business woman who is primarily interested in real estate and inherited the team from her late husband. When he decides he needs a vacation and the money, he takes Woods up on his offer. After a couple days of useless searching, he finally finds her...and immediately falls in love. The femme fatale is played by Rachel Ward, a hot commodity back then, coming off of The Thornbirds. A spoiled rich princess-type, she eventually succumbs to him and the following scenes are some of the most beautiful sequences put on film. The only commercial movie that has filmed scenes in the gorgeous ancient ruins of Chichen Itza and Tulum, these sequences make the film. The sex scene is one of the best I've seen, really putting a passion on the screen without becoming too...late night cinemax. Unfortunately, from here, the film plummets into a convuluted mess trying to deal with issues that seem out of place with the film: The L.A. business elite, gambling, real estate, etc. I think the film is definitely worth a watch for the first two-thirds alone. Also, dvd fans are encouraged to listen to the cast commentary. One of the better commentaries I've heard, there is a lot of great anecdotes from a rare track by Jeff Bridges and James Woods. The two leads really seem to come off as real friends joking and ribbing each other, unlike some of the stuffy professional actor commentaries that are usually the case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY loose remake of "Out of the Past"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ex football player Terry Brogran (Jeff Bridges) takes a job from sleazy friend Jake Wise (James Woods)--find his ex girlfriend Jessie Wyler (Rachel Ward) who shot him and ran away with a large amount of his cash. Terry tracks Jessie to Mexico...and immediately they fall in love. That's the first hour--the second hour becomes very convoluted with murders and double crosses all over the place.Interesting movie which is a semi-remake of "Out of the Past". In fact Jane Greer from the original plays the mother of her character here! The original was a strong, well-written film noir. This is not film noir--it's a combination romance/mystery/melodrama. Also Greer played a totally amoral woman in the original--here Ward isn't amoral, just misunderstood. Also Bridges is all pumped up and him and Ward work wonderfully together. Their frequent very R rated sex scenes really work. And it looks great--a portion of the film takes place in Mexico. Still there are definite problems here.One character, Edie (Swoosie Kurtz) is introduced to provide some REAL clumsy exposition...and doesn't pop up again until a HOUR later. I had forgotten who she was! Alex Karras is incredibly bad in his role. The plot gets way too confused. And the movie isn't sure what it wants to be. It switches gears so much I thought I was gonna get whiplash! The best part of the movie--an incredible car race down Sunset Blvd. has NOTHING to do with anything in the movie! The acting is pretty good. Bridges (in one of his few commercial films) and Ward LOOK fantastic, have great bodies and are both good in their roles. Woods is, surprisingly, pretty wooden. Greer isn't in much but she IS very good. And Richard Widmark hams it up in his small role.Also the film has a surprisingly somewhat downbeat ending. And there's a wonderful title song by Phil Collins (nominated for an Academy Award).A very interesting movie. I give it a 6. A sizable hit in its day--but that's because of the steamy sex scenes between Ward and Bridges.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I could tidily sum up "Against All Odds" in a witty or clever review I surely would, but it's not that kind of film. If you read the other user reviews you'll see that everyone has their own different opinion, loving the movie or hating it for their own personal reasons. And now I'll share my personal reasons with you...I was just a kid when the movie was released, and far too young to see it. I was, however, aware at the time that every man in America was in love with Rachel Ward and that the Phil Collins title song (and video) was played incessantly. From what I had heard and seen of the movie it seemed very adult, even taboo... unusual in the (mostly) family-friendly 1980's.Flash forward twenty years... I finally saw the movie on cable... it was great, not just as a film but because I'd been waiting so long to see it. It's an adult movie, a loose remake of an old film noir but "Against All Odds" never gets too heavy. The mistake so many noir-wannabes make is to have the characters so dark, so doomed, so DAMNED, that you lose all sympathy for them. This film avoids that, carefully showing how decent people can do terrible things and still remain... decent people.Jake Wise (James Woods, great as always)- is the skunky, understated gangster who hires his footballer buddy Terry Brogan (Jeff Bridges) to find his missing girlfriend Jess (Rachel Ward). Terry finds the sultry, irresistible girl in South America but decides not to tell Jake, opting instead to take her to bed and spend two weeks with her in paradise. Trouble finds them, as it always does, and the rest of the film is spent unraveling the web in which all three find themselves, with enough surprises to keep you guessing.This film also fits nicely into my favorite sub-genre: The 80's Cocaine Nightmare. Such films- including "Bright Lights, Big City," "American Psycho," "Tequila Sunrise," and "Less Than Zero"- feature successful, beautiful people whose greed, ambition, and love of the flake eventually bring them to their sticky end.You may love it, you may hate it, but "Against All Odds" to me is a definitive 80's movie. It just works. And the final scene- scored by Phil Collins' title song- is perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful flawed noir.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parts of "Against All Odds" are absolutely magnificent. The Mexican location photography is terrific. Rachel Ward looks great as does Jeff Bridges. The chemistry between them is mostly believable. I liked James Wood's smarmy, pompous, character. Alex Karras seemed miscast, as did Richard Widmark. The story piles on a thickening plot that occasionally wanders off course, and is probably more complex than necessary. No police are involved, and bodies too conveniently disappear. The ending seems especially forced, with an outcome that is less than satisfying.The film is beautiful, however the characters are mostly unlikeable, including Rachel Ward's. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed this partially flawed movie. - MERK</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just bought and watched this DVD. This is the first time I've watched this film for many years. I've always loved this film and its great to finally own it on DVD. Its hard to believe this film is 20 years old now but it hasn't dated and is one of the best films to come out of the 80's. Its a cracking thriller that goes along at a fast pace. it does get a bit muddled in the middle as the plot unfolds but builds up to a dramatic ending. Rachel Ward is totally stunning in this film and has a fantastic body though sadly we don't get to see all of her body thanks to some pretty remarkable camera work!! The scenes between her and Jeff Bridges are very hot. James Woods is great in this film as well. Its a real tear jerking end with the end credits rolling to Phil Collins greatest ever song 'Against all Odds' with our two stars of the film unable to be with each other thanks to Rachel Ward's powerful family. If ever a film needed a sequel it was this one but sadly it was never made. This film is well worth owning on DVD and can be bought at a pretty cheap price and comes with quite a few deleted scenes which do add to the film. I must check out the Directors commentary with James Wood and Jeff Bridges. On the whole this is a very watchable film with some very steamy scenes. I give it 8 1/2 out of 10. A little known fact is that the song 'Against All Odds' was a reject song from one of Phil Collin's albums which he deemed wasn't good enough for the album!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loosely based on Out Of The Past, this updating brings some new elements, many of which work, a few of which don't. Neat use of Jane Greer, heroine of the first film, as heroine's mother. So many new twists and turns, knowing the original will not spoil this thriller's conclusion. Only thing as per usual with Taylor Hackford, the film goes on a bit too long, but most of it is so good, you won't mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes it takes more than love...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The single thing that stand out most for me in this film is the very last shot of Rachel Ward looking at the camera while Phil Collins, singing the title song, says "How can I just watch you walk away, when all I can do is watch you leave". If you've ever been part of a couple where 2 people loved each other so very much, but it had to end because circumstances like jobs, school, parents, etc. made it impossible to continue, this movie is for you.If you've lived through a time in your life when you and your friends/lovers were immortal-young lions-with the world at your feet, but one day you sense a change of seasons in the air... a change that for shadows the coming of the real world you always knew was there but that you had hoped against hope to avoid, you'll love this movie. Great characters, solid performances, top notch script, beautiful natural scenery in Mexico, great soundtrack and a real "LA in the 80's" feel. For the most part the film holds up well today and the "look" is timeless. Very few holes in the plot, if any, and a fine supporting cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent 80s B-Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected a cringefest, but actually ended up liking this movie a lot. Befitting its era, it has a sleazy "Miami Vice" atmosphere, complete with Porsches, Ferraris, casual jackets, big hair and a great soundtrack including a live show by the one and only Kid Creole. But there's more. Nice location shoots in Mexico - Cozumel, Tulum and Chichen Itza. Jeff Bridges and James Woods, who play fairly complex characters well. A dark script that delivers some good moments, especially during the final 30 minutes.Yes, it's a B-movie, and at times it feels like a protracted episode of Knight Rider, the A-Team or the aforementioned Miami Vice. But is that a bad thing? If you're looking for a real 80s experience, find "Against All Odds" on VHS, pop it in your VCR and soak it in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Evil to Spoiled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Against All Odds is an less than effective remake of Out of the Past that RKO noir classic that starred Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, Kirk Douglas and Rhonda Fleming. Not that the players in this film are bad, far from it. But the whole basic structure of the story was completely changed.What made Out of the Past the classic it is, is the moody tension and overwhelming sadness surrounding the leading characters. Most of all Jane Greer who is an evil temptress beyond description bringing death and destruction to all around her.Jane Greer is in this film, but as the mother of Rachel Ward who plays the part Greer had in the original. Ward in this one is just a spoiled young woman who runs off with bookie James Woods to upset mom and then runs off with him.Greer is the owner of a professional football team in Los Angeles which she runs with her high priced fixer of a lawyer Richard Widmark. I think they're characters are modeled on Joan Payson who was the original owner of the New York Mets and M. Donald Grant who was reputed to be the hard character Widmark portrays.Anyway Jeff Bridges gets into the act when he's cut from Greer's team and goes to work for Woods trying to locate Ward. The rest of the film is pretty much following the plot of Out of the Past until the ending which is completely different. Remember how everyone ended up in the RKO film and the same doesn't happen to most of them.Still it's not a bad film, but Against All Odds just won't be a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woods and Bridges Carry Often Confusing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loosely based on a 1947 film noir, "Out of the Past," Taylor Hackford's "Against All Odds" has strong performances in all but the most critical role. Jessie, a confused disoriented heiress, is the romantic obsession of two men and the crux of the film's action. However, Rachel Ward fails to convince that Jessie could obsess anyone with her flat delivery and phoned-in performance. Jessie runs off to Mexico to snorkel and shop, and her gangster boyfriend hires an injured football player to find her. Sending a handsome hunky athlete off to find your girlfriend at the beach is not an inspired idea, and both the expected and the unexpected ensue. The twisted convoluted tale occasionally meanders, and the pacing falters at times. However, when the sweaty romantic scenes are over, the plot manages to re-energize and re-capture attention towards the fade out.Despite her physical beauty, Ward is the black hole at the film's center. However, her two co-stars are more captivating. James Woods can play slimy gangsters in his sleep, and his Jake Wise is appropriately chilling and creepy, which makes Jessie's attraction to him even less convincing. Evidently Jake had a brain fart when he decided to hire Terry Brogan to search for the girl who deserted him, because Jake and Terry are worlds apart in the looks and charm departments. Jeff Bridges's athletic Terry, who has history with Jake, is unwittingly drawn into a vortex of corruption during his search for Jessie. Although always watchable, Jeff Bridges has had better and more demanding roles than an injured jock playing private eye. Despite a decent script adapted by Eric Hughes from Daniel Mainwaring's original, the film's central mystery is why Jake and Terry would be hopelessly drawn to a shallow drifter like Jessie. Ward received top billing over Bridges and Woods, another mystery as baffling as any in the plot.Experienced veterans provide solid supporting performances, led by a still-handsome Richard Widmark, who, at age 70, remained a commanding presence. In a nod to film buffs, Jane Greer, star of the 1947 version, appears as Ward's cold distant mother. Location work in the Mayan temples of Mexico's Yucatan is travel-log appealing, and the end credits feature an Oscar-nominated title song by Phil Collins. An exciting car race through Los Angeles traffic is thrilling, if pointlessly reckless. Although "Against All Odds" runs more than 20 minutes longer than the 1947 original, Bridges and especially Woods are compelling enough to hold attention even when the tricky plot wanders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" What's a better place to commit murder. than a Mayan Ball Court? "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has ever read Daniel Mainwaring's 1947 novel 'Out of the Past' will quickly see the connection to Hollywood's newest remake called " Against All Odds." In the 47' version it was Robert Mitchum against Kirk Douglas, the new release star's Jeff Bridges and James Woods. In the original Mainwaring story, the hero plays a detective, the second transforms him into a football player. Both are essentially hired to travel South, searching for a run-away girlfriend with stolen cash. Both find the girl and then the story becomes more convoluted than a Bavarian pretzel. The movie is fraught with twists and turns and once inside the story-line, it becomes difficult to follow who is doing what to whom. Following closely, the audience is privy to the hot-off-the-griddle love triangle between the principals. At the same time, we try as hard as we can to Follow the Money. Those who have it want more and those who ignore it, willingly trade it for personal interest. In the end, this is a particular film which warns audience members, don't take your eyes and ears off the screen or else you'll lose your place. Interesting novel, but loses something when transfered to the screen. Alex Karras, Sal Rubinek and the late great Richard Widmark, add to the re-make. But, personally, I like the original movie as the re-make will steam up your glasses. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorites!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this movie a 10. I'm a longtime fan of Jeff Bridges, and this is one of his best. Jeff is the only good guy surrounded by bad guys and worse guys. Even the women are treacherous, except Swoosie Kurtz, who plays a kind of pathetic, lonely secretary. "Against All Odds" is a remake of an older film, but they've done a nice job updating it. There are so many twists and turns in the plot, it will keep you guessing right up to the end.I don't want to give anything away, but there's a great car chase scene that will have you on the edge of your seat. There are some nice scenes of the ruins at Chichen Itza (in Mexico) and the beautiful island of Cozumel before it became a tourist trap. The soundtrack is great too.I've seen this movie at least 10 times on video, maybe more. When I first saw it in the theater in 1984 I hadn't even heard of James Woods before. He is truly a plus in this picture, in fact all the cast is really good. Even though this is in the category of "Romance" it's not a chick-flick. Guys will like it too. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Obscure Film Starring Jeff Bridges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who consider themselves Jeff Bridges fans have never experienced him in this rather obscure film back in the year 1984. Jeff Bridges was definitely eye candy to the female demographic and it doesn't hurt that a romantic story is added to the crime drama that also stars James Woods and Rachel Ward. The gorgeous island landscape will surely inspire you reconsider where you plan to go to for your next vacation. And if the romance and the island paradise are not your cup of tea, there is also a story filled with conniving dirty scoundrels, corruption, greed, money and power that will likely keep the fans of noir intrigued. Jeff Bridges stars as Terry Brogan, a football player trying to make a comeback after being on the shelf with a shoulder injury. But due to a political loophole, Brogan is cut from the team. Suffering from financial debt and nowhere to turn to he is contacted by a sleazy businessman Jake Wise (James Woods) whose reputation has not always been clean. Jake is also not on very happy terms at the moment because his girlfriend Jessie (Rachel Ward) who's the owner's daughter to the team that Brogan played for, betrayed him and left the guy in a perpetual limp. With an act of desperation for money, Brogan arbitrarily agrees to help Wise look for Jessie and sure enough he finds her, but is not sure if he wants to bring her back to Jake Wise as he falls head over heels for her. They soak up sun sun together, they frolic in the sand, which lead to Jake bringing in a hired hand to see what the hell is going on. Things take a turn for the worse and the lovebirds find themselves in a precarious situation that neither of them can escape. Do they have the any chance to escape their fate before it is too late?The love triangle is surprisingly very engaging, even though situations like this has been done thousands of times before. The chemistry between Bridges and Woods is very intriguing and the romantic angle between Ward and Bridges will surely make your heart melt like a snowman in a microwave. The suspense is engaging, the thrills are exciting and the action could get pretty intense at times. But the crime drama can also tend to have its share of awkward moments as well. Brogan has become a man on a mission even through blackmail and is now a man running for his life all on account of just looking for extra money to get him out of debt. The premise can at time be quite surreal at times and the twists and turns are can leave you puzzled thanks mainly to the script by Eric Hughes and Daniel Manwaring. The plot of the story gets lost in the shuffle and the good relaxing time on the beach, well let's just say it wiped-out.Bridges plays his role quite convincingly as a wounded man, a naive guy who put his foot in a place he never should have been in from the beginning. The man has a heavy burden on his shoulder and he succeeds very well in carrying it. I was never a huge fan of Rachel Ward, but she's not sore on the eyes. The dialogue between her a Bridges are well executed, but his attraction to her is well obvious and not very well hidden. Woods is in his usual territory as the slimy, back-stabbing remorseless scoundrel who has no problem dealing with anyone who crosses his path, even if it isn't always pretty. Alex Karras as the head patriarch from the 1980's sitcom "Webster" plays a pivotal supporting role as a coach and sponsor to Mr. Brogan. Though the story has its share of lopsided scenes, it is still one worthy enough to enjoy. For Jeff Bridges fans who have overlooked this one should see him in his prime. He brings his charm and personality here like he's done in almost 45 years he has graced the silver screen.It will surely please everyone who enjoys romance, suspense and action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a solid, well balanced suspense thriller. The plot is intricate and nicely weaved, the acting is excellent, dialogue is tight. Since it's based on a film of the noir era (which I haven't seen yet) it adopts a lot of those traits but appropriates them for an era that's a little freer with sexual expression. Like Body Heat, and a few others of the '80s, it's always interesting to see that genre developed.The characters are nicely fleshed out; all have tangible motivations and all evoke a degree of sympathy form the viewer, which is hard to do.Some of it hits you as a little over the top, especially a few of the locations and the dated score, and it won't change your life, but overall it's a well executed film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading some of the earlier comments, I began to wonder if I'd seen the same film. It is gaggingly-poorly edited/scripted. Watching it with friends, our comment at scene-changes was "and now, in an entirely different movie...." Motivation for the characters' actions? Why did Rachel leave Jeff in Mexico and go back to James? "Because you couldn't handle things" ... but he (oops SPOILER ALERT!) had just thrown the victim's body in a river (after hauling it several miles...). And then she says to James, "You have to let me go." But she just came back to HIM. Sigh. James Woods' character changes about half way through, too; goes from being Mista Gangsta to the guy who looses the girl. Although Mr. Woods does a very courageous/convincing job of staying with the schizophrenic character. If there could be a reason to slog through this film, James Woods would be it. Aside from Rachel Ward/eye candy but, as another reviewer commented, she spends most of her time in baggy outfits that your (staunch Puritan) mother would approve of. One of the guys watching the film with us: "We wuz robbed! When does she take her clothes off?" It was as if someone were trying to make An Art Film by chopping the scenes/changing the context every few minutes. Either that or everybody wanted to get some $$ for spending a lot of time hanging out on the beach. Hey, where do I sign up?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1. Boy gets girl.This has to happen at the end of reel (or act) three. In Against All Odds, however, Jeff Bridges lays Rachel Ward towards the end of reel one, and throughout most of reel two.Result: the film is at sea during reel three because all the dramatic tension has been dispelled.The writer has not taken care to make the Bridges/Ward relationship convincing or meaningful beyond raw sexual attraction in a fabulous setting, so when they characters return to their troubled lives in Los Angeles, it is not credible that Bridges is passionately in love with Ward to the point where he will take incredible risks to get her back (which he actually doesn't).The narrative thrust of the plot is thus crippled within 30 minutes and this team of film-makers did not have the wit to retrieve it.Five points, nevertheless, for the photography of Mexico and Rachel Ward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Uneven and Convoluted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is well known primarily for the accompanying Phil Collins song. The bad news is that you'll have to sit through this lumpy mess to hear it play over the closing credits.Bridges plays a football player who gets cut two games into the season despite catching the winning TD pass and to all reports playing well. It's some kind of cost-cutting move, one that his sleazy agent (who now also represents the teams slimy owner) goes along with. So Bridges' sleazy gambler/clubowner/gangster buddy Woods decides to hire Bridges (for whom playing with some other team isn't even considered) to track down his ex-girlfriend who happens to be the owner's daughter. Despite no apparent PI skills, Bridges flies to Cozumel and by wandering around with a snapshot quickly locates her. She's pretty much a beyotch (would have to have something wrong to have been Woods' moll), but since the film needs to move along these two good looking people soon "fall in love". The rest of the film consists of various twists and turns involving point-shaving and blackmail so that the owner can develop some prime LA property. Multiple actions along the way are head-scratchers and the climactic confrontation at the development site is a big let-down.Bridges and Ward look good (her upsweep hairdo notwithstanding), but they have little chemistry. For an 80s film, her role required more skin than she showed and her acting is wan. Woods does show why he became a sleaze archetype. A couple scenes are so stupid as to undercut the entire film, including the secretary trying to get the "treasure chest" in front of a leering Doberman (who were big in film at the time). There is an excellent car race scene though.The biggest WTH moment though is when Bridges and Ward are copulating in a Mayan temple in the middle of freaking nowhere when Alex Karras - Bridges' old coach - walks in on them.Get the song on iTunes but miss this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre melodramatic remake of a classic noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A broke football player (Jeff Bridges) recently cut from his team is hired to track down a poor little rich girl (Rachel Ward) in Mexico wanted by her wealthy mother (Jane Greer) and her gangster ex-boyfriend (James Woods). Against All Odds is a remake of the 1940s classic Out of the Past. Updated for the 1980s, the film was also significantly dumbed down and rather than serve as a hardboiled noir like Out of the Past, Against All Odds is far more content to function as a melodrama probably in an attempt to secure better numbers at the box office. The movie is perhaps most notable for its excellent title song, played over the final scene and end credits, by Phil Collins. This final scene where Ward and Bridges stare at each other knowing they can never be together is the film's best moment. The film also gained traction because of a few, somewhat explicit, sex scenes between Ward and Bridges, but perhaps unconventionally it is Bridges' body that is showcased more than Ward's. The film also includes some nice tropical Mexican scenery, including a few scenes at ancient ruins, where Bridges and Ward have one of their romps. In general, Bridges is quite good here and that is to be expected as he excels in these kind of stoic roles where he plays an outsider. Ward, on the other hand, is about as emotive as a plank of wood. Rather than act, she mostly just whimpers through the whole film. The film also makes up a rather convoluted excuse as to why Ward's character speaks with an English, rather than American accent (the film is set mostly in LA and Ward's character is ostensibly American), but it was mostly likely due to the fact that she couldn't pull off a competent American accent. The film's biggest mistake however was turning the Ward character from a femme fatale who takes the initiative, as she did in the original film (and played by Jane Greer) into a largely helpless and ever whimpering rich girl. In the process the character lost a great deal of allure.The film is further marred by a script that goes totally off the rails in the film's final third weighed down by plot machinations featuring point-shaving and bribery and also a poorly directed climactic shootout/confrontation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Passable Noir-Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of Out of the Past, 'Against All Odds' is A Passable Noir-Thriller, that isn't power-packed nor is it weak. Its thoroughly watchable, but never gripping enough to leave you awe-inspired. 'Against All Odds' Synopsis: A gangster hires an ex-football player to find his girlfriend. When he finds her, they fall in love, and the twists start to appear.'Against All Odds' has an interesting premise, but it never pushes the limits. Its a so-so Noir-Thriller, that does have some terrific moments, but it isn't entirely wholesome. The twists &amp; turns in the narrative do hold an appeal, but they could've been sharper nonetheless.Eric Hughes's Screenplay is passable, but it needed a much stronger punch. Taylor Hackford's Direction is classy. Cinematography &amp; Editing are okay. Larry Carlton's Score is beautiful.Performance-Wise: Jeff Bridges delivers a credible performance, as always. He enacts the protagonist torn between love &amp; conspiracy, with conviction. Rachel Ward is effortlessly seductive, but also heartfelt. James Woods does well as the villain. The Late/Great Jane Greer leaves a mark. On the whole, 'Against All Odds' can be watched once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We had not seen this movie over the years but caught it today on the Movies! channel. Jeff Bridges is football quarterback Terry Brogan, having just been fired by the Los Angeles Outlaws, in his 30s he still thinks he has a couple of good seasons in him, so he is trying to get his job back.During all this he is hired to find a wealthy missing 20-something, Rachel Ward as Jessie Wyler. This requires him to track her down in Cancun. Her mother is tied in with real estate developer Richard Widmark, as Ben Claxton, and there are some shady deals going on out of sight, including James Woods as Jake Wise. There are betrayals and murder, in the end he heads for Miami to try out and see if he can play there, and it looks like he will get the girl too! Moderately entertaining, but not a particularly memorable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS THROUGHOUT POST: I just watched this 80's classic again and boy does it bring back memories. While this is nowhere near Oscar worthy, it is what it is, an exciting, fun, beautifully filmed movie featuring an unforgettable couple with some of the hottest screen chemistry to come out of the 80's.Against all Odds has a few major things in it's favor and one of them is the characters of Jessie and Terry played by Rachel Ward and Jeff Bridges respectively. Rachel's Jessie is such a complex bad/good girl and Jeff's Terry is so utterly pristine with a touch of bad boy, that the combination makes for a pretty well matched, sizzling couple with screen chemistry that is almost effortless. Likewise, from a cinematographic standpoint, the movie is beautifully filmed, the scenes with Jessie and Terry on the run in particular are magnificent and pure eighties. And the movie is great at building tension as well.Against all odds isn't without flaws, there are times when one is tempted to channel surf. Frankly when Terry and Jessie aren't on screen together, the movie slows down noticeably. But for the most part, it's a mostly fun to watch picture. And as frequently mentioned already by others, the end shot is flawless.I'd give this a solid 7.5. One very good thing about Against All Odds is it can be viewed more then once and still stay interesting. Most definitely recommended for those who have yet to check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost the worst film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd put off seeing "Against All Odds" for almost 30 years, though I'd loved Phil Collins video, and the title song, since it debuted on MTV. Turns out that the video is the better of the two and I should have just watched that. I finally rented the film, and it stinks. I can't believe Taylor Hackford made this confusing mess of a film. I also can't believe the 9-10 star reviews of the film on this site.I adore Jeff Bridges, Rachel Ward, and most of the other actors in the film, but not one of them does a credible job, which I don't think was their fault. Emotions range from spoiled tween to dementia-riddled senior on tranquilizers. One minute Rachel is crying, the next she's stomping off in a huff, then she runs away and jumps on a plane. Bridges recites his lines as if from a teleprompter, when just two years before, in "Tron," he is delightfully droll and playful as Flynn. Same with Ward; she was amazing two years earlier as Juliette in "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid." Alex Karras is completely wasted here. He has about three minutes tops of screen time, where he's just used as a plot point.Another reviewer mentioned that Bridges was in the best shape of his life at this time, and it's true that both he and Ward look fantastic. That doesn't quite make up for the dearth of good acting. The viewer has 128 minutes of story to sit through and in a film of that length they need something more than beautiful people to keep their attention. When you have the superlative Richard Widmark in your film as the main baddie and even his performance is comatose, something is dreadfully wrong. Widmark is more like an insurance agent discussing options on your policy than the crime kingpin he is supposed to be; no one can do evil expressions like Widmark, yet his face seems to have turned to stone here. James Woods, who can be counted on to go over the top if he is allowed to, remains about floor level with his emotions and his acting. When he threatens Bridges it sounds like your kid brother trying to impress you; there is no menace behind his threats. Because of all this I feel the blame for the nearly universal bad performances in this film has to fall on the director. This group of actors had given many wonderful performances before they made this film...they were capable of much more if only the director had asked it of them. The horrendous score and incidental music also deserve to be called out. The jagged electronic score was completely wrong. Hackford should have had Phil Collins do that as well; it cried out for something more lushly melodious and symphonic. The score bears a good deal of the blame in my reasons for hating the film. Hackford must have been distracted throughout the filming. He'd done a good job on "An Officer and a Gentleman," which had some great performances, but this film is just a complete dud. The only reason to watch it is for the beautiful scenery of coastal Mexico, and even that is muted on the DVD release. I'm upset that I can't get back the two hours I wasted on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The knock on 1980s movies is that they sacrifice substance for style, leaning too hard on whiz-bang visuals and MTV video aesthetics at the expense of character and story. Like every such generalization, it's not strictly true, but you would be excused thinking otherwise after watching this 1984 crime drama.Terry Brogan (Jeff Bridges) is a pro football player suddenly cut from the Los Angeles Outlaws on bogus terms. Sleazy gambling buddy Jake Wise (James Woods) offers him some needed funds in exchange for Terry finding a mysterious woman who stabbed Jake, stole his money, and fled to the Mayan ruins of Mexico. When Brogan discovers this woman, Jessie, looks exactly like Rachel Ward in her gravity-defying heyday, he decides on a new plan involving much sex and tequila. Naturally, things get crazy, setting in motion murder, heartbreak, and an emotive Phil Collins ballad.Based loosely on the classic noir firm "Out Of The Past", "Against All Odds" is best known today for the Phil Collins tune. It's a classy song that emotes a lot but doesn't overstay its welcome. At two hours, you can't say the same of the film.When we first see Terry, he's walking around Mexico showing an old photo of Jessie to random passersby. This shouldn't work, except of course its a movie. Bridges looks great with a lean build, a tan, shades, and a beard that makes him look like a cross between Dan Fouts and Kenny Rogers. He has good chemistry with Woods, here debuting his hard-guy-in-a-suit who would brighten many a film over the next two decades.Director Taylor Hackford gets the visual elements right, but the story feels as lost as Terry in his opening scene, especially when it is complicated by a L.A. real estate venture and Jake's gambling activities. More than most '80s films, the plot seems to do little more than whisk the characters from one exotic locale to another.The "Out Of The Past" connection works only to the detriment of this film, as the plot of the Robert Mitchum film followed a more straightforward path, and gave us a central female figure in Jane Greer who is one of the great femme fatales in cinema. Ward, by contrast, is painfully unsteady as she wears her heart way too far out on her sleeve."Can't anyone love me without it being life or death?" she cries out, a line she delivers so badly you wince from watching it. Judging Ward's acting skills is unfair, given the fact she must spout lines like this with painful regularity.Alex Karras as Terry's trainer is just as awful as Ward, and not nearly as much fun to look at, showing up out of nowhere in the middle of Terry and Jessie's most heated lovemaking session to up the ante on the film's unbelievability quotient.I enjoy its aesthetic, very "Miami Vice" with more earth tones and good musical segues. Hackford is always terrific at that, anyway. The sex scenes got a lot of attention in 1984, though they are actually subtle by today's standards. Ward and Bridges sure can kiss at any rate, which helps keep dialogue to a minimum."I wish I'd seen you play football," she says."I could see how Jake would go crazy without you," he replies.Dumb characters are at the heart of a successful film noir, but the passion that usually guides them to their doom feels tacked on here. As an ambiance bath, "Against All Odds" has something going for it, in Bridges' lazy effectiveness as a romantic foil and Woods' nicely underplayed menace. But even the noirish darkness of the last scenes can't conceal the weaknesses of this overstudied, underbaked time capsule.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>remake of "Out of the Past"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Against all Odds" is a 1974 moody remake of the noir classic "Out of the Past" and ultimately less successful. This time around, it's not Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer (though Greer appears in this films as the owner of a football team) but Jeff Bridges and Rachel Ward. The film also stars James Woods, Alex Karras, Swoozie Kurtz and Richard Widmark. Ward plays Greer's daughter, who runs away from her boyfriend (Woods). When Bridges is cut from the football team, bookie Wood hires him to find his girlfriend. Trouble follows.Somewhere post-Thornbirds, the beautiful Ward started playing bad girls. Here she's not so much bad, as Greer's character was in the original, but more of a brat and an ingrate. Totally unlikable. The cast is very good, but too much to type so that there were no surprises in the story. Ward usually plays a user, Woods someone snarky, Widmark bad guys, Greer cold as ice. So after meeting everyone, it wasn't hard to figure out that Bridges was asking for trouble. Oh, and did I mention that Saul Rubinek often plays slime and Pat Corley is usually a crooked politician? It was almost paint by numbers.Despite some beautiful scenery, some good scenes and good acting, Against All Odds left me disappointed. The plot, as in Out of the Past, is a little convoluted, which would be okay if, at the end, you cared. I didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great movie to watch. A time capsule. from 20 years ago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the plot was far superior to most cardboard cut out Hollywood love triangles. That may be due to the fact that Against all Odds "borrows" a lot of stuff from the movie "Out of the Past" starring Kirk Douglas in 1947. I really enjoyed it, but probably for different reasons. As a kid I loved football. When I first saw this film I had to be 12. The movie combines football with beautiful scenery from Cozumel Mexico, (and of course the beautiful Rachel Ward) just enough to grab my interest and take me away from my miserable existence that is the Midwest. As I watch it now 20 years later I am still filled with joy. Amazing how selective the mind can be. I recommend it. It will take you to another time for a while. A place devoid of terrorists, war, anger, and hate. you know the things our media (local news)crams down our collective throats everyday. Not that the film's subject matter is very glamorous. Just what reality was 20 years ago, which although violent doesn't even come close to what we deal with today. When I lived through the cold war and the fear of nuclear Armageddon, I never thought the situation could get any worse. Boy was I wrong. Show how much we know as children. Check out the movie. Its great to open those time capsules every once in a while and slip out of this unreality. To maybe even draw insight into how we got to this point?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words cannot describe how much I am fond of this movie and how splendid I think it is. From the screenplay dialogue to the title design, this film was flawlessly combined.The very beginning of the film mesmerized the audience. A man (Terry Brogan, played by Jeff Bridges) was searching for a woman (Jessie Wyler, played by Rachel Ward) in Mexico, who he had never met, with tense background music. Terry actually was hired by his mate Jake Wise (James Woods) to find Jessie, who was Jake's girlfriend. Ultimately Terry and Jessie fell in love with each other, and things went enormously crazy. There were betrayal, deceit, bribery, greed, crime surrounding them. Everybody was really corrupt and more or less involved in things that mentioned above. Only Terry and Jessie's passion for each other was pure.This brilliant movie was beautifully filmed by director Taylor Hackford and cinematographer Donald E. Thorin, and the rest of the entire crew! Fine musical scores by Michel Colombier and Larry Carlton, not to mention the magnificent theme song by Phil Collins. "Against All Odds" was full of an atmosphere of suspense, and the ending was incredibly haunting.The skin-diving scene was a phenomenon. It, as a matter of fact, referred to Terry and Jessie's first sexual intercourse. In a very creative way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloated remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this again recently a week after watching "Out of the past." The latter is one of the classiest of film noires, while this one is a bloated modernized version that pads the spare, tight frame of the original with layers of glitz, bad dialog and a shameless display of constantly explaining the plot, as if the viewer has had to break for commercials every fifteen minutes.By itself it would have been just another average Hollywood yawn. But as it crassly tries to be a remake of a classic it needs to be taken to the Woodshed and buried! The original had the slow unveiling of a really bad woman, while this one turns her into a "poor little rich girl", manipulated by circumstances. Jane Greer repeats as another bad woman, just of an older generation. She is the only one whose character sticks to the grittiness of the original.After that the acting is bad. Bridges is too young and inexperienced to do much with a loud script. Ward shows her basic lack of talent. Nice looking, and O.K. when she is asked to be angry, but as her character reveals itself her acting unravels into pained angst. Woods shows little of his dangerousness, perhaps because the script constantly demands that everybody explain their motivation.It is not only the script that ruins the movie. The soundtrack is discordant and annoying, and the only good piece of music(Collins) is saved for the final credits. For me the juxtaposition between the two movies would be like having Hemingway rewritten by Grisham.</fullReview>

The on-location shots in Mexico are magnificent, but I find the entire premise of the story to be improbable and the acting to be terrible. The continuity leaves a lot to be desired but the most obvious gaffe: Jeff Bridges' character breaks his arm at one point, but I can't remember which one because the plaster cast keeps switching from left to right and back again. The hot love scene deep inside the maze of the Mayan temple ruins, a masterpiece of photography and "unsubtle subtlety," is suddenly interrupted when Alex Karras's character bursts on the scene.

		<shortDescription>This film does not work. Why not? Now there's a question...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort of film that you leave, recognizing that the film as a whole never "came together", but trying to figure out just WHERE it went wrong. The script was (or at least should have been) intelligent, the actors were competent... so what went wrong?The best answer I could come up with (and heaven knows I'm no big shot Hollywood critic) was the way James Woods portrayed the character of Jake. This guy should have come off as a bigger-than-life, high-level Mafioso type; I got the impression of a cheap hood who tried to make himself look big as the front man for the real boss. When Jake orders the ex-football player to do a routine murder and the jock goes along with it, it doesn't underscore what a big man Jake is; it cheapens the lead character to think that he'd take orders to commit murder from the weaselly underling.It didn't help this movie in the long run - okay, maybe its box office - that the continuous play of Phil Collins' "Against All Odds" on radio and MTV effectively made this movie a must-see... and regardless of how good the tune was and what it was nominated for, the lyrics had NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with what happened in the course of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beaten by the odds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake probably works best if it's not just a straight scene-for-scene copy. In that spirit, when the filmmakers remade "Out of the Past", they cross-pollinated a story about washed up pro-football players onto the old missing girlfriend plot. Unfortunately we are presented with a hybrid that just doesn't bloom at all.The film commences with Terry Brogan (Jeff Bridges), searching for the beautiful Jessie Wyler (Rachel Ward), through picturesque locations in Mexico. A pulsating score by Michael Colombier accompanies his search along palm-fringed beachfronts, cafs and bars. A flashback explains the reason for his search.Jeff Bridges brings his likable style to the role of Terry Brogan, a pro-football player who has been dropped from his team. His charisma goes a long way to disguising the thinness of the material with much footage devoted to the ex-player part of the story. Amongst the characters is Grace Wyler played by Jane Greer who had Rachel Ward's role in 1947's "Out of the Past".Brogan accepts an assignment from Jake Wise (James Woods) to track down his girlfriend Jessie Wyler, Grace Wyler's daughter, who has disappeared in Mexico. The fact that Wise would send such an appealing and attractive guy to find his hot girlfriend makes about as much sense here as it did when Kirk Douglas sent Robert Mitchum on the same errand thirty-seven years before.When Brogan finds her they have an affair. They tryst in a number of exotic settings including the ruins of an ancient Mayan temple. Sound hot? Not really, the sex scenes register about as much heat as a fragrance commercial ? just look at the poster.The plot follows the 1947 version and the characters eventually end up back in LA for a less than exciting denouement.Although there is much talk in "Against All Odds", the motivation of many of the characters is hard to gauge. By the end, Bridges' character attracts little sympathy while Rachel Ward's character attracts none at all. She struggles to make us believe that she is the femme fatale the story says she is. There has to be something engaging even with the most deadly of fatales, but Ward comes across as just too brittle. Not helping much is James Woods who as Jake Wise is relentlessly ruthless and scheming; with the exception of Bridges, everyone is just a little too one-note.Despite interesting locales, and attractive stars "Against All Odds" is a pale imitation ? or a suntanned one in this case ? of an older, better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would be disappointing, if you had any expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Low expectations are the key to enjoying this movie. Keep in mind that the film is anchored by a dubious ballad by Phil Collins, an even more dubious performance by top-billed actress Rachel Ward, and was directed by a man who has the word "hack" in his name (Taylor Hackford). It is a re-make of Jacques Tourneur's equally stylish but infinitely more cynical 1940s classic "Out of the Past." While Tourneur's film took us on a death-trip that proceeds with cold logic to its blazing suicidal finale, this film is too invested in the romance at its core to allow the characters to be truly bad or truly alive.Let's face it, Jeff Bridges is not a replacement for Robert Mitchum. It says everything about the difference in these two films, that Mictchum's character is a broken-down man who operates a gas station in the high deserts of Nevada, while in this version Bridges plays a football player. That's right, and the plot actually has something to do with football players, coaches (Alex Karras appears prominently), bookies (Dorian Harewood and James Woods), corrupt real estate moguls (Jane Greer, from the original film) and professional fixers (Richard Widmark). The primary weakness of the script is that it spends the first half trying to convince us that Rachel Ward is a femme fatale, and then by the time we're halfway believing it (she deserts Bridges in Mexico after murdering Karras' character), the rest of the movie is spent trying to convince us that she's got a heart of gold. Her character makes no sense, and she doesn't have the screen presence to make us look past that fact.A high speed chase with sports cars that takes place 10 minutes into the film is the highlight of the entire film. We also get to see Kid Creole do his best Cab Calloway impersonation, and other bits of 80s "nostalgia" for things that weren't worth showing in the first place. The director is mostly concerned with having his characters walk through rooms that are stylishly decorated and architecturally moderne. If he had spent more time working on the script and less time scouting locations, it might be worth something. As it is, this film is not only an embarrassment to anybody who is a fan of the original film, but just a poor effort in and of itself. Widmark is the only actor who comes out looking better than he did going into it. Eminently skip-able.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever I think about "Against All Odds", it's that final shot of Rachel Ward as the credits roll that springs to mind. It's a great image, and one that really captures the sad undercurrent running through the whole movie. I haven't seen the original "Out of the Past", but from what I've read about it, "Odds" seems less a remake and more its own thing: a romantic love triangle very much of the '80s and sold on the chemistry between its leads. Between the exotic Cozumel beaches and nighttime L.A. streets, it's a sort of sunshine noir with sports politics and real estate maneuvering thrown in. There's a lot of plot going on here (probably overstuffed), but there's also a very nice sports car chase down Sunset Blvd, the always magnetic James Woods and the smoldering heat between Ward and Jeff Bridges that keeps things focused. 7/10</fullReview>

They have instead simply cut him from the squad. Frustrated and desperate for money, he decides to work for an old friend (James Woods), who happens to be a known drug dealer. So the lying and double-crossing begin, as does the search for young Jessie (Rachel Ward).Director Taylor Hackford makes little of the complex and potentially enthralling plot, while he does handle the romance quite well. The film is unfortunately uneven and is a definite indication that Mr. Hackford should stick to affairs of the heart.Friday, June 26, 1992 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** Spoilers in this review *** Probably my favorite scene in "Against All Odds is at the meeting between Brogan, "Jake" and corrupt rich dude Ben Caxton. Brogan has something of Caxton's and says all he wants in exchange is to get Jake out of his life. Caxton responds, "Why don't I believe you," to which Brogan replies "Because you're a corrupt old man!" The look on Caxton's face is so hilarious, like he's thinking "Yeah, he's got a point there!" LOL.This film in many ways is a typical Hollywood expose' of the corrupt right-wing "movers and shakers." Hollywood has certainly never been afraid to expose the hypocrisy and corruption that runs rampant among the rich and powerful so-called "movers and shakers" (who nearly always 'move' through lies, underhanded deals, and various other forms of immorality), and Against All Odds is no different.A good movie, not great, but good. In many ways it's unpleasant to watch because there are so many "bad guys" and only one "good guy" who really is against nearly insurmountable odds. It's not a film I can watch often, but one I catch every few years or so and always re-appreciate. Helps keep me aware of what goes on behind the masks, you might say. The last scene of the film is poignant, no question about that at all. 7/10</fullReview>

Bridges finds Ward and they become lovers in some of the sexiest scenes on cinema, short of porn. James Woods is in love with Rachel Ward as Jesse and we feel for him when he realizes that she has fallen for Bridges, because he truly loves her. There are some complicated plot twists, but ultimately, it is about Jesse (Rachel Ward) and Terry (Jeff Bridges) and how they have been thrown into politics, bribery and murder.

		<shortDescription>Bridges at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll tell you why I love this movie - Jeff Bridges. He plays the part to perfection. I love his passion for the game, his desire to stay clean, and his ability to stand on his own and not succumb to any of the low-lifes who surroud him (Jake, Jessie, etc...)He has some incredible lines: "I figure f*ck em' - and f*ck you too lady." "Lady, I'm sure there are a bunch of people who care what you believe, I don't see any in this room."Brogan's relationship with Jake is great. He doesn't take any of his sh*t, and Jake respects that. He knows Brogan is probably the only guy in Beverly Hills who can't be bought. Woods is great, as always.To sum it up - Bridges was born to play Terry Brogan, and Terry Brogan is one of the best characters of all time. I wish they'd written a sequel. They left it wide open at the end. And Phil's song makes the ending perfect. I wish there were more movies like this one.Terry Brogan goes down on the "I wonder what happened to?" list with Tony Monero and Travis Bickel. I guess we'll never know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rachel Ward is Awful, Jeff Bridges is Buff, and Phil Collins(?) Gets the Glory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Argument that You can't Transfer Film-Noir to Modern Times is Weak at best. Talented Filmmakers have Done it Repeatedly and it Can Work. It has been Termed Neo-Noir. Of course, it is a Tricky Transformation and the result has Not always been Successful. There Are some Great Neo-Noirs out there, but this is Not One of them.Director Taylor Hackford said that He did not want to Remake "Out of the Past" (1947), So why did He? It's OK to imagine a Metamorphosis and tailor the Film to Current Sensibilities, Style, and so forth, but Here it Hurts and the Mediocre result is anything but effective.Somehow, the Core of Noir is Lost among the Steamy, Sweaty, Sex Scenes and the Sheen of 1980's crowd pleasing Fads. Music Video Styling and Shallow Representations of the Femme Fatale Fails to intrigue. The Crisp Noir Dialog featured in the Original falls flat and the Actors seem to be Struggling to Make This WorkOverall, Not a Bad Movie, it is Just Unremarkable. Jeff Bridges at His physical Peak of Manhood, seems a bit Whiny on Top of the Tan and Gym Tone and Rachel Ward is a Less than Great Actress and is almost Awful and here Shows No Range of Emotion. James Woods gives the Best Performance but for Him it is a notch Below His usual Show Stealing abilities. Richard Widmark Playing the reprehensible Money Man, a Rich Slime Bucket, is Fine, but again, about Average for His later day Movies.You Know the Movie is Struggling for attention when Just about Everyone Relates to the Film through a Pop Song. A Pop Song? Now that's Definitely Not Noir, in Any Era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too complicated and overwrought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former football player Terry Brogan (Jeff Bridges) is searching for Jessie Wyler (Rachel Ward) in Cozumel, Mexico for a shady acquaintance Jake Wise (James Woods). She's the daughter of the owner of Terry's former pro team. Jake claims that she came at him with a knife and stole $50k. Terry is broke and desperate to get back on the team. He contacts Jessie's mother (Jane Greer) but all she offers is more money than Jake to find Jessie. Jessie doesn't want to be found by either Jake or her mother but she falls for Terry.The movie is bogged down by a lot of unnecessary plot. I don't understand why cutting him from the team is so complicated. It should be a lot simpler. There are real estate deals and politics. Some effort should be expended to simplify a lot of this. Everything is artificially elevated. Terry and Jake are racing their fast cars and I don't care. Nobody is going to die and there's no prize to win. That scene could have been cut down to achieve the same point. It takes 35 minutes to get to Rachel Ward and it takes even longer for them to develop the required chemistry. It's a lot fake overwrought romanticism in the breezy Caribean. At least the movie locations provides a terrific backdrop for the iconic Genesis song. Then the movie devolves into a convoluted mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is a part remake of 'Out of the Past.' Jeff Bridges is a washed up football player Terry Brogan who to makes ends meet takes a job from a shady pal Jake Wise played by James Woods who seems to be involved in some kind of illegal bet fixing. His girlfriend Jessie Wyler played by a sultry Rachel Ward shot him and ran away with some money to Mexico and wants Terry to track him down which he does hand ends up with a steamy relationship with her instead.Now I am aware that 'Out of the Past' also had a convoluted plot in the film noir tradition. Here the the film comes across as confusing, silly and dull. It seems all of Brogan's former football coaches are involved in some dark deeds, one of them is even sent to wipe out Brogan. The side plot of his football team owners, associates and Brogan's own lawyer being involved in backstabbing him as well as some land development deal comes across as half baked.Still the film is well shot, Bridges and Ward make a sexy couple, Woods at the time was making himself a reputation as a bad guy and the end title song is very good but the film never lifts off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take A Look At Me Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taylor Hackford directed this surprisingly strong remake of "Out Of The Past" which stars Jeff Bridges as former NFL football player Terry Brogan, who has just been cut from his team, and is desperately in need of money, so reluctantly takes a job from his shady friend Jake Wise(played by James Woods) to locate his missing girlfriend Jessie Wyler(played by Rachel Ward). He does find her in Mexico, but they both fall madly in love, which makes her subsequent return home to Jake all the more bizarre to Terry, who isn't so willing to give up on her. Jessie's mother(played by Jane Greer) is a powerful real-estate developer who objects strongly to the romance, and her chief representative(played by Richard Widmark) tries to scare him off, though he is unsuccessful, leading to a most dramatic and romantic end... Fine cast and direction, with compelling story and a truly haunting title song by Phil Collins make this a winner. Ending is truly bittersweet, yet there remains hope, and contains a classic closing scene...Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of the Past decimated and changed into a love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The male actors almost were able to save this, especially Jeff Bridges, but also Widmark, Woods, and Karras. Jane Greer was fine and Dorian Harewood too in a small part.It began really well, really atmospherically, and with music that supported the mood, and even a flashback.But then it steadily went downhill. This was due to several things: the story changes, scenes that had too much exposition and explanation, and most of all Rachel Ward. She simply didn't have the acting chops to carry the heavy burden that the script placed on her. The direction was good for the men, but when it came to her, the director couldn't get it out of her. When she started screeching and bawling, that brought it down. Jane Greer in the original is looking like a genius actress in the way she shifted sides between Mitchum and Douglas! The story was changed in very important respects, so that it was really not the same story at all. It became a love story, and supposedly the story of a woman transformed, but it simply didn't come across as it needed to due to Ms. Ward's one-note performance. Most of the changes weakened the story considerably. The ending was contrived. It became a semi-happy ending in which Ms. Ward's character really didn't change much at all and we are fed a note of false hope that maybe in the future, she and Bridges will get together. The story became clumsy and herky-jerky, not a smooth and integrated and satisfying whole.Jeff Bridges is deservedly a top Hollywood star. He almost singlehandedly imbued this film with a noir presence. It still is a neo-noir but made weaker than it could have been.With better film editing, some cutting, more action with fewer explanations, more conveyance of emotion via the actor's faces and eyes, and some script changes, this could have been a much better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some classic films ought to be left alone, as is the case of "Out of the Past", the Jacques Tourneur's 1947 movie, that can stand on its own. The idea that anyone can remake something that was well done before, or give it with a new treatment, usually ends up badly because we would be comparing the old picture with what someone has done with it now.Whatever possessed Taylor Hackford, an otherwise good director, to try his hand at changing the original, is beyond comprehension since it doesn't improve it, or change it, in a positive way. The film is loosely adapted from Daniel Mainwaring's screenplay. At times, watching this movie, we thought we were watching an adaptation of "Chinatown", a movie it parallels because of the subject matter and the setting, without the originality.The plot makes no sense, which is probably what makes the new version so wrong. Jeff Bridges, an excellent actor seems to be out of place in the movie. Also, Rachel Ward, doesn't add anything to her portrayal of Jessie. Jane Greer, who appeared in the original film, returns as the ruthless real estate developer. Richard Widmark has nothing to do. James Woods character is also a puzzle.Perhaps the key to this movie is to watch it for the glorious Mexican locales of Cozumel, Chichen Itza and Tulum and listen to Phil Collins title song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great song; terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do I hate this movie: let me count the ways. Unsympathetic characters; silly plot; no suspense; terrible editing; LOTS of "filler" between key scenes; an Eighties time capsule with the ugly interior decor, big hair, and period clothing. Seeing Rachel Ward slipping in and out of the era's baggy clothing made me long for "Flashdance" instead of this tripe. As one of the other reviewers noted: 2 hours out of my life wasted.Anything positive to say? Phil Collins' song is good; the car chase is pretty good; the Mayans were phenomenal architects. Chichen Itza and Tulum are the most interesting characters in the film. Lastly, a noir-ish film star from an earlier era, Jane Greer, playing Ward's mother, shows that she aged gracefully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How did this happen?! The other evening we caught the film noir Out of the Past. A first-rate period piece (1947) it was so engaging that we rushed out to see how this had morphed in the 1984 version. Things were promising as the modern version would be free of censorship, featured a promising cast, in color, and brought "Out" protagonist Jane Greer back in a pivotal role. So we were at least hoping for a reasonable translation, but oh boy, what a mess!When Jeff Bridges is inadequate you know there are problems! The acting was uninspired. But the screenplay, awful. Characters were drastically altered (think Robert Altman's absurd take on Raymond Chandler's brilliant The Long Goodbye) and the storyline ruined. In a word, it stunk. Please, if they want to do it again, let's please stick with the basic, excellent original story!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's theme song is one of Phil Collin's best. Too bad it was wasted on a movie that had an extraordinarily thin plot with a less than satisfactory anti-climatic ending. After investing your time trying to figure everything out and what's going on, the ending will hugely disappoint you. The chemistry between the actors is blah at best and the script's dialog is as elementary as the plot. It's not worth the time or effort to watch. You're better off listening to the Phil Collins song over and over again. Yet another 80's movie where the theme song is the only good thing about it (see also Caddyshack 2, Over the Top, Chariots of Fire, and many more that I can't think of right now) 2 out of 10 b/c the song makes it only slight better than Mo' Money)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie doesn't have a lot to offer outside some scenic shots of the Mexican coast and Rachel Ward's semi-nude "coast". Everybody in the cast does a workmanlike job and are appropriately cast but the movie had a lot of problems for me.First and foremost, I didn't care for Rachel Ward in this movie. Why are all the characters so obsessed with her? For a start, I don't think she looks all that good. Her hairstyle was awful and her costumes throughout the movie were baggy and unsexy. On top of that, she seems to be very physically awkward---no sexy, slithering walk as you might expect from some femme fatale in a movie. Yes, she gets all hot and bothered with Jeff Bridges in the Mayan temple but the camera just teases---was there ever such a major sex scene in a movie which didn't show more of the lead actress? There were a lot of problems for me with the plot. Ward is from Australia and doesn't make any pretense of trying to use an American accent. The explanation? Her character's father is a late British actor so I guess she inherited her accent (but didn't she grow up in the USA? Why would anyone who grew up in the USA have an Australian accent?). Her character has no redeeming qualities--a troubled rich girl, a former drug addict, a thief. All she seems able to do is maniupulate people and satisfy men in bed. Alright, maybe that is enough! She's not even the villainess in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it with some people? You find a word that sounds like you are knowledgeable about the film industry and use it to death. Never mind if its correct, just use it and sound like you are some intellectual film critic. Ha!That said, why were we supposed to care about the lives of two washed-up bores? By the time Terry (Jeff Bridges) found Jessie (Rachel Ward) in Mexico, I had long stopped caring whether she was alive or dead. The so-called plot - a bad-tempered, rebellious brat (acting more like a silly teenager than a grown woman) lives with a gangster to spite her wealthy family. They fight, she leaves him and is supposedly so intriguing that he hires a has-been football player to find her and bring her back. When Terry finds her, he falls in love with her. Why? She was a rude, cold, manipulative liar. Neither one of these characters was fleshed out enough to make them appealing.I felt sorry for Jake (James Wood). Yes, he was a shady type but he genuinely cared about Jessie and trusted Terry to find her. I don't think he would have tried to hurt her or make her stay if she really let him know that she was through with him. He just wanted a second chance and was willing to do whatever it took to get it. He was betrayed both by Terry and his hired help, Tommy (Dorian Harewood). He even defended the goon when someone made an insulting comment about him. He had loyalty to the people who worked for him, which doesn't make him seem that bad. At least he was honest enough to know what he was and not make excuses. How was Jessie's mother's friend Ben any better? Ben was Jake's boss but because he was wealthy and hid behind a cloak of "respectability" he pretended to be superior to the Jakes of the world.Terry should have counted his lucky stars in escaping from the clutches of these repulsive people. I think he should have taken a second look at that legal secretary. She put her life and job on the line to help him and nearly became a doberman's dinner for her trouble!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing to brag about, not even about the restricted audience. Los Angeles in all its shady business dealing with city planning and city development, no cinema industry, but a lot of football. A football player gets kicked out of the Outlaws, the football team, or at least one of the football teams, of Los Angeles after a broken shoulder or something like that. He gets involved with some "friend" who is as crooked as my arm when I blow my nose. That "friend" wants him to find his disappeared girl friend. She is the daughter of an important business woman who is doing in city development, meaning real estate speculation for the rich, the very rich, away from Beverley Hill. Behind her there is a man who is the real maker of deals, generally with money or blackmailing.Our kicked out football player accepts to look for the girl, falls in love, brings her back against all odds since a killer had been sent after them and then he manages to put his hand on the treasure chest of a crooked lawyer just after the latter was killed and the former has the power to blackmail everyone he wants. That's what I call a kushy pushy job. Lovely Jubbly!So he accepts to disappear, he gets trials with football teams out of Los Angeles, but he cannot get the girl. Too bad.And that's all. It is no new thing that city planning and real estate development are rotten to the core. It is no new thing that sports competition and football games are in a way or another "arranged" by some people who make money out of it. They say rigged like the football players who are rigged with their padding and masks and helmets, etc. You are sure to win when the result has been well cushioned ahead of time. So the film is in no way a masterpiece, except maybe if you could speak of a B masterpiece, the way some speak of B movies. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

Richard Widmark,(Ben Caxton), "Coma" plays the role of a business man who has many dark secrets that no one knows and pulls the strings on crime and corruption. Rachel Ward, (Jessie Wyler),"The Ascent" gives an outstanding performance along with some torrid sex scenes. Jeff Bridges, (Terry Brogan),"The Moguls", is an athlete who was injured and still desires to build himself back up again, however he is down on his luck. Terry meets up with James Woods,(Jake Wise) "Be Cool", who runs a Nite Club and has connections and offers Terry an opportunity to repay a debt which is rather risky. There are encounters with some very rough characters and even dogs who are both out for blood. Like I said before, the music was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie. However, it is beyond excellent, a cinema tour de force if you know about its earlier version and who was in that, if you know where the car race scene was shot, if you know the writer had his license pulled because of racing on LA streets, if you know that Jesse's mother was the love interest in the earlier version. Unless you get the DVD and listen to the comments you won't know any of that. It would be best to watch it, listen to the comments, then watch it again. I did and it was worth it. For example, in the racing scene on Sunset Boulevard the principals were driving their own cars for a lot of it. You can see the reflection of one car in the paint of the other. That is mentioned in the comments on the DVD. There are also movie shorthand things which you miss if not clued-in, such as the Toltec mask first seen in Jesse's place in Mexico and later in Jake's place in LA. These would be criticisms except that the DVD is available and has comments by the actor and director and then by the writer and director, and makes for a really rich and informative experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so i admit that the music is a bit cheesy and the story gets a bit choppy and hard to follow from time to time, but for the most part i think that "against all odds" is very well done and worth while movie that i would enjoy having on DVD and watching whenever. i am a little bias because i LOOOOOVE Rachel Ward, but i still have some arguments to make against some people who think this movie is a second rate remake. i was watching the special edition DVD and on one of the deleted scenes the director clearly said that he Didn't want to remake "out of the past", they merely took the story line and ran with it. so, a lot of people are disappointed that Rachel Ward isn't this evil bitch with a hidden agenda and actually loves Jeff Bridges and doesn't know what's going on with her psychotic boyfriend! well, against all odds isn't a remake and the director has clearly decided to go more for a ROMANCE movie with a lingering crime story line rather than a CRIME movie with a lingering romance. it's that simple. out of the past was one of the hard hitting film noirs of the 40's that was all about deceit and crime and murder and betrayal and against all odds is simply NOT that. Rachel Ward is SUPPOSED to be in love and weepy and oblivious! against all odds takes the story of a man hired by his old friend to find his runaway girlfriend who eventually fall in love with one another from out of the past BUT THATS IT .. after that it's no holds barred and the movies are completely different. I LOVED THIS MOVIE AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. the love scenes are unbelievably romantic and sensuous and Rachel ward is a definite far cry from her last project ... the thorn birds, but she does so well in leading James woods and Jeff bridges. she definitely deserved the top credit because she's the actress who drives the other two actors in the movie and it shows!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is interesting about this movie is that the story line was first told in 1947's Film Noir classic "Out of the Past". In it, both males leads are gangsters looking for their run away girlfriend. In the original, Kirk Douglas is the bad guy who hires Robert Mitchum. Mitchum is hired to find his girlfriend, the femme fa-tale played by Jane Greer. They meet up in Mexico. Jane Greer is also in this movie, but instead of being the femme fa-tale, Greer plays her mother. Watch this movie, then seen the original. You will be happier. As for the rest, the acting is good. But if you like Black and White Film Noir, see Jane Greer when she was hot. And you know what I mean.</fullReview>

Rich girl hooks up with hood, leaves, hood hires former hotshot friend to find her, finds her, falls for her, they get caught, everyone might now die. Happens every day. Fortunately for the film, Rachel Ward absolutely stops your heart every moment she is on the screen and Bridges is very believable.

It isn't possible to have any sympathy whatsoever for any of the characters, and what you have as a result is a bogged-down, mess of a picture. Watch this only if you are interested in Caribbean and South American scenery. That is all that makes this one watchable. Not one of the better film efforts of the 1980s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rachel Ward is gorgeous in this film. I can understand why Jeff Bridges goes crazy for her. The car race scene is one of the best. It is a story of what true love does to people. It also shows that even if you have found your one true love, the rest of the world will not allow your love to flourish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw the perfect black-and-white Turner print of the film-nwahr classic Out Of The Past (1947), starring Robert Mitchum, Kirk Douglas, Jane Greer, Rhonda Fleming, and other soon-to-be huge stars I knew about. I clicked through on one I didn't, Paul Valentine, who played the terrific polished gunsel, and found him in this remake, as was treacherous babe Jane Greer. If you'd like to see more of the late, great Phil Hartman, check out his uncanny resemblance to Paul Valentine in Out Of The Past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed that movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty different from Jacques Tourneur's noir gem starring Robert Mitchum, Kirk Douglas and Jane Greer. Not much of a noir movie in fact. It's really entertaining though: characters are not out of the past but rather straight in the 80s. That's what leaves the noir style behind using others elements gathered from various TV series: a nasty jet set background and a love affair that has to cope with it. Just add on action and sensuality and you got it.The result is widely enjoyable and I think Jeff Bridges Rachel Ward and James Woods are to be thanked for it. Not forgetting the accurate supporting by Richard Widmark and Jane Greer of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>aging footballer goes searching for friends gf and finds trouble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff Bridges plays an aging down on his luck footballer who is cut. Looking for work and money, he helps a friend in a shady proposition: tail his girlfriend. He follows her down to Mexico and finds her and of course falls for her. Her motives though are questionable and she heads back to LA and her boyfriend. Bridges follows her and tries to find answers and ends up in a bunch of danger.Best known for the title song by Phil Collins, the film has some good points going for it : Jeff Bridges and James Woods do good jobs acting and Rachel Ward is definitely simmering in this movie. The car chase scene is a classic but overall thats about it. The rest is your standard noir film without much more to recommend it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot line was a little cheesy for me but the scenery was quite lovely. It was filmed in Cozumel before that island became overdeveloped. There are also bits of the surrounding area of the Yucatan peninsula including the ruins of Tulum. Jeff Bridges was quite a hottie back then. I really don't remember him looking like that. Check out that six-pack! The Coconuts (of Kid Creole and the Coconuts) need to shave their under arms. They're the backup singers/dancers in the Palace Club. When the number begins and they begin toward the front of the stage and raise their arms prepare for a sweaty forest under there. Euuuuuuh</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>rating sounds about right....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie came highly recommended by my tv guide. before I went to watch i checked the imdb, so maybe now I'm prejudiced, but the rating below six sounds about right to me... Not so good a movie, but watchable, jeff bridges is ok, but james woods has certainly done better. music is a bit simple, i would expect a bit more from Taylor Hackford who surprised me with Devil's advocate and blood in, blood out. Rachel Ward's character reminded me of the character of Moira she played in on the beach. The song by Phill Collins is great, although it can be a bit of a cliche when you hear it too often....6/10</fullReview>

Well, I liked James Wood, but the story was lacking, and the characters were wooden. Not likeable. This film needed another rewrite. This movie is against all odds and did not favor well.

		<shortDescription>Jet-set junk - but not unwatchable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An injured footballer is sent to Mexico to trace an errant girl friend, but ends up falling in love with her.An 80's rewrite of Out of the Past, works best at illustrating how the clichs of 1940's can be married to the clichs of the 1980's. Not so much a script as a checklist: Silly premise (tick), dubious people (tick), good looking guy (tick), good looking girl (tick), hot pop soundtrack (tick), big bad guy (tick), various smaller bad guys for-the-killing-of (tick), lush locations (tick), soft-core sex (tick) - need I go on?Jeff Bridges has been told to get an all-over tan and go to the gym more - and it has worked well. Not a spare ounce of fat on him. Never looked better. Rachel Ward is not really my type, in or out of clothes, and is no real actress but seems to know all the cool bedtime positions; and has that just-out-of-the-beauty-parlour look - even when hiding out in the sticks!Director Taylor Hackford knows he has a junky script, so keeps it coming as quickly as he can before popcorn starts bouncing off the screen. Film noir vet Richard Widmark turns up as the big boss, presumably under the agreement that he doesn't have to use any of those four letter words or go to the premier!Ironically, no more or less trashy than the film it retreads and the plot moves along at enough of a clip for you to keep on watching. Silly it may be, but the work of pros working hard enough to pay for their villa in the sun. Which probably looks a lot like those featured in this film. Very much a film of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid this one, against all odds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Webster" costar Alex Karras and former B-level film veteran Jane Greer certainly give "Against All Odds" a good supporting cast to work with but they, along with the stars Jeff Bridges and James Woods are all wasted in a convoulted plot with too many gratuitous sex scenes and not enough material to flesh out a good story in this tale of a football quarterback (Bridges) who is asked by his shady bookie friend (Woods) to go to Mexico and track down Woods' girlfriend (Rachel Ward) who just happens to be the daughter of the football team's owner. Stuff like this can only happen in the movies. Costar Greer has done this exact same film before back in 1947 under the title, "Out Of The Past."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taylor Hackford's best film. Jeff Bridges is superb as the cynical Terry Brogan and James Woods is his usual terrific bad guy self as Jake Wise. We are immediately drawn into Terry's disintegrating world as a pro football player as he becomes enmeshed in the seedy underbelly of sports betting and the high brow clientele being catered to. Rachel Ward (who I loved in The Thornbirds) brings sizzling sensuality to the film, but the true enjoyment of the film comes from the exposing of the corrupt foundations of the L.A. jet set by one of its own "lost" heroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 hours wasted just to see Rachel Ward!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it when it was released. It's on my list of most boring, overrated movies of the 80s, which includes Reds (starring Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton) and Chariots of Fire. Except for Rachel Ward, it was a waste of time. Although on the screen more in Odds as co-star, her smaller role as the mysterious high-price prostitute in a much better movie, Sharky's Machine, was more intriguing. After the Thornbirds mini series, her fans would go to see any movie she was in. Rachel and the title song--the first of Phil Collins' boring formula "hit" pop songs--were the forces behind the interest in the movie. It was the last straw for me going to see Jeff Bridges. His acting at that time consisted of pushing his hair back, squinting and puffing on a cigarette. He began really acting in The Fisher King and The Fabulous Baker Boys, and I became a fan. I've always liked James Woods' acting even in bad movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Football player (jeff bridges) gets fired from the team and then hired to find missing heiress (rachel ward). He finds her and they fall in love and then things get complicated and the shooting starts. Not a bad movie but certainly not great. Bridges looks like a million bucks as the super-fit but injured football player. OTOH rachel ward who is a beautiful woman, is here given a fright wig for a hairdo and looks almost homely. Richard Whidmark is great as the all powerful bad guy. Ex football star alex karras has a decent part and i was amazed at how small he was. Bridges is listed at 6'1" and he appeared to be 2 inches taller than alex who was a lineman in the NFL in the 60s!!A very average movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie could have showed more of JEFF BRIDGES naked. I have my own anatomy to look at and all the other MALE movie oriented movies out there...But the male body is beautiful as well. When will there ever be an equal medium for our teens to look at. I have a couple of daughters, and I just want more male nudity out there. Turn about is fair play guys,sorry. This is a well made movie. But stick to the plot. Less is more. Keep things sacred behind closes doors. I love a great movie, and this one is up there. The romantic events are great! The location and scenery are AWESOME. Leave things more to the imagination, leaves more for the imagination to explore and make up its own conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people don't get this film. The love triangle between Jeff Bridges, Rachel Ward, and James Woods is very well done. I would agree that some of the plot is hard to buy. Why would Woods hire and football player to find his runaway girlfriend. I say because he doesn't want anybody to find out he is looking. The movie is kind of set in two different stories. The first being Bridges down in Mexico with Rachel Ward and the second being him coming back to Los Angeles to deal with Jake Wise. 6/10 Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scenery in this movie is beautiful, and so is Rachel Ward, but it's a drag. It's sort of a remake of "Out of the Past", with no atmosphere and a really embarrassing plot about how corrupt "the system" is. Watch "Tequila Sunrise" or "Out of the Past", instead. The commentary track on the DVD amply illustrates that the director made this mess on purpose, but I don't think that you could say it was deliberate in that I can't see that any careful thought was involved...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible...two hours of my life I'll never get back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would love to sue the people who made this movie to get my time back, but it's too late, I wasted time out of my life on this atrocious movie. To help salvage things I will at least use the experience to warn you nice folks to stay far, far away from this movie. It is as droning and grating and mushy as Phil Collins' theme song, of the same title, for it.I normally like Jeff Bridges, but he was lackluster in this film. Or perhaps it was just the horrible character development? Bridges' and Ward's characters are loathsome. A bratty spoiled woman who is supposed to be "hot" but is horrible looking, even by 80's standards (I saw the movie in '84 in the theater and remembering she was "ugly" to me) and a traitorous quasi-bum who shirks his responsibility for a sick affair with the ugly brat. The movie is about this. James Woods' character is the only sympathetic one at all, and even he is a chump.From what I have read this is based on a "film noir" made in the '40's. I can't tell if they tried to keep it in the "noir" style. I think they just slapped together awful characters and tried to make it '80's chic, like Miami Vice, and they ended up with a bomb. And don't think these characters are loathsome in the "noir" sense. Unlike noir where characters are flawed but interesting, these characters are flawed and incredibly pedestrian, common, ugly people. They made a good looking actor and actress look horrible for this movie, and made them yet MORE unattractive by giving them the most horrible, ugly personalities. Not interesting "bad", but more like common trash "bad", the kind of people who make you cringe when you see signs of their existence. Even the many sex scenes, which are gratuitous in their frequency, are not at all titillating. Skip this movie. If you want a good movie from 1984, see Revenge of the Nerds...at least it's interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but would sit and fast forward it. Does not come near the original film "Out of the Past" from 1947. Attempt to make modern Noir does not work. Its too long and talky. Viewers quickly lose interest in the story, too many threads to follow. The leads dont have the explosive chemistry to set the screen on fire. Jeff Bridges is too sullen and charmless. Hes got a great body but the beard isnt sexy. Hes also got a lame way of holding his beer bottles and seems to love speeding away in his porche. Rachel Ward was one of the hottest stars at the time but just disapeared after this. Shes pretty but doesnt seem to believe in the script. No one does except James Woods who always brings excitement to the films hes in. Nice to see Jane Greer from the original film as well as Richard Widmark.Nice settings in Mexico, otherwise theres no reason to sit thru this dreary thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated, Yuppiness w/ Good Locale Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff Bridges may have physically been in the best shape in his life in 1983/84 when he filmed Taylor Hackford's "Against All Odds", a dated, sometimes beautiful, but yuppyish crime drama starring provocative Brit Rachel Ward, rugged Bridges, and boyish James Woods. Yuppiness is in full display in a myriad of scenes and pervasive throughout the dialog. Who has the most money and toys wins with bad 80s haircuts - I guess that's the theme. The "thriller" aspect is poorly done - with laughable choreographed fight scenes occasionally sprinkled in. By far the best sequences in the movie are the international ones more so for the aged beauty of Mexico nearly 30 years before and with Ward and Bridges in their respective physical primes - like watching a travel plug-in. The script and dialog is clunky though with a bad 80's TV show feel thanks to the trapped music of the time and sometimes poor direction. Might be worth a view for nostalgia and the international scenes and locations. Movie was apparently a remake. Mixed at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Junk Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacques Tourneur directed "Out of the Past" in 1947, one of cinema's premiere film noirs. Taylor Hackford would remake "Out of the Past" in 1987 with "Against All Odds", a terrible neo noir which sees Jeff Bridges playing an injured football player who finds himself searching the Yucatan Peninzula for the daughter of a wealthy businessman.The film's noir plot is old news, it oozes the worst trends of the 1980s (lots of beaches, fancy cars, naked skin, pop music, MTV editing) and ends with a musical climax which tries, blatantly, to repeat the success of "An Officer and a Gentleman's" ending, another film directed by Hackford.Like many directors in the 1980s, Hackfort spent a lot of time creating "tie-in" music for his films, hiring well known musicians to create "signature songs" to help market his flicks. "Against All Odds" was a big hit in the 1980s thanks largely to a cunningly used Phil Collins song, its much played MTV music video functioning as a kind of incessant advertisement for the film."Out of the Past" contains a logistically impressive car chase and a fine performance by Jeff Bridges, but is mostly inept. Bridges would make a number of noirish movies in the 1980s (the best of which is "Cutter's Way"), which would lead to the Coen Brother's casting him in "The Big Lebowski".4/10 ? Worth no viewings.</fullReview>
