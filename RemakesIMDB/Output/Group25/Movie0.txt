		<shortDescription>A classic--maybe the best film noir ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) runs a small gas station in a little town in CA. He's in love with a beautiful girl. But he has a past which is about to catch up with him involving gangster Whit (Kirk Douglas) and evil Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer)...MANY twists and turns happen.The plot is very complicated but this is a prime example of film noir. It's beautifully directed using darkness in almost every shot and has all the ingredients of a good noir--an innocent man (Robert Mitchum) in over his head, a bad guy (Kirk Douglas) and a totally amoral woman (Jane Greer). What makes this stands out (beside the incredible cinematography and direction) is a wonderful script. It's full of some truly incredible lines and delivered dead pan by the cast (as it should be). If any of them had winked at the camera once this would have failed. Mitchum plays it very stone-faced but Douglas is great and Greer is just fascinating as a totally evil, beautiful woman.Basically a must-see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do I love it? Let me count the ways...First, like a few perfect jazz albums, OUT OF THE PAST has a distinctive, coherent sound developed through various moods and tempos and melodies. Robert Mitchum is the lead soloist who dominates the score; the sound of the film is his sound, cool and weary and knowing. Though he doesn't sing in this one, no performance better demonstrates Mitchum's musicality, his sense of rhythm, pace and inflection. He referred to his dialogue as "the lyrics," and treated it that way, delivering his lines behind the beat, the way Sinatra sings. Jane Greer contributes her gorgeous dry contralto and Kirk Douglas adds a light, sneering counterpoint to an inspired group improvisation on the theme of disillusionment.Mitchum is Jeff Markham, alias Jeff Bailey, an ex-private eye who made a big mistake by falling for Kathie (Jane Greer), the gangster's mistress he was hired to track down. Splitting up after he discovers she's a liar and a killer, he hides out in a small town, taking up with a nice girl named Ann, knowing it's just a matter of time before the past catches up with him. His narration and dialogue carry the film along on a laid-back high, like a series of perfect smoke rings. He sums up his philosophy of life in a casino when Kathie asks, "Is there a way to win?" and he answers, "There's a way to lose more slowly." When she says she's sorry the man she shot didn't die, he murmurs dreamily, "Give him time." His enveloping pessimism is strangely elated; Jeff knows the score and savors it like some private hipster knowledge. "She can't be all bad. No one is," Jeff's nice girlfriend says of Kathie, but he returns, "She comes closest."Kathie Moffat is the greatest of all femmes fatales, because she's the least caricatured. She's not a scheming black widow, just a totally selfish, cowardly woman who feels no remorse for anything she does, and who happens to be beautiful and alluring enough that we can believe any man, even a smart and tough one, would fall for her. Jeff and Kathie's romance is genuinely rhapsodic, nothing like the usual mating of temptress and chump; they're both so sexy and smart and wised-up, always getting the joke together. The disillusionment wouldn't be so compelling if the illusion weren't so lovely. When Kathie shoots Jeff's partner, Mitchum?in a reaction shot lasting all of two seconds?shows Jeff realizing, and instantaneously coming to terms with, the fact that the best thing that ever happened to him is also the worst thing that ever happened to him. He looks simultaneously shocked to the core, and as though he'd expected it all along.Jeff Bailey is a paradox: you'd think nobody could put anything over on this guy, yet he acts like a sucker; he exemplifies both cynical pride and romantic blindness. Does he know what he's getting into and deliberately delude himself? Is he drawn to Kathie because she can rouse him from his torpor of indifference, because he can only really care about his life when he's in danger of losing it? You're never sure, but Mitchum knows how to hold your interest without explaining himself. His essential "Mitchumness" lies in hidden depths, those hints of melancholy, amusement and cold violence that seep through his impassive surface, the suggestions of menace and compassion and old wounds. He gives the movie a core of mystery that's eternally captivating. Like great American popular music, it's sublime hokum, so well-crafted that it stays eternally fresh and means more to you the more you hear it.Here is a world in which every throwaway gesture?ordering a cup of coffee, checking a briefcase?has drop-dead style, every word spoken is a wisecrack or a line of pulp poetry. Even minor characters and incidental scenes are rich and unforgettable: Theresa Harris as Eunice the maid in her fabulous Billie Holiday hat in the Harlem nightclub; the check-room clerk at the bus station, witness to who knows how many noir entanglements, with his hollow-man motto: "I always say everyone's right"; Joe Stefanos's black overcoat appearing like an ink-spot in the clean white town; the signs the mute Kid flashes to Jeff by the glittering lake, as the sky clouds over?The movie floats from place to place, blending real landscapes and studio sets, expressionistic stairwells and Ansel Adams mountains. The episodes run together fluid and compulsive as a dream. Sometimes there's nothing but music and movement: Jeff prowling cat-like around Meta Carson's apartment while boogie-woogie piano plays in the next room. The cinematography is distractingly gorgeous, drifting into glistening abstract patterns of black and white, like the web of bare tree-branches projected onto the bodies of Jeff and Ann at their last meeting. A seamless blend of romance and cynicism, drama and humor, OUT OF THE PAST is not only a perfect Hollywood studio product, it's a definitive movie experience. It's supersaturated, yet it never feels overworked, never tries too hard. It just seems to happen, almost by casual serendipity; the wit and elegance and glamour are so unforced and alive. You succumb to it instantly and helplessly as Jeff succumbs to Kathie's magic. The spell breaks for him, but not for us. Disenchantment may be the theme of OUT OF THE PAST, but the movie itself is a source of perennial wonder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jacques Tourneur will probably be remembered best for this film, even though he had an extensive career in Hollywood. Working with Daniel Mainwaring, the author of the novel in which this movie is based, he created one of the best pictures of this genre, one that will be a perennial favorite. Mr. Tourneur and his cinematographer, the brilliant Nicholas Musuraca, made a stunning looking film that looks as good today, as when it was originally released.If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading now.Jeff Bailey has reinvented himself as the owner of a gas station in California. His past comes to haunt him at the beginning of the movie. Jeff has found peace and love in the small town where he has taken refuge. He can change his identity, but he can't hide from the people that want to see him dead.We watch in the beginning how Jeff is sent away by Whit Sterling to look for the disappearing Kathie Moffat, who has stolen forty thousand dollars and gone hiding. Jeff finds her in Acapulco. Kathie gives a bad name to any other dames in the movies of this genre. She is totally ruthless; she will do anything to double cross Whit as well as have Jeff do whatever she wants.Comparisons have been made between "The Maltese Falcon" and "Out of the Past". Both have plots that are twisted; when we feel we know everything, there is a new twist to the story. We are constantly misled into thinking one way, when in reality, something else has happened.This is a film that combines all the elements of the classic film noir and juxtaposes it against the serene surroundings of where Jeff is now living. Black and white photography was used to great advantage in the movie. It has a style that makes it one of a kind. The music by Roy Webb plays neatly in the background without interrupting the action.The acting is first rate. Mr. Tourneur got a brilliant performance from Robert Mitchum. His Jeff, is the epitome of coolness. It's hard to understand the mentality of American cinema of the times not paying Mr. Mitchum his due. He was a much better actor than he was given credit for. His presence looms large in this movie and it's a tribute to him that he makes his character dominate the movie.Jane Greer was also excellent in her take of Kathie Moffat. She is pure evil, a sensuous woman who will do anything to get her own way. When we see her in Acapulco she is a seductress that no man can resist. She leads Jeff on by the sheer power of the desire he feels for her. Ms. Greer was not a beauty, by Hollywood standard, but yet, she makes an incredible contribution to the movie. Her textured performance is exquisite in its economy. We all see right through her, yet, she takes us for an incredible ride, up to the end of the picture.The others in the cast do an excellent job. A young and dashing Kirk Douglas is perfect as the dubious Whit. He shows such a magnetism, even then, at the start of his career in movies. Rhonda Fleming had a small role and she makes most of it. Also Virginia Huston, as Ann, makes a great contribution to the film.The film, ultimately, is a tribute to the talent of the director. This is Mr. Tourneur's best movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just one of the greatest noirs ? one of the greatest movies, period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one of the most emotionally shaded, unforgettable instalments of the noir cycle, Jacques Tourneur's Out Of The Past opens deceptively ? not in the neon-lit tenderloin of a big city some rainy night but up in the thin, cool air of the High Sierras, in a little town whose Main and only street boasts an open-kitchen beanery on one side and a gas station on the other. The sign on the station tells that it belongs to Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum), and when a stranger drops into the diner looking for his old pal Bailey, the waitress remarks `Small world.' `Or big sign,' the out-of-towner cryptically replies. Of course it's not a casual call to catch up on times past, because Mitchum has a past, a heavy one that's about to catch up with him, a past that he lived under another name. The visitor to the mountains is an emissary from silky operator Kirk Douglas, for whom Mitchum, with his partner in the private-eye racket Steve Brodie, has worked before, with fateful results. Mitchum senses that his particular jig may be up, and, before answering his summons from Douglas to meet him at Lake Tahoe, tells his story, in flashback, to his girl (Virgina Huston).A woman (Jane Greer) had shot Douglas and absconded with his $40,000. Douglas engaged Mitchum to play bounty-hunter, to track her down and bring her and the loot back. His search led him to Mexico and a little bar called La Mar Azul, where she appeared `out of the sunlight,' elusive but radiant, and stole his heart. A few days later she reappeared, this time `out of the moonlight,' and under that subtropical moon they walked on the beach and then to her cozy bungalow, where a sudden deluge drenched them to the skin and blew open the door to their passion. Here, Tourneur establishes himself as the Great Romantic of the noir cycle ? it's a charged and rapturous idyll. But even illicit honeymoons must end. Greer and Mitchum came back to the States, lying low in the North Beach district of San Francisco, until the industrious Brodie, in Douglas' pocket, spotted them at a racetrack. They lay even lower, thinking they've finally eluded him, but he turned up one night at their mountain cabin, where Greer coldly shot him dead. Even more startled than Brodie was Mitchum, who saw Greer in a new light that neither sun nor moon provided ? with the wrenching realization that she wasn't the innocent victim of bad men and worse circumstances that she'd sold herself to him as. She clinched the point by high-tailing off, leaving him to dispose of the body (and forgetfully leaving her bankbook, showing a deposit of the $40-grand that she'd lied about never taking). So much for the past; the present now beckons, as does Douglas. He claims to harbor no ill will for Mitchum. And why should he? As Mitchum joins him for breakfast on the terrace, Greer is there, too, eating grapefruit as though nothing had happened. The past holds no claims on her; she lives the for next advantage the future can offer. But Douglas has a job for Mitchum, involving a shady lawyer and some compromising papers back in San Francisco.Here the movie takes its most audacious turn (Daniel Mainwaring wrote the script from his novel Build My Gallows High ? as Geoffrey Homes ? and James M. Cain and Frank Fenton had their hands in it as well). Right in the middle of Out Of The Past we embark on something close to a movie-within-a-movie, a mini-Maltese Falcon, with a new set of characters and even a new femme fatale (Rhonda Fleming). The conventional look of film noir ? taxicabs and elevators, penthouse apartments at night with the Coit Tower looming in the distance ? finally gets full rein. But then into this murky scheme ? a frame-up, really ? emerges Greer, this time out of pitch darkness. The plots within plots begin to converge....Out Of The Past was a pivotal picture for its three principals. It was only Douglas' second film, but he started big ? in a supporting role but a meaty one, as in his debut the previous year in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (they're two of the best roles he would ever take). Mitchum had spent years in the galleys but finally got a leading role that let him unleash his distinctive persona ? the fearless and nimble intelligence behind the nonchalant eyes, the world-weary retorts mumbled from behind the cigarette drooping from his lip (it's Mitchum's own appropriation of what Humphrey Bogart had started). The best of his many great lines he aims at Greer, calling her a `leaf that the wind blows from gutter to gutter.' And Greer, who made far fewer movies than her acting (graceful and natural) and her looks (like a less literal Jayne Meadows) would augur, takes her most emblematic credit and plays it to the hilt. Hers is perhaps the slowest transformation in the noir cycle and the most breathtakingly brutal. When, for her final scene, she shows up in a snood, it's clear that, for Mitchum, good times are no longer in store.The talent that went into Out Of The Past is manifold. Both director of photography Nicholas Musuraca and Roy Webb, who wrote the responsive score, were old comrades of Tourneur from his earlier days in Val Lewton's B-movie unit at RKO. The credentials for the screenplay, as above, were impeccable, resulting in chiseled, quotable dialogue, right down to Paul Valentine (as one of Douglas' strong-arms) advising Greer, about to place a long-distance call, that `those dames listen in.' But the most prestigious palm must go to Tourneur. He had less of a distinctive style to him ? less of a `look,' less of a formula ? than most of the top-flight noir directors; he was a chameleon, who used his talents less to make his own statement as to bring out the best in the scripts he was given. He was born in France and he died in France, but when in Hollywood he brought neither technical innovation nor rigorous theory to his work. Rather he looked for the human element that underlies and informs art ? and he relished its complexity. (The movie, for instance, opens and closes on Dickie Moore, as a teenaged deaf mute in Mitchum's employ, and whose function in the story is far from a merely sentimental fillip.) Tourneur took film noir as close to tragic poetry as it would ever come, and Out Of The Past, his masterwork, raised the standards of the noir cycle as far as they would ever go. It's not just one of the greatest noirs, it's one of the greatest movies, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beloved film classic should be seen by more people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrific exotic adventure/melodrama with gothic undertones. Douglas follows Mitchum following Greer to Mexico; murder and robbery follow everywhere femme fatale Greer goes. She's excellent; vulnerable eyes revealing the fear motivating her totally irrational, greedy actions. She and Mitchum are made for each other (it's a shame that this and the less exciting "The Big Steal" are their only films together as far as I know, although Greer did make a good pairing with the comparably skilled Richard Widmark in "Run for the Sun"). Every step of their twisted journey feels inevitable, painful, and joyous, like a death-row inmate smoking his last cigarette. Mitchum is at his best here as the patsy for Greer and Doublas' schemes, who plays along as if he knows better but is truly seeking absolution from death.One of the best films ever made by Hollywood, all the more amazing considering it was made almost on the fly (what people today call a "film noir" but what the producers though of as a "B" movie). Tourneur is one of the best low budget directors in the business; fans of good film will seek out his movies, which cover all the different genres of film. His father was one of the creators of film style, and he has a striking sense of visual composition himself, which he puts to excellent use in this, possibly his best film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of best 40's film noir - and where is it ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tremendously stylish, brilliantly scripted and wonderfully directed noir classic about a man who cannot escape from his past. Rarely does the genre get away from the grimy city streets with it's dark corridors and alleyways only partially lit by un-realistic streams of bright light. In this film we not only see the underworld gangs, the bars and floozies, the heavies and the fatales, but we also see the bright beautiful countryside, the streams and the rocks - a complete otherworld.Mitchum is superb as the man who has escaped the city to live a new life in the country only to be dragged back by powerful forces. This broadening of the cinematic landscape makes the movie more affecting than your assorted Bogarts' &amp; Ladds'. As with 'I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang' I feel much more sympathy for the lead actor who gets dragged back into the bear pit to wrestle for his life and soul.'Out of the Past' also has some of the finest dialogue and narration I have ever heard, probably matched only by 'The Maltese Falcon'. 'She was like an autumn leaf blowing from gutter to gutter', is one gem that sticks in my mind.The mood of the film is pleasantly melancholic and the portrayal of the fatale figure (Jane Greer) is particularly sympathetic. In most noir movies the male perspective of the double-crossing woman predominates (not that there's anything wrong with that, it's usually very funny). Here however, whilst Greer presents one of the blackest of women you at least know why she does what she does and can sympathise with her plight. She is trapped too.Tourneur, tragically made few films but was a master at getting messages deep into your psyche, into your soul. 'Cat People 'and 'I Walked With a Zombie' both had otherworlds where the demons lived. We all have otherworlds too, places we'd rather not go very often, but as with Mitchum we are sometimes confronted with those demons and have to do battle once again. When I go next I hope to be wearing my hat at an exquisite angle and have my trench coat well belted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is This NotThe Best Noir?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was Siodmax' "The Killers" in 1946! There was Huston's "The Asphalt Jungle" in 1950 and in between was RKO's OUT OF THE PAST in 1947. Together these three films represent the very best film noirs that ever was to come out of Hollywood or ever would again. Of the three however OUT OF THE PAST arguably stands a toe in front of the others as the all time favourite. Why is this? Perhaps it's because of its meatier narrative and story line with its palpable unrelenting dramatic thrust together with its extraordinary camera setups and its remarkable use of light and shadow or perhaps because of its faultless screenplay matched in interpretation by inspired casting. No matter what the reason OUT OF THE PAST simply manages to stand out as the most sublime and mesmerizing thriller ever made. Produced for RKO by Warren Duff it was splendidly written for the screen by Geoffrey Holmes which derived from his novel "Build My Gallows High" (the picture's title in England). Stunningly photographed in Black &amp; White by Nicholas Musuraca it was arrestingly scored by Roy Webb (The best thing he ever did) and the picture was directed with a positive flair by Jacques Tourneur.Jeff Markham, alias Jeff Bailey, (Robert Mitchum) a man with a past ekes out a living running a filling station outside Bakersfield. One day out of the blue - and out of Jeff's past - arrives Joe Stafanos (Paul Valentine) the strong-arm henchman of shady businessman Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas). He's here with a message for Jeff that Whit wants to see him again. Some time ago Jeff was a private eye and Whit had engaged him to go to Mexico and hunt down his girlfriend Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who had absconded with $40,000. In flashback we see Jeff finding her but unwittingly the vulnerable Jeff falls in love with her and they go on the run together. But not for long, Whit sends Jeff's estranged detective partner Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie) to find them both but when he does Kathie shoots and kills him and disappears leaving Jeff to return to the states alone. He gives up the detective business and buries himself in Bakersfield running a gas station. Now Whit has located him and wants to see him. But it's only a ruse to have Jeff framed for Fisher's murder in retaliation for his disloyalty. Jeff goes anyhow to meet Whit at his mansion on Lake Tahoe and is astonished to find Kathie there ("Kathie's back in the fold again" declares a weaselly Whit). Later Kathie gets Stafanos to kill Jeff who fails in the attempt. Then she double crosses Whit and kills him. And the picture ends with Kathie making up to Jeff and wanting him to go away with her and start over again where they had left off in Mexico. Jeff pretends to agree but unbeknown to her he calls the police who set up a roadblock in which tragically they both perish. Jeff Bailey had finally gotten even with the woman who had lied, cheated, murdered and double crossed just about everyone for her own devious ends but in doing so he paid the ultimate price.Performances are superb throughout. Here the dozy eyed Mitchum - in his first starring role - solidifies his playing of the private eye. But he also shows he could cut a wholly acceptable romantic lead helped along by his mellifluous and soft voiced atmospheric narration. One scene in particular is very effective where he is waiting for her on the beach at night and when she arrives Mitchum's voice is heard gently on the soundtrack ...."Then she'd come along.....just like school was out and everything else was just a stone by the sea". The wonderful Jane Greer is the quintessential femme fatale. Her gentle saintly beauty belying her treacherous, underhanded and calculating evil. And a young Kirk Douglas - here just feeling his way in movies - is fine as the courtly but odious villain. Adding greatly to the whole thing is the marvellous score by RKO resident composer Roy Webb which features a memorable and lingering main cue that becomes a tender love theme for the love scenes and is transformed into an exciting big band jazz number for the black nightclub sequence.OUT OF THE PAST is the archetypal film noir! An outstanding document of what Hollywood could achieve in their golden past. Unfortunately they now seem to have taken a wrong turn off that road that so often led to greatness.Classic Mitchum adage from OUT OF THE PAST............... "If anyone's gonna to die baby......I'm gonna die last".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent example of film noir at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full of atmosphere and heat, "Out of the Past" is a classic film noir, directed by a master, Jacques Tourneur. Although considered only an above-average B movie at the time of release, it's doubtful anyone thinks of it that way today, as it is superior to many "A" films. With a top-notch cast and a deceptively easy pace that belies the tension and danger underneath, "Out of the Past" makes for an intriguing, absorbing film.Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer make a great pair - both are sultry, sexy, hard to read, and gorgeous. I found Greer's performance quite interesting. In the beginning, she appears quite warm, frightened, and sincere, as opposed to, say, Lizabeth Scott in "Dead Reckoning." When she turns hardboiled, it's subtle, with only a change in her eyes and voice, when she comments that Fisher isn't going to say anything to anybody. I love the way Mitchum sizes up women. He absolutely smolders, and 40 years later, in "The Winds of War," he was still smoldering.Kirk Douglas is appropriately edgy in his supporting role as Whit. Rhonda Fleming has a small role, but no one that incredibly beautiful was going to go unnoticed for long.What a wonderful film, what a perfect example of a genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly touching film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely stylish film noir with a balanced, touching performance by Robert Mitchum. I was not expecting to be as moved by this film as I ultimately was. It has the snappy banter that one would expect of a film from the 40s, but the dialogue transcends mere wit and left me more than a little emotional. Mitchum is remarkably understated and cool, making his self-destructive behavior all the more entrancing. Kirk Douglas also adds a really light touch to his role, keeping his slick gangster more genuine than one might expect. I would have to say that while it is in many ways a typical film noir (and a fine example of the style), I have never seen anything quite like it. There are locations you would never expect to see in a film noir and a surprising bittersweet ending. Fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scope of Her Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the Past came at a time for Robert Mitchum after one of the worst films in his career, Desire Me which he did on a loan out to MGM. He must have been grateful to get back to RKO studios and to do one of the best noir films ever done.Mitchum plays the luckless Jeff Bailey, private eye who has the ill fortune to fall under the feminine charms of Jane Greer after gambler/racketeer Kirk Douglas hires him to find her and $40,000.00 she stole from him after shooting him. Mitchum trails her to Mexico, but when he meets her, let's just say he easily sees why Kirk Douglas wants her back so bad. It's one piece of intrigue after another at this point until there's tragedy all around.This was Kirk Douglas's second picture and he showed his range as a player after playing a weakling in his debut film, The Strange Loves of Martha Ivers. Douglas and Mitchum got good notices, but this film really belongs to Jane Greer. The sheer scope of this woman's evil will leave you gasping. Out of the Past gave Jane Greer her career role and she made the most of it. Two of post World War II Hollywood's biggest leading men and several others in tow. It's breathtaking when you think of it.Out of the Past is a real downer of a film, but mesmerizing as a study of how a man can get hooked on feminine charms applied right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of the Past is one of the best film noir of all time. It's use of story line and lighting alone makes this film a winner. Robert Mitchum is the perfect detective character. Like a superhero, he gains his power from the city and is weak to his enemies when in the country. Great use of symbolisim throughout the film. When Mitchum falls for Moffat, we see the spider woman at work as she catches him in her spider web. (more like a fishing net on the beach) A terrific ending and beautiful camera work.

		<shortDescription>Definitive Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film established the Robert Mitchum screen persona. In it he established the easy going laconic style that was to become his trademark. His Jeff Bailey is the epitome of the 1940s tragic hero. The story is told in flashback, a Film Noir tradition. Bailey owns a gas station in a small California town. But he is a man with a past, a past that comes back to haunt him(as in Hemingway's "The Killers")Bailey tells us that he was a detective in his previous life. He was hired by a gambler to find a girl who had stolen $40,000 from him. Bailey found the girl and the money , but love got in the way.To reveal anymore of this convoluted plot would ruin it for those who have not had the pleasure of not seeing this masterpiece. In addition to Mitchum, the rest of the cast excels as well. Jane Greer is the perfect Femme Fatal. Kirk Douglas is mean and sadistic as the gambler. Rhonda Fleming, Virginia Huston, Steve Brodie and Paul Valentine provide excellent support.(Greer and Valentine were in the 1985 remake "Against the Odds".Jacques Tourneur one of the great Noir directors does a fine job with Daniel Mainwaring's story and script(using the pseudonym Geoffery Homes) and the Roy Webb music is the perfect compliment.A lot of young talent went into the making of this classic. Many of the people involved went on to bigger and better things. It is easy to understand why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone quite rightly mentions the great work of the main cast of this film. And they are all great. But to me the cherry in the ensemble is Dickie Moore's deaf mute character. For whatever reason "the Kid" has this deep, unquestioning loyalty to Jeff. And in spite of his handicap, he definitely has Jeff's back. I've got spoiler on this comment because I'm mentioning the fly-fishing moment. That is one of my favorite scenes of all time. The way Moore plays it, he just turns into a bird dog, his focus so complete he's a statue. And zip, so long pal. Of course you got to love the end. The Kid can tell the truth about Jeff, or lie for the girl's happiness. And this quiet little character makes the tough classy decision. Then the goodbye wave. No lip pursing, or beetling of sad brow. Moore plays it perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a small town in California, the mysterious Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) owns a small gas station and is in love with the local Ann (Virginia Huston). When a stranger just arrived in town meets him, Jeff is ordered to travel to meet the powerful criminal Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas). Before traveling, Jeff calls Ann and tells her the story of his life, when he was a private eyes hired by Whit for US$ 5,000.00 to find his former mistress Kathie (Jane Greer) that had shot Whit and stolen US$ 40,000.00. The competent Jeff finds Kathie in Acapulco, but she tells that she had not taken Whit's money and they fall in love for each other and escape from Whit. When the former partner of Jeff, Fisher (Steve Brodie), finds the couple living in an isolated cabin, Kathie kills him and Jeff buries his corpse. Jeff accidentally finds the receipt of deposit of the amount in Kathie's purse and leaves her forever. When Jeff meets Whit, he surprisingly finds Kathie living with him; Whit asks Jeff one last job to get even and release Jeff from his debt. But Jeff finds that Whit is actually framing him."Out of the Past" is an excellent film-noir, with a melancholic story and a magnificent and amoral female fatal. The direction of Jacques Tourneur is outstanding and the cinematography is very beautiful. Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer have top-notch performances, showing great chemistry. However, the fantastic screenplay is certainly the best in this movie, disclosing a complex plot with the use of flashback and great lines. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Fuga do Passado" ("Escape from the Past")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly brilliant movie which is a strong contender for the greatest film-noir ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Jacques Tourneur's horror movies ('Cat People', 'Night Of The Demon', 'I Walked With A Zombie',etc.) for many years, but for some reason I hadn't seen 'Out Of The Past' until very recently. Regarded by many noir buffs as one of the very best examples of the genre, if not THE best, it knocked my socks off! Some movies are so good that you almost can't believe they exist. 'Vertigo', 'Rashomon', 'Taxi Driver', 'Cool Hand Luke', 'The Wild Bunch', 'The Wages Of Fear', these are some titles that immediately spring to mind. Your jaw just drops in amazement, and repeated viewing reveal more layers and levels of enjoyment. 'Out Of The Past' now joins that group of very special movies for me. Tourneur's horror classics are brilliant works, but this movie surpasses them all to me. Everything about this movie is superb. The direction, photography, script (which crime legend James M. Cain of 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' and 'Double Indemnity' fame contributed to anonymously), and the actors. The cast are all good, but Robert Mitchum steals the show with a first rate performance, second only in my opinion to his unforgettable role in the extraordinary 'Night Of The Hunter'. The beautiful Jane Greer is also excellent, as is Kirk Douglas. If you want to get into film-noir and understand just how influential it was on subsequent movies, make 'Out Of The Past' your first stop. It is a masterpiece, pure and simple. I know this movie will be in my life for a very long time, and that gives me a lot of satisfaction. 'Out Of The Past' comes with my highest recommendation. I can't put into words just how great this movie is, so just watch it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Few Are As Excellent As This One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Out Of The Past" is a film that surpassed all my expectations. Few films have satisfied me as much as this. Believable characters with a great story makes this and other films like it good, but what separates this from all other 'Film-Noir', detective stories is it's dramatic mood. This is the only film I've ever seen where I know what's likely to happen yet somehow I find myself deeper and deeper in it's story. I find myself amidst all of the danger, disappointments and betrayals and still wanting more. No other movie will probably surpass this one's greatness (though some may be as great). Eerie yet provocative, "Out Of The Past" is handled with seemingly great care by it's director, Jacques Tourneur. From the great camera shots of the trees in the forest location to the shots of San Francisco full of shadows at night, I was already impressed. Acting by Robert Mitchum, Kirk Douglas, and every one of the cast only cemented the mood that made this movie so easily watchable. I consider this one of my favorites and one of the best movies I'll ever see in my lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O innocent victims of Cupid, Remember this terse little verse: To let a fool kiss you is stupid, To let a kiss fool you is worse.Fine photography here by Musuraca. If you want a splendid example of "low key lighting" check out the scene in which Greer and Mitchum have their first serious conversation at night on the Acapulco beach, her face in shadow, but still her expressions discernible, her hair backlighted and its curls edged with a kind of mellow glow. His face more sharply defined, starkly creased with black and highlights. The rest of the film lives up to that scene, although it is notably lacking in day-lit shots of wide-open spaces. (There's really only one, in a death scene that takes place on a tumultuous river.) Tourneur's direction is efficient. He moves the figures around evocatively, from Tahoe to San Francisco to Los Angeles to small towns in the Sierras. There are two "sex scenes" that he has to deal with. In the first, which occurs after the beach conversation, there is a conventional cut from a kiss to the surf rolling onto the sand. But in the second, when the lovers run into "her place" for the first time, they are wet from the rain. Mitchum dries her hair by rubbing it harshly then tosses the towel onto the "one light burning in the place," the lamp tumbles to the floor, the door is blown open by the wind, and there is a cut to the torrential downpour on the tropical plants outside. A tour de force of symbolic imagery. Did he laugh while planning it?And that, I fear, is about it for me. I know it's considered a classic example of film noir, and it makes me wonder about why film noir is so highly regarded. Greer, of course, is a beautiful woman, which is nice, and as competent a performer as Mitchum. Except that Mitchum couldn't be described as beautiful. The icons are here -- trench coat, speeding cars, florid dialog, short-barreled black revolvers, hotels in the big city, lots of makeup, fedora hats, neon signs. Kirk Douglas is the most interesting actor. He oozes more insincerity than anyone else in the film, which is saying a lot since absolutely nobody is totally believable.But I've seen this movie about three times over the course of the past decade and simply can't get with it. Mitchum seems tough but dumb. Nobody else is sympathetic. The plot line is twisted, hard to follow, and equally hard to believe. I found myself hoping Mitchum would wind up with the "nice girl" at the end, but didn't really care much. It wasn't really tragic when Mitchum and Greer are speeding along the dark road, Greer sees the roadblock, sneers "You dirty stinking rat," and plugs him during the struggle. I kept wondering while watching it, why I found myself comparing it to "The Maltese Falcon" and finding it wanting. I couldn't figure it out, really. It seemed disjointed and dull. That's not to say it's trash. There is, after all, the photography and the direction, plus Douglas at his phoniest, in only his second movie. And it's also worth seeing for historical reasons. Everybody says it's a classic example of film noir, so see it and make your own judgment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly The Greatest Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just had the luck to watch this movie on the big screen and I can't forget it.Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past may just be the greatest film noir ever made. It looks like any other, but, to paraphrase Bogart, only more so: Nicholas Musuraca's black-and-white cinematography is brighter and darker than any film noir's; Robert Mitchum's character, fugitive detective Jeff Bailley is more sarcastic and fatalistic than ten Sam Spades. Jane Greer plays Kathie Moffat, an unrepentant, cold-blooded femme fatale whose alliances change as quickly as the weather. Kirk Douglas is a soft-voiced, mild-mannered villain with a Machievellian mind and Paul Valentine plays the coolest henchman ever. And then there's the unforgettable ending, which represents the essence of the genre.The movie starts simply but develops a Byzantine plot full of twists and turns and the most quotable dialogue ever. Jeff Bailey is a gas-pumper whose shady past catches up with him when Joe Stefanos comes by. Bailey is trying to lay low and live a good life, but there is no peace or redemption in this movie, and soon he's caught in a web of deceit and murder. Saying more is unnecessary.What really matters is the dialogue, the back-and-forth witty, sarcastic quips, the expressive acting from the perfect cast, the cinematography and the pervasive atmosphere of doom. Although the viewer will be laughing from start to finish, this is no funny movie. The movie is dark, amazingly dark for its time, and no character has illusions about themselves: they're killers, blackmailers and thieves. Robert Mitchum's line, "Baby, I don't care", sums up this movie perfectly. It's this remorselessness that makes this movie so modern and an exciting film experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Noir ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like shoving films into a genre, mainly because a good film won't fit neatly into any one category. On the other hand, such genre groups are handy for general discussion and making "best of" lists, and so here I am sticking films in categories despite myself.That said, there's not much film noir that stands up to OUT OF THE PAST. THE THIRD MAN, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS and SUNSET BLVD. come quickly to mind. TOUCH OF EVIL, THE BIG SLEEP and THE SET-UP (even though it's a boxing movie) as well. It's a short list, and OOTP is right up there for me.One reason is a superior plot thread. I actually found myself thinking "where is this going?" instead of "oh, please don't go there". Another reason is Robert Mitchum's outstanding performance. But really, there's not much to criticize here.As it's not the first title coming to mind when one usually mentions the genre, I'll have to put the overly used phrase "don't miss this" in here, as any fan of film noir - or simply good movies - should make sure to see it. Unless you're one of those stuck on color film and think L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is noir, you're bound to like it.</fullReview>

However, I was very happy that Robert Mitchum,(Jeff Bailey),"Pokten",'95, took this part and was outstanding through out the entire picture. The film was very well directed by a great director and Kirk Douglas (Whit Sterling,"Diamonds",'99, was just starting out as a film actor with his second role on the big Silver Screen, as a slippery evil mobster who stopped at nothing to make a buck! Rhonda Fleming,(Meta Carson),"Waiting for the Wind", played a very foxy lady and had all her charming men hanging by a shoe string. Jeff Bailey tries to run away from the past and settle down in a nice country town where he pumps gas and has as very faithful young man who is deaf and helps Jeff in every way possible.

		<shortDescription>There Was A Better Mitchum-Greer Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Try as I might, I could never get this film noir starring Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer to be as good to me as it's reputation. This film is often mentioned as one of the best of the film noir genre, but I never found it so. The poster is far better. In fact, if you want to see a more interesting film noir with Mitchum and Greer, then watch "The Big Steal."Nonetheless, I think the confusing story with its convoluted storyline brings it down. Unlike most noirs than occur in a big city, this one involves the countryside from San Francisco to Acapulco. Kirk Douglas doesn't have a big role in here but he makes his presence felt. He does a good job of being both menacing and personable at the same time.It also was nice to see this on a good DVD transfer as I was never able to find a good VHS of this movie. It does make the viewing experience a lot better....but I'm still looking for more with this film. I'll say what most "crtiics" are afraid to admit: it's overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a sizzler! You don't get more noirish than this. No matter how many times I see it, it just gets better and better, like burgundy. Jane Greer's performance is one of the most subtle and sophisticated portrayals of a corrupt female ever filmed. The way she alternates between domination and whimpering submission in the twinkling of an eye, over and over again, like a dog that fawns before it can be beaten, then snarls and snaps, then fawns again, her innate compulsion to lie and conceal, her ruthlessness, her weakness, her lack of hesitation to kill, her need to steal, her passion, her lust, her self-contempt intimately interlaced with an obscene self-love, is all simply spectacular. In this brilliant story and script by Daniel Mainwaring, she seems to replicate her weird relationship with Howard Hughes by being the moll of smooth gangster Kirk Douglas, who at 31 was in only his second film role and pulls it off wonderfully by seeming much older. The hero is Robert Mitchum, he of the gliding hipster walk and shoulders as broad as a bus, who looks down at Greer with alternating infatuation and horror, a helpless victim of her irresistible allure, but also adept at saving himself from danger time after time, and not hesitant at telling her to get lost. (However, no man can really tell Jane Greer to get lost, because who can resist her?) The direction by Jacques Tourneur surpasses even his usual excellence. Dickie Moore adds a superb and haunting touch of strangeness as a deaf-mute devoted to Mitchum. Rhonda Fleming, in only her fifth credited screen role, puts plenty of her own glamour about, and isn't leaving the field wholly to Greer. The script has lots of terrific one-liners, which are highly amusing, if occasionally corny. There are plenty of such opportunities to laugh out loud. Sometimes the drollery is exaggerated on purpose, such as when Rhonda Fleming says to Mitchum at her first meeting: 'Do you always leave your fingerprints all over a girl's shoulder? Not that I'm complaining, mind you. You have big strong hands.' But Mitchum has seen gals like Rhonda before, and isn't falling for any of that stuff. This film isn't really about the story, it's about the people and the atmosphere. Who cares who shoots whom, who falls off a cliff into a river, who steals whose documents, who gets the dough or doesn't get the dough. That's all beside the point. What matters is the gallery of accentuated types being portrayed in this fantasy tale by these actors who set the cinema on fire, and who are intensely glowing inside like charcoal on a barbecue grill: somebody is going to get burnt. That's the danger and excitement of real cinema noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeff Bailey (in an early starring role by Robert Mitchum) is a man hiding under an assumed name and trying to start a new and quiet life. There is something in his past - a woman and a betrayal that he ran away from. But he is a courageous man who when confronted with the past does try to do his best to come clean.Whit Sterling (a charmingly scruple-less Kirk Douglas) has been double-crossed by Jeff in the past but has the gall to call him up for another favour in order to clear the past.Kathie Moffat is a selfish woman who both man love(d) and who can double cross anybody. Jeff puts it best "you're like a leaf that the wind blows from one gutter to another".Whether for noir fans or for fans of 40's Hollywood movies, Out of the Past is required viewing. There are a number of factors that go into making this a perfect movie. The most striking is the dialogue. There are countless quotable lines. Less than half of them have made it onto IMDb. The plot is very intricate and yet all the characters are developed fully. The entire cast is uniformly excellent and believable. The direction by Jacques Tourneur is just as good and atmospheric as in his horror classic Cat People. There are several moments that will have your heartbeat racing and you are constantly amazed at the witty dialogue.My favourite scene was when Jeff has breakfast with Whit at Lake Tahoe. Kirk deserved an Oscar just for that 5 minute scene alone - he is so cool and shameless. For me this is very high on the list of all time great movies! Needs to be seen several times.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profound and Classy Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacques Tourneur's consummate noir magnum opus 'Out of the Past' essentially follows the same premise as Siodmak's 'Criss Cross,' both depicting the downfall and demise of a fine man due to corruption by a callous femme fatale. Yet 'Out of the Past' remains clearly superior, with an intense profundity the later picture can only dream of. This is primarily due to its brilliantly intricate plotting, taut writing and, above all, thorough character development. Whereas all we learn about Steve Thomson is that he is a love-struck, irrational dope, prone to puzzling, almost martyr-like decisions, his equivalent here, Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum, in what is arguably his most excellent performance), becomes an almost instant identification figure for the audience, capable of following his well-defined ark from a composed, professional detective to a romantic hero, to a deeply cynical, perpetually wounded and toughened anti-hero ? all without ever loosing his cool.*** SPOILER WARNING ***Unlike Thompson, Bailey remains one step ahead of his antagonists throughout most of the story, utterly seeing through the frame-up he is forced into and just about successfully playing all sides against each other. Though he is still tragically obsessed with the femme fatale Kathie Moffett (Jane Greer), he never trusts her again after the first betrayal, instead moving on and consummating a new liaison with the pure and virtuous Ann Miller (beautiful Virginia Huston), his apparently only chance of salvation. Jeff's tranquil existence with Ann is disturbed, however, when he is tracked down by Joe Stephanos (Paul Valentine), the unctuous accomplice of gangster Whit Sterling (hunky Kirk Douglas), who wants him to perform one last job.In the following conversation with Ann, Jeff decides to finally shed some light on his mysterious past. A heavily narrated flashback ensues, during which Jeff is hired by Whit to track down Kathie, his deceitful mistress. According to Whit, she shot him and stole $40,000 of his money, but all he really wants is for her to come back to him. When Jeff tracks her down in Mexico City, it becomes clear why: Kathie is an irresistible stunner. Naturally he falls hopelessly in love, protects her from Whit, and later, when she cold-bloodedly shoots one of Whit's goons, falls out of love (moreover, it turns out she deceived him about the money). He buries the goon's body and goes into hiding in a small Californian town, where he meets Ann. Thus ends the flashback.Now it turns out that Kathie has rejoined Whit, who blackmails Jeff into recovering some incriminating tax reports, the film's McGuffin, by threatening to pin the goon's murder on him. Jeff soon realizes he is being framed, double-crosses Whit and Kathie, who in turn triple-cross him. He quadruple-crosses Whit, while Kathie quintuple-crosses both Whit and Jeff. She kills Whit and puts forward an ultimatum to Jeff: he must either take the fall for Whit's murder or run away with her, loving fugitives forever. Instead, he alerts the police. When she finds out, she shoots him and is consequently gunned down by said law enforcement officials.To those largely unfamiliar with the film's two main characters, the above paragraph must seem quite absurd, yet in the context of their uniquely conflicted, astonishingly dysfunctional relationship, it makes perfect sense. When Jeff again finds Kathie with Whit, he is shaken and sickened, even (or especially) after she tells him that she still loves him. `You're like a leaf that the wind blows from one gutter to another,' he replies. `You can't help anything you do, even murder.' Hence they go about deceiving and insulting each other in ever more wily ways, more and more alike in their mendaciousness and vindictiveness. In the end, this struggle becomes not just self-destructive, but desperately suicidal. `We deserve each other,' they conclude. Still, by alerting the authorities, Jeff ultimately chooses Ann, even if he knows he won't live to return to her. This is, of course, is ancient cinematic convention.Indeed, what makes 'Out of the Past' particularly effective is that at times it at least seemingly offers the protagonist a way out. The many glimmers of hope, mostly in the form of Ann, who loves Jeff quite unconditionally, make the film's gloomily nihilistic conclusion all the more potent. There is little to examine about their relationship beyond the obvious, though. Ann is so slavishly devoted to Jeff that there is never a shadow of a doubt in her mind that he is innocent and will eventually return to her. In the end, only when she is made to think that Jeff actually left her for Kathie is she able to move on with her life. Still, his rare scenes with her represent the moral center of the film. Set in a bucolic environment and bathed in heavenly light at all times, they are both in tone and style dramatically different from the rest, an effective counterpoint to the otherwise dismal goings-on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid noir made great by some tough performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff Bailey owns a gas station in a small town. When he is visited by an old friend he is forced to come clean with his girlfriend and tells her how he used to work for big time gambler Whit Sterling. Whit had been shot by a lover who had then vanished with $40K. Jeff traces her to Acapulco but delayed telling Whit he had found her. Over time, Jeff fell for Kathie himself. However now the past has caught up with him as he is brought back to do another job for Whit. As he goes to the job that he suspects is a trap, we see the past between him and Kathie.Starting in the middle of the story, this film spends much of it's first half bringing us up to speed on Jeff's background as well as setting up the rest of the film. The story is pretty much traditional noir fare - a tough detective falls for a woman he is hired to find and it changes his whole life. Despite this it is still engaging and enjoyable - as much due to the style of delivery as it is for the material. All the usual characters are present here and they are well developed even if they are well worn in the genre. The film overloads on shadows at some points but mostly it has a dark, brooding visual style that supports the mood of the material. It is best demonstrated by the use of light as it is shadows - Ann is shown with a clearly lit face in her key scenes while Kathie is more shielded by darkness in some of hers.The characters are well delivered by a pretty solid cast, although the lion's share of the film belongs to Mitchum and Greer. Robert Mitchum deals with his character really well, no matter how he changes at different times during the story. At his most basic he does tough and brooding very well and he convinced me that he was a man who had goodness in his heart but hardness due to his circumstances. Greer is great and quite subtle for the genre - her femme fatale is not an obvious vamp who eats men, but is much more scheming than that and all the better for it. Douglas is a good presence but is given very little screen time. His performance for the majority is too bland but towards the end he reveals his darker character. Support is roundly good but I always struggle with the `wholesome' love interest that is often used to contrast with the femme fatale character - Huston does OK with the role considering, but she is much less interesting than the others.Overall this is a typically brooding noir that works well thanks to some tough performances and a flashback structure that aids the telling of the story. Mitchum is tough and effective while Greer makes for a good femme fatale by actually underplaying the traditional facets. The use of lighting fits the expectations and the end result is a film that is a good one to watch if you want to see what noir is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The essential film noir...has everything the genre demands...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OUT OF THE PAST is like watching a textbook lesson in Film Noir 101.It has so many layers of plots and sub-plots, so much rich B&amp;W texture in Nicholas Musuraca's shadowy photography, so many ambiguous moments that keep you guessing what's around the corner, and so many memorable quotes in scene after scene that you could spend the entire movie just writing down the crafty lines. What a blessing it must have been for these actors to read the script and savor the flavor of the lines they would be reciting.ROBERT MITCHUM, of course, slouching around in trenchcoat and hat on the prowl for the femme fatale, was at his peak as a movie hero, fully aware of the dangers ahead as he meets up with shady old friend KIRK DOUGLAS. (Incidentally, the Mitchum/Douglas chemistry is just as strong, if not stronger, than that between Mitchum and JANE GREER). Greer has the sultry good looks for a femme fatale but she's just a little too poker-faced to make her crimes seem credible.Once the screenplay makes clear that he's about to be more prey than predator, it becomes fascinating to watch the way he falls into the web of deceit so completely. Then the film becomes a little more burdensome to watch as the double crosses begin. There ought to be an ALERT message flashing on the screen as the plot becomes more involved. You need to be watching carefully as events unfold on screen or you'll lose track of the story details that all mesh together at the end.Even the ending is not as deceptively simple as it looks. There are implications that someone is not telling the whole truth, but I won't give that plot detail away here. Stay alert until that final scene and you'll see what I'm getting at.Mitchum, Greer and Douglas are excellent and they have a wonderful cast of supporting players that never let them down. The script is a marvel of how a film noir should be constructed with the clever lines completely appropriate for the characters and never once do they ring a false note.By all means, it's the kind of private eye story everyone can enjoy, as dark and shadowy as any film noir you've ever seen--and then some. It's one of RKO's most memorable noirs.Trivia note: Personally, I like the original title which, I believe, is the title of the novel: BUILD MY GALLOWS HIGH.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A script the equal of Maltese Falcon, and great photography, great acting!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the Past (1947)The writing and the plot of this complex, richly envisioned film noir ranks among the best. If you haven't seen it, plan to see it twice. Supposedly Scorsese recently screened it for DiCaprio, and Leonardo stood up at the end and claimed it was the best darned movie he ever saw, or something like that. And it really does have all the subtle elements in the writing and acting to give this power even to insider Hollywood pros. Or especially to people who really know and love movies. And who want to.Jane Greer is a femme fatale to make rattlesnakes cower, and yet she has that screen beauty to turn every head and cause good men to make bad decisions. (This is the definition of femme fatale.) Even the canny Robert Mitchum can't avoid her wiles. The young and powerful presence of Kirk Douglas adds a new casual twist to the mobster boss stereotype--he's likable without that caricature mob styling of other noirs. The "good" woman is especially tragic, and believable, too, in the form of little known Virginia Houston (who makes a bookend to her career in the fabulous Sudden Fear five years later). There are some novelties to the movie as a noir type, mainly the outdoor setting for some of the main scenes. But there is plenty of urban night stuff, and the more common (and well crafted) relationships between detectives and mobsters and the women above. The photography is classic dramatic stuff--watch near the very end how the camera follows Mitchum to one side of the car, the girl gets in, and then it glides across the front to watch him come around and get in the other side. This is so fluid and slight, you never really pay attention, but it's part of the slick way the movie makers keep the continuity and the verisimilitude at a high, dramatic pitch. Cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca is one of the best of the noir style, an unsung master (check his list of credits on this site and see all the great ones he's photographed). The director, it should be noted, is French born Jacques Tourneur, who made a number of interesting films (including the famous Cat People) as well as many B-movies. He shows a touch for tenderness that reminds me of Nicholas Ray, and the last, moving, minutes of the movie will make you want to watch it all again for other nuances.</fullReview>

Robert Mitchum in his first starring role and Kirk Douglas in one of his earliest roles are both exceptional and the cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca creates a dark, ominous atmosphere by making clever use of expressionistic shadows. The presence of a tough private investigator, a devious and deadly femme fatale and themes of murder, deception, betrayal, double crosses and fatalism all combine to make this movie an archetypal film noir.The idyllic existence which Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) had been enjoying in Bridgeport, California is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of Joe Stephanos (Paul Valentine). Joe says that his boss, a big time gambler called Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas), wants to see Jeff at his place at Lake Tahoe. Jeff feels compelled to agree and while travelling there tells his devoted girlfriend Ann (Virginia Huston) about his previous dealings with Whit Sterling.In New York, Jeff (whose real name was Markham) and his partner Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie) had been private investigators who were hired by Sterling to find his girlfriend Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who'd gone missing after shooting Sterling and stealing $40,000. Jeff had located her in Acapulco, fell in love with her and together they relocated to San Francisco. There they kept a low profile and lived happily until Jack Fisher (who had been hired to find them by Sterling) saw Jeff one day and eventually caught up with the couple at a cabin. Jack demanded his cut of the fee which Sterling had offered for bringing Kathie back and their heated conversation led to a fight between the two men which culminated in Kathie shooting Jack dead. She then immediately disappeared leaving Jeff to bury the body. Ann is predictably shocked but regards what happened as being all in the past and says that she wants Jeff to come back to her after he's finished his business with Sterling.At Lake Tahoe, Jeff discovers that Kathie is once again living with Whit and that he knows all that happened between them. Whit seems good humoured and unconcerned about the past and now wishes to hire Jeff to retrieve some tax records which a San Francisco lawyer called Leonard Eels (Ken Niles) is using to blackmail him. The events that follow lead to Jeff being framed for two murders and after a series of complex plot twists and a number of fatalities, the story reaches its denouement which is perfectly in keeping with the mood of pessimism and inevitability which prevails throughout the entire action.Jeff Markham is smart and laid back and also regularly makes brilliant quick witted responses to remarks made by other people. His experiences have made him cynical and jaded but he still passively allows himself to be drawn into perilous situations against his own better judgement. This happens when he betrays Sterling's trust and goes with Kathie to San Francisco and again when he accepts Sterling's second assignment even though he senses that his employer wants revenge and is actually setting him up to be framed for murder. There's a certain inevitability about his actions and their consequences and he seems powerless to alter the course of the events that follow. Even his escapes to San Francisco and Bridgeport prove to be utterly futile.Robert Mitchum with his trademark nonchalance is excellent as Markham and Kirk Douglas gives a memorable performance as Sterling. His good humoured and affable style actually adds greater menace and unpredictability to his character which the audience immediately recognise as a totally ruthless operator. Kathie Moffat is cunning and treacherous and betrays both Sterling and Markham. She also kills three men and sends another on a mission which leads to his death. Jane Greer is perfect in her role and is particularly successful in portraying her character's cold, callous and scheming nature."Out Of The Past" is a work of greater intelligence and substance than the vast majority of crime thrillers and a wonderful example of film noir at its purest and best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of this world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favourite Mitchum film - and Greer for that matter, 2nd favourite Tourneur after Night of the Demon, and also in my all-time Top 100 somewhere. Along with Double Indemnity and The Big Sleep this one (Build my gallows high) defines American film noir and with its cogent story, screenplay, acting, photography and production is true Art too, and yet still seems to me strangely neglected by critics, the media etc.Private dick Mitchum has to find gangster Douglas's girl Greer who shot him and skedaddled with USD 40,000 of his - when he finds her he takes one second to fall for her which turns out ultimately disastrous for all concerned. And what man would blame him - Greer was very alluring, but the big problem was that even if she was taller than Napoleon she would probably have killed as many people if given the chance. At least she was basically a good girl again when they came to do The Big Steal 2 years later. All of the murders committed in here were memorably portrayed and something to mull over afterwards. The photography is something else - gleaming and stark black and white on nitrate stock and intelligent compositions mean the atmosphere generated is intense, whether seething, sexy, menacing or pastoral.Over the decades I've seen BMGH probably nearly 20 times now with hardly any loss of admiration for it, it sucks me into its dirty world beautifully every time, so I think I like it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers:This may be the greatest film noir of all time. Jane Greer is the ultimate femme fatale, Cathy, who is beautiful, but cold-hearted. Robert Mitchum is great as Jeff Bailey/Markham, and Kirk Douglas is well cast as the mischevious crime lord, Whit. Out of the Past has one of the greatest scripts of all time. Alliances are constantly switching and betrayals and backstabbing is everywhere. Just looking within the three previously mentioned characters, there is a number of shifted alliances. Cathy betrays Whit, then Jeff betrays Whit, Cathy betrays Jeff, Whit betrays Jeff, Cathy betrays Whit, Cathy betrays Jeff, Jeff betrays Cathy, Whit betrays Cathy, Cathy betrays Whit, Jeff betrays Cathy, Cathy betrays Jeff, and, in the end, they all kill each other anyways so if no one had betrayed anyone in the first place, nothing would have happened. I'm not trying to preach, I am simply recognizing how outstanding the script is, and the irony involved in the tragic story. Jacques Tourneur brought this excellent script flawlessly to the screen with flawless performances to create, perhaps, the greatest film noir of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jane Greer: (explaining why she double-crossed Mitchum) "I don't want to die." Mitchum: "Neither do I, baby, but if I have to I want to die last..." There's nothing like film noir, particularly for whatever reason 40's California film noir. Mitchum gets caught in a nearly incomprehensible cross and double-cross surrounding Douglas, who plays the dapper heavy in a key but thankless role. Greer is Douglas' sometimes-girlfriend who seems to be playing Mitchum as the chump. The dialogue between Mitchum and Greer (and also Mitchum and Fleming) bristles in that mostly-clever but partly-cheesy fashion unique to this genre. Greer is stunning in a delicate sort of way and Mitch deadpans, chain smokes and squints his way through like nobody's business, the essential Mitchum performance. Huston: (talking about Greer) "Nobody's all bad." Mitchum: "No, but she comes closest." Ah, film noir...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody Dies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some say this plot is complicated and almost impossible to follow. It's hardly that. It's so simple a child can understand it. Everybody dies, and the story elegantly shows each character moving inexorably, often knowing and unable to halt the march to his [or her] ultimate destiny. Jane Greer is awesome as the femme fatale. We see her first as young and beautiful, "walking out of the sunlight", and we, like Robert Mitchum's character, fall under her spell. But, as the story unfolds, Greer's Kathie Moffett reveals more of her dark side, and she is no one to cross, because her ultimate solution to any problem is gunfire. But, do not suppose that Moffett is a stereotype, for this femme fatale is a complex character, a strong woman, trying to make her way in a man's world, controlling, conniving, manipulative and devious, but often forced into these schemes, and also a woman deeply in love. And, at its heart, this movie is a story of love gone wrong. In the end, Jeff and Kathie's love for one another is poisoned by deceit, distrust, and suspicion. Toward the end, it looks like they may get away from the gangster, played wonderfully by Kirk Douglas, who brought them together, and make a life for themselves. But, this is a film noir universe, where no one lives happily ever after. One more betrayal, and the tragic lovers meet their inevitable end. Out of the Past is stylish, witty, beautiful in a decadent sort of noir way, and the characters are complex, interesting, and with great depth. It is one of the best film noirs ever done, a must have and must see for anyone who loves the genre. A solid 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Miss This One!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What seems to be missing in the critiques of this fantastic, dark little film is a good look at the screenplay: tough, intelligent, crisp, complex, clever, and real, with nary a superfluous word. Geoffrey Homes (aka Daniel Mainwaring) wrote the screenplay from his even darker mystery HANG MY GALLOWS HIGH, itself beautifully written, occasionally even poetic.There is so much double-crossing going on in this film you don't know what or who to believe. Given their attractiveness, intelligence, sincerity, and wit, it's hard to believe that the characters portrayed by Jane Greer and Rhonda Fleming (both looking EXTREMELY hot) and by Mitchum and Kirk Douglas can't be trusted by anyone.I've watched this film at least a dozen times. I never tire of it. Brilliant, exciting, and beautiful. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "film noir" that really keeps it dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(little hint about the end. please excuse my english...I'm french)The problem with "films noirs" is that most of the time the inspired writers don't want to bring the spectator down and thus cheer us all up with incredible happy endings. Fortunately enough this film is an exception, there's really nothing to make you feel good or comfort you, and yet the "engrenage inexorable" which catches Jeff (R. Mitchum) can seem less threatening than usual.Of course he's in danger, of course things keep getting worse and worse and yet he seems unshakable, the strong &amp; fragile, stoic Mitchum. This is a great performance by one of the most enigmatic actors of his time. As for the love story, indeed as says James Ellroy "cherchez la femme", it's a masterpiece. Jeff is torn appart between magic and intriguing Kathie (Jane Greer) and sweet redemption Ann (Virginia Huston) but the characters although easy to identify are not caricatures . Kathie is wonderful. Jane Greer's incredible style and features make the character irresistible and increase the surprise and disappointment as we discover her "dark side". But she's not a vilain, she's better than that: she's a human and a woman, ambiguous, selfish but ... There's something about her next to what sweet gentle Ann cannot compare.On the "baddies' side" there's also Kirk Douglas as chief villain, but classy , rich and not so bad you can't like him. Yes indeed this movie respects every point of a good film noir: love, betrayal, hope, redemption, fall from grace, ambiguity, inexorability. The dark ending gives to the whole movie an antic-tragedy style, as states Anouilh the matter with drama is that you cannot help but thinking there's still hope, with tragedy everything's clear, everyone knows what to do and how it's going to end. Even though Jeff isn't Oedipe there's a look in his eyes and a final sacrifice that really make him a tragic hero.Of course Tourneur's images , direction and style are perfect as usual and capture the subtle sensuality between the actors. It's a real moment of pleasure, the story is good, the actors too; more than an excellent film, this is a piece of cinema, and as everyone knows, that's simply art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mitchum drags on his cigs, wears a trenchcoat, gets betrayed, does some betraying of his own and ends up right where he doesn't want to be. Greer smokes, backstabs, purrs, bats her eyes and tries to act blameless, even with a gun in her hand... Douglas never more menacing in one of few villain roles epitomizes the word smarmy. All 3 revolve around each other in tricky clever script that never slows down - with final telling word of dialogue to sum up Jeff Bailey character in a nutshell. The Kid, previously, not too bad with a fishing pole, lies to protect the nice girl and help her carry on; a really poignant little slice of writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply the best example of 'film noir'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this film countless times and cease to tire of its near perfection. Perhaps the story is a little convoluted but a couple (let alone my 50+) viewings will clarify the plot, and the complexity of structure only adds interest each time you watch it. It may not quite be Mitchum's best performance but is his (and Jane Greer's) best film.It's a very unusual film of its time in the use of real locations and the minimising of back projection and artificial sets. I love films with exotic locations so Acapulco and San Francisco do very nicely. For example using real settings for the evening beach and human fishing scenes is so much superior to using a studio lot, and since this was a B film on its release we can only imagine how awful some of these sets might have been with its modest budget. The cinematography of Nicholas Musuraca is superb, lending realism so much so that you can almost smell the grease at the gas station and feel the breeze coming off the lake in the opening scene. The dialogue is both clever and witty and worthy of Raymond Chandler himself. It gives great lines to many characters in a film that has many interesting supporting roles and reveals enough about many of them to extend them to 3 dimensions. Whit Sterling, as played by Kirk Douglas, is a powerful villain with a certain sly charm. Joe Stephanos an apparently easygoing heavy still carries his inferiority complex (vis-a-vis Jeff Bailey) with an insight into his doomed future. Even the Kid 'speaks' volumes on his understanding of Jeff's confused and complex character. Jane Greer was perfect as the beautifully cold Kathie Moffat who has all the men wrapped around her fingers showing the lovability of a Preying Mantis. Well writting about this film just makes me want to watch it again, I just love this movie and you should too !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Example of Classic "Film Noire"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Out of the Past" is considered by many to be one of the best, if not the best, example of the "film noire" genre. It was produced by RKO who made many of the best "film noires" during the 40s and early 50s.Directed by Jacques Tourneau, it contains all of the "film noire" characteristics. Its full of night scenes, dark brooding shadows, a "femme fatale", snappy ideologue, murder, mystery and plenty of double crosses.Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) is happily running a small gas station in Bridgeport, California and in love with local girl Ann Miller (Virginia Houston). One day from out of the past comes Joe Stephanos (Paul Valentine) looking for him. It seems that Jeff has a past. In any event, Jeff goes to see gambler/gangster Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas) who asks him to find his girlfriend Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who has shot him and absconded with $40,000 of his money. On the way Jeff explains to Ann about his past and that his real name is Markham.Jeff undertakes the task and ultimately discovers Kathie in Acupulco where they become lovers and attempt to allude Sterling. Ultimately, Jeff's ex-partner Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie) finds them in San Francisco. Fisher confronts the couple and a struggle ensues between the men. During the scuffle, Kathie kills Fisher, and then the fun starts.Kathie suddenly disappears. Jeff returns to Lake Tahoe where Sterling lives and is soon framed by him for the murder of Leonard Eels (Ken Niles) after being set up by his secretary Meta Carson (Rhonda Fleming). Kathie turns up in Sterling's company having gone back to him. After a few more double crosses and murders, Kathie and Jeff manage to get together again and.........Both Mitchum and Douglas were just coming into their own at this time. The interplay between them and the "femme fatale" Greer is fun to watch. Former child star Dickie Jones appears as a deaf/mute who worked for Jeff at the gas station. Richard Web appears as Ann Miller's faithful beau who patiently awaits Jeff's downfall.Remade in 1984 as "Against All Odds" with Jeff Bridges, Rachel Ward and James Woods in the Mitchum, Greer and Douglas parts respectively. Jane Greer also has a small role in the later film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and Memorable "B" Noir; Tourneur Classic; One of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the most copied, plagiarized and misunderstood of all noir films; it is also extremely artistic, mostly-well done in every department and consistently absorbing, in my view. What is often ignored is that in this interesting narrative, Robert Mitchum has been forced into the position of needing the work offered by Kirk Douglas. The woman in Douglas's life, very pretty Jane Greer, had stolen money and shot him. and the viewer is left to wonder which Douglas really wanted back? And if he had gotten either back, what were his intentions? This earlier part of the story is told in flashback; at the present Mitchum is living quietly in a small town pumping gas, and has a girl, Virginia Huston, to whom he retails his past. So when he is hired a second time by Douglas, a gambler-gangster, he takes precautions...but his past and the fact that he fell in love with Kathie and that he failed to do his job catches up with him, with tragic consequences. They were traced; Kathie shot their pursuer, and left him cold with no money. The gambler does not seem to hold a grudge; but is Mitchum being set up? There's a new investigate a new woman, Rhonda Fleming; but always there is the past catching up with Mitchum at last. Jacques Tourneur directed this classic of moody lights, moody people and effectively-used low-lighting. The convoluted script is by Daniel Mainwaring, plus Frank Fenton's and James M. Cain's contributions, from his own novel. Everyone connected with this "B" B/W classic of noir is to be congratulated; this is not the estimable sort of film that usually garners award; it just does good for those in it and affects everyone who sees it and goes on influencing people for years to come. In the cast, Mitchum is very strong, Douglas effective only when he is playing a bad guy, not a leader. Greer has one of her best cool and fascinating roles here. Also in the cast are Rhonda Fleming as noted, Steve Brodie, Richard Webb, Dickie Moore, Ken Niles and hardly anyone else. Soomehow, unplanned, two people fall in love in this film, and when she tries to warn him that she has a past, Mitchum tells Greer, "Honey, I don't care!" Perhaps judging by the results he should have cared. The famous sequences at the gas station, in a Mexican cantina, on the beach and in richer locales are all highly-memorable. Credit for the atmosphere goes to Nicholas Musuraca, Darrell Silvera did the sets and Roy Webb supplied eerie music. This is a fast-paced and understated adventure; one of the best in every respect. __________________________________________________</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Gets That Dream Girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Yes, there are a plethora of shadows here but never lose sight of what the shadows represent within all Film Noir: existential darkness. With the exception of the deaf boy, and the girl back at the rural hideaway, everybody in the movie is utterly evil. Jeff is happy and wants to live here, in the small town, where he is putting his life together. When you watch the movie, notice that quintessential Noir moral inversion: the person you think is the best is actually the absolute worst. Noir is a reaction to the Cold War, after WW2, the fear of not being able to trust anyone is reified into human beings. The smiling, caring Whit who joyfully puts you in a frame he has assembled, out of vengeance, for your being with Kathie. Carson's wife being so gracious and affectionate, keeping you busy while they put the noose around your neck. As a misanthropist, I have a huge collection of Noir because I find them congruent with my view of human beings. Even the Douglas' Muscle, who is kind to Jeff and feigns friendship is later on the rocks trying to shoot him. This is a masterpiece of Noir but it also is very hard to watch. Kathie goes through men like a bulldozer, even Douglas pays for his naivet for talking about framing her, in her presence, a fatal mistake. When I watched it, guys yelled,"Wake up dummy, she is not Wilmer," the patsy from The Maltese Falcon. The movie has a great cast; you will get to see Douglas, the grinning, affable villain, with Mitchum which is a rare treat. Jane Greer is great here; she fooled me until the very end. I still think she is who Kasdan patterned Matty Walker after in Body Heat. She slings verbal crap like a short order cook. Nobody has a clue what the evil little spider is really up to, not even Jeff, until it is too late. Watch Jeff's face when she kills Whit and now he belongs to her. Jeff knows how long of a table life he is going to have with this tarantula. This really is the feature that most reviewers miss when they review Noir. There is this obsession with shadows. Look, the most important feature of Film Noir is: a moral protagonist who is either injured or destroyed trying to maintain his goodness. Mildred Pierce is one where she is severely damaged but survives. Here, and in Kiss Of Death, the hero is destroyed. Movies where everybody is morally corrupt like: The Grifters, Body Heat or Blood Simple are not Film Noir. Yes, everybody in Noir is a rat EXCEPT the moral protagonist. Shadows and Misanthropy do not make Film Noir. I swear, I read a review of Soylent Green where a guy called it Neo Noir. Please, it really is not predicated solely upon shadows. Black Film because the people are evil; the shadows are existential metaphors for the morality of the peoples' personalities. This is one of the greatest of all Film Noirs. A painful watch, Jeff, and his dreams of happiness are destroyed by Kathie, the poster girl for staying single.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cigarette Symphony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raymond Chandler is reported to have said that if he was unsure of how the plot would develop in one of his gumshoe tales, he would bring on a man with a gun. In this film nothing is done before the actor lights a cigarette. It's a blast from the past, all right. Was the movie financed by a cigarette company ? It's worth watching again, just to count the number of cigarettes that are consumed, often no more than two or three puffs before they are chucked.It is truly a film noir; many shadowy and murky scenes, and a genuine femme fatale, who lies like a trooper and has all the men, good and bad, twisted round her little finger. To be frank, I couldn't fully follow the convoluted plot, but it didn't seem to matter. A bit like The Big Sleep. It was fascinating to wait for the next compulsive cigarette to be lit by one of the characters, Jeff Bailey-Markham, as he dug deeper into the mess that was being prepared for him. Highly entertaining. Sadly, the leading characters get killed, before they die of cancer. However, you have to admit, they get what was coming to them. The main survivor is the deaf and dumb boy, but then I don't think he smokes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Non-self</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film noir is the best. It changed the rules. It is our first great tradition for layered cinematic dreaming, not simply the body of work of a few exceptional filmmakers but actually spanning twenty years and hundreds of films. It changed the rules by delivering both the sensual cinematic world of movie stars and multilayered internal reflection echoing out to the night of life. This is one of the most curious and important in my view, I advise you go into it with a bit of noir in you so as to fully appreciate what is being innovated. It's not just any other noir.How to unspool this? Okay, you should know right off the bat that Bogie campaigned for the lead in this, it's an attractive role overall, my guess however is that he had realized in Falcon, probably the erudite company made him, that an incongruous story can serve as the ritual shibboleth that permits ecstatic (jazz) dancing between selves, so both in character and omniscient hovering-out above the situation, an even more attractive prospect for an actor. This brings the same set of self-reflexive notions to the noir world as Falcon did to detective fiction, already well established by that time in terms of dynamics.So nevermind that the story is murky and full of holes - that is partially the point and commented upon in the film. The plot is only the hook. Your best clue is the deaf boy hooking the bad guy off a cliff just seconds before a fatal shot. It just doesn't happen except in a story you tell.The project went to RKO instead and Robert Mitchum was cast in the part, really the perfect man for the role of dazed watcher who ecstatically hovers inside and above his own world of elusive remembrance. It's exciting stuff, this role.He is our narrator. He is the center of all this ever having been real. The typical noir plot - detective falls for the wrong woman - happened in the past and is recalled on a latenight drive to Tahoe. It has all the staples, crime, PI work, the dreamy woman. He succumbs to the hallucinative lure and sashaying of that story and brings it all alive, once more.The first of this is simple (explicit) enough and easy to spot because it's already framed as memory. Acapulco is all a dream about this woman, remember he waits for her by a movie theater and she walks out of the light like a vision. And back in San Francisco, they hide out at nights in movie theaters to keep from being seen.The second drift into daydream is what matters here, it's superbly done that you don't notice until much later. By that time, we are lost as he is.Before we get there, why is all this happening? Why was he sought out in a gas station in a hole in the middle of nowhere, specifically him? He is running around with someone else's girl, the writers explitictly made sure she's not just any girl but someone else's, or was (maybe the war intervened, two men came back instead of one and she's undecided). That guy we see, has a name (Jim), and looks aggravated. At any rate, our guy's got to be troubled by this not being entirely right. It has to be settled.He was sought out so he could drive back and tell the story on his way. That story that presumably happened in the past, is where he runs off with someone else's woman. Both of them want to, but the thing has to be settled.It is settled back in San Francisco, in one of the most ravishing movie plots concocted in Hollywood. You have to pay close attention because it's one of the most fascinating turns in movies.So far, we had a narrative-vision that portentously maps to the narrator's situation. We had all of this come back to him as the real thing. Suddenly, we have a third plot - retrieve incriminating papers - which is a third woman that he follows, once more poses as someone else, once more someone else wants her, but this time, this is superb, we have ecstatic hovering out of self that is clear insight of the situation; carrying on as he is, that guy is gonna get hurt, and sure enough, turns up dead in the middle of the night, and sure enough he is responsible and stands to get the rap.He knew it was a set-up the minute he walked in that door, but it is just too late when he gets back. He knew it was wrong every step of the way. Somewhere something went wrong and he can't make it right again in his head. In-film character goes on with the plot, but the now-transcendent self has seen wide and is already calling down the darkness. You may note this as the invisible machinery of fate.It could have been settled in a number of ways, this layered structure. The filmmakers settled on pitch black; dissolution.So, there it is, I believe a sort of closure for the first years of film noir, a must see if you want to understand noir. Wonderful. Welles takes it from here, doing Shanghai the following year. But that is another story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't go into the plot as that can take countless paragraphs &amp; leave you just as confused, except to say there are plenty of plot twists &amp; the pacing is excellent.The running commentary spoken by Robert Mitchum adds to the sense of excitement and you can't wait to see how the film ends up. Robert Mitchum, given a good script (as here) delivers a superb performance &amp; proves, without doubt what a fine actor he could be. His late film work was unworthy of his considerable talent and we have lost a fine actor, great personality and certainly a character larger than life! Stars of that period seem to be aura about them that cannot be said of the movie stars of today.Excellent support from Jane Greer, looking totally enchanting &amp; very convincing as a femme fatale with Kirk Douglas equally beguiling as the bad guy. The film IS dark but it adds to sense of doom surrounding the Jeff Bailey character played by Robert Mitchum.Watch this film whenever it's on, or buy the DVD, as I guarantee that you will be gripped from first to last.RKO thank you - a wonderful little studio that made memorable films to compete with the best....we all love King Kong,Citizen Kane, Hunchback of Notre Dame to name a few I am sure but it's films like this, Cat People, Narrow Margin, The Window that deserve top marks for doing the very most with very little and entertaining us so much along the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was released in the U.K in 1947 by RKO Radio Pictures Inc. with the alternative title "Build My Gallows High", the same as the novel by Geoffrey Home (pseudonym of Daniel Mainwaring), who also wrote the screenplay.It is an early example of classic film noir with the hard-boiled anti-hero excellently played by Robert Mitchum, with superbly menacing support from Kirk Douglas as his boss.The flashback structure reminds me of the 1944 version of "Murder My Sweet" (a.k.a. "Farewell My Lovely" in the U.K.) and the voice-over is very reminiscent of most Raymond Chandler-sourced films of this type. There are also similarities to David Cronenberg's 2005 "A History of Violence" and Richard Fleischer's 1952 "The Narrow Margin".My favourite lines occur during a flashback exchange between Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer (an excellent femme fatale) where, after Mitchum comments "I didn't know you were so little" she says "I'm taller than Napoleon" and he responds with "You're prettier too".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir With A Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genre known as "film noir" has as many sine-qua-non exemplars as it does boundaries, ideas it must be nihilistic or be set entirely at night. "Out Of The Past" could be the greatest film noir for the way it challenges such assumptions while making its case for greatness. It's a classic anyway.Robert Mitchum stars as a guy named Jeff, pumping gas in Bridgeport, California until history comes to collect him in the form of a sniggering lackey named Joe Stephanos (Paul Valentine). Joe works for this other guy named Whit (Kirk Douglas) who wants Jeff to do a job, one which as it turns out involves a woman named Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who both Jeff and Whit had a past with. Never mind Jeff now has true love with Ann Miller (Virgina Huston); Kathie has enough hottitude to drag poor Jeff to his doom, however nobly Jeff may try to play his feeble hand."Is there a way to win?" Kathie once asked in her past with Jeff."There's a way to lose more slowly," replied Jeff, optimistically more than realistically as things turn out.Crisp dialogue is one key strength of this film, along with fantastic supporting performances by Greer, Huston, Valentine, Dickie Moore as Jeff's one true pal, and especially Douglas, who in an early performance plays down any histrionic "I Am Sparticus" expectations you may have with his cocksure, amiable, low-key performance as the main bad guy. "I fire people, but nobody quits on me," he tells Jeff, with only the slightest sense of menace in his eyes. Yet that slightest sense makes all the difference.It helps a lot that Mitchum plays the lead. I was not convinced of his greatness going into this film, but he blows away all doubts. Like imogensara_smith points out in her review here, Mitchum gives a kind of scat-jazz vocalization to his performance, finding the off-center angle to give his words the right flow. Single words like "Sure," "Okay," and "Thanks" in his hands feel almost like Sinatra hitting the off-beats on a Sammy Cahn lyric. His longer lines feel every bit as clever as Bogart's in "Casablanca." Just Mitchum's opening scenes with Huston, set by criminally-underestimated director Jacques Tourneur to a sunny landscape we might mistake for Hemingway's "Big Two-Hearted River" except its California and not Michigan, is enough to make the case for Mitchum's thematic representation as the consummate 20th-century man. Sure, he's laconic, but he kills you all the same.So does Greer, from the first line she says to Jeff, regarding a pair of earrings he offers her: "I never wear them." Do you then notice the number of scenes thereafter when she is wearing earrings? Virginia Huston may be wooden, but so is the hull of a boat that keeps it afloat. "Out Of The Past," unlike so many clever, soul-killing film noirs before and after, works not from playing against the grain of human kindness and loyalty but for how it highlights same. Mitchum and Moore both present us with guys who are committed to Hemingway's ideal of "grace under pressure" however little they benefit from living by it. Save your "D.O.A" and "Criss Cross" however sympathetic its heroes; "Out Of The Past" gives you a Roman ideal of stoicism whom the gods play with but cannot quite break, however Jeff bends.SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD - I can't claim this film is perfect; unlike a diamond it doesn't benefit from every angle of view. What is Jeff's supposed motive for killing the lawyer Eels? Or Joe's for trying to shoot Jeff? I think I know why Kathie gave Jeff accurate info on where Eels' files went, and it only adds to the drama of their relationship. Ambiguity is a good thing generally, both for making one thing while watching a film and after, something "Out Of The Past" proves again and again. - SLIGHT SPOILERS ENDThe best thing about "Out Of The Past" is that it resists snap judgments about any of its characters, even Kathie. Why, even snide Joe seems humanized by the sight of death, and Whit may or may not be the victimizer Kathie claims (we see him slap her once, but is he a sadist or reacting to her vicious character the same way Jeff and we have since the movie's first-half was over?) How do Kathie's cat eyes and obvious cunning contrast with memories of sunny Acapulco?You carry memories of Acapulco, too, watching this and trying to figure out who's right or wrong. The human condition is a drag generally, but something about "Out Of The Past" makes it seem fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Build My Gallows High, Baby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. Mitchum is cool, tough, arrogant and a total schnook, who gets dragged through hell by a woman, Jane Greer, who he should have known not to trust. He is like Fred McMurray in Double Indemnity, or Burt Lancaster in the Killers, men whose emotional and moral strength is non-existent compared to their physical strength.The convolutions of the plot in any film noir are far less important than atmosphere, script and the sense of doom that hangs over the characters. From the moment Steve Brodie rides into the small town where Mitchum has made a life, and Brodie has on black trench coat, the clear signal is that Mitchum is doomed, in spite of his supposed street smarts and physical strength. Mitchum conveys a doomed quality in most of his best work, and the sense is that he knows it but is too curious to take the trip and not strong enough to resist the excitement. The brittle snappy conversations are meant as the character's badge of hipness and wisdom, and really a sign of how displaced they are from normal human emotion. "Out of the Past" is really an important moment in the maturity of the movies because no one escapes clean because they are all flawed, all caught up in events that they can only start not finish. In other words, fools on fools errands, trying to survive by their wits and not possessing anywhere near enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beer And The Darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the best film noir movie of them all, "Out of the Past" has all the ingredients that make the genre so popular today. And Jane Greer is the definitive femme fatale. Oh, how she supplements Robert Mitchum's brilliant performance. That the two mesh as few other movie couples do is part of the fun of watching this once in a lifetime film.Directed with lan by Jacques Tourneur, he made the wise decision to drop the title of the novel on which the picture is based, "Build My Gallows High," for a much more alluring and apropos one, "Out of the Past," which is a key to the story being told, even though the line "build my gallows high" is used toward the end of the show. The novel and the screenplay were written by the almost neglected Daniel Mainwaring, aka Geoffrey Holmes, partly responsible for such goodies as "The Big Steal," "The Tall Target," "Roadblock," "The Hitch-Hiker," "The Phenix City Story," and the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." He also did the rewrite of "Out of the Past" called "Against All Odds," released posthumously. Why he is not given more credit for his works is a mystery. If much of the narration sounds similar in style to Walter Neff's in "Double Indemnity," and Frank Chambers' in "The Postman Always Rings Twice," it's because James M. Cain had a hand in the screenplay. The story involves a one-time shamas, Jeff Bailey (Mitchum), who botched a job for a big-time crime boss, Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas in his second film role), because he fell for the loving lies of his prey, Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer at her most cunning). Now Jeff has a run-down gas station in small town America, dependable friends including a deaf mute, The Kid (played by former child star Dickie Moore), and Meta Carson (Rhonda Fleming) who loves him, and time to enjoy bucolic pleasures such as fishing. Out of the past comes danger from Whit Sterling, seeking to rectify old affronts, and the return of siren Kathie to haunt Jeff's heart once more. Has Jeff learned from the past? He believes he has. So begins an elaborate cat and mouse game entangling Jeff, Kathie, Whit, and Whit's henchmen in a struggle for survival in an amoral jungle, quite unlike the idyllic new life Jeff had attempted to build for himself.The viewer will see some of the best acting ever put on the big screen. Douglas is magnificent even when laid out on the floor. The cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca helps define noir. Note the signs of threat and decadence lurking behind the rustic simplicity of the small town of Bridgeport. All in all a film that deserves the praise it has received from critics and noir fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noir at its greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've had to laugh at some of the comments I've seen from people who find "Out of the Past," to be dark and convoluted and confusing. That's the point! That's why they call it noir! If you can't get it, don't bother trying to figure it out. Robert Mitchum is the epitome of the 40s tough guy because he genuinely was one of the toughest, and he oozes cool in his trench coat and hat and the way he dishes out his lines: "You're like a leaf that blows from one gutter to another." They don't write or make films like this anymore because they can't (with the lone contemporary example of L.A. Confidential, which was a genuine modern noir, although Ellroy's third part of his trilogy, "The Big Nowhere," was even better and should be made into a film.) The pairing of Mitchum with Kirk Douglas made for a classic encounter and Jane Greer set the standard for the femme fatale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film noir, like any genre, has a few defining moments in its history. Without a doubt Jacques Tourneur's vivid film sits somewhere at the top. All the noir elements are here: the femme fatale, doomed leading man, double-crosses, top notch dialogue, and style to burn. What makes OUT OF THE PAST special is that to Tourneur's advantage, the film was cast with actors whose performance and appearance raise the characters to a mythic level similar to some of John Ford's films. Successfull on every level, OUT OF THE PAST delivers the goods and then some.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, bear with me, I'm not old enough to remember the Big Band era (but my parents were) and I'm a a big Bunny Berigan fan. From what little I've heard, I know that Berigan showed up on many unattributed cuts of famous big band records. There were a lot of people who might have thought that they were hearing Harry James on Goodman recordings when it was really the brilliance of Bunny.Since I didn't grow up with this music, I don't know every song title like someone who was young, then, but the song the band is playing when Mitchum goes into the black night club, near the beginning of the movie, I recall as a famous Berigan tune. Not only that, I am almost 100% certain that the recording of the trumpet player IS Berigan on the soundtrack. Does anybody know for sure? This theme is used throughout the picture, in one form or another.OK, what is the name of the song and is this a Bunny recording? This just could be one more feather in Bunny's otherwise tragic cap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeff Bailey(Robert Mitchum)is trying start a new life as a garage/pump attendant in a sleepy mid-west town when his past catches up on him. He is "advised" to pay a visit to Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas), a man who once employed Mitchum when he worked as a private eye. On the way to meet Sterling, Bailey tells of his past, in a series of flashbacks, to girlfriend Meta Carson (played by Rhonda Fleming). The real star of the movie though is Jane Greer who is superb as Kathie Moffat, an excellent femme fatal and Sterling's "mole", to boot! Whilst watching the movie and engrossed in the flashbacks of Mitchum's story, you are soon given a reality check by trying to work out who Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) is actually double crossing - yep, she's that good. If you thought that "The big sleep" was tricky then you ain't seen nothing! In the flashbacks, like the proverbial chump, Mitchum takes on a job offer from Sterling to find Greer who has run off with his $40,000. He ends up in Acapulco and is entranced by femme fatal Greer. Against his better judgment he runs away with Greer thinking that it is forever. To Greer forever is till the next chump comes along!Meanwhile back to the present..................What is this job, after all this time that Sterling wants him to do? Mitchum knows its a trap of some kind but is still willing to take it on. Will he come out on top? Is it for Jeff Bailey or does he still love Kathie Moffat? Watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Out of the Past" is an interesting and well-crafted film-noir with a good cast and an elaborate story. Jane Greer is well-remembered for her performance, and Robert Mitchum is quite effective as the man at the center of the story. Kirk Douglas adds plenty of energy as Mitchum's genial but threatening employer. The atmosphere is suitably ominous and interesting, with a good variety of settings that complement each other.The story set-up creates some good possibilities, with Jeff (Mitchum's character) living a peaceful life in an out-of-the-way place, when he is suddenly confronted with some past acquaintances whom he'd prefer to have forgotten. It works well both because the ensuing story is interesting in itself, and also because it is easy to sympathize with Jeff's predicament and the difficult choices he must make. It all makes for a high-quality and memorable picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the Past(1947) combines two basic elements of film noir(detective, innocent man corrupted plotlines)that results in something masterful. Out of the Past(1947) was a product of a maturing genre, which during the late 1940s, began dealing with taboo themes more frequently. There was a slow uprise in implicit expressions of sexuality, and violent intensity. Also, filmmakers began exploring themes and ideas not covered during early years of film noir. By the late 1940s, many American noirs were depicting psychopathic behavior more often into plots.American cinema of the 1940s is characterized by large amounts of cigarette smoking, especially in film noir genre. Out of the Past(1947) is the ultimate smoking noir picture of the 1940s. The smoking is as much apart of plot as actors or locations because of clouded character motives that are developed. Back then, cigarette smoking in American films was seen as a form of American coolness, individualism, and toughness. What smoking does create in Out of the Past is an air of mysterious atmosphere.Its fatalistic love story is depicted in the style of classical Greek tragedy. Jeff Markham is a quintessential tragic noir hero whose obsessive desire for femme fatale, Kathie Moffat leads to his downfall. Love story element involving Jeff and Kathie feels like something out of Double Indemnity(1944), or Scarlet Street(1946). Not surprising considering that one of the writers involved with screenplay was James M. Cain(uncredited)whose signature noir style is all over the love story angle. Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer light up the screen with enough sexual chemistry and desire to fill a room.Trangle motif plays an important role in plot and motives of main characters involved. There are two love triangles shown in Out of the Past(1947). The first one involves Jeff(Robert Mitchum), Kathie(Jane Greer), and Whit(Kirk Douglas). Second love triangle includes Jeff(Robert Mitchum), Kathie(Jane Greer), and Ann(Virginia Huston). Love triangles are an enduring quality of fiction that never seems to die because of people's interest in them, and artists fascination by their conflictual elements.Mitchum established himself as a Hollywood tough guy with his ambiguous, cool depiction of an amoral fatalistic detective. His characterization of Jeff shows Mitchum in his element when displaying emotions of animalistic vulnerability. Raymond Chandler may have had a point in believing that Robert Mitchum was a perfect choice to play Philip Marlowe. He certainly had the face and physical presence to play the Mike Hammer character. His performance is brought up three notches by Jacques Tourneur's brilliant direction of his actors.The tension, director, Jacques Tourneur creates through moody b/w photography unfolds in a way, which compells the viewer to keep eyes stuck on what happens next. Atmospheric tension is at the forefront of the ensuring conflict faced by main characters, and the resolution of this conflict. Mitchum, Douglas, and Greer's acting performances conjure up human tension by sheer presence, and hard-boiled acting styles. The cinematography in Out of the Past contributes in creating tension by moving in a clautraphobic flow. Atmosphere is conjured up in a manner not too dissimilar to atmosphere, and mood created by Tourneur for his horror films.Jacques Tourneur hands out what is in my opinion, his best film beating out the horror pic he did during that same period of time. Famous climatic sequence that is shown on any documentary on film noir is handled with intensifed professionalism. Watching many of the scenes, I am impressed by the well roundedness of Tourneur's direction, and a taut feeling of paranoia created by Tourneur. The introductory meeting moment between Jeff and Kathie is a highlight of Film noir in 1940s American cinema. Out of the Past(1947) is to noir cinema in the same vein that his horror classics were to that genre.What separates the great from the average film noires are the handling of the double cross scene, and the way one portrays it. Difference between a believablely tense double cross moment, and an unconvincing one depends on the acting and direction, which when great can make the double cross moment work like clockwork. Out of the Past(1947) is one of those films where the double cross moment becomes a believable spectacle of dark human impulses. The fabulous acting, camerawork, and direction all work functionly to make famous double cross moment succeed. One reason the double cross moment fails in many Neo-Noirs is because they come out of nowhere or are blandly depicted.A film, which I believe had an impact on the style and depiction of characters in OFTP is Luchino Visconti's Ossessione(1942). Like Detour, which I have written about earlier, Out of the Past feels like at times, an American Neo-Realist film. Qualities which made classics like Ossessione, show up in Out of the Past(1947) in character composition, and depiction of locations. The fatalistic love story follows in the same manner of tragedy here as in Ossessione. Tourneur was inspired by the look and tone of Ossession, and was able to create a masterpiece with a style distinctly his own.Kirk Douglas gives one of his best pre-Sparticus performances in film. Kirk Douglas matches the coolness and tough attitude of Mitchum in scenes where they are in together. The final scene is one, which is always discussed in college classes, and documentaries on film noirs, or American cinema. Out of the Past(1947) is a well rounded film that still holds up as a piece of legendary movie making. A favorite, which has aged well, and never ceases to be entertaining as well as provocative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dark stranger from the city rides into a simple small town. He has some questions about the man with the mysterious past who owns the gas station across from a nice family diner. After the two men talk, the man with the mysterious past goes to fix loose threads he left behind in a film that is nothing but noir.Robert Mitchum plays Bailey, the snoop who falls in love with his client's target: the dark and mysterious Kathie (Greer). Quick-tongued and lethargic, he gracefully plunges deeper into the abyss of uncertainty as he gets caught up in a power game between a man and his girl, and the own pull of his desires versus what he knows is right for him.The acting of these characters as they tumble about their own destruction is superb, but none moreso than the witty dialog that's great even by film noir standards. The directing and cinematography are perfect to, so that it's nearly impossible not to feel pulled along by the roller-coaster ride towards doom. The action NEVER lets up, and just when the film seems to catch its balance, it lunges right over.Highly recommended to fans of noir and anyone who wants to look into the genre, not to mention anybody who likes classics and just about anybody else who has any reason to believe they should watch it.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grab this film from out of the past and watch it today! A Classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Film Noir's perennial themes is the inability to escape from one's past. OUT OF THE PAST is a textbook example of this theme and as a representation of Film Noir in general, it's practically flawless. Robert Mitchum plays a private detective who has created a new existence for himself in a small town out in the country, with a small town girl and runs a roadside gas station, when from out of the past comes a menacing looking stranger in a black suite, seeking to re-unite Mitchum with a powerful hood played by Kirk Douglas. In order to have the possibility of a future, our detective must confront his past. His first order of business is to come clean with the girl he loves and through flashbacks we witness this former detective's "fall from grace" at the double-crossing hands of a beautiful femme fatale, Jane Greer. When we return back to the present, this double-cross will be followed by a whole series of crosses, ultimately resulting in a labyrinth of deception from which no one can escape. Daniel Mainwaring wrote the script from his novel "Build My Gallows High" (a line that is also used to great effect in the film) and the dialog is brilliant but just as important, the characters know when not to speak. Nicholas Musuraca, whose brilliant camera work in CAT PEOPLE (also directed by Jacques Tourneur) was a hi-light, repeats that success here, and films one of the most subtle, yet evocative sex scenes ever.

		<fullReview>This film was great. The plot kept me guessing the entire time, and the cinematography was beautiful; instead of relying on dark city streets to give it a classic "noir" atmosphere, director Jacques Tourneur chose to display the breathtaking California countryside in black and white, at once contrasting and accentuating the dark nature of the characters' actions. Robert Mitchum is amazing as Jeff Bailey. He is the epitome of nonchalance and sangfroid, and yet is able to depict a more romantic side at the same time. Jane Greer is also incredible as Kathie Moffat. Her portrayal of a woman who will do anything to get what she wants is powerful, but still realistic. Her performance is not over-the- top, which makes her character even more frightening. The soundtrack is also fantastic; it adds to each scene without overpowering it. This is a great example of a film noir, and I loved watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film slightly reminds me of Casablanca, in that the male lead's former love interest comes back and things and people change for that instance (the "love" in this one is more complicated and intertwined, but the same feeling, for me, arose), going every which way from the predictability of life previous. This film hosts great acting and an amazing use of light. Both by the strong women of the film played by Rhonda Fleming and Jane Greer. And also, one can feel the tension between the actors Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas. The tension, and how well the mesh, must be more than their acting ability, but something about who they are as individuals, which just added to the roles (so awesome casting done there). And the light, there was heavy use of chiaroscuro, making the dark noir have light in a way that highlighted on-screen aspects, both for importance and aesthetics. I definitely liked this film, I see myself viewing more film noir over the coming summer months.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badass movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a great crime mystery. The main character was a badass who from beginning to end was well rounded but you couldn't get your hands on him. Another great part of this movie was the script, I loved how every character interacted with one another, this was a huge factor in developing very dramatic scenes. Another huge part I liked about this movie was the locations. I loved the outskirt town, the dimly lit rooms, etc. This movie definitely developed the very dramatic noir factors we seen in these types of films. I am new to film noirs, but I must say that Out Of The Past was a beautiful mystery, crime, drama that left me with a big question mark on my head from scene to scene right up until the final scene. A great suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of the Past Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the Past is another classic film noir, one of the best I might add. Starring Robert Mitchum, from Night of The Hunter, it is about a private eye who falls for a suspicious women played by Jane Greer. Greer steals the film really, her performance is great, she is charming yet evil but still beautiful.This film is full of drama, intrigue, and sexual motivation, the staples of a film noir. The lighting is terrific, with very dark deep shadows contrasted nicely with whites and and light. For as classic as this film looks, it is a bit of a depressing film. Still the charm of Jane Greer and the overall feel and look of the film will keep you invested until the end. If you are a fan of film noir, go watch this right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great characters, convoluted plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a lot to like in this gritty noir -- especially an irresistible performance by Robert Mitchum -- but I found the story frustratingly confusing. I just could not follow all the sinister twists and turns.Mitchum conveys a powerful sexuality here. His crumpled trench coat does nothing to camouflage impeccable, manly posture as he makes his rounds through the pristine hills 300 miles from LA, a Harlem jazz club, or a seamy Acapulco bar. Watch the way a 30-year-old Mitchum draws on those cigarettes that will, ultimately, take his life 50 years later.He's got great chemistry with the Madonna/whore pair to whom he is irresistibly drawn -- a dazzling Jane Greer as Kathie and Virginia Huston as Ann, appearing a tad too old to be behaving so chastely under the wing her schoolmarm-like mother. A slicked-back Kirk Douglas is believably chilling as the vicious criminal Whit.There's a lot of great dialogue in this film."You see that cove over there? Well, I'd like to build a house right there -- marry you, live in it, and never go anywhere else," Jeff purrs to Ann amidst a dazzling landscape clearly loved by French director Jacques Tourneur.As a lover, Mitchum's part is written say the things a woman loves to hear, making this a deeply romantic tale set against a sordid backdrop of man at his venal worst."You're going to find it very easy to take me anywhere"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This piece of film noir feels, at times, like other noir classics. But it stands on its own. It has a convoluted plot that somehow--unlike "The Maltese Falcon" and others--remains understandable for the viewer.It stars Robert Mitchum who, with his hound dog eyes and lazy drawl, plays a private detective who gets in deep with a woman he is hired to track. Most of the film is a flashback that explains why he abandons his past life and settles in a quiet little town called Bridgeport.He's one smart cookie, but the past just keeps dragging him back to an intrigue that promises heartache. Jane Greer plays the part of Kathie, a woman he is drawn to despite troublesome complications. As Mike in David Mamet's "House of Games" might say, "Oh, you're a bad pony. And I'm not gonna bet on you." The viewer knows he must be thinking something like that, but he decides to gamble anyway.The film provides wonderful characters at every turn and numerous twists that keep it interesting. Like most noir, it has its share of night scenes, and they are filmed with great skill. "Out of the Past" deserves a spot among the best noir classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Awfully cold around the heart"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The type of movie we have now come to call film noir is unique among genres (if it is indeed a genre, and that itself is a moot point), in that it is defined by both thematic and stylistic elements. To be accepted as a film noir, a movie must be dark on the screen as well as in story. An example of how this works is the Hitchcock picture Vertigo, which for all its cynical, fate-riddled plot should be thought of as archetypal noir, but it is rarely called one because it is shot in blazing Technicolor. Out of the Past on the other hand is a prime example of how story and style can be melded to make the very epitome of everything film noir conjures up.After Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Philip Marlowe in The Big Sleep, the private investigator thriller was practically a subgenre in its own right. Even though the term film noir was not yet known in Hollywood, there is very little about Out of the Past that was not already a clich. But clich can be good, if it's done well. Three things make this particular clich-fest stand out. First is the snappy, quotable dialogue; a mile away from anything people say in real life, but realism was never the purpose of these things. Second a perfect and to-the-point balancing of events. Flashbacks can often be awkward, gimmicky things, but the one in Out of the Past has enough substance to be a story-within-a-story, but is just about short enough to prevent it from unbalancing the bulk of the picture. And finally there is the payoff in the final scene, a moment of poignancy rare in film noir, and one that offers a tiny crumb of comfort without detracting from the general mood of despair.Now let's look at the contribution of director Jacques Tourneur. He displays (in all his movies, even the Westerns) a kind of tight, enclosed look, but one that owes very little to German Expressionism. It is based around placing things in the foreground, often half-on and half-off the screen. Actual close-ups are rare, but there is nevertheless a constant feeling of closeness, with characters squared up around the frame as if their elbows should be rubbing against the screen. Often the focal point is a little deeper in the shot, and Tourneur pulls some brilliant tricks with layers of depth. One example is where Kirk Douglas is questioning Robert Mitchum in a restaurant. As Douglas becomes a little more aggressive and the dialogue becomes more relevant to the plot, the scene becomes visually more arresting, with a waiter tidying up in front of the actors and a family getting up and leaving behind them. Most directors will use framing to draw our eyes one way or another, but Tourneur does it so starkly and firmly just by a simple arrangement, such as the fence that leads away diagonally from the screen to Mitchum and Virginia Huston when he drops her off. Our attention is being forced but everything still looks natural. Tourneur's is a style that is hard on the eye without actually looking overtly stylised. Out of the Past was one of the earliest leading roles for Robert Mitchum, and he wears the part like a glove. His acting is not exceptional here, but he fits in very well. Apparently doing very little, he gives off a kind of atmosphere that is as bleak as the images. His movements, subtle and sporadic as they, are in time with the rhythm of the whole piece. His co-star Jane Greer ? not an especially prominent movie actress ? is also wonderfully understated, keeping the size of her performance below the level of melodrama, breaking through with steely emotion here and there with exceptional control. No-one else in the cast especially stands out, but they really aren't so supposed to ? they are supposed to be part of the general pattern.There is little else to say that Out of the Past makes for a satisfying and enjoyable watch. Cinema is both a storytelling and an aesthetic medium, and it works best when the one angle complements the other. Film noir, often a crushingly dispiriting "genre", reaches almost majestic proportions with this offering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neat Little Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This little gem is a must see for all noir fans. The plot is simple, and told mostly in flashback. The hero(or should we say anti-hero) is introduced as a mechanic in a small town with a shady past but trying to forget that and live a normal life courting the towns most like-able girl portrayed with usual nonchalance by Robert Mitchum. The opening scene is itself a gem - We see a highway somewhere near the California mountains and a shady looking man trudging over the local garage but instantly the viewer realises that it is a planned visit by the sequence of events. The narrative is in electric speed and we are told the story of Mitchum in his not so far past as a Private Eye who double-crosses his gangster boss and gets away with the bosses gorgeous girl (the femme fatale of the flick). The gangster and his moll are excellently portrayed by Kirk Douglas and Jane Greer. The past has come back to torment the private eye and he is pulled into another vortex of betrayal, murder and his self extinction unable to be redeemed by his new found love, the plain American girl next door. Any more of the movie would only spoil the viewers delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of the Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, build my gallows high, baby.Deciding to go on a film noir kick, choosing OUT OF THE PAST was an easy starting place if ever there was one. All the elements are represented. The femme fatale, played by Jane Greer, who is cunning in how she can deceive the men in her orbit. The lowly detective(Robert Mitchum) who is hired to find her, falling for Greer while in Mexico hot on her trail, getting caught in a web he can not escape. Kirk Douglas a tax cheat millionaire who hired Mitchum to find Greer and the $40,000 she stole from him. If Mitchum had just found Greer, contacted Douglas telling him of her whereabouts and finished the job as he was supposed to, maybe he could have avoided the later complications which develop. Greer is bad. She isn't above using men in order to slither out of situations which might place her in harm's way(often of her own making, such as the stunt where she left Douglas with his cash, was a major figure in Mitchum's framing for a tax specialist's murder, etc). Mitchum's mistake was falling for her. He couldn't help himself and the result ties him to both Greer and Douglas. Douglas, because Mitchum took his money and didn't report he had found Greer, living it up in Mexico among other places. Greer, because Mitchum and her had the affair and he cannot seem to sever the tie that binds them. What makes OUT OF THE PAST wonderfully noir is the crackling dialogue, twisty plot, and a cast to die for. All the parts, from the leads to the supporting players, are expertly cast, especially Greer, who uses her looks and phony innocence as tools to manipulate and destroy. Mitchum has a multi-faceted hero who uses his smarts in an attempt to stay one step ahead of Douglas and Greer, ultimately doomed because of his association with them. While trying to outsmart Greer, Mitchum underestimates her skill at maneuvering out of a sticky problem when he believes he has her in a trap that is fool-proof involving the shooting of his slimy partner (Steve Brodie) who was wanting the $40,000 as hush money to keep her location from Douglas. With Virginia Huston as Mitchum's other love interest, Ann(he was hoping to start over with her, running a gas station in her small town), Richard Webb as a local in love with Ann and who believes Mitchum's Jeff is bad news, Paul Valentine as Douglas' hook(Joe, also working a scheme with Greer's Kathie, probably another flunky she was working over) and Dickie Moore as deaf and dumb kid who works at Jeff's gas station, a marvelous cast can work wonders. This movie had so much going right, it's no wonder OUT OF THE PAST has stood the test of time and remains so revered among fans of film noir. I liked how the film's title coincides with the overall story of the movie. Jeff tried to make a go of it?to assume a new identity, find a place off the beaten track, romance a wholesome local girl who become devoted to him despite their short courtship, and attempt a fresh start. Unfortunately, the past has a way of resurfacing, and interesting enough, Jeff accepts that he will have to once again meet Whit(Douglas) and Kathie, not putting up a fight because he knows it would be futile. And, perhaps, Jeff knew during his conversation with Whit's hood Joe that his fate could end grimly. I like Mitchum's scenes with Huston because she represents the ideal candidate Jeff would like to substitute for Kathie, because she has no agenda or ulterior motives. The idyllic area near Jeff's gas station, the stream, hills, rocks, is the perfect substitute for the urban city and the crime that thrives within such a setting. This small town is exactly the kind of place a man could run and hide in, yet Jeff still cannot bury away the past which will not stay buried. And so Jeff resigns to the fact that it was worth a shot, but the demons of the past have a way of finding you. Film noir rarely ends happily for any of the principles as this movie establishes all too well. Mitchum was polluted due to his connections with the criminal element, and it would take a self-less act on his part to right wrongs which would put a stop to Greer once and for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noir or not, is it a good movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the comments I have read on this movie concentrate on whether it is a good film noir, or if it might be classic film noir. But the concept of "film noir" was hardly in existence when this came out. I have felt that remarking on whether a film is good in its genre is less to the point than saying whether it simply is a good movie, and my answer to that for this film is "yes." Whether this is classic noir or not, it is certainly classic Mitchum. He is perfect for the role of Jeff Bailey, a world-weary, somewhat fatalistic detective who has a checkered past and is trying to go straight. In this story Bailey gets deeply involved in complicated events that reach out from the past to entrap him. I had to watch this twice to digest all of the shifting feints and double crossings. When gangster Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas in an early excellent performance) says to Baily, "You just sit and stay inside yourself. You wait for me to talk. I like that," Balily replies, "I never found out much listening to myself." This is is an example of the great one-liners that punctuate this film, and no one character has a monopoly on them. Many films have aspired to achieve the sharp banter that is on display here, but few have succeeded.In addition to the male leads we are treated to great, sexy performances by Jane Greer (as Kathie Moffat) and Rhonda Fleming. Sterling dispatched Bailey to Mexico to locate Moffat, who is on the lam after shooting Sterling (unsuccessfully) and making off with $40,000. The scene where Bailey awaits Moffat in a Mexican bar and she comes in off the sunlight street has to be one of the greatest movie entrances of all time.A lot of this was filmed on location and seeing the real thing makes you you understand that any contemporary movie really can't capture the period details of the 1940s. I particularly liked the scene where the blown open door signifies that a sexual act has taken place. Sometimes the imagination has more effect than the naked details.The black-and-white photography is stunning. The DVD print I watched was pristine. The effectiveness of the filming made me sad to realize that black-and-white film as a unique art form has pretty much passed from the scene. This makes a film out of the past like this one a treasure.</fullReview>

Immensely satisfying. In 1991, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

		<fullReview>What a movie. If I had to give away the term quintessential film noir to any film noir, Out of the Past could very well be it. The plot is complicated yet it is very engrossing, with plenty of effective scenes, especially that unforgettable ending. It is gorgeously shot, exceptionally directed, adeptly scripted and atmospherically scored, these are reasons enough to watch this film. But I can't write this review without praising the acting. Robert Mitchum is memorably languid as the ultra-hard-boiled former private detective, while Jane Greer is dangerously beautiful as the cold yet equally beautiful femme-fatale. Kirk Douglas is also brilliant as the soft-spoken yet truly Machiavellian gangster. Overall, Out of The Past is quite simply quintessential film noir. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very definitive noir classic directed by Jacques Tourneur. You can't get much better than this. Jeff Bailey(Robert Mitchum), a chain-smoking former-gumshoe trying to change his life by running a small gas station in Connecticut, is visited by a man from his past(Paul Valentine). Joe Stephanos urges Jeff to take a small trip to meet with a wealthy gambler/mob guy Whit Sterling(Kirk Douglas). Sterling wants to hire Bailey to track down his jilted lover Kathie(Jane Greer), who left a slug in his shoulder and disappeared with a small fortune in cash. Bailey takes the offer and finds the femme fatal in Mexico with no idea what the gambler's former mistress plans on doing and with whom. Not only is Sterling concerned with Jeff's situation, but also is his former detective partner(Steve Brodie)and local love interest(Rhonda Fleming). Sets and scenery are superb. And a finale that you don't expect. Also in the cast: Dickie Moore, Richard Webb and Virginia Huston.</fullReview>

It seems to be a realistic, trim thriller but the dialog is so good that it echoes long after the movie ends. It is almost Shakespearean because it is more about character than plot but it has a lot of plot, enough for five movies. Everyone should watch this film at least once and see if they ever forget it or Robert Mitchum. What a guy, what an actor, what a movie.

		<shortDescription>Wish They Still Made 'Em Like This...A Singular Example Of The Best In Film Noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely do so many elements come together so perfectly in movie making as in "Out Of The Past". Start with the simple idea a man can reject his former bad life if he goes straight. However, sometimes the past has a reach and when one least expects it attempts to extract it's revenge. Nothing original here, but after that practically everything about this movie is original and well crafted I would imagine it to be one, if not the best, film school examples of the genre.Cinematography, it starts immediately with the symbolism of crossroads (life's decisions?). Also unusual visual points of view, for instance like the viewer is traveling in Joe's car and seeing how Jeff's "hiding in plain sight" is his first mistake. Still, though there's something about this town that may save Jeff, while the main road is cosmopolitan enough the camera clearly shows just a block away it looks like old west prairie with the simple frame church and the symbol of salvation for the fallen.There's not really a need to go on and on because the viewer can see how excellent the lighting, framing, and directing of every shot is. Because the movie is so good you'll want to watch it again it's likely the viewer will pick up even more with repeated viewings. Beyond this more technical part is the artistic part. The three principals put in real "powerhouse" roles. Mitchum is both seemingly able to take care of himself in any situation, a real wise-guy who grew a real (not jail house) conscience. His Jeff Bailey projects strength yet is strangely vulnerable to both his past and his emotions (i.e.., believable). Kurt Douglass plays Whit Sterling with so well the camera just hugs his every nuance with strange affection. It's obvious that an iconic star has arrived. And Jane Greer, well not a Hollywood "bombshell" type, she possesses a girlish beauty and here it's juxtaposed against a damaged world weary detachment. Something a man like Jeff is willing to believe in since he's also running away. Ms. Greer actually had me thinking her character was sweet..Ha! She is perfect for this role.Suffice to say that beyond the beautiful location scenery and top notch acting the story gets more interesting due to what I like to call "left turns" in the script. You won't see them coming and then when the next one is heaped on top you will wonder where it's all going. That is truly the way to keep interest-when the plot twists are not simply for shock, but serve the development of the overall story. Could this film be any better? I really do not think so. Film school lesson 101 for film noir starts here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jacques Tourneur's 'Out of the Past (1947)' has all the required ingredients for the archetypal film-noir: a bold and charismatic hero, wearied by a lifetime of violence and corruption, but reluctantly hauled back into his old world by a past he can't escape; a seductive femme fatale, a seemingly-innocent, pretty enchantress whose loyalty can never be counted upon; a sleazy and vengeful gambler, who's silently holding all the cards that will determine our hero's fate. Daniel Mainwaring's dark and tragic narrative {credited under the pseudonym Geoffrey Homes} combines a linear storyline with reminiscing flashbacks, the latter narrated in a tired, laconic tone of voice by Robert Mitchum {who, after frightening roles in 'The Night of the Hunter (1955)' and 'Cape Fear (1962),' finally convinces me that he can effectively play a hero}. Complete with bleak, shadowy cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca, and no shortage of double- and triple-crossings, 'Out of the Past' ? along with Billy Wilder's masterpiece 'Double Indemnity (1944)' ? remains one of the purest examples of the film noir style.If Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) thought he could escape his old enemies by purchasing an old gas station in a small American town, then he was sorely mistaken. A previous employer, Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas), a seedy and sly gangster, has sent for him, and, more than likely, the meeting has something to do with Kathie (Jane Greer), the beautiful seductress with whom Bailey {back when he was called Jeff Markham} fell in love when he was supposed to be capturing her. Bailey is a smooth, shrewd operator, and recognises that plans have been drawn against him, but he responds to the situation as one whose judgement should never be doubted. The romance described early in the film, as Bailey recounts his doomed love story to local innocent girlfriend, Anne (Virginia Huston), is deceptively touching, and, despite the clear framing device around which the story is structured, I was completely fooled into sympathising with Kathie, only to be left feeling foolish and hollow as her initial betrayal is revealed.In the United Kingdom, Tourneur's film was released under the title 'Build My Gallows High,' also the name of the novel from which the screenplay was adapted. There are enough sharp, bitterly-ironic snippets of dialogue for me to spend all day listing them, but lines such as "Baby, I don't care," "?if I have to, I'll die last" and "you dirty double-crossing rat!" are pure noir, and serve as an excellent introduction to the style of American film-making that was most prominent from 1941-1958 {basically from John Huston's 'The Maltese Falcon' to Orson Welles' 'Touch of Evil'}. The story comes to a successfully downbeat conclusion, with each of the three main characters meeting a messy and tragic end in a suitably Shakespearian fashion. Though Jeff Bailey was ostensibly our story's hero, he had already committed enough sins by the film's beginning to avoid a happy ending, and his fate was effectively sealed from the moment he chose to revisit his past employer, despite obviously having little choice in the matter. Such is film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great film noir classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first had the pleasure of looking at this film on a trip down the Southern Calilfornia coast in the early 1970's. When we stopped off in a motel, I saw this movie, and was taken by it and Robert Mitchums performance. Since that time this film has grown in stature.This film has defined what film noir is supposed to look like, especially those that are meant to entertain us. The photography of a Jacque Tournier film is to be seen in this film, and the cool that Robert Mitchum exhibits and became famous for can also be seen. Jane Greer is great as the woman all the fuss will be about, and Kirk Douglas shows the menace below his smiling face. One of the great things that allows this film to hold up all these years, is in the dialog and the low key acting of the characters. Sometimes in older films because of the moral codes that were in place, they seem dated because people do not swear, (such as in ON THE WATERFRONT). However, in this film, with hardly anyone screaming in this film, and everyone seeming to be cautious of what they might say, bad language is not missed, and the anger that they might have is below the surface, like they are swearing only we don't hear it.What keeps it from being a perfect film I think are some of the San Francisco scenes. They are confusing, and in the case of some of the actresses, I had always felt I was watching one actress, but was really looking at another. This part of the film is really muddled.When I saw this film, I always wondered why Mitchum had never played Philip Marlowe. However, when this film really started to get noticed for the great film it really is in the 1970's, I think Hollywood realized how good he would be as Philip Marlowe, and he started in (Though in his 50's) in FAREWELL MY LOVELY, and the British modern version of THE BIG SLEEP. In watching this film and other Mitchum films, how much better I feel he would have been in THE MALTESE FALCON than Bogart (Bogart had interest in doing OUT OF THE PAST) He could have delivered the same lines, and would have been more believable in the sexual interest that some of the females in that film have towards Sam Spade. I always have felt that Ricardo Cortez in this regards was more believable that Humphrey Bogart in the MALTESE FALCON.</fullReview>

With Kirk Douglas, Rhonda Fleming, Richard Webb, Steve Brodie, Virginia Huston, Paul Valentine, Dickie Moore, Ken Niles.A true masterpiece of film making and obviously a or perhaps rather, THE Leading Exponent of the 'Film Noir' Genre. It seems very hard indeed to find any weak points. In consideration of just about aspect of this movie, it surely makes the grade. If this were to be a report card for the Director, French Born, Jacques Tourneur, would be a "Straight A Student." A movie that is said to be 'Film Noir' has been defined as a film wherein things start out at the bottom and steadily and continually get worse. Well that definition certainly fits OUT OF THE PAST.The story starts out with a well dressed out of towner 'Dude', Joe Stephanos (Paul Valentine) stopping in at the local Gas Station and Grill, inquiring about the Service Station's owner Jeff Bailey alias Jeff Markham (Mitchum).Upon their meeting, Jeff is warned by the young deaf-mute Kid (Dickie Moore), who works at the Filling Station. Without finding out all, we learn that Stephanos had just accidentally spotted Jeff at the Station and having recognized him, sought him out and demanded a pay-off in order to have his whereabouts kept as their secret.Jeff (Mitchum) immediately summons his Lady, Ann Miller (Virginia Huston) and on taking a lengthy drive over to Lake Tahoe, Jeff reveals his past.We learn that he had been a Private Detective and partners with a Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie). They had accepted a job to do some gum shoeing in tracing down a "girlfriend" of Big Time Gambler/Gangster, Whit Sterling (Mr. Kirk Douglas). The 'Lady', Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) is said to have shot Sterling, though not fatally. She also is thought to have split for Mexico with $40,000.00 of the Boss's (1947) cash.Jeff and Jack Fisher take the job, with Jeff insisting on doing the field assignment, while Fisher holds down the fort. They agree to a 'right down the middle' split of their payments for services rendered.Down Acapulco way, he finds her and they get up-close and personal. So, they go "on the Lamb" and avoid all the usual places, but after a while they're spotted by old partner, Jack Fisher, who also decides on blackmailing as a payment method of choice, as it would be far more lucrative.So, about 2 or 3 killings and an equal number of double crosses later, we wind up back at the original town, with all the principals back together, and fighting over the cash like a pack of wolves.And it is here that we will stop and say that this is one super film in any Genre and should be in one's Film Library. The dialog in particular, is lively, bright even funny at times. The Black &amp; White photography actually amplifies the effect of the film's storyline and, along with the fine cinematography, serves to put the viewer right in the picture, without one's knowing it.And the scenario takes in a rapid Merry-Go-Round ride from Tahoe, to L.A. Acapulco, San Francisco and eventually right back to the very spot on the map where we started. And as such, demonstrates a near perfection of symmetry in filming and also in the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SYNOPSIS: A Private Detective with a checkered past tries to start a new life in a small Northern Nevada town. When his past catches up with him, he devises a plan to set things right and protect the woman he loves.CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER: It is easy to be led down the wrong path, especially if you love the wrong person. Sometimes our attempts to make amends or set things right don't always go as we planned. In reality, you often times can't escape your past. It hunts you down and finds you.This is a Film Noir classic. I saw it once in college and was impressed by it, but couldn't remember much of the film since so many years have passed. Watching it again, only makes me realize just how much Hollywood has lost its ability to make really good films.PROS AND CONS: There aren't too many cons about this film. The black and white cinematography looks like it was done by Ansel Adams. Almost every scene in the film is suitable for framing. There is a lot of dramatic lighting, long shadows, cigarettes, hats and trench-coats. The overall feeling of the film is one of intimacy and dark mystery. It draws you in, as though you were sitting in the room with the actors and a part of the conversation. If you want to see what really good screen writing is all about, see this film. In my wildest dreams, I wished I talked like this. Every word carries weight and the comebacks and smart responses are the essence of strong men and women with dark secrets.As for the cons. I suppose the fact that every scene shows someone smoking isn't really a good image for young people today.....the whole film is basically a Phillip-Morris advertisement. The only other con would be the fact that the director and the screenwriter assume the audience isn't stupid. You have to pay attention to this film to really follow it. There are no special effects, explosions or thrill rides to entertain your eyes. You have to listen to what the people are saying and understand their hidden meanings. Basically, a one hour and thirty minute college course in how to make great cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jane Greer "blows like a leave from gutter to gutter."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film, I was amazed to learn that Jane Greer was so young. Compared to the real live women I had known at her age, she played a remarkably mature and evil woman. With all the killers, bad guys and shaddy characters in the film, her character is rotten to the core. The script is not predictable, unlike so many of today's films. Before her character is introduced, we know that she has shot Kirk Douglas and run off with 40K. Kirk, is a white collar criminal who plays a rather naive character - he wants her back, and hires Robert Mitchum who is played for a fool, despite being a clever street wise private detective. Dickie Moore, who was a child star in the silent era, plays a deaf and dumb friend of Mitchum. He ends up pulling Mitchum's would be killer to his death with a trout line, as Mitchum acted as bait. And who sent the killer to kill. Who else but pretty innocent looking Jane.Unlike many of today's films, you could listen to the dialog, and pretty much know what was going on. The film does not rely on car crashes, gore or sex scenes. We know what was going on in Mexico with Mitchum and Greer, without the Director blaring the fact in our faces. And no matter how great the Director and the Actors are, they still can not beat my imagination of what was going on with Mitchum and Greer. She had to be something, for Mitchums's character to do a turn about. You can't help but think that he is a bit sleazy, but only a Jane Greer could make him forget his professional ethics-if private detectives have any ethics at all. They don't seem to have any in the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perhaps the major studio triumph of Touner's career; cast is fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To see Robert Mitchum in a film like Out of the Past is to see one of the benchmarks of the film-noir era and style of film. He wears his trench-coat through many scenes of the film, looking weathered yet strong in his own way as he's put against the elements, and there's a certain tragedy in his performance at times even as he's one of the cooler stars of the 1940's Hollywood system. He stars as Jeff Bailey, a private-eye turned gas station attendant with a past involving a woman, a criminal, and a messy affair that left him running into a kind of 'quiet' life. But he's brought back out of it by his old 'boss'- in a terrific early role from Kirk Douglas (his first scene in the film, as well as one with Jane Greer in the third act, ranks as great)- into something of a trap. While director Jacques Tourner and his screenwriter do a very credible job in telling the story, particularly in setting up the characters and the inherent flaws in them all via the flashback romance, is that the atmosphere trumps over. Tourner, who had his early breaks in the B movies of Val Lewton, does the story and the characters a splendid service in how he gets down the urban settings, and even the scenes in Mexico, on the beach, in a very foreboding office towards the end of the film. There are a few taut twists, but they all work, and the entanglement of Jeff, Kathie and Whitt is one of those classic examples of how its down believably. You might be able to sense what could have been between Jeff and Kathie, but in this situation who's to say why it shouldn't be as dark and (perhaps) existential as this? It's not a humorless film either, and seeing it in an sold-out audience is a delight to add with the entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm from the generation that only knew this as the movie that inspired "Against All Odds." I tried to sit through that just once, but it felt endless and the characters were all really slimy &amp; offputting; none more-so than James Woods. Bleccch.So eventually I got around to this, and I'm writing this long after seeing it.I seem to remember it being deeper than movies of it's era; just as intricate as you'd expect from noir; and long but satisfying. Cathy is an amazing character and the phases of her deception play out over generous spans of time. She's just awful. I don't think I've ever been more agitated watching a movie, as when Robert Mitchum is about to let down his guard in their final car ride. I was shouting at the screen, "Shoot HER! SHOOT HER NOW!" and laughing in the same instant at the movies ability to induce such a frenzy. I love a movie that can draw more than one emotion at once, and other films I admire accomplish something similar. In Rear Window a second after a laugh, Hitchcock supplies the most startling scene in the movie, Terms of Endearment audaciously mixes bathos with humor, and David Lynch's Wild at Heart takes the cake with... well, just see it.Unfortunately Mitchum couldn't hear me yelling.The character of Joe is a big closet case. Happily following Witt around like a lapdog and being his booster. Some of the looks he gives Witt are lovestruck. Very strange.</fullReview>

The other heavy in the movie is Kirk Douglas his second movie of his career turns in a great performance. Kirk portrays his dominance in this picture. Kirk Douglas has a way to turn a role into a winner. The main actress in this incredible film is Jane Greer. Jane is smooth and ruthless. She kills and often. She's beautiful and very smart. Another great actress is Rhonda Fleming. This red head has a very limited role in Out of the Past. But her career is just starting.

		<fullReview>Trust a Frenchman to make a classic of film noir shot mainly in daylight and wide open spaces. At the time the casting was probably unremarked on but in retrospect what we have here is a couple of icons in their salad days, like young stags trying out their first pairs of antlers on each other. There's more than a nod to Hemingway's The Killer's - the original version rather than the remake - in the frame constructed around the flashback; obvious city-bred street-wise tough guy living the life of a Caspar Milquetoast in the middle of East Jesus. This time around Mitchum's Jeff Bailey has moved one grade up from Burt Lancaster's short-order cook and is the proprietor of a modest filling station where, natch, he is spotted by someone from his past and dragged inexorably back into a world he hoped but didn't really believe he had left behind, there to be framed by Kirk Douglas as the mini-tycoon who had hired him in his days as Private heat to find Jane Greer. Most of the classic elements are present and accounted for, low-key dialogue, voice-overs, trench-coats, cordite at midnight. A classic of the genre that more than stands the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going from making dark and ingenious horror films like "Cat People" and "I walked with a Zombie" in the early 1940's director Jacques Tourneur changed lanes in 1947 and directed what many consider the best film-noir movie of all time. The hypnotic, if a bit complicated, Robert Mitchum/Jane Greer classic "Out of the Past". Working at his gas station in Bridgport Calif. Jeff Baily aka Jeff Markham, Robrt Mitchum, is trying to escape from his past and start a new and less stressful life but fate in the form of mobster Joe Stepanos,Paul Valentine, steps in and ruins all his future plans.Joe finding Jeff in Bridgport tells him that his former boss Whit Sterling, Kirk Douglas, want's to see him back in Lake Tahoe. Jeff knows instinctively that his future is going to be anything but peaceful.Taking his girlfriend Ann, Virginia Huston,along Jeff tells her about his dark and shady past, in a long flashback. We then go back some three years when Jeff Markhan was a private detective working for the big time gambler and racketeer Sterling in New York. Sterling is shot and left for dead by his moll Kathie Moffat, Jane Greer, who took off with $40,000.00 of his money never to be seen or heard from again. Jeff taking the case from Sterling to find Kathie travels to Mexico sensing that that's where Kathie would go to get away from the grip of the Sterling Mob. Kathie has no idea that Whit is alive after she shot him for she didn't wait around to find out. Finding Kathie at the Mexican seaside town of Acapulco Jeff instead of informing his boss by telegram of his findings keep it to himself and develops a relationship with her. That leads to them both taking off and leaving Mexico to go on the lamb, and away from the Sterling Mob, in California.In the San Francisco Bay area Jeff by chance sees his fellow private eye and Sterling employee Jack Fisher ,Steve Brodie, at the racetrack. It's then that he knows that it's only a matter of time when Whit finds both him and Kathie and exacts his vengeance on both of them for two timing, by Kathie, and double-crossing, by Jeff, him.The movie "out of the Past" goes back and forth with it connecting two murders, one in Jeff's past and the other that happens late in the film, that he's framed for by Whit Sterling in order to blackmail him. Knowing that he's a marked man and hasn't long to live Jeff tries to distance himself from Ann. Not wanting to bring her into the world that he came from and is now reluctantly going back to. At the end of the movie Jeff's close friend the mute and hearing impaired Kid, Dickie Moore,who works at his gas station lies to Ann about Jeff's true feelings about her in order to keep Ann from falling apart over him leaving her. Dark suspenseful and depressing, but very gripping and engrossing, film that made Robert Mitchum an overnight star and is now the one movie that all other film-noir crime dramas are measured by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film "noir" masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best film ever directed by Jacques Tourneur and one of the Robert Mitchum's best (matched only perhaps by his performance in "The Night of the Hunter"), "Out of the Past" contains in itself probably all of the film "noir" ingredients: the main character (former private detective Jeff Markham played by Robert Mitchum) haunted by his past, strong erotic quality in character's interactions which quite often comes close to perversity, presence of a "femme fatale" whose manipulations often put the main character's life in danger, and Katie (played by Jane Greer) is undoubtedly one of the most "lethal" women that I've ever seen on film. And at last the black and white photography, with it's expressionist touch in lightning, in fact the whole cinematographic structure of the film that gradually descends from somehow idyllic bright beginning of Robert Mitchum's character fishing in the river with his girlfriend towards an almost completely dark and fatal ending. With an exellent, witty script, superb acting and masterful directing, "Out of the Past" is a must-see and see again classic of the American cinema. 10/10</fullReview>

The brightness of the sun to the heavy shadows that are seen during the fight scene. Which I have got to say is one of the most violent fight scenes that I have seen from a movie during this time.

		<shortDescription>Unique Film of the Classic Noir Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of this film is a wonderful introduction into this world created within the noir genre. Robert Mitchum as Jeff Malcolm, the traditional private-eye of the classic genre and this character is amongst my favorite in all the noir films I've seen along with Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep and William Holden in Sunset Blvd. Mitchum in this role seems to have added a rhythm and cadence to his tone of speaking that at times is totally hypnotic. Mitchum's mysterious narration is complemented with clever writing with a sense of great lyricism to the dialogue. The film somehow manages to convince you to trust the perspective of a man who we know is at least somewhat dishonest. We trust him and believe the romance, the path of crime. and the claim that he innocently was involved in a dark past that he is barely responsible for. Kirk Douglas is a commanding performer, here, in only the second role of his career. Jane Greer is in the role of Kathie, the classic femme fatale with a slightly manipulative yet simultaneously charming persona that is at times reminiscent of Phyllis Dietrichson from Double Indemnity. This plot is captivating and is in many ways a blend between The Maltese Falcon and Double Indemnity in several stylistic and narrative aspects. While it isn't quite on the same level as either of those two films I still very much enjoyed the film and and will definitely watch again.</fullReview>

The very first and most important feature is the very dark plot of a man who's past catches up to him no matter how hard he tries to move on from it. The second is that no humor is every shown on any of the characters faces. The background music always adds suspense to the already suspenseful film. Most of the movie is shot at night, as are most noirs. Another quality is that most of the characters in the film are guilty of some kind of crime they committed at some point in their life.

Unfortunately for him, his past is about to catch up with him in the form of a debt owed to Kirk Douglas's nasty gangster. Douglas's mistress, Kathie, absconded with $40,000 and Douglas wants it back, so he employs Mitchum to track the woman down.Unfortunately, Kathie is a classic femme fatale - played with full-scale conniving relish by Jane Greer - and Mitchum soon finds himself falling for her ample charms. What follows then is a ride of betrayal, murder, and of course death, all ably filmed by the great Jacques Tourneur (NIGHT OF THE DEMON). Much of the fun in BUILD MY GALLOWS HIGH comes from the contrast between Douglas's youthful evil and Mitchum's laid back laconic style, and there are the requisite plot elements to enjoy here: sudden character betrayals, bursts of shocking violence, a memorable ending, and lots of smouldering tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is he really bad, or did she make him that way?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living in a small town makes the quietly macho Robert Mitchum seem squeezed in to where he doesn't quite fit in. Even dating the sweetest girl in town (Rhonda Fleming) is a tough factor to take. But when he is given the opportunity to go to Mexico to search for the missing girlfriend of an old pal (Kirk Douglas), Mitchum is outa there. This quietly sleepy Mexican village has Mitchum just as bored, until she walks in. She's Jane Greer, one of the most unforgettable vixens in film noir, and she plays so hard to get that you know it will be only a matter of time before the chaser is caught by the chasee. Stanwyck....Hayward....Tierney...Trevor...Savage....Bennett....Lake ....Scott....Mayo. These are the last names of some of the phenomenal actresses who have entered the legendary list of femme fatals in one of the most studied of all movie formulas. The mid-late 1940's brought the darkness of human nature out into the open, and women, who had gained independence while the men were away fighting, represented a sex which was determined to keep that newly found freedom and not return to the sweet little housewife that they had been before. Bad girls had always existed in movies, even ones who killed. But this new breed had a confidence they hadn't known before. Jane Greer's Kathie combines sultry femininity with sociopathic danger, and like many other women in these films, wasn't afraid of risking it all to commit murder, not even her soul.There is no way to pick what the best film noir is, but this certainly must be somewhere in the top 20, at least. Every element of this film is intriguing and dark, from the moment Mitchum begins to tell Fleming the story of how he became involved with Greer in the first place to the final fade-out where Fleming tries to grasp everything that has happened. How does a woman come to the point of such evil where human life, so usually valued by the women who create it, becomes dispensable like an old purse? Greer has no qualms about watching Mitchum defending them both with one of Douglas's cronies then after a few minutes end it with the pulling of a trigger. She's a bit sadomasochistic in that sense, and that makes her fun to watch.Questions arise from other characters in this film to indicate that Mitchum's character is no good. He was pulled out of an obvious dull existence, pretty much forgot about it when finding the most exciting life he could away from the countryside, so it is difficult to return back to it. Fleming and the others in the small town (which includes a very handsome Dickie Moore playing a deaf and dumb observer to Mitchum's destructive acts) can't imagine Mitchum's change thanks to a woman like Greer, so in a sense, this is about more than just the story. It is about character and how sin can seem intriguing and even justifiable. There are lots of questions left when the film concludes with a shocking finale, which is perhaps what the writer intended. The study of humanity on film finally gets a reality check thanks to changes in the world we didn't see coming before the war began that truly slapped us in the face once it ended.</fullReview>

Out of the Past also had a wonderful representation of the femme fatal that is seen in most film noirs. I felt that there was a very realistic feel to the film, due to the interaction and development of the characters. I would recommend this film to anyone looking to watch a dark drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analysis for Out of the Past (1947)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find this film a little better than "Mildred Pierce" because of the great acting, the darkness of the film, and the writing of the film. It does, however, come with a very dark ending. I did not like the way that Kathie and Jeff get killed in the end. It really lost me there, because there was a lot of violence in the end. I do not like violence. It really hurts the way I watch the film. On a brighter note, it does come with a cult following. I really like the fact that has a good moral. Don't betray others, or else you and/or others will pay the consequences for your actions. I have been keeping that moral for the last few years, and this film has helped me a little more. Watching this film can help others as well when they watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of the Past (1947) **** (out of 4)Excellent film noir from director Jacques Tourneur has a detective (Robert Mitchum) being hired by a mobster (Kirk Douglas) to track down a woman (Jane Greer) who double crossed him. When the detective finds the woman the two quickly fall for one another, which will lead to disaster in the future. OUT OF THE PAST is considered by many to be the greatest noir ever made and I certainly won't argue. I think the entire noir genre has so many different great films that many people could argue for any of them but to me it just seems all of the elements are at full force here and this includes some terrific dialogue and performances. For me the greatest thing about this movie are the performances with Mitchum really standing out in one of his greatest roles. The dialogue fits Mitchum so perfectly because of that tough, laid-back nature of his and he has no problem throwing out this dialogue and making it sound cool. Mitchum was always able to use this cool nature of his and it was simply born to be hidden in dark shadows and smoke. Greer is also extremely good because of the cold-blooded nature she's able to give the character. Even Douglas is wonderful here and I don't think he ever gets the credit he deserves for his role here. The wonderful coldness that he brings the character is just fun to watch and you can't help but see what a snake this guy is. The cinematography and music score are both top-notch and really work well with one another. There are many great scenes here but I think my favorite remains the scene in the cabin where Mitchum is fighting his ex-partner and we see the woman's reaction with just a bunch of shadows bouncing off of her. OUT OF THE PAST is a fast and fun noir that manages to be cool and tough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jacques Tourneur directed this famous film noir that stars Robert Mitchum as Jeff Bailey, an ex-private detective hiding out in a small-town from his past, which eventually catches up with him. It seems that Jeff was hired by gangster Whit Sterling(played by Kirk Douglas) to find his missing mistress Kathie(played by Jane Greer) who had shot him and stole $40,000! He does locate her in Acupulco, where they end up falling in love, though she ends up killing someone, driving him away, but both Whit &amp; Kathie return into his life, with fatal consequences... Memorable film with fine acting and moody direction leading these two troubled and doomed people to their inevitable fate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie played as a retrospective at the International Film Festvial in Berlin this year. A movie that can be considered a classic I reckon, but that I never got a chance of watching up to that point. The acting is great and the story moves along very nicely. The dialog is fast and funny as you might have seen and heard from other movies of that era and/or genre that is.There are some nice twists and turns in the story that make it a great watch. I won't reveal anything about the story of course, but if you like film noir, detective movies and a movie that is tension filled from beginning to the end, this is for you. You shouldn't mind that it's only in black &amp; white either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir At The Peak Of Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year was 1947.World War 2 had come and gone.The world seemed to have grown-up some since the war. War is like that, sometimes. It has a tendency to mature a lot of attitudes - Even Hollywood's.Post-WW2 movie-making was, to say the least, phenomenal. It was like yet another celebration of glorious victory. Some of the most memorable and impressive films to come out of Hollywood were, in fact, produced between the years of 1945-1960. In my opinion this was Hollywood's ultimate "hey-day".Out Of the Past (OOTP) is a prime example of Hollywood movie-making excellence. From its tight script, to the mature dialog and subject matter, to the excellent cinematography, to the great direction, and, last, but not least, to the superb cast and their top-rate performances, OOTP is a classic piece of Film Noir that is arguably the absolute best in its genre.Fact: For many years that followed OOTP's release it was, literally, the one and only film that was used as a yard-stick to measure and rate any other flick that fit into the film classification of Film Noir.OOTP's intriguing plot-line is so intricately woven with double-crosses and even triple-crosses that it will keep any fan of 1940's Film Noir, like myself, hooked from the start to its "final showdown" finish.The most notable performance in OOTP was, of course, that of Robert Mitchum. The role of Jeff Bailey was clearly written with Mitchum specifically in mind. Mitchum's strong command of his character never missed a beat.Mitchum was at the absolute height of his career in OOTP. During this era of his profession Mitchum was one of Hollywoood's most popular and bankable actors. It would be another 10 years before chronic alcohol-abuse and reckless partying would ravage his solid good looks and age him prematurely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through the Past Darkly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the small town Bridgeport, California, secretive service station owner Robert Mitchum (as Jeffrey "Jeff" Bailey) is enjoying a break with pretty girlfriend Virginia Huston (as Ann Miller). He receives word from deaf mute Dickie Moore that henchman Paul Valentine (as Joe Stephanos) has arrived with an invitation to meet mobster Kirk Douglas (as Whit Sterling). We learn Mr. Mitchum (ne Markham) is trying to leave a dark past behind. In an extended flashback, he is a private detective hired by Mr. Douglas to find duplicitous beauty Jane Greer (as Kathie Moffat) and a missing $40,000...The storyline, flashback and ending could be clearer - but such confusion seems to have become acceptable for the "film noir" genre. What makes this an excellent film is the dark look given "Out of the Past" by director Jacques Tourneur and cinematographer Nick Musuraca. The characterizations are first-rate. An ardent cigarette smoker, Mitchum is a nonchalant narrator and protagonist. As the wordless "Kid", young Moore does well after a three year screen absence (he served in World War II). In a figure flattering dress, also watch for Rhonda Fleming (as Meta Carson) to make a big impression.******** Out of the Past (11/13/47) Jacques Tourneur ~ Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, Kirk Douglas, Dickie Moore</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Except for a few minor quibbles which I'll get to, this is one fine example of noir that in a lot of respects sets the standard for the genre. Particularly mesmerizing is Jane Greer as the scheming Kathie Moffat, who by the end of the story, if you don't want to see her get what she's got coming, you just haven't paid enough attention. Complementing her effort is the always reliable Robert Mitchum, who basically has a solid citizen past, but gets caught up in the machinations of big time gambler Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas) who gets to tell his henchmen when to jump and how high.What really impressed me here was the clever dialog throughout, with about the best one liners this side of "The Maltese Falcon". The one in my summary is pretty classy, but now that I think about it, didn't really apply to Greer's character, because she proved herself fairly competent with a handgun, going two for two (three if you want to count Mitchum at the finale) in the marksmanship area. I also liked the one from Sterling about his boy Stephanos (Paul Valentine), stating he couldn't find a prayer in the Bible. I'd love to come up with stuff like that on my own.Anyway, about those quibbles I mentioned. When Markham (Mitchum) locates the briefcase in Baylord's (John Kellogg) office, he never looks to make sure the tax documents are still inside. A minor point I know, but it's something I would have done, so that's why I bring it up. Then you've got Joe Stephanos going over the side of that cliff because of The Kid's (Dickie Moore) accurate casting. But the sheer physics involved with the length of line and Stephanos' hefty physique didn't make that scene very credible to me. Interesting and ironic sure, but not credible.The kicker in all of this if you're rooting for Mitchum's character is that he doesn't make it to the end of the story. I wanted to see good old Kathie take her lumps, but felt pretty good about Markham/Bailey coming through with a check in the win column. Not only not so, but The Kid had to shake his head the wrong way to crush Markham's new gal (Virginia Huston). I know why he did it, but that was one tough sayonara. I guess that's why they call it noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie seems to use the technical things to make the main points stand out more. For example the intense lighting used, makes the scenes more dramatic. It uses low key lighting, with bright faces and dark shadows or/and backgrounds. I liked when they switch from the background being dark to the people being dark instead to show this dramatic fight between two men. The day light scenes, seem intense also at times. It seems that they still use low key lighting because of the shadows. It is almost like a combination of both low and high key lighting. The way they chose to light their scenes adds more emotion to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the film that will determine it all, whether you in particular have a taste for film noir or not. Out of the Past contains classic elements such as the plot revolving around a murder, dark lighting and shadows and a femme fatale, all of which pertain to the film noir genre. Our hero Jeff Bailey is played by Robert Mitchum who plays him with such nonchalance that he may very well have helped create the image of the stereotypical private eye; cool, calm and collected even when he knows he's in trouble. The cast in general is relatively large and amazing.My biggest criticism is that at times, it's difficult to keep up with the plot. (But that's what second viewings are for right?) A lot is going on and it becomes a complicated web of deception at times. The cinematography characteristically follows the guidelines of a film noir; dark, dark, dark. The film is intelligent and should be seen if you would like to (or already) have a taste of the film noir genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a "classic" film. You overlook black/white and imperfect sound after a few minutes, due to other qualities that still stand out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ghent filmfestival 2012 programmed this film under the heading "classics", and it truly belongs there in every meaning of the word. I must confess that I had never before considered seeing this film. Many oldies are slow and tedious, more often than not, but I stand corrected after seeing this one. After a few minutes you overlook that the film is in black and white. And the story is also well told and switches from one scene to the next at well chosen moments.Typically dating back to half a century ago is the number of cigarettes being lighted as a matter of course, outside and inside the house and without politely asking for objections. Such things mark this film more as ancient than the missing colors and the imperfect sound, in my opinion. And I found also remarkable the very very short credits at the end, compared with recent movies where you can sit watching credits for many minutes (but may be missing from the copy they used).In hindsight it was very unusual that nearly 2/3 of the film's running time, roughly the whole first hour, is devoted to things that happened in the past. This happens after our main character has decided to reveal his not so innocent past to his fiance. He has continuously postponed telling her about his previous job as a private detective, during which years some unethical things happened. The story is told while riding from their home village to the location where he expects to get a new assignment. It is shown in the form of a continuous flashback, during which you nearly forget that it is indeed a flashback.In the last half hour, the remaining 1/3 of the 97 minutes running time, the story returns to the assignment at hand. At that point the aforementioned comprehensive flashback is paying off. Several people who haven't seen each other in years, appear one after another, all of them having several axes to grind. Apart from that situation full of tension, able to develop in many directions, we are left in the dark who is telling the truth and nothing but the truth. Even worse, it soon becomes apparent that we cannot even trust our main character to do the right thing.As said before, my hesitations to book tickets for an oldie film proved wrong. This one is neither tedious nor slow, letting us continuously wonder what will happen next. Who cares about black and white, or imperfect sound for that matter?? Most (2/3) of the running time of this film is devoted to showing the past of the main characters, which fact matches the title of the movie in full, due to the heavy burden all participants bring out of the past. Everyone is formed by his/her past for a considerable amount, and that is particularly true when your past haunts you due to unfinished business. A perfect illustration of that principle can be found in this film.</fullReview>

The dialog was tight but not nearly as tight as some of the dialog in Double Indemnity but it's definitely beyond the hearing interpretation of today's generation. The dialog whips out like a switchblade and it slices and dices.The plot begins simple but gets complicated and there's some nice twists that liven things up.If you're an experienced Noir fan, you'll be wishing you could tell the Jeff not to trust Kathie. She's a spider baiting him into her web of lies. It's like watching a horror flick and knowing the protagonists shouldn't go up stairs.This film exceeded my expectations, I enjoyed it. I knew it had Robert Mitchum and was surprised when saw Kurt Douglas. A great flick but not necessary one to introduce someone to the Noir genre. There are other Noir flicks that are more Noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very interesting Noir film since watching "Mildred Pierce", this one take a darker turn into the genre of detective work. Like all other Noir films, this one follows the work of a detective. However, this one takes a different approach: he tries to escape his past and move on to a new life. Despite what he wants, he keeps getting dragged into his old past life. This film is good in that the detective Jeff keeps having to deal with his girl, who happens to murder some people and even tries to pin those murders on him.

		<fullReview>This firm turns up on most Top Ten firm noir lists. Some rate it the best ever made. Watching it again recently, I found it consistently good and often brilliant. The scene in which the male and female leads (Mitchum and Greer) meet in an Acapulco cafe is among the truly memorable scenes put onto the screen: moody location, witty dialogue, palpable sexual tension, and the knowledge ? held in suspension by the vitality of the characters ? that it is the beginning of their mutual destruction. The film is put together like a Swiss clock; the two halves are discrete stories, with their own narrative development and denouement, but the one is like the nitrate packed into a larger, second projectile that Tournier fires midway through his tight 97 minute schedule. Because the story creates a solid 'present day' before it moves into flashback and is supplied with a small set of characters, who sit outside the action of its two mise-en-scene halves (the 'clean' love interest and a deaf mute boy), the clock keeps perfect time. We, the audience, are left wondering how it will end right up to the last moment, and, unlike many films, the secondary characters, left on stage at the end, are given a meaningful resolution rather than just cast aside, having fulfilled their plotting purpose. Greer as the memorable femme fatale character is terrific. She keeps all the elements in movement ? vulnerability, manipulativeness, tenderness and deadliness ? so that one can never quite give up on her. Mitchum does the hard-boiled 'detective', a character type he made his own, with wonderful gusto and inflection. Kirk Douglas as the glamorous crime boss takes a familiar cinema character to a level rarely reached, with his fascinating mixture of charm and menace. Special mention should be made, too, of Paul Valentine, as the crime boss's enforcer. Again, a familiar part is filled out to make something substantial; it is a definitive performance. The scene in which he describes his feelings on killing one of his boss's targets is more disturbing that any graphic representation of the action event (not shown) could be.A must for film noir buffs, this film makes a case for inclusion in any Top 100 cinema collection.</fullReview>

I found this movie to be very fascinating because there was only one girl causing all the chaos just for the greed of money. I love the killing schemes that were set up; I thought it was funny and also suspenseful. This movie is just so good because of everything that went down. It was suspenseful and had lots of drama. The journey they had was so fun to watch and exhilarating, like everywhere they went something bad happened. This movie is the true definition of film noir, from the gloomy look on every scene to the killing. I believe this movie should be remade because it was such a prodigious movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Side Notes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot or repeat consensus points. Instead, I'll bring up a few neglected points.Making the Kid (Moore) a deaf mute is an inspired atmospheric feature. That way a rather jarring and mysterious note occurs right at the beginning when the Kid fails to respond to Joe's (Valentine) normal question. And when he and Jeff (Mitchum) communicate in sign language, it's like Jeff also participates in that special world, setting him too apart from the rest of us.Jeff and the Kid are also bonded with nature, as shown in the gloriously picturesque fishing sequence. So it's only logical that when a figure from the dark side, namely Joe, invades that world, he meets a bad end. Note too that it's the Kid who stops Joe, and with a weapon connected to nature, that is, a fishing rod. Jeff's problem is that he has one foot in this world of light but the other in the fatal world of dark, the one he can't resist.Note too, how despite all the killings, the cops are nowhere in sight until the very end. It's like they don't even exist. This absence reinforces a noirish world where impunity reigns and justice becomes a purely private matter. It also produces one of the most nihilistic of all noirs.Anyway, the movie is clearly a classic of its kind, and that's despite a brain-wracking middle part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Finally caught back up to this one after close to 30 years. I have always listed it among my favorite Film Noir movies and now I remember why! The story is not dissimilar to many of the detective films from the 40's and 50's, but this one is based on Daniel Mainwaring's brilliantly titled novel "Buld My Gallows High". It stars ultra-cool Robert Mitchum and an up and coming actor named Kirk Douglas, in just his second film.As with any Film Noir, there must be a woman stirring up trouble for the men who just can't seem to think clearly around them. Here we get two fabulous women who can't be trusted: Jane Greer and Rhonda Fleming. We also get some of the most creative lighting you will ever see in a movie. I am guessing the production budget was very small, but the shadows and darkness work very well for the story. The next best part of this one is the stream of classic lines. Some are funny and others are quite jolting given the seriousness with which they are delivered.The movie is directed by Jacques Tourneur, who also directed "Cat People" just a few years prior. His best scenes here involve Mitchum, Greer and Douglas playing cat and mouse with dialogue, but I also enjoy Rhonda Fleming's brief but impactful appearance.A couple of interesting notes on those involved. Jane Greer was discovered by Howard Hughes and has some pretty frightening things to say about their time together. She was a very young bride to Rudy Vallee, but Hughes broke up the marriage pretty quickly. Ms. Greer also appeared in "Against All Odds" in 1984. That film was basically an updated remake of this film. In that film, she played the mother of Rachel Ward's character. Since this was Kirk Douglas' second film, you can really see how little range he had at this point. Very interesting to compare this to some of his later work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was really good. I know that is a very sophomoric way of putting it, but it remains true nonetheless. All of the classic elements of film noir are on full display in Out Of The Past, including story filling flashbacks, gritty gangsters, and the obligatory femme fatal. So, to start, the first thing that I really noticed about this film was its excellent cinematography. Every shot seemed exceedingly well put together, with no minute detail left to chance. The excellent use of contrasting light to typify the different characters in their relation not only to each other, but to the story as whole was first rate. The rough feel of a something so polished is an odd exception to the other film noir films of that era. The film, while at the outset seeming slow and rustic, never really loses its, for lack of a better term, " gritty" feel. As a viewer, you are drawn to this world of mobsters and mayhem, risk and redemption. It is hard not to be with the caliber of acting present in this film. What an outstanding case. Obviously as a viewer, one would expect the big name actors, Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, and Kirk Douglas, to deliver great performances (which they do), but the all around supporting cast was just as equally enjoyable to watch. Of those worth particular mention would be Paul Valentine as Joe Stephanos, as well as Rhonda Fleming as Meta Carson. These supporting actors and their role in the story is what for me made this movie a true classic. Lastly, I enjoyed the plot itself. To be sure, it reminded me a bit of the film A History Of Violence with Viggo Mortensen, but it was still great. The double crossing of double crossers who double crossed in the first place was admittedly a little hard to follow at first, but the film does an excellent job of keeping things in order. This is truly a credit to the writers and director. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would definitely recommend it to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Mitchum stars in this film noir as Jeff Bailey, a man that can't catch a break. Bailey is living a new life as a gas station owner when his troubled past catches up to him. The film goes on an exciting ride with many twists and turns from there. A young Kirk Douglas turns in a strong performance, along with Mitchum, as Whit Sterling a gambler looking to track down an old flame that robbed him. The old flame, Kathy, is played by Jane Greer. Greer's performance dominated the film despite the strong cast, and defined her career. Greer played to perfection a beautiful woman with an agenda that was horrible. Greer's character left you in stunned disbelief throughout the film, and her ability as an actress made the negative feelings very real for the audience. The film as a whole was well done, and like many film noir left you with a sense of despair. The charms of an evil woman in this film lead to a series of bad events for the leading men, and one very entertaining film for the audience.</fullReview>

They do some researching and turns out she's been hiding out in Acapulco, Kathie seduces Jeff and makes him forget about the man who hired him in the first place - only thing is that it's all a scam and it only leads for more trouble ahead for Jeff.A really great film noir, really dramatic and features the typical femme fatale present in most films of the time. Great actors and great filming with an interesting plot and storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>out of the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely a film noir. There are many examples of scenes with dark shadows and sharp lights. Examples include a car scene when Kathy and Jeff are in a car together, and also when these two characters come back together at Whit's house after their relationship on the run didn't work out. Not only do the movie scenes distinguish this noir, but also having an alienated lead character (Jeff) and a femme fatale (Kathy) also gives the impression that this film is a noir.Along with the film noir aspects of the movie, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, and the directing were great in this movie. The story was believable for the movie and kept me hooked throughout the film. It was a little hard to follow Jeff as he works for Whit a second time. He knows that they are trying to frame him, but to follow Whit, Kathy, and Jeff during this film can be confusing at times. The ending was very interesting for me. I keep thinking of this question. Was Jeff really running away with Kathy and the police? Or did Jeff's deaf worker just say that he was to Ann so she could get over Jeff and have a better life? I can't help but think that Jeff did what he did to make sure that all of the bad people, including Jeff himself, got what they deserved. Even if that means Jeff dying himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shadows of the Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many remember Jacques Tourneur for directing classic Hollywood horror films such as Cat People (1942) and I Walked with a Zombie (1943), both of which are good and well made. But Tourneur didn't just direct horror films for RKO he also made dark crime stories; Berlin Express (1948), Nightfall (1957) and Out of the Past (1947). The latter is his most famous film-noir with an impressive cast. It's a love triangle structured in five sequences. Typically for film-noirs the plot has many layers and it is very complex at some points even very hard to understand, but I don't think the understanding of the multi-storey plot is important.A man arrives to a gas station looking for the owner, Jeff Bailey. A kid goes to warn Bailey who is fishing with his girlfriend. When Bailey meets this mysterious stranger he is forced to leave the calm quiet life and gets drawn back to the underworld, where he finds his long lost love. But the love of Bailey is actually his crime boss' girl, from whom he once stole a lot of money and escaped to Mexico. Shadows of the past won't let Bailey alone and he is torn between good and evil - his present kind country girlfriend and 'femme fatale' the woman he once loved.The story is very complex and the femme fatale, Kathie Moffat seems to be playing many games at once. It is quite challenging to keep track of all the events, but that is not the point. One who watched Out of the Past as an entirety will get an astonishing experience. The hallmarks of film-noir are well known, all of which can be found in Out of the Past; femme fatale, flashbacks, moral complexity, cynicism, exotic milieus, darkness that surrounds and the postwar disillusions. Out of the Past is an overlooked classic, which can easily be compared with the classic noirs of Welles, Hawks, Huston and Wilder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of the Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French-American director Jacques Tourneur (1904-1977) is probably best known for his classic horror films, such as Cat People (1942) and I Walked with a Zombie (1943), but film noir was not unfamiliar to him either. His 1947 detective story Out of the Past is based on the novel Build My Gallows High by Daniel Mainwaring and tells the story of a gas station owner named Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) in a little California town. One day a strange man named Joe (Paul Valentine) comes to meet him, bringing unwelcome memories from Jeff's shady past to the community. Jeff decides to tell the truth about himself to his girlfriend Ann (Virginia Huston): years earlier, he used to work as a private investigator in New York but fled after becoming romantically connected to a woman named Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who he was supposed to track down for a rich gangster Whit Sterling (the calm Kirk Douglas). Hoping to set things straight for the future, Jeff agrees to meet Whit and Kathie again and accepts their new unpleasant job offer...The many turns of the plot require attentive viewing, but the most enjoyable aspect of Out of the Past is the portrayal of the tense relationships between the characters. The femme fatale role of the movie has been given to the beautiful Jane Greer who hides Kathie's scheming, deceptive plans under her fragile appearance excellently. Jeff, like the audience, has to keep guessing her true motives throughout the story, but he is hardly a straightforward everyman himself: it becomes clear that he knows more than he lets out when willingly participating in the cunning plan of Whit Sterling, a suave gambler obviously seeking revenge on Jeff even while presenting his offer as an ordinary job. Jeff's new assignment leads him to meet another sly lady Meta Carson (Rhonda Fleming), who is not easy to handle either and further accelerates his slow sinking into the world of blackmail beyond the point of no return.The characters' multidimensional natures in general are also among the strong points of the tale. Despite his casual attitude to the tragic events that surround him in the proximity of Kathie and Whit, Jeff has a mystified and romanticized view of the women of his life, strongly exemplified by the very ending scene with Ann and a deaf young man (Dickie Moore) working at Jeff's gas station. Without revealing too much, I think the moment shows that Jeff has always had their best on his mind, even when doing the right thing is known to be painful.As can be expected from a classic film noir, the black and white visual style with stark lighting contrasts and shadows is very nice to look at. The mountain landscapes of Lake Tahoe also provide a very good-looking alternative to the usual dark urban streets; not that there's anything wrong about them though. Even though Out of the Past is not one of my favourite noirs, the downbeat atmosphere and interesting characters make the tragedy very watchable ? the best elements of noir cinema are well used by Tourneur and the writers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noir classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to the BBC this year for its additional festive present to film noir lovers like me by running a season of classics over this Christmas period, including this classic.Employing most of the classic noir devices such as a hard-boiled (ex)-private eye (Robert Mitchum), scheming, beautiful femme fatale (Jane Greer), plenty double-dealing, fisticuffs and murders, this involving tale grabs you from the off. I won't attempt to summarise the plot, just watch the movie and let it pull you in, pretty much the way that Greer's character does to Mitchum.The movie seems to me to rely a little less on the more expressionist exhibitions of noir cinematography, although there is darkness and shadow at key scenes, particularly when Greer kills Mitchum's erstwhile partner, out for his share of the finder's fee and I also enjoyed the car-subjective shot in the very opening scenes, a little reminiscent of Welles' tour-de-force tracking shot at the start of 'Touch of Evil'. From there the typically convoluted plot takes us on Mitchum's travels as he tracks down only to fall irresistibly for gangster's moll Greer, on the run from spurned tough guy Kirk Douglas. The myriad plot developments this time are discernible (not always the case with film noir narratives) and as ever all the loose ends are violently tied up up by the conclusion, taking in a bitter-sweet final vignette just for good measure to allow Mitchum's new girl-friend to let his memory go and get on with her life.The acting is as good as you'd expect, Mitchum the definition of tough laconic-ism, ditto Greer as dangerously beautiful and Douglas as malevolently powerful, with everyone else in support right on the money too. The dialogue is just short of Chandler / Hammett standards, but still contains some genre classics, none more so than Mitchum's 'Baby I Don't Care' (taken later as the title of an excellent biography of Mitch's) uttered mid-clinch to Greer as he willingly trips, stumbles and falls for her considerable, but perilous charms.Quite simply, one of the best thrillers to come out of the whole noir era which I heartily recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through the 1940s, before the Hollywood studio system folded itself into the social conformity of the 1950s, several well-written and superbly plotted stories made it to the silver screen. In the category of film noir, Out of the Past, starring Robert Mitchum?one of the more individualistic, risk-taking actors (even into the 1950s)?is one such gem.The above statement from Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) occurs early in the movie as we find him in a small California town trying to lead a normal life. We even see him out fishing (!), with his local honey Ann (Virginia Huston), and looking every bit like the guy who wants to settle down, buy a house, raise a passel of kids in the country. Not! Bailey's contemplation of the idyllic life is interrupted when another big man?menacing, obviously from a past Bailey wants to leave that way?finds Bailey, and gives him an appointment he cannot refuse. ...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2009</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An underrated film noir by Jacques Tourneur, "Out of the Past" stars Robert Mitchum as Jeff Baily, a gas station owner with a mysterious past. It turns out he was once a private investigator hired to track down the missing wife of a shady businessman called Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas), but fell in love and ran off with the girl instead. The rest of Tourneur's film progresses in typical noir fashion, we the audience watching with delight as its labyrinthine plot slowly unfolds. Criminals are murdered, people are double-crossed, characters trade witty dialogue and money is exchanged. By the film's end everyone is literally dead or worse off, but we can't help but smile. This is noir, after all. You're doomed the moment the title credits start rolling.Though its missing the more obvious auteurist brush-strokes of a Hitch, Hawks, Houston, or Lang, "Out of the Past" is a first rate film noir, every bit as good as its more well known siblings. Stand out scenes include a brutal fist fight, an extended sequence in which Mitchum cleans up a crime scene and some seriously sexy verbal jousting between him and Jane Greer.Today Tourneur's been mostly forgotten, though many still keep his flame alive. He's best remembered for "Nightfall", arguably a greater noir than "Out of the Past", and of course "Cat People" and "I Walked With a Zombie". Director Martin Scorsese rates his "Night of the Demon" highly, and many deem his "Wichita" a masterpiece.8.5/10 - Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Out of the Past" has definite film noir style to it, such as: deep shadows and dramatic lighting, as well as character narration, gloomy music, and the typical story of crime. However, it's unique because the protagonist is not the hardboiled, incorruptible dark knight like Humphrey Bogart was in the film noir films he starred in. Robert Mitchum is a form of detective and he is a tough guy, but his character though does not necessarily follow the original film noir hero.Rather than blending in with villainy and keeping strong to morals, his character instead allows to be penetrated by a beautiful woman (Jane Greer) who takes on the transition of being an innocent and pretty gal to a masculine and deceptive villain. Not giving too much more of the story, "Out of the Past" is about a woman who changes from the stereotype female character of innocence and purity to a killer and thief, while the hero gets sucked and controlled by this woman. In a sense, this makes the movie a battle of sexes, where the woman proves the dominating factor and the male is ultimately defeated. In the dramatic climax, it leads to the idea that if a woman gets too much power; she will not only be destroyed, but also ruin the people around her.Overall, this is a pretty good film noir that holds to the genres unique film-making techniques, but it also delivers a provocative message through subtle imagery. It is not the best thing I have seen, but it was a good ride for all 97 minutes. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Former private detective Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) is living a quiet life in a small town, running a gas station and dating local girl Ann Miller (Virginia Huston). One day a man from his past shows up and tells Jeff his former employer (Kirk Douglas) is looking for him. Jeff has no choice but return to his old life to tie up loose ends. Before he does that, though, he tells the story of what led him to this point, including his involvement with a duplicitous woman named Kathie (Jane Greer).Superb performances from all. One of Robert Mitchum's best roles and certainly Jane Greer's best, as one of the most memorable femme fatales the movies ever saw. Kirk Douglas is great in his second picture. Special praise for Paul Valentine, in his film debut, who stands toe to toe with movie legends and holds his own. Even supporting actors like Dickie Moore, Rhonda Fleming, and Steve Brodie are terrific. Brilliant direction from Jacques Tourneur (his best film) and cinematography from Nicholas Musuraca that perfectly captures the ideal look of film noir. The excellent script has lots of sharp, quotable lines. Daniel Mainwaring adapted his own novel, with uncredited help from James M. Cain and Frank Fenton.One of the greatest film noirs ever made. Perhaps the greatest. It's essential viewing for anybody who loves movies and film noir, in particular. A stylish, atmospheric, cynical film with a surprisingly upbeat moment at the end. There's not enough good things that can be said about this classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was recommended to me after discussing Robert Mitchum's great performance in 'Night of the Hunter'. In comparison to his over-the-top baddies such as that and 'Cape Fear', this is probably one of his most understated &amp; natural performances.The opening sequence is classic noir- man wearing trench coat shows up looking for another man. A chase starts; a game of cat &amp; mouse- then all the classic characters soon show up. However, Kathie is not your typical femme fatale. She's not anywhere as cold &amp; calculating as Barbara Stanwyck in 'Double Indemnity', but she still uses her beautiful feminine whiles to get what she wants. She's manipulative and pathetic actually, which makes for a more believable relationship that Mitchum would just fall head over heels for her.I was also pleasantly surprised to see a young Kirk Douglas (sans his usual loin cloth) playing a bad guy. His gleeful bullying of Mitchum was another turn of realism- the real villains never get their hands dirty.This film may not have some of the juicier or dirtier plots out there in the noir genre, but it's still a well-paced mystery. The ending seems a little abrupt, but like most noir it's the chase that gives the most rewards &amp; the endings are usually clich or hackneyed. See this for great snappy one-liners, smoldering physical chemistry, and a reminder that "most dames are nothing but trouble, but don't you love trouble anyway".</fullReview>

Given that this was a relatively small-budgeted RKO film, it is remarkable how Tourneur makes this film look so crisp, and the shadowy cinematography so beautiful.

		<shortDescription>The Best 40s Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing wrong with "Out of the Past." It is hands down the best film noir to be released in the 1940s (even better than "Double Indemnity," high praise indeed from me), and it rivals "Sunset Boulevard" and "Kiss Me Deadly" as my favorite noir of all time.Robert Mitchum plays a regular Joe, quietly living an ordinary life in some out of the way sleepy American town, whose criminal past catches up with him and refuses to let him go. It's reminiscent of last year's "A History of Violence," and explores some of the same themes as David Cronenberg's film: Can we forget the past if the past doesn't want to forget us? Mitchum delivers a spectacular performance; his craggy, mournful face is the very picture of a man who knows he's living on borrowed time. Jane Greer is the sizzling femme fatale who has his number. And Kirk Douglas appears in an early performance as a cold-blooded crime boss.What else can I say about the movie other than it's virtually flawless. Stark, moody cinematography; haunting score; terrific, sharp dialogue. This is one of the most quotable films ever.A don't miss.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read so many reviews praising the movie it was a natural choice for me as I love film noir. Though I was kind of let down by the overall lack of atmosphere the film does have a substantial plot and plenty of sharp dialogue.Robert Mitchum plays a private snoop hired to find the moll of a gangster after she flees to Mexico with a stash of his dough. He finds her alright, but they fall in love, and try, and fail, to begin anew by themselves.Told partly in retrospect the film plays with its timeline creatively and adds a touch of sophistication to what would otherwise be a straight-forward narrative. Mitchum emotes very little as the sly gumshoe while Kirk Douglas plays the villain with a pleasant air of cheerfulness.But what disappointed me is the absence of darkness. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of alleyways, gusts of wind, lightning flashes and shadows...but just not enough. I was left with no lasting images in my head, which is a big reason why I am a fan of the genre. Too many scenes were set in bright daylight with wide open spaces. Such locations just don't work in Noir, in my opinion.Still, Out of the Past (known as Build my Gallows High in the UK) is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good,...but a tad overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, it's odd that I would give a film a score of 8 and still say it's overrated. That's because as of the time I wrote this review, this film was #203 on the IMDb Top 250--and this just seems too high a rating. Part of it is because there are many better Film Noir movies that didn't make the list and because the plot, at times, is awfully convoluted. It earns it's 8 more because of the film's excellent style and snappy Noir dialog. In many ways, it reminds me of the excellent Bogart film, THE BIG SLEEP, because they both have plot problems BUT still are excellent films to watch.Now as I said already, the dialog was great and Robert Mitchum is a great Noir actor. He is big, tough, kind of ugly and not 100% good or evil--the perfect Noir hero. And in support, you've got quite a few similar characters--except that they ARE 100% evil! In true Noir fashion, the other "unsung" supporting actors were the sets and camera angles and music that really set the mood. Director Jacques Tourneur did a great job of setting the mood--just like he did in his famous collaborations with producer Val Lewton.So give the movie a try, but also try to see some other Noir gangster films from the era that are also great films but somehow have gone unnoticed, such as T-MEN, THE KILLERS, DOA, BOB Le FLAMBEUR, KISS OF DEATH, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW, WHITE HEAT, THE RACKET and THE NARROW MARGIN and many, many more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the past, you can not escape.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OUT OF THE PAST is a brilliant movie that shows us a credible totality of the duel, tension and fraud in a great detective story. Characterization, accompanied noir atmosphere, is just great. The main characters do not choose, place, time and manner to be conflicted. The change in the style of dialogue is certainly welcome. In this film lacks tense, fast and incisive incidents. The voice of the main character is quiet, he almost mumbling to himself and such appearances gives depth to the noir atmosphere. Roughly speaking, this is the story of a private investigator who becomes the victim of a femme fatale. Basically it is more complex, because the relationship of the past, but some things need to be addressed in the present.From the past, you can not escape.Robert Mitchum as Jeff Bailey, previously known as Jeff Markham more reminiscent of a knight in shining armor that breaks through the defense wall of despair and depression than the macho guy what he envisioned. His characteristic pose with a cigarette and a hat remains etched in the collective memory. Although Mitchum's character at first may seem passive, after the main turning point (the one in which the masks fall) he tries to take matters into their own hands. Jeff, good-natured guy who is trying to "do the right thing"!? The second half of the film shows the calculated selfishness in his character.Jane Greer as Kathie Moffat From the very beginning dictated by events. Escape from all here often means an escape from himself. This is noticeable in the two main characters. Kate is pretty manipulator with no clear motivation. In my opinion, Kathie is not motivated by money but a sense of depression and abandonment with which hardly bears. Therefore, it remains itself in the first place as best shown in scenes where fought with disappointment and loneliness.Great supporting role of Kirk Douglas further increases tensions.Motives are exchanged and the two main characters of the battle for control in which it is difficult to make out the winner. Even in the moments when the hierarchy somehow established past stands around the corner ready them into place.Deeply emotionally damaged and disrupted social world fought in the past. Mute boy, who wants to survive the madness of the present, at the end of the film brings the most logical decision. Double deception, triple conspiracy and femme fatale in an excellent movie film.</fullReview>

The main male character, Jeff, played by Robert Mitchum, is a very likable character and a stand up guy. You can like him almost immediately. His former co-worker who comes to town looking for him though is a different story. I honestly want to sock the guy after he made his debut. The cinematography was well done, sometimes having the camera takes shots through fences and cars which I thought was cool. The shadows added to the mystery of the film. Kathie, played by Jane Greer, reminded me an awful lot of the Kathy from John Steinbeck's "East of Eden". This girl flip flops more than a fish out of water, but it does keep you on your toes throughout the film, which is good. I honestly loved Kirk Douglas as Whit, his sly smile and charm were perfect for this film. The overall plot is interesting and relevant enough that I wouldn't mind watching it a second time.</fullReview>

Believable characters with a great story makes this and other films like it good, but what separates this from all other 'Film-Noir', detective stories is it's dramatic mood. I was not expecting to be as moved by this film as I ultimately was. The story is told in flashback, a Film Noir tradition. It has the snappy banter that one would expect of a film from the 40s, but the dialogue transcends mere wit and left me more than a little emotional. There is a lot of dramatic lighting, long shadows, cigarettes, hats and trench-coats. The overall feeling of the film is one of intimacy and dark mystery. It draws you in, as though you were sitting in the room with the actors and a part of the conversation. If you want to see what really good screen writing is all about, see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Notch Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A private eye escapes his past to run a gas station in a small town, but his past catches up with him. Now he must return to the big city world of danger, corruption, double crosses and duplicitous dames.What can you say? This is film noir the way it should be done: a private eye, a dame, some crime, and Robert Mitchum. Maybe the role was meant for Humphrey Bogart, but Mitchum is the best. Add on Kirk Douglas and director Jacques Tourneur, and you have a winner.Strangely, today (2015) Tourneur's best-remembered films are the ones he made with Val Lewton, which tended to be 1940s horror stories. This should be on that list, too, and it should be on any number of critics' best of lists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of the past is a classic American film noir with all the usual elements; The mystery, the suspense, the detective, and the smoke filled rooms. The composition is simple and the acting is pretty good though the plot seemed to drag at times. The story was believable and moved at a fairly quick pace so it was able to keep my attention. Though the story line was complex itself, it was easy to follow. Director, Jacques Torneur did a great job creating and developing the film. The flashbacks are very well done and the gangsters are well casted. Overall a great film with a great cast and an excellent story line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great example of Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a sucker for flashback films, and this is no exception. Tie that in with the fact that this film is of the Film Noir genre and you have the makings of a great film. This film has everything that you look for in a Film Noir, and essentially everything that makes a film a film noir by definition : a femme fatale, a dark storyline and dark cinematography.Another thing that I found interesting in this film wsa the directors use of cigarette smoke in getting his point across in who was mad at whom, and to what degree. This film is filled with murder and a man trying to rewrite his story by changing his present, which makes it easy to understand why this film is considered one of the best film noir's ever written.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of the past is an interesting movie that is a perfect textbook example of film noir. The reason why this film noir works better than any of the other ones that were out at the time was that you couldn't tell that this was made on the cheap, and has better actors and screenplay. The angle shifts and lighting in this movie make you feel like there is some kind of disturbance throughout this movie. The director really knows how to play with your emotions through lighting and angles of the camera. They even have a type of mood that grows throughout the movie that further the setting and keeps you involved in the movie. The actors are quite snappy and witty with their acting and make the movie extremely enjoyable.</fullReview>

This film is the perfect blend that rarely comes together that results in greatness. The script is superb, the acting is magnificent, everything just works, and works very well. Robert Mitchum was born for his part, tough and rugged, yet tender and vulnerable. Nobody could have been better for the part, nobody. Jane Greer is so beautiful and alluring, you will find yourself falling in love with her. She brought Kathie to life in a way that makes you forget you are watching a movie. The Scene with Mitchum and Greer in her Cabana during the rain storm is timeless, classic and unforgettable, you can feel the energy between them and the intimacy of that love scene can be felt deep within. I love this movie and highly recommend it, it is definitely one of those "must see" films, Do yourself a favor and if you happen to catch it on some late night theater, watch it, enjoy it, you won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>flashback structure takes the sting out of a nasty noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe Stefanos comes to small town of Bridgeport, California to look for Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) who's been laying low as a gas station owner. He decides to tell his girl Ann Miller (Virginia Huston) about his past. His real name is Jeff Markham. Three years ago, he and his partner Jack Fischer were private detectives hired by gangster Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas) to find Kathy Moffat (Jane Greer). She stole $40k and took off to Acapulco. In Mexico, he falls for her. She tells him that she doesn't have the money and they go to live together in San Fransico. Whit continues to look for her. Fischer runs into them and tries to blackmail them. Kathy shoots him and drives off with the $40k.The first half of the movie is a flashback with a completely different dame. It diffuses some of the tension. Actually the flashback by itself could have made a very interesting straight forward film noir. It would have been better if there is more action, more sex, and more brutality. No matter what, it's great to see Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is undoubtedly one of the great film noir, heck, one of the great films, period, and all its merits have been discussed plenty. A couple of things struck me, though. Jeff (Mitchum) must have an IQ of 180. He's so fast with his answers and comments, all of them precise and smart. I know Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe were fast, and that this comes with the film noir territory, but I'm telling you Jeff got them all beat. He sees all the angles immediately. Except twice, once when he thinks he has managed for Fisher to lose his trail, and at the end where he drops the ball, which brings me to the other gripe which has to do with the ending (I won't go into the incredible and convenient way the mute kid saves his friend Jeff): why would Jeff first and later Whit face away from that psycho Kathie near the end when Whit finds out about Kathie's lies? Did they frisk her for a weapon? I was expecting her to come up with a gun hidden in her robe and first shoot Jeff when he walked away from her, and then Whit when he walked away from her. And she later kills Whit, what a surprise! after he threatens her life if she doesn't take the rap. Wasn't he supposed to be smart? Didn't he know by then the psychotic lady he was dealing with, who had shot him before and ran away with his money, and also killed Fisher? And Bailey did not see this angle (that she would kill Whit), him been as sharp as he was? And can someone explain to me why did Jeff have to go back to Whit's place, to see Kathie one last time? Hadn't he settled already with Whit the delivery of the papers and the payment at Reno? I know, suspense of disbelief and the evil dames that turn men stupid, but these issues were way too obvious for me to ignore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quintessential Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There isn't much that can be said about Jacques Tourneur's film that hasn't already been said before. The plot is monstrously complicated, but really doesn't assume too much importance; what matters more is to savor the atmosphere created by Nicholas Musuraca's camera, as it tracks moodily round a series of dingy interiors that contrast starkly with the bright light of Jeff Bailey's (Robert Mitchum's) gas station. In this world there are no such concepts as "good" and "evil": the characters are perpetually out to exploit one another. Jeff might be considered the "hero" of the film, but his motives are often questionable - although he does not actually commit murder, he becomes involved in a series of plots initiated by Whit (Kirk Douglas), and subsequently tries to double-cross him. Mitchum's performance is pure film noir - clad in dirty raincoat and battered hat, he is the epitome of cool, only becoming emotional when really necessary. He has to work hard for our attention, however, particularly in the scenes with Kathie (Jane Greer), whose motives can never be trusted. Alternately manipulative and winsome, she has the capacity to twist any man - Jeff included - round her little finger. Her verbal tussles with Jeff are one of the film's highlights: whenever we think that Jeff has the measure of her, she eludes him. In this kind of universe, "good" characters like Ann (Virginia Huston) have little chance of survival; despite the fact that her love for Jeff remains constant, she can never stay close to him. The action of OUT OF THE PAST (BUILD MY GALLOWS HIGH in the UK) starts slowly, but then builds to a compelling climax in which there are no winners. For historians interested in post-1945 disillusion in the United States after the end of World War II, the film is a seminal text.</fullReview>

The plot was simple to begin with then there were some added twists throughout the movie which made it more complicated as you went on, which I liked. I did not like the ending though. Which in my opinion, if the ending is not good then it just brings the whole movie down a few notches. This isn't a movie I would go around telling people that they should definitely go see, but if ever brought up in conversation I would tell them to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Similar to Mildred Pierce, this film is full of flashbacks to tell the story, along with narration by the main character. Jeff tells Ann the story of his dark past as flashbacks coincide with his story. This way of creating a film can sometimes make you focus less on the key points of the story and more on the two who are sharing the story together. I found it an interesting twist when Jeff and Ann arrived at Whit's to find Kathie there, the woman Jeff had fallen in love with after he was instructed to find her. Kathie is secretly a woman with cruel intentions, as Jeff had found out she really did steal $40,000 of Whit's money. She then accuses Jeff of killing his older partner Fisher. Throughout the film, Jeff seems like a genuinely good character but is continually set up to look bad. The ending is a little disappointing, which makes the film not a 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irrefutably cool noir starring Robert Mitchum in one of his finest, most charismatic performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A quintessential film noir that deals with themes you would usually associate with the genre. A private detective starts a new life in a small town till one day a stranger stops by, looking for an "old pal", cue a flashback with some snappy narration (and a slew of one liners), a convoluted plot and a seductive, almost evil femme fatale. This film embodies "cool" for me, Robert Mitchum plays his character perfectly, like a hard-boiled Phillip Marlowe if you will. The femme fatale is played by Jane Greer who was also excellent. The film also includes an early performance from Kirk Douglas as the charismatic villain. He plays it with subtle nuances, he's psychotic without ever acting like it. Some of my favourite scenes in the film were between Mitchum and Douglas, their exchanges were highly entertaining and contained some great dialogue. Along with the dialogue, the most impressive thing about this movie was the visual style, the low key lighting and mise en sc?ne help create a brooding, dreamlike atmosphere fit for any of the best noir's out there. It's astounding to think this film was considered a B-movie in it's heyday, today it's regarded as one of the great films of the 40's, and rightly so!8.5/10</fullReview>

Female lead (Jane Greer's part) a possible shoe in for Angelina or Scarlett Johannsen. Of course the end is not perfect but it would be changed for today's audience I am sure. Robert Mitchum was always a very underrated actor because he made it look so damn easy. He could play tough,tender,dangerous or heroic .he could also deliver his wisecracks better than anyone I can think of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It all has to do with what you believe "Film Noir" to be. Is it a series of markers, waiting to be hit? Or is it a way for artists to express a pessimistic, determinist view of the world within a system that stressed socialization and the "happy ending"? I prefer artist-driven cinema - that is to say, "auteurism". And this film isn't an example. It's an expertly created work with all of the signifiers that genre-oriented viewers expect of Noir: the double-crossing dame counterpoised with the good girl, the hard - boiled guy in a trenchcoat, "atmospheric" shots of shadow and rain, lots of sparring and double entendre in the dialog, etc. And I am underwhelmed. There is none of the craziness that dreamers and lunatics bring to their work. I'm thinking of Touch of Evil, Detour, The Big Heat...like that. This is a textbook. And it's a good textbook. The proof is in the pudding: the situations and scenes have turned up umpteen times in almost sixty years worth of films. That's Show Biz. But I'm looking for something beyond this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic film noir. Not a classic at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be a consensus, in all the books on films noir that I've come across, that "Out of the Past" is a pretty fine, not to say iconic, example of the genre. I bought it a few years ago and was not impressed. However, after having read some more stuff recently and been encouraged once again by a host of positive opinions, I watched it again. Well, still no dice. I'm not even convinced that it's a particularly good film, never mind a classic example of noir. The major problem is the script. While memorably snappy here and there ("Baby, I don't care"; "A dame with a rod is like a guy with a knitting needle"; "Awfully cold around the heart"; and Bailey's voice-over in the flashback), it loses focus and momentum in the last third of the film, the San Francisco/Tahoe scenes. Here the film is complicated by needlessly tortuous plotting, and Kathie's villainy seems awkward and dull.The San Francisco scenes are the most noir-ish in terms of style and setting. Set at night, in the rain, there are long moments of quiet as Bailey sidles in and out of bars and apartments. Yet the photography is unremarkable and adds nothing to the mood of the piece that the night-time does not bring on its own. This contrasts starkly with the opening of the film, set in daylight in mid-town America, by the fishing stream, and with the second third of the film, set in Acapulco, in the sunshine and brightness, and the romance of the beach. Yet there is a standard noir voice-over against the sunshine which, though it doesn't jibe with the intense romance that plays out there, is no doubt intended to underscore Bailey's fatalism and Kathie's projected betrayal. The tone is so uneven that the mood of the film, intentionally cynical and bleak, simply drains away into a dullness that is only reprieved by the out-and-out nihilism of the ending.And yet there is some good stuff too. The flashback sequence is probably the best in the film, despite the asymmetry of its components. In fact, perhaps this very conflict of styles brings a complexity and depth that the rest of the film sadly lacks. Bailey's utter abandonment of his better self to Kathie, punctuated by his wonderfully poetic narrative, gives heart to a film that sorely lacks one. The pain and shock on Bailey's face when Kathie shoots Fisher dead, is mirrored in the viewer's. After this, nothing matters and no-one cares ? it just slides away into tedium.The performances are very varied. I am conflicted by Mitchum's. Much as I value him as an actor, his laconic, careless mannerisms are reduced to weariness in this film; his resignation approaches enervation. There is nothing at all convincing about his feelings for the character of Anne Miller, and though Bailey belongs entirely to the milieu of Kathie and her sociopathic impulses, one cannot feel any sympathy for him, as he feels nothing for himself. All is emptiness.While there is at least a seamless effortlessness about Mitchum, the same cannot be said of Jane Greer. She is fundamentally without charm as a seductress and unconvincing as a femme fatale. When compared to Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis Dietrichson, or even Gene Tierney as Ellen Berent, her shortcomings are glaring. As an actress she reacts to the role instead of making it her own.The only real bright spot in the film was Kirk Douglas, to be honest. Whit Sterling really thrived. Whether venal, cool, angry, amused or simply smooth, he managed to evince a real passion for life and, alone of all the characters in the film, laughed. Whit suddenly slapping Kathie was the only time I felt anything as the film dragged to a close.Noir cynicism and suffering are one thing ("In a Lonely Place", for example), but lifelessness is something else again. "Out of the Past" is mired in the sense of its own meaninglessness. It is beyond loneliness, beyond bitterness. This is not film noir. This is boredom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Also known as Build my Gallows High which is the name of the source novel. This hard edged film noir with a slightly complicated plot with good use of light, camera shots a delicious femme fatale with no morals (Jane Greer.) In fact the film has another femme fatale that pops up briefly halfway through and a young Kirk Douglas playing a charming yet steely villain.Robert Mitchum plays a garage/petrol pump owner in a small town when he is clocked by an old face from the past. We learn that he used to be a private eye and he did a job for Kirk Douglas, a gambler and hoodlum to find the beautiful lady that shot him and ran off with some of his money.Mitchum finds her in Mexico and then falls in love with her and they both go into hiding only for some time later Mitchum's business partner to clock him.Now some years later he has been found again and told by Douglas to go to San Francisco to retrieve some papers. Mitchum also finds that Greer is back with Douglas. Mitchum reckons that he is likely to be framed and the cat and mouse games begin with people double crossing each other.Mitchum plays it cool, you can see why the film studios saw him as the next Bogarde. He is physically big and not a man to be messed around with but he can also play tender and romantic. This is an early example of what a talent he was.Also in an early role is an actor that would also go on to become a cinema great. Douglas is clearly having a ball as the sinister, smiling villain using everyone around him but a beautiful dame is his one weakness.Maybe the film was a little too contrived, could had done to be slightly tighter and yet with Mitchum as an innocent the ending does not sit well. Well thats the Hayes Code for you.</fullReview>

Re-making OUT OF THE PAST wasn't gonna work.One great thing about RKO Radio Pictures is how often they filmed on location, and the west California &amp; Sierra Nevada sites certainly enhanced this fine film. Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer pretty much have defining roles and they perform admirably.A real FILM NOIR --- not just a mystery --- count on double-crossing, back-stabbing, lies, treachery, booze-guzzling, cigarette smoking, dim lighting, murder, extortion, even tax-cheating. The real McCoy.See this classic on VHS or DVD. Out of the Past is easier to find than the lame color "remake."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeff Markham runs a gas station in a nondescript little town. An old associate shows up and invites him to meet with a former employer, a man named Whit Sterling. It turns out Markham welched out on a job a few years back, and Sterling is keen for Markham to repay his debt ?This is a terrific old film noir classic by the criminally underrated Tourneur, who made several fantastic movies for RKO Pictures during the forties. For purists of the genre, it has everything going for it; the world-weary detective hero, the conniving femme fatale, a supporting cast of double crossers, bewildering plot lines, tough guy lingo (at one point Mitchum tells Fleming, "If you drop the junior league patter we may get the conversation down to where it belongs."), and stylish chiaroscuro photography by Nicholas Musuraca. I'm never quite sure what I think of Mitchum as an actor - his lazy drawl style suits some movies but not others - but he fits like a glove here, and a young Douglas is also a lot of fun as the ever-smiling villain. The real star though is Greer as Kathie, the source of all the travails. She has that patented wide-eyed oh-you-must-believe-me stare down pat whilst lying through her teeth, and as the movie progresses she somehow becomes more attractive whilst her actions become more horrific. Sadly, Greer's legacy isn't quite as bright as her contemporary femmes fatales, but don't miss her here; despite being only twenty-two, she turns in a simmering razor blade of a performance. Brilliantly written by the talented Daniel Mainwaring (under his regular nom-de-plume Geoffrey Homes), a great crime novelist and the screenwriter of The Phenix City Story and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. The UK TV print of this movie is called Build My Gallows High, the title of Mainwaring's pulp classic book. Remade very successfully by Taylor Hackford in 1984 as Against All Odds, in which both Greer and Valentine have small roles. If you like black-and-white private eye movies but you've only ever seen The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep, don't miss this exceptionally well made crime thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a very unusual film of its time in the use of real locations and the minimizing of back projection and artificial sets. I fell asleep in the middle, but one thing that i need to say that this movie is a real noir gem, every shot is gorgeous. I thoroughly enjoyed this film noir all about Robert Mitchum's character confronting his past . However, the story is really complex and I admit that I don't think I caught every nuance on my one viewing. After watching this movie, I just thought how interesting a film can be with its complex story and complex characters. A perfect example of thrilling drama and a nearly perfect Film Noir. The genre doesn't come much better than this classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Post war forties black and white..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyed the film, but am sure time has flown since this was produced, and senses they days are way beyond what they were back in there late forties. My age may preference, being older than the movie.. a little. So the staged acting and production aspects are past their day and only are excellent in viewing with a more open and naivet in ones mind. Good for its day.. But not up to these more expressive times. Excellent performances by all the cast. For your younger, some of there best early work. Congratulations to the director, for handling everything and everyone so well and coming up with a effective and working film that has a lot of class and respect for the art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think that this is a "great film", but it's sure a great movie. It doesn't make a lot of sense, but it's wonderful nonsense. Mitchum smolders, Greer is wicked and beautiful, and Douglas chews the scenery. The movie is full of doublecrosses, people with mysterious pasts, and scenes at night. It has everything that a noire film should have, including a sense of humor about itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very dated, boring, an oddity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Potential spoilers: Sorry, but I found this movie so very dull and dated that I switched it off after an hour. Robert Mitchum comes across as a kind of vacant halfwit, mumbling his way through his lines, apparently disinterested. That fever caught me! Kirk Douglas is silly, snide and smarmy. The women are straight from Central Casting, nothing special.No one in the cast was a standout, nothing memorable. The plot is lame. The photography passable, direction far more competent than this would-be film-noir flick deserved. I realise it is now 67 years since it was made, but this is one old B&amp;W movie that is now an oddity, interesting for those who like Mitchum and/or Douglas, and who perhaps enjoy post-WW2 cartoon America. I was deeply disappointed after seeing many glowing reviews.I rate it overall 4 out of 10. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have to see again and pay a lot more attention than I think I did, especially to understand why the critics give it five out of five, but what I can remember was pretty good, from director Jacques Tourneur (Cat People). Basically Jeff Bailey, aka Jeff Markham (Robert Mitchum) has his past come back to him when he is ordered to see gambler Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas). On his way there, he tells his girlfriend Ann Miller (Virginia Huston) his story, and obviously a flashback shows this. Jeff was once a private eye hired by Sterling to spy on his mistress Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer), who shot Whit and got away with $40,000. He finds her in Acapulco, and she (being delectable) makes him forget about Sterling, and they have a bit of a passion for each other. Back to the present, Whit's new job for Jeff is a trap, but he is cautious. Also Rhonda Fleming as Meta Carson, Richard Webb as Jim 'Jimmy', Steve Brodie as Jack Fisher, Paul Valentine as Joe Stephanos, Dickie Moore as The Kid and Ken Niles as Leonard Eels. There were one or two moments of interest, but until I see it again properly, I can't give high praise for it. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great lines, crap ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All in all, Out of the Past is not a classic in my book. I enjoyed Mitchum, Douglas and Greer, esp some of the great dialouge. But a classic movie has to have it all, and the ending here showed no imagination. Even a predicable noir ending is fine- but i hate the way that it just ends. Surely Mitchum (or the screenwriter) could have come up with some better solution than to drive into a roadblock. Jeez- hit her, knock her out and deliver her to the cops. That being said, it is great to see Mitchum smack people around and deliver great lines. It's worth watching over again just for that. Valentine was great, too- too bad he didn't do more supporting roles in his career- he had a great look</fullReview>
