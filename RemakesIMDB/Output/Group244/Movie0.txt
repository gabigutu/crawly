		<shortDescription>A Quiet Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A true classic of American Cinema Verite, "The Little Fugitive" works on several levels. On one level, it's a magnificent portrait of New York, and particularly Coney Island, during the early '50's, when New York City, if you were a kid, was truly a magic place. Anyone growing up in that period can easily identify with the fun and wonders to be seen at Coney when you were a kid and had the day free and money to spend from turned-in pop bottles (Remember those?). Professional photographers, the husband-and-wife team of Morris Engel and Ruth Orkin told a simple story with an eye toward preserving, on film, a way of life that would disappear in just two decades time, and in such an involving way that you feel yourself becoming part of it. All that's missing is the salt air and discarded popcorn bags.Now to the performances, every one of them a gem. Rickie Brewster and especially little Richie Andrusco as Lennie and Joey, two boys with no previous acting experience, give natural, ingratiating performances as the two brothers at the center of the story. One wonders whatever happened to them, and if, in fact, they're still recognized almost 50 years later. As to the adults, most of them New York-based stage actors, Winnifred Cushing, as the boys' mother, come off as just a bit too arch to be really likeable, but Jay Williams, in the main adult role of the ingratiating pony ride man, more than makes up for it with an enjoyable, lively performance. And see if you can recognize a very young Will Lee, aka "Mr. Hooper" from "Sesame Street," as the photo booth man who lets young Joey help him out.In short, "Little Fugitive" is not only great as a movie, but also as an evocation of a time and place that lives only in the memories of those who were there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant Little Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little Fugitive is a pleasant little film set in a more innocent time. The children that play Joey and Lennie act naturally and are light-years away from the gee-whiz-freckle-faced "kids" that usually inhabit films. There is a documentary, unjudgemental feel to the film, with not an ounce of condescension in the whole film. There are very few adults in the film, and when there are adults, they are presented as slight irritations to the children.The story concerns two brothers who are forced to spend a weekend together because their single mom has to go an care for her mother. Lennie, the older boy, has to look after little Joey, despite the fact that he wanted to spend his Saturday at Coney Island. Early in the film, Lennie and his friends trick Joey into thinking that he killed his big brother, just to get rid of him. Joey, panic-stricken, runs off and hops on a subway (think 1953--Way Safer) and goes off to Coney Island. It is at this point that the film flexes its creative muscles. great b&amp;w photography, interesting angles, wistful harmonica soundtrack, and a episodic, poetic narrative. Watch this film. its a keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coney Island is an escapist paradise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A magical little movie about a boy who runs away to Coney Island after thinking he's accidently killed his older brother. It's almost a silent movie, as the younger boy escapes by playing games and collecting bottles off the beach and his brother looks for him in vain among the endless Coney Island crowds. Not much happens but it's all very watchable. It probably already felt nostalgic to audiences the year it was released.It's too bad more modern kids haven't seen this movie. They'd probably be able to see themselves in Richard Brewster and Richie Andrusco a lot more than in any of the underwritten Hollywood brat parts in mainstream kid-friendly movies. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coney Island Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the summer of 1952 an accomplished still photographer from Brooklyn named Morris Engel got together with his photographer - wife Ruth Orkin and friend Ray Ashley to collaborate on the making of a small independent movie. Made on a shoestring budget using an innovative , lightweight 35mm camera , Engel and company proceeded to spend a few months filming the story of a 7 year-old boy who escapes to Coney Island for a day and a night after being led to believe that he killed his own brother. The resultant film , LITTLE FUGITIVE , was turned down by every major distributor . Photographed in black and white and with a running time of a mere 80 minutes , the bigger releasing corporations looked down on this picture as if it were an alien product , an unappetizing little "stinker" that boasted very little dialog ( and what there was of it was post-synchronized in a studio) ; that employed a single harmonica for a background music score ; and last but not least had a mundane setting of Brooklyn row houses and declining Coney Island for a setting.The production's uncertain future was rescued when Joseph Burstyn , an American distributor of prestige foreign films , decided to give the movie a chance. That decision led to LITTLE FUGITIVE winning the Silver Lion for best direction at the Venice Film Festival.This utterly charming , simple tale of a little boy's adventures at Coney Island belies the arduous work behind the camera that resulted in a bona fide American classic. Ashley , Engel and Orkin's original screenplay centers on a small group of young boys , particularly 12 year old Lennie and his younger brother Joey. The fulcrum on which the story's lever turns involves Lennie and Joey's mother having to leave home unexpectedly to look after their ailing grandmother. Lennie's plans to take a trip to Coney Island with his friends is thwarted because of this. In response to his protests ,Lennie's mother tells him that he has to stay home and take care of Joey , that he's "the man of the family" now (the father is absent) and that Coney Island will just have to wait . A disgruntled Lennie takes up his baby sitting duties begrudgingly , and is none too appreciative when little Joey tries to appease his anger with the gift of an old , battered baseball as a birthday present.In a later conversation with his friends , fueled by the fantasies of comic book reading , Lennie is given suggestions on how to get rid of his little brother so the gang can go to Coney Island. A plan is conceived , a real rifle is obtained , and a mock murder takes place , with a panic-stricken Joey,having been shown how to shoot a rifle by one of the boys , thinks he has murdered his brother. In tears, Joey runs home, hides in a closet , but soon climbs out an apartment window and onto the streets of Brooklyn , convinced , in the word's of one of Lennie's friends , that he'll "fry " in the electric chair. Seeing a neighborhood cop around the corner doesn't help ,so Joey hops on a subway car : Last Stop , Coney Island. Back at the apartment , a nervous Lennie arrives to find his brother missing , having no idea Joey is headed alone to the amusement paradise.The aforementioned scenes , which comprise about the first third of the film , are the heaviest dialog - wise. All the young actors are remarkably natural , and they render the obviously scripted words convincingly. If LITTLE FUGITIVE has any fault at all , it is in these introductory scenes ; the dialog ,as written , is somewhat flat . However , the sequences move swiftly , and the movie really takes off once Joey arrives at Coney Island.Here is the heart of this movie , an extraordinary , extended episodic adventure of one child's day at Coney Island. And here is where Richie Andrusco , who plays Joey , really shines. This remarkable little boy , who seems to be one half angelic choirboy , the other half full of the devil , is truly a real find. Discovered by the film team riding the Coney Island Steeplechase Carousel , director Engel was impressed with the boy's "animal strength". Employing a nonprofessional is a risky venture and LITTLE FUGITIVE nearly succumbed to disaster when early in the filming Richie decided he didn't want to play Joey anymore. In an inspiring moment of chutzpah , Mr. Engel asked Richie what he would like to do , and then gave the kid money to go on any rides or games he wanted to play , plied him with endless amounts of food and drink ( soda pop , hot dogs , cotton candy and watermelon , enormous amounts of which must have been consumed during the June through September shoot ! ) In essence , as Engel has stated many times in the past , Richie Andrusco pretty much directed the narrative course of this picture himself , Engel following in tow , his tripod - less camera hung around his neck , capturing the character Joey's every move. Joey's adventures and travails are resolved rather predictably at the end , and the scripted dialog once again takes over ,still somewhat stilted and flat . But it hardly matters , because Morris Engel has taken the viewer on a journey into the heart of one irresistible little boy , and in the process has recaptured for the tired old adult in us the chance to experience the curiosity , joy and terror of childhood once again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Little Fugitive" is less a movie than it is an immaculately pristine and wistful time-capsule of the '50's. A self-exiled 7-year-old wanders an amusement park in a now long-lost world free--relatively speaking--of child-molesters and out-of-control tort lawyers. Filmed on location on Coney Island, using only its crowds and beach as it was in the Summer of 1953, and not a phony backdrop or clueless extra anywhere in sight. In high-quality black &amp; white that misses nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh, down-to-earth feeling to filmmaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally credited as one of the pioneers of independent cinema (as far as making your own film your own way and still getting seen in theaters), Morris Engel used his background as a New York City photographer to bring a fresh, down-to-earth feeling to filmmaking. Engel and his wife, photojournalist Ruth Orkin, wrote, directed, produced and edited their own low-budget films, shot by Engel using a hand-held 35mm camera of his own design.The first of their three films, LITTLE FUGITIVE, is a beautiful, innocent film about a seven-year-old boy who is tricked by his older brother and runs away to Coney Island with six dollars. As the boy interacts with his new world on the boardwalk, Engel really transports the viewer there. The film feels like a documentary: sparse dialogue, realistic acting, hand-held cinematography and real locations. The FUGITIVE actors and atmosphere never come off fake: as the boy is hitting baseball in a batting cage, one hit ball flies towards the camera and you find yourself jumping out of the way!The actor doesn't stop with this film "mistake", he's having fun and keeps going. All the childhood loves are there: bottles in the sand, hot dogs and cotton candy, ponies and parachute rides. With their films, Engel and Orkin created folklore, paving the way for directors like Truffaut, Godard, Cassavetes and Leigh. FUGITIVE was successful for a non-studio film in the '50s, playing to over 5,000 theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important snapshot of an age of innocence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has great value in so many ways. I'd like to comment on only one of them. One of the things that might make a young person skeptical about this film is that a seven year old could wander Coney Island without fear. The '50's was a unique time in American history. The awakening of the social conscience of the 60's was ahead, and the horrors of WWII were behind. It was, in many ways, a time when Americans lived in relative personal safety and a kind of innocence. One of the things that might make a young person skeptical about this film is the idea that a seven year old could wander Coney Island without fear. About the time this film was made I was living in Los Angeles. I became separated from my mother and lost on the bus system. In the afternoon a man asked what the problem was. He called my mom and waited for her to come for me. I remember I was on Hollywood Blvd., near Vine. I was nine.We need to remember the innocence as well as the guilt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Real-Life' Curiosity Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talk about a movie with a different feel to it!It looks like a home movie with real people, not actors. Actually, it almost is that, as these were new actors filmed by new filmmaker managing on a threadbare budget.The little boy in the film, Richie Andrusco, was the central character and he had never acted before and has never acted after this film! No wonder he looked so "real." Most of the people in the film - at least in the background - were real people, not actors, so you really get a feel of being in New York City and Coney Island in particular in the mid 1950s.The story is a simple one, about a kid who thought he killed his brother and runs away, spending a night and two days at Coney Island. It shows how a kid that age probably would spend his time at this place. You almost have to fast-forward through a couple of scenes as they go on too long, such as the boy picking up bottles to return for cash.This movie is real curiosity piece. It's not a film you would watch over and over but it's definitely worth at least one look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brilliant masterful one of a kind film. Morris Engel's beautiful photography and Ruth Orkin's talented editing take this film to heights rarely seen. An innovative camera allows for a `documentary/candid' quality to this film about a 6 year old boy (Richie Andrusco) who runs away to Coney Island because he thinks he accidentally killed his brother. Beautifully composed shots under the boardwalk a images never to be forgotten. For any serious film student (in fact for anyone) this is a `must see'.French New Wave cinema must be incredibly indebted to this poignant, sensitive and insightful film.</fullReview>

Little Richie Andrusco performed as though unaware of the camera capturing his every waver, dislike and amusement.

		<shortDescription>A blast from the past that my child and I both enjoyed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because my 11 year old is pretty open-minded, I've taken her on adventure of watching b/w movies, just as my mom did for me. She actually enjoyed some of the old-time "horror" movies and loves the "Twilight Zone".I also introduced her to what would be considered "art house" movies. She didn't really like "The Bicycle Thief" but I did, and this movie was recommended by Blockbuster. So I put it in my queue- and it was not a mistake. OK, so some of the acting is stilted and unprofessional and sometimes the movie feels longer than 75-80 minutes (depending on which version you view).But, whether you're a big or little brother or sister, you can definitely relate. Even my child, who's my only child, can relate because she has younger cousins. I agree with many of the posters that the children act like children and act like how they would act in that situation. If you're blessed to get the DVD with the commentary, it evens add to your viewing pleasure.What most gratified me was when my daughter, who has gone to almost every kiddy-themed entertainment center, said about several of the rides that they looked fun! This movie about Coney Island helped me visualize what my mother always talked about Riverdale, a Chicago area amusement park from the 40's and brought back memories of Funtown, Old Chicago, and Santa's Village, the local amusement parks of my day from the 70's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This little gem takes its time to explore a world through the eyes of a young kid. His curiosity leads him on a little journey in and around Coney Island, full of wonder and fascination, while underneath, the guilt of something he's done lurks and lives.What works best here is how everything is so innocently depicted, the way a child truly would do, and nowhere will you find hyped up gimmicks to enhance things. From an era now long gone, it is probably that that keeps it pure and honest throughout the story. Little Fugitive is a great example of how a lot can be said if the viewer is allowed to come along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you first start watching this movie, you think the director has a budget of $10, but what you discover is a pioneer of the independent film. This little gem is a whimsical tale of 7 year old Joey Norton, who's duped by friends into thinking he's shot and killed his older brother, Richie. Upon believing this, Joey exiles himself to Coney Island, with Richie in hot pursuit. The film does a wonderful job of catching the innocence of the 50's. If you can get them away from the computer, video games and MTV, I truly believe that even kids today would enjoy this little piece of "Americana"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's All There For Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to know the plot of this excellent little film, read all of the other very well put comments. All I want to say is: I was just a little younger than the Joey of this film when it was made. I lived in the same neighborhood in Brooklyn where he lived. I took the same train he took to get to Coney Island. At Coney Island, I did all the things he and his brother did (except ride the Parachute Jump - too scary, and anyway they stopped allowing small children on it soon afterwards -- too dangerous), including collecting empty bottles to return to food stands to get a little pocket change. I rode those very same ponies. I waded through those same Coney Island streets that got flooded every time it rained. It always makes my heart jump a little when Lenny is in the candy store and says "Give me a chocolate pop." He doesn't mean soda - in Brooklyn, a "pop" was ice cream on a stick (that's why a Popsicle is called a "Pop"sicle).That is how we looked, that is how we talked, those are the games we played (BB guns were like forbidden fruit to city boys).This film gets everything exactly right, in the most charming way, and I love it.</fullReview>

I loved this movie because it spoke to me- I knew how the beach smelled after a rain, how much Joey longed to ride that pony, how the peculiar torture by an older brother could be forgiven and forgotten by a moment's offhand kindness (and a little guilt).

		<fullReview>This movie is something else. It dares to be different. Too many movies are absurdly, laughably goal-oriented, trudging along their preset paths toward nowhere, never smelling the roses, failing to dwell on this world's sheer radiance and magic. This is the movie that dwells (although it too has a bit too much plot). In a semi-documentary fashion we get a precious slice of 1953 - which to me are the good old days, unmarred by many words, with a wonderfully simple musical track. Too many movies depict children as smartalecks or tap-dancers. This one has the wisdom to say: being yourself is your biggest accomplishment. There is something of Mr. Rodgers in it. Time slows down in this movie, yet it is far less boring than speedier concoctions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A naive little boy is fooled by his older brother and his friends into thinking he has killed his brother so he won't pester them anymore while their mother is away. He escapes to Coney Island which the brother had planned to do before mama had to go take care of grandma out of town. Now, the petrified little boy ends up having the exciting day his brother had planned on having. He plays games, eats more than he can handle, and most importantly to him, gets to ride the ponies. The pony ride worker becomes concerned that he's a runaway, investigates, and notifies the brother to his presence. Now horrified by his own actions, older brother makes it his business to rectify his prank.These kids are natural non-actors, and deliver their lines as if a camera was following them around while such a scenario took place. If we have reality TV today, this is reality cinema, and outstanding. It doesn't matter that not a name appears in the cast. It's also fascinating to watch the younger brother use what he sees to survive-gathering bottles to collect money in order to survive. The photography of 1953 Coney Island is wonderfully realistic and doesn't appear either too cinematic or too cheap. This is a family film that is as gritty and realistic as the film noirs made about New York during this era, and shows New Yorkers at their best. A subplot between the older brother and one of his friends ending their friendship is sadly never resolved, but that's minor in the final product which is really about the two brothers coming to terms with each other. This is a must for families with two or more boys struggling to learn to get along with each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neo-realism in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching The Little Fugitive was an eye-opener for me. I had never heard of Morris Engel, the New York-born director who documented the landing of the Allies in Normandy. Not only is the movie a pleasure to watch but it is reminiscent of the the post-WWII realist school of film. Vittorio de Sica directed movies that have the a similar "look and feel" to them, although his make a social statement. These are well-known to casual movie buffs like me; for example, The Bicycle Thief and Umberto D. Of course, this one is set in Brooklyn and Coney Island and the actors are American, not Italian. Other than that, all I can say is that this is a classic. It does not pretend to be anything more than a story of two brothers that takes place in the space of a single day. Not only is there a beautiful story, there is also a magical setting that has been captured on film for all time. Almost everyone will feel the film as it pulls at their heartstrings. It is set in a time long past; yet people like me who grew up in the fifties can relate to it. The eyes of the camera moving around Coney Island captures people in a time and place that make this film very special.It is a tribute to TCM that it brings such films to the screen when the latest pop-culture buzz dictates what TV viewers see. It is gratifying to know that this film has been added to the national film registry in the USA, which is dedicated to the preservation of great movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mom's away at a funeral, so the kids ignore her orders, go out to Coney Island one after the other, have all kinds of glorious fun, are irresponsible, get lost, get found, come home, and neither get in trouble nor suffer from the experience. With home-movie production values, extremely casual pacing and structure, and no hint of a marketable moral, it's no wonder the DVD box comes with props from Francois Truffaut. There's nothing affected or aestheticized about it, though - it gets inside these homely city kids and projects things through their own sense of wonder and discovery. So while kids might well love it, it's no more a kids film than 400 Blows: the way it portrays the workaday flow of human interaction is revelatory as well as cute and just a little slight. Just thinking about it makes me grin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Little Masterpiece that Could _ and Did</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I discovered "The Little Fugitive" quite by accident in the mid-1970s while surfing Los Angeles television channels (yup, before cable) on a rainy afternoon when I should have been at work. I have no idea why I wasn't working, but I'm glad I played hooky. This film is the kind of rare life-affirming experience that changes one's perspective, which is what cinema in its purest form and at its foundation is intended to do."The Little Fugitive" is a 1953 American film written and directed by Raymond Abrashkin (as "Ray Ashley"), Morris Engel and Ruth Orkin, that tells the story of a child, seven-year-old Joey Norton (Richie Andrusco), alone in Coney Island.Joey resides with his older brother Lennie (Richard Brewster) in a lower- to middle-class Brooklyn neighborhood. Too young and small to be totally accepted by Lennie and his friends, Joey knows he's loved at root but suffers from little-brother syndrome. He longs to play with the older kids, but that usually comes at the price of teasing and ultimately being left behind anyway.One day when their mother is away visiting her sick mother, Lennie and his pals play a joke on Joey. Using catsup and a toy gun, they convince Joey that he has shot and killed his big brother. Mean, sure. But that's kids _ and what a wonderful story premise.The kids tell Joe he'll go to prison for the rest of his life (which is quite a stretch indeed when you're seven years old), so he does what many children in Brooklyn at that time would do: he runs away to Coney Island. If you're going to be guilty, nothing like arcades, pony rides and the beach to put things back in perspective.The movie focuses on Joey's day by himself as he goes unnoticed by everyone (still the way of things, sadly) except for the fellow who operates the pony ride, which Joey continues to patronize again and again thanks to his cashing in deposit bottles (if this movie were done today, Joey would grow up to be the founder of Denny's, let's face it).To say much more would obviously ruin the plot, but suffice it to say this film is Exhibit A that an inexpensive film with a sweet, original story can delve just as deeply into the human psyche, and successfully and movingly, as anything with big stars, a huge budget and scatological references heaped in the dialog.This film, which influenced the French New Wave, is looked upon as a landmark, not the least of which because of its groundbreaking naturalistic style and use of nonprofessional actors. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing (Motion Picture Story) and won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival, as well as earning an award from the National Board of Review as one of the top 10 films of 1953 and the Silver Ribbon as Best Foreign Film from the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists. In 1997, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.It was first of Morris Engel's three films (it was followed by "Lovers and Lollipops" in 1956 and "Weddings and Babies," which was shot in 1957 and released in 1960). All three were similar stylistically, using hand-held 35mm cameras. In the first two, the cameras didn't record the sound; later dubbing was used. "Weddings and Babies" was the first fiction feature made with a portable camera that allowed synchronized sound.The impact of this film is still being felt, even if today's filmmakers are unaware of it. A little (80-minute), cheap and totally threadbare independent masterpiece made with heart that doesn't follow trends, but sets one. Let's hope that some newbie filmmaker somewhere discovers this picture and that it serves as inspiration to lay off the zombies already and take the leap into the risky world of originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunate Timing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks reviewer O'Farrell for the interesting details of the shoot itself. No need to repeat the consensus opinion here, except to say the film remains a minor classic, undimmed by the passing years, mainly because it deals lyrically with the universal experience of engaging the big, impersonal world for the first time. I'm just regretting that the timing was so unfortunate. 1953 was the year Hollywood responded to television inroads, in spades. The strategy was to provide the viewer with experiences little screen b&amp;w could not provide. Thus, it was the year of wide screen Cinerama, Cinemascope, and Technicolor spectacle. Even 3-D was given a whirl, but didn't catch on. Naturally these innovations were accompanied by the kind of PR blitz only hyperbolic Hollywood can unloose. Thus, moviegoers' imagination was pointed in a new, big budget direction, which also spelled migration of the B-movie over to the burgeoning TV industry. The implications for a non-commercial experimental film like Fugitive are obvious. As a result, Engel's innovative, street-level approach would have to wait until the next decade to catch-on in the work of John Cassavetes, and the French "New Wave". Though Engel's next two films (1956) &amp; (1958) are interesting, showing similar visual flair, they were, I think, too much like the dying B- movie to catch-on even at the aficionado level. The lasting lesson from this little gem, I believe, is to show that compelling movie-making doesn't have to come from a big entrenched industry, but can come from guts, talent, and your own backyard. Of course, it helps to have a little luck, which I'm sorry to say Fugitive's timing did not have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive considering its budget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A single mother is called out of town and leaves her 12 year-old in charge of the apartment and his little brother. However, the older brother and his friends play a really nasty trick on the brother--convincing him he's accidentally killed one of them!! The little boy runs off to Coney Island and the camera follows."Little Fugitive" is a film you need to put in context to appreciate. On a superficial level, the film looks a bit cheap--almost like a home movie. And, the actors are just ordinary kids. And, the film is made in various locales around New York--so nothing was spent on sets or props. But, on the other hand, considering that the budget was next to nothing, you can't help but admire the results. It also compares well to the Italian Neo-Realist films--films which used pretty much the same sorts of settings and non-professional actors but still had bigger budgets and fancy directors like De Sica and Rossellini. Here Ray Ashley, Morris Engel and Ruth Orkin (hardly household names) manage to make an American Neo-Realist film which stacks up well all considered. And, frankly, it's a LOT better than the other two films Engel and Orkin made after "Little Fugitive".There's a lot to like and a lot to dislike about the film. The kids gave good natural performances and the story idea was clever. On the negative, however, is that the film sure could have used an editing. All too often, you see the protagonist just doing one ordinary thing after another after another--all set to the same harmonica music (which, after a while, gets on your nerves). Seeing the little boy wander off to Coney Island wasn't bad, but did we need to see him do EVERYTHING there? No. In addition, he didn't seem to be trying to forget his problems or hiding--just having an outing like any other kid--and this really hurts the narrative. Still, it's a nice little experiment and a cute film in many ways. It's the sort of film the average person probably would not enjoy but for cinemaphiles it's a nice diversion and shows what you can do with incredibly limited resources. Just think--the budget for "Little Fugitive" was nearly the same as "Plan 9 From Outer Space"--and two films couldn't be any more different!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, very tender...monotonously so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Still photographer Morris Engel co-wrote, co-produced, and co-directed this independent film about a little boy on his own at Coney Island, even photographing the movie in a then-revolutionary format (using a hand-held 35mm camera sans tripod). Influtential and often beautiful in moody black-and-white, no one could rightfully dispute Engel's gifted eye for scene composition, design, and intimate action. However, the dubbed-in voices sound disembodied, the amateurishness of the film's conception (including the actors) is a handicap, and the harmonica music is grating throughout. There are some stunning and lovely moments: a sudden cloudburst sending all the sunbathers under a pier, their silhouettes intermingling; the youngster learning how to make pocket money--by collecting recyclable bottles on the beach--and using his change to ride the ponies; a pony-wrangler understanding the boy's situation and calling his older brother, but not getting the cops involved (a nice change of pace); the brother writing messages all over the park in chalk, hoping to get the tyke's attention. Engel uses impressively long takes to draw us into the visual narrative; he had some great ideas, and uses the Coney Island locals to his best advantage, and yet the movie never really soars. It dawdles along with hearty moments and ends on a 'cute' note, though it made a big impression on the French New Wave. One might think this could have been the launching pad for Engel as a major Hollywood talent--but, alas, four years later he was still doing the same thing. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You cannot step twice into the same river</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When did I see that movie? I was 15, maybe? It played in a theatre for young people. Yes, in the fifties, in the communist Czechoslovakia, there were theatres named "For youngsters". It was one of the first, if not the first American movie that appeared in Czech theaters since 1948. Even at that age I was already tuned to the "American lifestyle" and the "Little Fugitive" fully satisfied me. It showed me "America". I could sense the difference. The kids dressed differently, they had toys I could only dream about. Seeing all this was truly exciting for me.To see the movie again I had to buy it on eBay. I watched the movie now, after more than 50 years, with controlled expectations. I remembered the movie, but not quite. Certain scenes played in my head in different surroundings, some even in a different context. What bothered me right from the beginning was the acting, Everybody in the movie, except for our small hero, Richie Andrusco, is really, painfully bad. It proved again that you cannot enter the same river twice. There are parts in the movie that remind me, for some reason, Jacques Tati. It doesn't really help, because Jacques Tati movies, just like this one, are marked by time. The attraction and the charm has evaporated...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but slight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cute premise stretched rather thin. A 7 year-old boy is tricked by his 12 year-old brother into thinking he accidentally shot him. The kid is so upset he runs away, taking with him six dollars the boys' mother left behind for them. He goes to Coney Island and spends two whole days there. It's all nice and charming, but it might have worked better as a thirty minute episode of a TV series, or even at an hour. At 80 minutes, it gets repetitive and loses much of its potential charm. Shots are even reused several times. Richie Andrusco as the 7 year-old and Richard Brewster as his older brother are excellent child stars. They are far more natural than any counterpart in a Hollywood film of this time period. It's funny the way things change. That prank with the gun would surely have seemed very cruel in 1953. But with that kind of event being an everyday 10 o'clock news item, it's much more tainted right now. And it's funny that, when I first saw Jack the Pony Ride Man, I didn't think of him as a concerned adult but as a potential child molester! 7/10.</fullReview>
