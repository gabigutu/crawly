		<shortDescription>Made in the 90's but definitely part of the 50s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very beginning of this film, those who have any fondness of the 50s and its music know that this is a film they will enjoy. The camera work is done in such a way that it seems to bring you greatly into the emotion of the film and truly make you believe that you are there. This then carries on though the film along with some classic 50s music. It is a film in which the parents are so stereotype-hyped that they almost don't seem real, yet there is an edge to them which makes you fear that parents truly where that way. It tells the story, not only of the apparent parent inability to accept rock 'n' roll but of the social pressure against the coloured community at the time. In many ways this film seems to still talk about many issues of today and therefore this remake still has a modern edge. The only thing against this film is the fact that more was not done with the plot, therefore creating a film where you know how it will end from the first meeting we see of Susan (the main star played by Renee Zellweger) and Luck.A great film full of romance, teenage angst, and more importantly - the 50s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light Hearted Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not see this cable movie when it originally played on Showtime in 1994. I just grabbed the video off the dollar rental rack at my local supermarket's video dept. the other night, and I was pleasantly surprised. Well, I did see Allan Arkush's name listed as director, and felt if it was anywhere close to his "Rock n' Roll High School" (1979) it would be worth a look. I enjoyed the fact that Arkush cast the heroine of his 1979 film, P.J. Soles, and the actress who played her best friend in that movie, Dey Young, as two of the mothers objecting to rock and roll's influence on their kids. Mary Woronov, who played the evil principal in RnR HS, and Dick Miller, who played a policeman or fire chief in the first film, also appear under the same character names. Fans of cult actor Miller will note that he uses the name Paisley, which he first used in the Roger Corman Beatnik spoof horror movie "Bucket of Blood" in 1959. Yes, this is not up to the level of John Water's "Hairspray," but it is a fun movie with generally good performances, including one by sixties soul singer Ruth Brown, who was also in the Water's film. I generally avoid Howie Mandell like the plague, but he was OK here as the fast talking hipster DJ. Zellweger, John Doe, Gerrit Graham, Max Perlich, and (especially) Jennifer Lewis all give good performances and seem to be having fun in roles familiar from dozens of old American International drive-in movies. Makes me hope Dimension will release more of the "Rebel Highway" Showtime series, which all took their titles from AIP "classics."</fullReview>

Although someone named Julianna Raye is actually performing her songs, you'd never know it; she's thoroughly convincing as a piano-poundin' rock an' roller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening beat I fell in love with SR&amp;R. A delightful little spoof on the teen years in the 50's complete with a Murray the K style announcer, a downtrodden teen queen and her garage band, 4 hysterical busybodies intent on saving the world from the evils of music [who were hysterically funny], a way too old motorcycle "Fonzie", and lots of singing and dancing. A fun movie not to be taken one bit seriously nor making a statement of any kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modest remake brightened by its lead actress.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This TV movie comes from a series of remakes of budget 50's teen movies. It is a relatively simple tale of a battle between teenagers and their elders who think their offspring are being corrupted by rock 'n' roll. This version features some old tracks (generally remade) plus a couple of new tracks that try to mimic the old style. On screen these are performed by the then little known Renee Zellweger, although the vocal performance is by Julianna Raye. This is a must for any Zellweger fans as she lights up the small screen. Beyond that it could pass the time adequately for 'armchair rebels' or nostalgia seekers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rock 'n' roll is here to stay!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this is a simple yet enjoyable movie filled with rock 'n' roll and swinging tunes of the 60's. A "fresh" alternative for those who are chilling at home with their friends and are longing to see a standard comedy. Definitely worth checking out for fans of Renee Zellweger.Though it's not far away from clichés, it's still fun enough to watch. Just take it as it is and don't expect too much from it, knowing it's a typical "feel-good" movie. So relax, take off your shoes, grab a comfy sofa, and start watching. There's a special appearance by Paul Anka, in case you didn't notice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prequel to Rock 'n Roll High School</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a great film, not a terrible film but it IS a prequel to the great Rock 'n' Roll High School starring The Ramones. Andy Warhol alum Mary Woranov plays E. Joyce Togar, reprising her roll in the earlier film. PJ Soles and Dey Young play their own mums. At least we find out why Miss Togar hates rock and roll as much as she does. Both films were directed by Allan Arkush, though this one was made for the short-lived 1994 television series 'Rebel Highway'. At least it's fun but unfortunately, though the potential was there, not nearly as good or funny as Rock 'n' Roll High School. It was never billed as a prequel to the Ramones' film, or maybe it might have been noticed more than it ultimately was. If I hadn't already been a fan of RNRHS I never would have known the connections.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rock and Roll High School Returns... Sort Of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two young girls start a band and open up a nightclub in town where the local kids can hang out and stay out of trouble, but they encounter opposition from local people who think rock is the devil's music and will corrupt their kids.Is it wrong that I found it ironic Howie Mandel was accused of allowing close dancing, when it is well known he is terrified of people touching him? In a strange way, this exists in a parallel world to "Rock and Rock High School", with Mary Woronov again as the rock-hating lady, and Dick Miller again as a cop (Officer Paisley!). Even P. J. Soles as an adult Riff Randell?John Doe, who plays Lucky, recalls Allan Arkush being "everything you'd want in a director. He was one of those people who really got it. He knew how to have fun, how to let people cut loose... and you can feel it." He says the movie took only three days to shoot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rock and Roll - Innocent or Guilty?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to Netflix streaming I was able to view this early Zellweger movie, made just a couple of years before she started to get roles that gave her more notice in the movie business.Set in the 1950s and spoofing afternoon TV dance shows like American Bandstand, Renée Zellweger is Susan, a 17-yr-old high schooler. In her own room she enjoys Rock and Roll and the opening scene has her dancing energetically, hopping all over her bed, pretending to sing. Out of sight she and two of her friends are forming their own Rock and Roll band. She plays piano and sings (but her singing is dubbed by someone else).Howie Mandel is Danny Klay, the Dick Clark surrogate, and he MCs the TV dance show. He eventually meets the young wannabees and takes a liking to them and helps publicize their musical endeavors. One of the boys is Max Perlich (good in 'Beautiful Girls') as Tony.Most of the theme here is the 1950s divide between parents and kids. The kids want to dance Rock and Roll, they want to invite and enjoy black singing groups, but the parents believe that is all evil.There is a large kernel of truth in all that but this movie is done in a very exaggerated style more for laughs than for hard-hitting social statements.After they teens briefly open a former restaurant as a spot for teens to play music and dance, one of the uppity moms gets a noise nuisance order to close them down. But Danny Klay holds a mock trial on his show, inviting people to call in, Rock and Roll, is it innocent or guilty? The resolution is less than satisfactory but the movie is entertaining enough and I enjoyed seeing Zellweger in a very early role, filmed when she was about 24.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nifty little flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spunky young Susan (a winningly fresh and sassy performance by the adorable Zenee Zellweger) and her friends start their own rock group as well as open a nigh club. However, they face opposition from local uptight adults who consider rock'n'roll to be the devil's music. Director Allen Arkush, working from a sharp script by Trish Soodik, relates the enjoyable story at a zippy pace, offers an affectionate evocation of the 50's teen rock scene, maintains an engaging breezy tone throughout, and nicely addresses the racism and repressive conservatism of the period. Moreover, the main characters are drawn with great warmth, the vibrant soundtrack seriously smokes, and the picture possesses an infectious bounce and crackling energy that's a total joy to watch. The zesty acting from the enthusiastic cast keeps it humming: Howie Mandel as hip TV show host Danny Klay, Patricia Childress as Susan's sweet gal pal Cookie, Max Perlich as groovy drummer Tony, John Doe as surly rebel biker Lucky, Gerrit Graham as jerk producer Lipsky, and P.J. Soles, Dey Young, and Mary Woronov as evil square buzz-crushing parents who are determined to stop rock'n'roll. Popping up in neat bit roles are Dick Miller as Officer Paisley and William Schallert as a stern judge. An absolute blast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With a name like Shake Rattle and Rock, how could it not be the fifties!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I have only seen this once, and frankly I wasn't impressed with the lead actress, It was great that the writer would choose to reference three characters from an earlier film about teenagers and rock and roll. P.J. Soles, Dey Young, and Mary Woranov are playing the mothers of their characters from 'Rock and Roll High School'. Forget Zellweger and go rent 'Rock and Roll High School' if you want teenage antics and a good soundtrack. By the way if John Lennon was the first "songwriter", then who wrote all those songs that came before him? And as for women playing instruments in the 50s, as an earlier review stated that they did not, apparently the reviewer has never heard of the hoards of female artists in the fifties that not only wrote their own music, but played instruments on the recordings, and live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About the only thing going for this movie was the music. Not only was this movie disappointing, but the ending was very unsatisfactory. I'm surprised Rene Zellwiger's career recovered from this. Howie Mandel was at that point in his career to actually turn down roles. This one, he should have turned down. Hairspray, (original) was way better than this disappointment. At least that movie had a satisfactory ending. Shake Rattle and Rock should be retitled "Shake Rattle and put this DVD under the tire of your car and run over it. " This movie was a low point for everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm fond of Renee Zellweger. But this rather dull movie trudges along with few peaks and valleys. Doesn't offer Zellweger a chance to get off the ground -- as she's more than capable of doing. The best part of this film is during the opening credits when Renee is dancing in her bedrooom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remakes of grade C exploitation films not a success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Renee Zellwegger is a great actress in later films her presence here is merely serviceable. The real problem lies in the concept of remaking a teen exploitation film. The original film might have a charm for its naive cheesiness that now looks camp and amusing. To remake such a product is a poor premise. The film looked like it wished it were Hairspray by John Waters (who knows how to make material that refenences the original materials without looking like a wannabe). It also had annoyingly poor art direction and script writing. The music was fairly good but stories like this are more successful in films like Grace of My Heart. For a good time got to Blackboard Jungle and Jailhouse Rock. This kind of film is a product of its' time and not likely to be successfully translated into a nostalgia vehicle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a hard film to summarise correctly. How does one summon up the necessary amount of vile and invective to describe this criminal, execrable, cheesy awfulness? This is a film (and I use the term loosely) that Renee Zellweger should use her considerable funds to hunt down and destroy as humanely as possible, for the greater glory of humanity. Awful, banal, trite, empty, useless, clichéd, mindless dross. The ending of the film, where 'rock n' roll' is put on trial, made me want to stab my eyes out and rip my ears off.It is THAT bad.Of course it's easy to criticize. Very easy in this case.Please don't be taken in by other reviewers attempts to pretend that this is light hearted fun. They are emissaries of darkness.You have been warned...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Renee Zellweger can only take a role so far. She is cute, the movie is very colorful, and the costumes are nice, but the story and the quality of the movie aren't enough to make it very good. This movie is reminiscent of "Hairspray" starring Ricki Lake. It is a low-budget film with an underdeveloped story. I wouldn't recommend it unless you love Renee Zellweger or Hairspray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shake, Rattle and Pitch (As In, Out The Window)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shake, Rattle and Rock was a 1994 effort made by Renee Zellweger before she was famous, so I suppose she can be forgiven for this film (and I use that word loosely). Renee does at least try to make the best of a hackneyed plot, about kids who just want to rock 'n' roll in 1950's America, while looking adorable as a redhead in the process.However, even her cuteness cannot save this blatantly cheap looking movie. I have no problem with a movie being low budget (a lot of my favourite movies are of the independent variety) but a movie should never look this cheap. Also it's kind of hard to have a period piece when it looked like there was very little money, talent or competence to work with. I didn't see one classic car, and isn't that a prerequisite of a movie that's supposed to take place in past (especially the 50's or 60's)? Another bad sign that I noticed right away was that the opening credits were done in the same style of font that is often favoured by cheap porn. Now I'm not a porn connoisseur mind you, but I have seen a few with this same style of (hilariously cheap looking) opening credits.Zellweger plays a chick named Susan whose parents just don't get her, so she unleashes her frustrations by dancing it up as a regular on an American Bandstand rip off show called The 3 O'clock Bop (or something like that) that is hosted by Howie Mandel! That should be a red light right from the start; that Howie Mandel is making an attempt to act! This movie was so pathetically bad that I found it hysterical. There are some comments on this site that say this film was a satire, and hence was trying to be horrible on purpose, but I really and honestly think that it took itself seriously. And THAT made me laugh my ass off! How did I come to watch such a train wreck? I'm visiting my parents for a few days and I woke up about two hours ago and couldn't get back to sleep, and I actually found Shake, Rattle and Rock on my parents DVD shelf. What possessed my mother to buy this is beyond me, so I will have to investigate when she gets up. I'm betting five bucks that she came across it in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart...wait a minute, I can't make a bet with myself! Anyway, I have to make fun when she gets up none the less. Most likely this DVD was purchased for five bucks or less, but it's still a gip.I can't really review this movie because I only watched about 45 minutes of it before I had to turn it off! It's pretty bad that I couldn't force myself to sit through the entire 83 minutes, but maybe I'll torture myself and watch the remainder of it later if I'm really and truly bored (and I would have to be).I just really couldn't stomach watching Renee be attracted to the token bad boy of the movie, because it's obvious this teenage motorcycle hoodlum is at least 40! Wait, I have the IMDb page open for this piece of junk, let me check out the motorcycle hoods filmography. YES, I was right! The actor's name is John Doe (of all names) and he WAS 40 when this movie was made! I was jovial before, but now I'm cracking up! The make-up in Shake, Rattle and Rock was obviously one of the films many other oversights, and was probably done by the directors little sister. I say this because 40-year-old teenage motorcycle punk has a noticeable black eye that pops up (not long before I turned the movie off) that isn't explained, and it looks like an attempt to conceal it was made with a dollop of cheap foundation. I'm guessing that someone on set punched him because of his lousy acting, and that fact that he was 20 years too old for this damn part.The breaking point for me came when the cast started doing a montage/dance sequence in slow motion while getting ready for the big concert. Ugh, I must have looked bi-polar at that moment because I was both disgusted and laughing so hard that my stomach muscles hurt. Only watch this movie if you are in the mood to see what parts an A-list actress like Renee Zellweger had to reduce herself to back when she was slumming it in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>senseless waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since there are obviously more people not liking this movie but only positive reviews online I have to add my opinion here. I saw this movie because of Renée Zellweger, and I thought it was a total waste of time. The other reviewers were correct in one point: the movie has no message and cannot be taken seriously. I would like to add, it is not funny and does not have an interesting plot, either. Throughout the movie, I was really trying to figure out the addressee of the picture. Possibly people from the 50s, but nobody else then. The only thing I learned is that Renée Zellweger seems to have always played the same character: a freaky but likable woman. Well, I am cautiously looking forward to her next appearance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Even Zellweger Can Save It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the TV guide which described this movie as being about some teenage kids starting a band and opening a nightclub much to the annoyance of the adults of the town who are very , very conservative . Right away I thought I'd be watching something along the lines of FOOTLOOSE which by no means a great movie would have some appeal to a teenage audience .However what the TV guide didn't point out was that SHAKE RATTLE AND ROCK was set in the 1950s so right away you've got a musical score that means nothing to the kids of today . Wouldn't a movie produced in 1994 aimed at a teen audience work much better if it'd be set in 1994 featuring a grunge soundtrack . I also doubt if anyone who can remember the 1950s would be able to recognise the 1950s here . People discussed " Black foreplay with a pillow " at the dinner table ! Teenage kids had both the funds and means to open nightclubs ! Perhaps the worst criticism of Trish Soodik's script is that she seems to be under the impression that in the 1950s singers used to write their own material ! No they didn't , not even Elvis wrote his own songs and the concept of a singer songwriter didn't happen until John Lennon came along . Female artists didn't play instruments eitherOkay with these criticisms I might be accused of taking this TVM too seriously but believe me that would be impossible and not even the always superb Renee Zellweger can save this anachronistic lightweight teen movie from being instantly forgettable</fullReview>
