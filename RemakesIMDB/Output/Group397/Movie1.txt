		<shortDescription>An evening well spent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many poorly made, self-conscious and annoying so-called art house films out there, and then there is this gem of a movie. I sincerely hope it gets a U.S. art cinema release. It's not often I am still remembering the characters, the passion of the heart, the location and faith awakening all in one post-viewing memory.The actors are all uniformly true to to their characters, and really excellent at involving us in their personal tests of faith and moral dilemma. The orthodoxy of their faith, positioned against a seeping modern day sensibility surrounds us as effectively as the location photography transports us (American audiences) to a world we know little about.A friend told me to see "this lesbian movie." It's not that. It's a story of girls in a repressed society dealing with their first sexual awakening and affection confused bonding as a portion of the story of immersion in their faith and how it transforms their relationship with each other in their involvement with a strange, mystical and salvation-seeking non-Jew.This is a uniformly excellent film. In the openness of the locations and the beautiful music, the closeness of the camera work puts us in a claustrophobic male-dominated society, just at a moment in time when women are establishing their place in their religion and in their society.I spend a lot of time in theaters. It's not often I come away with a feeling I have truly experienced a romance with faith, with the human heart and with the written word so totally in one film.Congratulations to the filmmakers and actors. I sincerely hope this movie finds its best audience in American theaters.(I am not Jewish and was deeply moved and intrigued by the religious material presented)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film tonight and was utterly blown away...It seems that the quality of Israeli films has drastically increased in recently years, but this film in particular hits all the right notes of comedy and tragedy that truly inspire.The plot is multifaceted and contains multiple layers and questions. Indeed, it is far more ambitious in the tale it weaves than most.A lesser film would settle for the storyline of the uptight girl taught a life lesson as she helps an elder, or the uptight girl falling in love and learning to live life not by the rules, or else maybe tentatively learn to question her religious upbringing, but this film manages to weave all of these elements together and truly make them sing.The characters are without exception well fleshed out and wonderful. They all feel like real human beings rather than caricatures. In particular, the main love story is poignant and well fleshed out. The tragedy of forbidden desire is truly a tangible ingredient in the film's brew.One of my favorite things about non-American cinema in general, but especially Israeli film, in fact, is the way they show love and the human body in a beautiful and sensual fashion without over dramatizing or being untrue. Last years Haboah ("The Bubble") did this exceptionally well, as does this film...This was a truly powerful film that challenged notions of religious authority and hierarchy will simultaneously treating them with the utmost respect and a mysterious power. Absolutely worth seeking out and seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone has secrets, but some are more significant than others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ha-Sodot (2007), is an Israeli film, shown in the U.S. as "The Secrets." It was co-written and directed by Avi Nesher. Noemi (Ania Bukstein) is a young woman who loves to study Torah with her father. She knows that, as a ultra-orthodox Jew, she can never be a rabbi, and she accepts that fact. However, she cannot accept the traditional role of wife and mother that's expected of her by her culture. She's given permission to study at a women's seminary. The school is operated by an older woman who is trying to bring learning to Orthodox women, while working within the Orthodox culture.It's a good school, where the students are treated well and where learning and good works are emphasized. The plot revolves around one type of good works--bringing food to people in the area who cannot afford to purchase what they need. The person to whom the food is brought is a woman named Anouk, played by Fanny Ardant. Noemi is chosen to take the food because she's extremely competent, and Anouk's situation is complex and difficult. Anouk's first language is French, so the Headmistress assigns Michal, a French-speaking student, to accompany Noemi. One of the major plot threads revolves around the relationship of the two young women with the older woman. Another plot thread is the growing tenderness between Noemi and Michal. A third thread is the difficulties for women who want to exercise their judgment in a society where the judgments are traditionally made by men.We saw two movies at the Rochester Jewish Film Festival. The first was "Noodle." When I reviewed that film I noted that it could have been made in any developed nation--not just Israel. "The Secrets" could probably only be made in Israel. Obviously, patriarchal societies exist in many countries. However, I think that only in Israel could a film be made about people who live within such a society, and yet be shown in theaters with scenes that include full frontal nudity. That is the paradox of Israeli society--the ancient and orthodox exist in parallel with the modern and liberated. The acting in the film was outstanding. Both Bukstein and Shtamler are extraordinarily attractive and capable actors. However, when Fanny Ardant is on the screen, her beauty and acting skill make you forget everyone else. "The Secrets" is an unusual and compelling film. If the movie is released for theatrical distribution, watch for it and see it. Otherwise, try to find it on DVD. This is a fascinating film--don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film Unlike Any Other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an absolutely amazing film. I have never seen an Israeli film before and didn't even know there were any. I bought the DVD because it featured Fanny Ardant and I like watching her. I don't know why Fanny Ardant is so totally fascinating, she just is. Quel surprise! Nom de Dieu! etc. I could hardly believe my eyes when the film opened with credits in Hebrew, a language in which I fear I am deficient and cannot even spell 'Moses', much less 'Ezekiel'. What unfolded before my amazed eyes was a truly wonderful film, a rich tapestry of conflicting traditions, longings, emotions, and a battle for the freedom of women from their intolerable suppression by the Ultra-Orthodox Jews and their notion of what they call 'the Law', a 2500 year-old codification of behaviour to which they appear to be utterly mentally enslaved. This portrayal of them by an Israeli filmmaker is extremely shocking. If anything is calculated to make one despise Ultra-Orthodox Judaism, this film is it, and it was made in the very country where so many of them live and where they are even represented in the Parliament. As for the story, it centres around two girls from religious families who meet as a result of having gone to study in a yeshiva (seminary), where they pore over religious texts and discuss what Deuteronomy means and such fascinating subjects as that. So restricted are these people in their thought processes that they are not even supposed to read the Talmud, but only the Torah. They are not supposed to study Kabbalah because that is heresy, and their persisting in doing so is an important part of the story. The two girls are utterly charming, played to perfection by the intense Russian-born Ania Bukstein as the character Naomi and 'Michal' (i.e., Michelle) Shtamler as the character Michelle. Their relationship begins with difficulty, because Naomi is humourless and serious, a brilliant scholar whose father is a famous rabbi, and she is engaged to the world's greatest bore, a horrid young rabbi pupil of his who is arrogant, humourless, grim, offensive in every way, and without a single redeeming quality. Michelle is a happy go lucky type with a smile that could melt the Arctic Ice Cap and the two girls are so different they have trouble hitting it off at first. Eventually, however, their friendship deepens so much that they become lovers. I can imagine the Ultra-Orthodox rioting in Jerusalem over this! It takes a very long time indeed for Naomi to lighten up, and to free herself from the brain-washing of her father and her upbringing, and to break off the engagement with the young monster rabbi. Intimately interwoven with the two girls' story is their encounter with a strange older woman in the same town, a character named Anouk, played by Fanny Ardant. Only Michelle can speak both Hebrew and French, but the two girls become drawn into the mysterious life of Anouk, who has come back to the town to die, as she has terminal cancer. Through her brilliance as a scholar Naomi finds rituals drawn from the forbidden Kabbalah to purge Anouk of her past sins, in order to ready her for death and to be 'forgiven by God'. Along the way, Naomi is shocked to discover that Anouk is not even Jewish, but her love for her past Jewish lover, whom she killed in a quarrel (she has spent 15 years in jail as a result), makes it psychologically necessary for her to go through this process. The girls risk their reputations by trying to help Anouk, and are eventually expelled from the yeshiva for heretical acts and for daring to go to Anouk's hospital bedside on the Sabbath. The film is made with such honesty and intensity, and such raw passion, that it is a searing cultural, religious, and social document as well as a human testament of immense power and relevance. All of the performances are intense and convincing. The minor character of Yanki, who should have been a rabbi but chose instead to become a musician, is charmingly portrayed by Adir Miller, who with self-deprecating smiles endears himself to everyone. The main performances by Ardant, Bukstein, and Shtamler are so radiant and compelling that this film is an instant classic. It should really be seen by anyone who likes great cinema, but even people indifferent to such things should watch it if they have the slightest interest in the Middle East, as this says so much about the melting pot which is Israel, where crazed fanatics and easygoing liberals live uneasily side by side. (Does it remind you of Beirut?) People complain about the intolerant and insane Wahabbi Muslims, but what about the Ultra-Orthodox Jews? They both suppress women, are totally humourless, and propagate grim doctrines which recommend a kind of hell on earth. Truly the extremists of the Middle East deserve each other. But do we deserve either of them? In any case, we do deserve this wonderful film, and it deserves us, in the form of our attention and admiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, Sensitive and Transgressor Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The orthodox religious and studious Jewish Naomi (Ania Bukstein) is the daughter of a prominent rabbi and is promised to marry the arrogant yeshiva student Michael (Guri Alfi). Naomi secretly dreams on becoming a rabbi and after the death of her mother, she succeeds in convincing his father to postpone her marriage and be sent to the traditional Seminary of Knowledge and Truth in the ancient city of Safed in the mountains. The grieving Naomi shares a room with the outcast and free-spirited Michelle (Michal Shtamler) and two other roommates. Naomi and Michelle are assigned by the headmistress to help Anouk (Fanny Ardant), a woman that spent fifteen years in prison for killing her lover, and is terminal with cancer. Anouk asks for the purification Kabalistic ritual Tikkun to reach God, and the girls decide to help her. Meanwhile Naomi falls in love for Michelle and she finds in the Bible that their desire is not considered a sin in the eyes of God. While assisting Anouk, Naomi tries to convince her beloved friend that their relationship is not wrong in a repressive society ruled and judged by men. "Ha-Sodot" a.k.a. "The Secrets" is a beautiful, sensitive and transgressor romance in a society ruled by conservative rabbis and extremely repressive with women. I immediately recalled Peter Jackson's "Heavenly Creatures" and the platonic love of Juliet Hilme and Pauline Parker. Further, Ania Bukstein and Michal Shtamler slightly resemble Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey in the beginning of their careers. It is engaging to see in 2009 such different society when compared with the western culture, and a director exposing this situation without any judgment or manipulation. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Segredos Íntimos" ("Intimate Secrets")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have too much to add to the previous comments but I wonder why there have been no comments since last October. This movie must be hiding for the right opportunity(ies) to be seen.I previewed this movie as part of an upcoming Jewish Film Festival and it was far and away the best drama that I have seen, perhaps in several years.I thought the Orthodox Jewish milieu was going to be a turn-off but that only added to a great story, directing, acting, setting, and scenery.The actresses seemed to be familiar types from other, English-language, films but they probably were not.

		<fullReview>"Secrets" is a film about everything. Just when you think you know what the main theme of the film is, it shifts direction subtly. I think you have to know at least one person who is like a character in this film to find it believable, or you possibly might just be interested in unfamiliar cultures. Practically every event in this film could not possibly happen in the US, but the movie is not a fantasy.What are the secrets that the viewer gradually comes to understand? They are things people don't tell other people. They are things that people don't know about themselves. They are a culture's basic assumptions that normally go unquestioned. They are ancient Jewish mystical practices that are not supposed to be talked about. They are insights into biblical writings that were never uncovered before. They are little twists of language, like how many M's are in a sentence. They are what happens to people when they face death.And the secrets of what makes this an amazing film? They are the uniformly great performances, the cinematography that lovingly caresses the city of Sfat (or Zefat, as the Israel road signs say), the beautiful and moving music, and the the questions that haunt the viewer emotionally and intellectually afterward.</fullReview>

Fortunately, it is eligible this year for a GLADD award for a feature film in limited release.The performances by Fanny Ardant as Anouk, Ania Bukstein as Noemi, and Michal Shtamler as Michel (That's Michelle!) were outstanding.It was a powerful and fascinating look at a very patriarchal society, and a glimpse that even Jews have differences of opinion on their religion (Are they Protestant?).Funny, compelling, sure to anger you over the treatment of women, warm and tender: it is an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Windows to Understanding Extant Taboos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SECRETS (HA-SODOT) is not only a deeply satisfying film as a story that involves the viewer at every level, but it is also a reminder that certain customs/prejudices of inequality between the sexes still exist. Written with poetic distinction by Hadar Gairon and Avi Nesher (who also sensitively directs the film), THE SECRETS brings us into a world few know and even fewer understand. And it informs us of cultural differences while telling a griping and fascinating story in a way few films are able to imitate. Israel, despite the enlightened quality of life the Jews enjoy, remains a place where the division between men and women may have been erased when it comes to military obligations, but where the orthodox religion very decidedly separates the roles of male and female. Noemi (Ania Bukstein) wishes to 'postpone' her obligated marriage in order to study spiritual matters at the seminary in the ancient Kabalistic seat of Safed. She convinces her father to allow her to study for a year and then return to fulfill her feminine obligation to become a wife and mother. Once enrolled at the seminary Noemi becomes friends with another young 'rebel' girl Michelle (Michal Shtamier) and as their friendship grows they discover a French woman Anouk (Fanny Ardant), apparently living a life of poverty supported by the kindness of the seminary despite her history of imprisonment for murder. Noemi and Michelle study the secrets of the Kabal and become determined to administer the cleansing rituals for Anouk who is dying from cancer. Noemi and Michelle bond and become emotionally and physically committed to each other. Once they have administered the cleansing to Anouk the two girls are expelled from the seminary. They part ways with the hope that they will be together on the outside. Yet once back in the milieu of their society, old customs and rules alter their relationship: tradition conquers. Director Avi Nesher unfolds this delicate story with restraint and taste and encourages the viewer to identify with each of the characters, no matter whether they are male or female, confined in traditional viewpoints or enlightened. Every actor in this large cast is excellent, but the work by Ardant, Bukstein and Shtamier is exemplary. This is a very fine film deserving of a wide audience, In Hebrew and French with subtitles.

		<shortDescription>how to say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure how to express my feelings on this film. I was thoroughly enjoying it until the film neared its conclusion. The ending seemed to contradict who the characters were in this film and left me feeling betrayed. If the first hour and forty minutes or whatever hadn't been so above par this movie would have been unwatchable. As it is I'm not sure that I could watch it again knowing how it ends, and I enjoy watching movies multiple times. With a better ending I would have had to give this movie about a 9 and I'm not sure if the ending disillusions me so because the rest of the film contrasts with it so vividly or it really is that awful. Either way you can decide for yourself if you watch this movie. I just hope that you won't feel as betrayed by the ending as I did, giving this movie a 3 now leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth and a sick feeling in my stomach. If you want to give it a chance I would recommend stopping it at maybe 5 minutes left in the film (not credits) at least then you won't know how it disappoints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting, delicate film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I thought this is a lesbian film then after watching it, I realize this is much more than a romantic lesbian film. The movie starts off with the lead actress, Naomi, who has a very traditional upbringing in Israel, who is a very smart and confident young girl and just lost her mother. Before she enters the role of wife and mother, she wants to do something for herself. Although she can't be the rabbi, she wants to study more about the religion so she entered the school in Safed. There, she met a free spirited and rebellious girl, Michal. They both helped this non-Jew woman to cleanse her sins of murdering her lover and leaving her husband and children. Throughout the whole cleansing process, not only they helped this woman to gain her inner peace, they also discovered something within themselves. They developed the deep connection and more appreciation for each other's differences. Their friendship went above and they fell in love with each other. After helping this woman, they both got expelled by the school. Originally, they were to get an apartment together. But in this traditional culture and society dominated by men, Michal decided to follow the traditional rules and get married. At the end, Naomi showed up in Michal's wedding. When Michal asked if she could forgive her, Naomi said no, cried, then smiled and both danced in the wedding. It is sad to see the couple who developed a deep connection were separated by the society!! There are several plots in this movie- helping the outcast against all and realizing what you want and going after what you want but being stopped by the society. It was very deep, emotional, and touching. Their acting were superb. It was very convincing. It was really impressive for this movie to focus on so many levels: religions, self realization and acceptance, and society expectations. Job well done. strongly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hope for North American Release!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living in a secular society and not being religious myself this movie was like visiting another planet. It's a world where religion is taken seriously. And when I say religion I don't mean believing in God (or G-d, as in the sub-titles), but rather the understanding of what God said is studied seriously. Again, while I'm not religious, I admired the fact that the girls took it so gravely seriously. I admit I cannot make a judgment on the accuracy of the movie as a depiction of Orthodox Jews, but the world is filled with societies where women are treated as less then men so it wouldn't surprise me if it was true. As a movie, it was funny and dramatic and entertaining and never lost my interest for a moment. I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival 2007, but I hope this gets some North American release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Sides Of The Same (Dark) Coin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What we have here is,yet,another shining example of what is supposed to be good for you can also be really,really bad for you. In this case, it is religion. The story concerns Naomi (played to perfection by Ania Bukstein),who is a young woman who wants to study theology at a seminary,much against the wishes of her ultra-Orthodox Rabbi father, as well as her straight laced,traditional husband to be,Michael (played by Guri Alfi),who's view of women is that they should be home, serving their husband &amp; G-d. When Naomi does manage to enter the seminary,she meets an equally headstrong young woman,Michelle (Michal Shtamler),who she takes an instant dislike to,but eventually forge a friend ship. When the two of them take on duties beyond studies,they bring food to a middle aged Parisian woman,Anouk (played by the always welcome Fanny Ardant),they find out of her dark past &amp; try to help her regain her spiritual centre by dabbling in the ancient Kabbalah (the realm of Judism that embraces mysticism,which is strictly forbidden in ultra Orthodox households). Things only become more involved when the two young women discover their budding sexuality during a sleep over (and for the benefit of any of you perverts out there that are thinking, "BOY,MIDDLE EASTERN LESBO PORN!!!", think again---the subject material is handled with good taste). Avi Nesher directs &amp; co writes (with Hadar Galron)a crisp,well written script that is guaranteed to be a lightning rod for controversy (as homosexuality is absolutely a no no in Orthodox Judism). This film may be a bit of a find,as there are not a lot of cinemas that will screen a two hour film, spoken in Hebrew &amp; French,with subtitles (art houses seem to be about the only logical choice,here). Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains a bit of rude language,full frontal female nudity &amp; a bit of sexual experimentation. Okay for more mature minded teens that may be interested in matters of a spiritual nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intricately Woven, Beautifully Depicted Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting to see this film ever since I saw it on Ardant's profile two years ago--and let me assure you, it was well worth the wait! Noemi and Michal befriend the terminally-ill Anouk, who seeks their help in finding the "secret" to ending God's wrath against Anouk. But this seemingly meek outcast has several "secrets" of her own--secrets that have Noemi questioning her reasons for seeking help. When the seminary discovers this odd relationship, Noemi and Michal are forbidden to help Anouk's quest for salvation. Will the girls do as they are told, and follow the rules established by society? Or will they do what they know to be right, even if it is deemed "wrong" by everyone else? Nesher does an excellent job of directing this film and bringing out the absolute best in each actress. Ania Bukstein gives a compelling performance as Noemi, a young woman torn between the traditional ideas of her family and the radical desires of her heart. Bukstein blew me away with her emotional intensity--she depicts Noemi as repentant, albeit headstrong, walking a fine line between piety and blasphemy. She should have won every award Israel had to offer for this role! With such a strong actress, an equally strong costar is needed--and Nesher was spot-on in choosing Michal Shtamler as the willful yet soulful Michal/Michelle. Shtamler, who apparently learned her French lines phonetically (although she could've fooled me, and I'm a French major!), gives a break-out performance that is equally stunning. And of course we cannot forget Fanny Ardant, the Crown Jewel of French Cinema. As usual, Ardant plays her role to perfection--she is absolutely mesmerizing. As Anouk, the tragic-muse-turned-murderer, Ardant captivates the audience with her frailty and honesty--all while weaving a web of mystery that leaves you wondering who exactly this woman is. Another great performance to add to her already-stunning resume.I have only highlighted the main story line--Nesher, however, weaves in multiple tales to create this cinematic masterpiece. The rest of the cast also give great performances, creating unforgettable characters and breathing life into the already great script. The film is a beautifully executed portrait of the battle between mainstream society and free will, and what happens when the two come into conflict.</fullReview>

That's pretty brave. But it seems to me that in the last 10 minutes the movie just changes out of nowhere.I don't know if this actually count as a spoiler but... -SPOILER ALERT- Those great characters are now completely unrecognizable and the story just takes a turn to accommodate a "safe" ending that wouldn't offend anyone and it felt like absolutely nothing was accomplished through the whole film.It may sound silly but this ending actually made me feel betrayed.It's as if the director got scared of making an ending that was coherent with the story, so instead he made one that said basically "no matter how hard you try to change the 'system', you will always fail",maybe that was what he was aiming for, if so congratulations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwrought but effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rigidity of male-dominated ultra-Orthodox Judaism and the heresy of female same sex partnership inform Avi Nesher's overwrought but effective melodrama, The Secrets. The film, nominated for eight awards by the Israeli Film Academy, is about a young woman who values "truth above tradition, sincerity above conformity, and human needs above legal technicalities" but runs into a buzz saw led by those who cannot see beyond ancient words. Naomi (Ania Bukstein) at first seems like a traditional rabbi's daughter ? withdrawn, intellectual, and submissive, one who does not question her father Rabbi Hess (Sefi Rivlin) or his orthodoxy. Since her mother has died, however, she has become more aware of the limited role her mother played in the family life, a role that led to her depression.She tells her father "Often when I came into this kitchen, I found her weeping.", and begins to question the direction of her own life. Instead of agreeing to marry her fiancé Michael (Guri Alfi), one of her father's rabbinical students, a man she does not love and who treats her in a condescending manner, she asks instead to postpone the marriage and go away to study at the Daat Emet seminary for women in Safed, an old city noted for its devotion to practices of mystical Judaism. The seminary is an avenue for Jewish women who want to study Talmud and Torah before they plunge into marriage. It is led by a woman who hopes that someday there will be a female rabbi, but offers only patience and faith while quietly awaiting a "silent revolution".One of Naomi's roommates, Michelle (Michal Shtamler), is an irritable young woman recently arrived in Israel from Paris. Naomi and Michelle are assigned to deliver food daily to Anouk (Fanny Ardant), a cancer patient, also from France. They learn that Anouk has recently been released from prison after serving fifteen years for murder, an event Anouk describes as a crime of passion. Although the reasons are not explained, she has come to Israel to seek healing and redemption for her crime even though she is not Jewish. She wants God to forgive her before she dies and wants Naomi and Michelle to help her achieve atonement.Anouk asks for a Tikkun, an ancient Kabbalistic cleansing ritual based on the symbol of Tikkun ha-Olam which embodies the command that humanity must restore and redeem a broken and fallen world. In some of the film's strongest sequences, the girls and Anouk visit a holy cleansing pool in the middle of the night because it is off limits for women. Feminist and Lesbian issues are touched in Naomi and Michelle's growing relationship that expands into sexual exploration. An additional subplot involves the high-spirited Yanki (Adir Miller), a klezmer clarinetist who has his eyes on the marriage possibilities with one of the girls. While the film may be over-plotted and goes on too long, it is wonderfully acted by Bukstein, Ardant, and Shtamler and makes clear that the fight against dogma and religious intolerance is one that is as real today as ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just LOVE this film.The story is heart-wrenching and Naomi's brave character just won me over completely. Ania Bukstein is simply brilliant. And so is Michal Shtamler. I never expected a film about the Jewish faith can be so liberal (though more conventional thoughts are also included). This is the first time I ever watch films by Avi Nesher and certainly I will keep my eye open for future productions by the same director. Even a small step, hopefully this film will also help to eliminate discrimination in areas where orthodox views are still dominant. Hats off for a great director and wonderful cast. The music inside is hauntingly beautiful too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, Thought Provoking, and Sad..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched so many Lesbian Films, This is not an usual Lesbian Film, it's really more than that, worth watching, worth every seconds you've spent, worth every dollars, Entertaining, thought Provoking, but don't watch the ending if you don't wanna cry!.After watching the movie, it's awesome, I'm in love with Ania Bukstein (Naomi) character, especially when she said "I'm not like you, I am not a coward", inspires me so much.But, This film somehow showed me how to be Brave and strong like Naomi, and the art of Letting her go (Letting Michelle go) and Let her be happy with her choice, her determination.&#xfeff;I really hope if there will be a sequel for this film.Ania Bukstein deserve an award for her performance in this film.very recommended !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really excellent film and one I'll watch again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish there were more films like this that are entertaining but explore cultural elements that are truly priceless for those who are not living day-to-day in similar religions or cultures. This film was multi-generational, and touched me deeply, even as I know I would not be likely in the typical marketing group. I have to say, it's just well-written, superbly acted and directed and compelling in a unique and interesting way. I felt I was learning and growing but also feeling the emotional upheaval that goes on in these types of compromising situations with family, with love, with societal norms. But the film isn't preachy. It's sexy at times, it's educational and the cinematography is sublime and smart. Hollywood would not diss this film, as it follows many qualities of a commercial, popular film that would find a mass audience. The music, which should always be mentioned, was perfect for the scenes. The timing of actors was impeccable, and story was full of truth, even if the situation could seem far-fetched; it never felt overly produced or concocted from some means to make the story more exciting or commercial. The actresses deserve big kudos. Amazing work - all of them. I will likely want to buy my own copy of this film. Hope the director can find his way to make another and use these actors again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Israeli films just get better and better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautifully shot in the holy city of Tzfat, I wanted to see the film simply for the surroundings because I love this town. But the photography blew me away as did the actress Michal Shtamler and of course, the wonderful Fanny Ardent who embodies French elegance and refinement, even if she is a tad too beautiful to be a dying woman in this film.My only problem with this movie is that (because it was made by a man), certain scenes regarding the physical relationship between the two protagonists of the film were totally gratuitous and only made to titillate. Too bad. I mean, was that really necessary?, but without giving anything away, you'll understand why I think it's normal that a male director would add that in a film like this.But it's a great story, and it doesn't ride too hard on the chick flick element.See it, then go to Israel and take a trip up to Tzfat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, well acted, a little inaccurate and self-defeating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies about strictly Orthodox Jews come with a built-in problem. Everyone wants a boy-meets-girl story, but in real life these boys and girls aren't allowed to meet alone. So THE SECRETS pretends that the prohibition doesn't exist, and it's not the first movie to pretend so. It also throws out the window the Orthodox rule that says women shouldn't be singing within earshot of men; but at least, in doing so, it provides some good listening. The city of Safed is beautifully photographed, and the actors do their work well. The supporting actors were drawn largely from the ranks of Israeli comedy, but being separated from their usual images by Orthodox trappings, they don't ring a false note (except Adir Miller, who can't be blamed for allowing the audience to see he's not really playing that clarinet). Fanny Ardent the guest actress does her best with a part in which her physical suffering waxes and wanes for reasons that seem to have more to do with the drama's demands of the moment than with any treatment she is receiving. The lead actress is convincing in her quest to promote greater religious responsibility for women, but if that's the filmmakers' agenda, they were too caught in their own mindset to realize that for many members of a general audience, the fact that she has lesbian tendencies as well feeds negative stereotyping of feminists. The script also suffers a bit from coincidence syndrome, but it is a nobly ambitious script with at least one big thinking point, about how sometimes "no" is the most positive answer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can not do it? hurl darts at every component of this misbegotten effort. Doing so would exceed Amazon's verbiage cap. Ms. Ardant was the drawing card; but the diffuse, overwrought, condescending and pedantic The Secrets merely delivers a rancid load of Giffilte fish. Ardant's role was ridiculous, though she gave it her all and then some.Contesting a certain reviewer's perspective, this GM can't justify a default ***** review for every gay-themed or Israeli film.An e-x-t-e-n-s-i-v-e list of distributors, producers and underwriters preceded the opening titles, leading me to think this might have been a student film. Still: It's what's on screen that counts; and in the case at hand, there's way too little of value.</fullReview>
