		<shortDescription>Entertaining comedy with scene-stealing dog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Down and Out in Beverly Hills" is a very funny 1986 comedy from director Paul Mazursky. Nick Nolte stars as a down-and-out bum who one day, after his dog leaves him and goes to live somewhere else, tries to drown himself in the swimming pool of a rich couple. The man of the house (played delightfully by Richard Dreyfuss) saves his live and decides to take him in despite the objections of his wife (played wonderfully by Bette Midler). The bum becomes an influence over everybody in the household. Plus, their dog starts to love the bum. There are big laughs throughout the film, though the movie is a little less funny than Bette Midler's other 1986 comedy "Ruthless People". Still, "Down and Out" has some terrific performances from Midler, Dreyfuss, Nolte, and the rest of the supporting cast. But the real scene-stealer here is the performance by Mike the Dog as Matisse, the canine with a dog psychiatrist. Mike gives one of the best performances by an animal of all-time.***1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Remake of a French Comedy Featuring a Winning Cast...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DOWN &amp; OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS is a smart American remake of the French film BONDU SAVED FROM DROWNING updated to modern day Beverly Hills. In this version, a homeless man accidentally wanders onto the property of a wealthy Beverly Hills family and tries to drown himself in their pool. Upon rescue, the family takes pity on him and take him in but the bum gets a little too comfortable and begins biting the hand that feeds him (in more ways than one). Nick Nolte gives a rock solid performance as Jerry, the homeless bum who ends up running the Whiteman home. Nolte has rarely been so convincing in a role...apparently he spent several weeks on the streets of LA pretending to be homeless in preparation for the role. Richard Dreyfuss plays Dave Whiteman, the wealthy owner of a hanger company who takes Jerry in and initially envies Jerry's freedom before Jerry goes too far. Bette Midler is very funny as Dave's social climbing wife Barbara and Tracy Nelson plays their snooty college student daughter. Evan Richards also has some funny moments as the Whiteman son, Max. Paul Mazursky's spirited direction (Mazursky also cameos as one of Dave's fat-cat friends)and a clever screenplay help to make this one of the more entertaining comedy confections from the 80's. There is also a scene-stealing performance by a dog named Mike, who plays the Whiteman family pet, Matisse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Still funny upon seeing it the second time - 20 years after its first-run viewing. Every character is likable - Nolte, Dreyfuss and Midler in the starring roles, and every one of the primary co-star and the supporting cast.Nolte is an outstanding actor, and this role and his harder-edged character in the great "North Dallas Forty," are among his very best. Many actors exhibit far different personalities off-screen than "on" ( e.g. Nicholson), or are downright goofy in real life (Cruise, Jolle, Affleck/Lopez, etc.). But I've never seen any whom I wish might be more like his on-screen persona than Nolte. The guy has charisma, believability, and is completely likable in every role.Here, he staggers, pretty much literally, homeless, into the mansion of a Beverly Hills wealthy family as dysfunctional (although pleasantly so) as any on the planet.Of course, his presence and "counsel" take care of all their neuroses - bringing a relaxed enjoyment of life to Dreyfuss, a reawakening of sexual delight in Midler, enjoyment (and relief from anorexia/bulimia) to the winsome daughter, direction to the frustrated adolescent son, happiness to the sexy Latino maid, and effecting a change in the family pooch to where he can now enjoy the pleasant life of a contented, happy pet.The diversions and hi-jinks in the story are also pleasant - often these necessary components of a film can detract - and the equally necessary closing events lead to a pleasant rapprochement and a happy ending.An excellent, "feel good" viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Nick Nolte was arrested for DUI in 2002 and they published his mug shot picture I thought it was Jerry Baskin. I first saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and found it very amusing. This is a re-telling of playwright René Fauchois' Boudu sauvé des eaux that was made into a film in 1932. In this story the rescued drowning man is played by Nick Nolte who is a down and out former actor who is homeless and had but one friend, his stray dog. He can't find his dog and wanders into the backyard of a Beverly Hills dysfunctional and affluent family where he plans to end it all by drowning in their swimming pool. Homeowner Richard Dreyfuss comes to the rescue and the homeless man, Jerry becomes a wanted and unwanted guest in their home. Bette Midler is Dreyfuss' wife, Tracy Nelson is the daughter, Evan Richards is the son, Elizabeth Pena is the maid and Little Richard is the next-door-neighbor. A fun situational comedy, the screenplay was written by Paul Mazursky and Leon Capetanos who collaborated on several films with Mazursky. Mazursky is a multi-talented director/writer/producer/actor who also appears in this film. He got wrote and produced I Love You Alice B. Toklis and then went on to big success as the director of Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice. In the 70's he had some other notable films that he directed including Harry and Tonto and An Unmarried Woman but his only film of note in the 80's was Moscow on the Hudson and after Down and Out in Beverly Hills directed only seven other films of little note and his writing creativity seems to have stalled to as he only wrote four more screenplays in the past 20 years. Cinematographer Donald Mcalpine is this film's photographer. He's had recent success with Chronicles of Narnia. Some of his other films include Mrs. Doubtfire, Predator, My Brilliant Career and Breaker Morant. Andy Summers of the rock band the Police provides the music score. The Talking Heads song Once in a Lifetime which was 6 years old was used as the theme song of the film and it suddenly became a charting single. This is a good film if you've never seen it and a good look back to the 80's. I would give it an 8.0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I may not know what's funny, but I know what I like. I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. I don't know, or care if it is supposed to be a satire or not. Between the son and the dog and the neighbor and the anorexic daughter and the maid, not to mention the three main characters, there are many funny moments. Nick Nolte, insinuating himself on this dysfunctional family, headed by Richard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler, appears to steer them all in the right direction, with plenty of nice moments along the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure it hasn't dated all that well, but look at this 1986 hit as a nice time capsule of L.A. from that time period. A period that basically ended with the sobering and terrifying riots of 1992. Down and Out in Beverly Hills deals with a well-to-do yet dysfunctional family having its priorities rearranged by a bum who first attempts to drown himself in their swimming pool. Nick Nolte, looking only a little scruffier than his 2002 Hawai'ian shirt mugshot plays the Jerry Baskin character on different levels. Early on he seems much like the typical run of the mill schizophrenic homeless person chasing after a dog who found himself a better owner. Then, after his dunk in the pool, we see that he is actually quite intelligent and observant. Almost instantly he sees what is wrong with everyone in the household. He just can't seem to point any of that intellect toward improving his own situation. Even when it is laying there right in front of him.The patriarch of the family is Dave Whiteman who embodies some of Richard Dreyfuss's better work. He is very successful, yet he it just too uptight. Something seems lacking for him. It isn't the appearance of the bum that sets him off. He actually is the one who most wants him to stay if perhaps to live vicariously through him in some ways. Bette Middler is on hand as Dave's sexually unfulfilled wife who mostly spends her time with worthless self-help gurus. She even has one hired for their cutesy little dog. Nolte is apparently the only man around who has what it takes to recharge her batteries in bed! The family has an attractive yet obviously anorexic daughter and an androgynous son. A sexpot Hispanic maid is also on hand for Dave to use at his will... that is until Nolte moves in on her as well. The film takes place over about a month's time and there really isn't much plot to speak of other than seeing how these characters are altered by Nolte's character.The film has several funny moments, and thankfully Ms. Middler is not allowed to sing too much. The theme song by the Talking Heads is always welcome to the human ear. Some of the comedy, mostly involving the cutesy dog reactions and Little Richard's exasperated yelling are more annoying than anything else. There are some great performances and many funny observations about successful Angelinos at that time. Not much of a message to be learned from any of it, however. Maybe that is why it works. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I visited a deli on Rodeo Drive just before this movie was released and was staggered by the uniformity in grooming. It was like a small-town high school in the 1950s. All the women looked alike. Beautiful. Their long hair fluffy, each strand curled like Top Ramen. (Okay, okay. I lack the vocabulary. Excuse me.) They all seemed to wear the same dark rough-knit long-sleeved sweaters, tight Levis, and leather boots. This is what one kills for? The privilege of wearing a uniform? Paul Mazursky has got the milieu down pat and he skewers it. I haven't seen the French original but, though it may be different, it's probably not funnier than this version.I'll skip the story except to say that it's about a homeless man (Nick Nolte) who is taken in by a wealthy dysfunctional family, and he straightens everyone out by giving them what they want -- as he puts it. Some gags are funnier than others, helped along by Mazursky's direction. When the spoiled, bored wife has an orgasm with the bum, she screams so loudly that the neighbors a block away turn to listen. A flock of pigeons is frightened out of its tree. I can't think of another movie that features a psychiatric veterinarian.The climax, unfortunately, is more silly than funny, as if nobody could think of an ending that would stop what's already gone by. Mazursky had the same problem with "Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice," at the end of which the sting of genuine phoniness gives way completely to fantasy and everyone does a ring dance to "What The World Needs Now Is Love..." In "Down and Out in Beverley Hills," a party ends with the accidental setting off of a fireworks display and everyone jumping into the pool. You almost wince at the desperation behind this scene.And then, in a denouement, when the bum decides to leave with the family dog, the whole family and their servants follow him into the mews behind the mansion and beg him with their eyes to come back, which he does quickly enough. Sure, it's a happy ending, but just exactly what is going to happen when Nolte returns after he's been exposed as a lying, manipulative, lazy scuzzbag who has given the son permission to be a transvestite and has been doing both his host's wife and daughter? All he had with him when he first entered the family was a pocket full of rocks. This time he's got a lot of baggage.Still, it's a light-hearted and engaging comedy, and none of the acting hurts a bit. Aside from the doggy's psychiatrist, I thought Little Richard was the most memorable character, especially when he complains about how much longer it takes the police to respond to HIS emergency alarm than his white neighbors'. (The dog chases him away, tearing at his golden robe.) Dreyfus is quite good too, reminding me of his performance as the exasperated and finally mad psychiatrist in "What About Bob?" Mazursky wisely avoided any attempt to insinuate overt signs of "seriousness" into the screenplay. A comedy doesn't need dark undertones to be successful, and this is successful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Nolte is "Down and Out in Beverly Hills," a 1986 film directed and co-written by Paul Mazursky and starring Richard Dreyfuss, Bette Midler, Elizabeth Pena, Little Richard, and Tracy Nelson. Nolte is Jerry, a street person so low even his dog leaves him for a kind jogger. While searching for his dog, he stumbles onto the property of Dave and Barbara Whiteman - Whiteman is a clothes hanger king living the good life in Beverly Hills. Filling his pockets with rocks, Jerry attempts suicide by diving into the Whiteman pool, but is saved and ultimately taken in by Dave. Jerry isn't particularly grateful - he wants Courvoisier instead of the alcohol offered him, and, given dinner, questions the meat on the turkey. Dave, guilty about his wealth, bored with his life, and wanting to do some good, buys Jerry clothes and lets him live at the mansion. He even offers Jerry jobs, which Jerry doesn't accept. Jerry's history is on the vague side - he speaks of doing the concert piano circuit, he is recognized in a restaurant by as a writer, maybe he did some acting...hard to know. Before long, he's taken over the entire household, becoming the only one in the house that the Whiteman's psychologically disturbed dog, Matisse, can tolerate, Barbara Whiteman's masseuse and the man who finds her G-spot, the lover of housekeeper Carmen (Pena) after Dave goes back to sleeping with Barbara, the man who gets the Whiteman's anorexic daughter (Nelson) to fall in love with him and start eating; and the man who convinces the androgynous Whiteman son to come out to his parents. Too late, Dave realizes he's Dr. Frankenstein, and Jerry is the monster.This is an entertaining film with dark undertones and good performances, particularly from Nolte, Dreyfuss, Midler, Pena and Mike (Matisse the dog). Little Richard is a riot as a neighbor. Nolte is in great shape here, as is Midler, who looks fantastic. The party scene toward the end of the film where Dreyfuss chases Nolte throughout the house and grounds is quite funny. The ending isn't the best, but it's a fun watch anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM.Down and Out in Beverley Hills is a comedy, which, bizarrely, gets funnier every year.Whereas it's release saw it as a fairly standard screwball farce, time sees it more and more as a parody of vain 80s obsessions. Among the targets are the growing trends for therapists, jogging, alternative religions, designer drugs and fashion diets.Richard Dreyfuss is perfect as Dave Whiteman, the nonplussed businessman in the centre of the chaos going on around him. Whereas in some movies the "cute dog" would be irritating, even this element is satisfying thanks to the open hatred he and Dreyfuss displays towards one another. I particularly like the scene where, unable to wreck Whiteman's sexual encounter with his mistress, the dog vindictively sets off the burglar alarm. Another nice touch is an early spoof reference to "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", which of course starred Dreyfuss in the lead role. Closer inspection of the film reveals that it's also a lot wittier than you remembered.Bette Midler's meditating, shallow and indulgent Barbara acts a light counterpoint to the social conscience thrown up by Nick Nolte's tramp, Jerry. Jerry's entry into the household, 35 minutes in, initiates a radical change in all the characters, with Jerry seducing all three women in Dreyfuss' life, helping his son to out himself, and taming his dog.What makes this film a little bit special is the slightly darker, thoughtful edge it portrays. While it admittedly doesn't see through all the issues it throws up, this is a more intelligent than average comedy, with neatly drawn characters and a satisfying resolution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-meaning comedy shows its age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seen today, DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS is hampered by its obvious eighties-ness, which still doesn't detract from its fair quota of charms. When a homeless man, Jerry (played by the ever-reliable Nick Nolte) is saved from drowning in the swimming pool of nice-guy millionaire Dave (Richard Dreyfuss), his subsequent welcome into their family has unpredictable implications for Dave's badly-adjusted lot.The humour is still by-and-large amusing after all these years (a highlight being when Dreyfuss hangs out on the beach with Nolte's fellow bums), even if the periphery characters are slight and shallow. The appearance of Little Richard early-on signals he's got to find a piano before the film is through. Unfortunately, his character - a black record producer unhappy at the implicit racism of the suburbs - has nothing else to do in the mean time.While it hasn't stood the test of time, hamstrung by its good intentions and badly compromised ending, DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS is an amusing diversion. The most surprising outcome you draw from watching again a family that does not communicate is just how well the issues were addressed in AMERICAN BEAUTY, an altogether darker comedy, but more funny, sincere and resonant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the charms of Down and Out is it's "dated" quality. Paul Mazursky has a great talent for capturing an era in popular culture and some of his movies, such as Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice are incredible historical records of their times as well as durable entertainment. Down and Out jump-started Richard Dreyfuss' flagging career, as well as Bette Midler's as a movie actress and Little Richard as a popular singer. This is something modern audiences probably don't know, just a historical side note. Nick Nolte prepared for the part by actually living on the street and not bathing for a month. An actor who takes his parts seriously.Another fun quality of Mazursky's films is that he puts his friends and family into his movies. Don Muhich, the dog psychiatrist, was Paul's psychotherapist in the '70s and has that role in two other Mazursky movies (B&amp;C&amp;T&amp;A and Blume in Love)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Infectious fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't one of Mazursky's better, serious films but it is an awful lot of fun nevertheless and it stays in the memory. It's an American reworking of Renoir's "Boudu sauve des eaux" and in the role of the scampish tramp it has the great Nick Nolte who looks like a disheveled bear. He's the Boudu character rescued by Beverly Hills businessman Richard Dreyfuss who is as genial and as soft as a poached egg and who radiates goodness. He's the kind of man who feels he has to set the world to rights but isn't pushy enough to do it. That can't be said of his jiggly wife, Bette Midler, who is brash, lewd and who seems to be wearing dresses several sizes too small for her. Midler moves like a mini tornado and her performance has some of the energy of her stage shows. Between them, Nolte, Dreyfuss and Midler bring combined wit and intelligence to the material. They seem to be having a right old time and their pleasure is infectious. Mazursky keeps things on a low boil and lets his players have their rein. It's to our advantage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Mazursky on familiar ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Mazursky's southern California update of Jean Renoir's 1932 comedy 'Boudo Saved From Drowning' stars Nick Nolte as a skid row derelict rescued from attempting suicide in the backyard swimming pool of upscale executive Richard Dreyfuss. Installed quite suddenly in the lap of luxury, Nolte begins exerting unusual influence over his benefactors, but the ambiguity of the character and his intentions is needlessly destroyed in the final scenes. Mazursky is on familiar ground for most of the movie, as always at his best when mocking the lifestyles of the rich and trendy, but it's a shame that he felt compelled to combine scenes of near sublime social satire with indiscriminate numbskull farce. Someone should have told him that seeing people fall fully clothed into a swimming pool (as most of the cast is required to do at the film's climax) is only funny when you're there to witness it firsthand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks spice and urgency, down but not out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Down and Out in Beverly Hills features an excellent cast doing probably their each individual best work. The casting itself is pitch perfect right down to the two dogs. But I believe the problem stems from the direction. The films claims it's a comedy, when really, it's a chuckle-delivering drama. I think director Paul Mazursky accidentally made the premise a bit too serious.You know how people say a film is "love it or hate it?" I think Down and Out in Beverly Hills is "love it or accept it." I think of these kinds of films sort of as "elegant comedies" where the sets and actors are very classy, but it's questionable you'd want to see a movie with those kind of characters. Other movies I believe fit into my sub-genre are Arthur and Fierce Creatures. They aren't bad films, but I don't believe the characters are interesting enough to carry the weight of a full length film on their backs.The plot: A rich family's life is changed when a bum tries to commit suicide in their backyard pool. The family is made wealthy because the husband, Dave Whiteman (Dreyfuss), is the head of a coat-hanger factory. His wife Barbara (Midler) is happy with the wealth, but unsatisfied as a person. Her and Dave's relationship is complex and she is more often than not left unfulfilled by her husband.The bum is played fantastically by Nick Nolte. His name is Jerry, and after his "faithful" dog companion runs away to find a home with a jogger, Jerry jumps in the Whitemans' pool when it is draining to try and kill himself. Seconds away from being gone, Dave jumps in to save the man and to revitalize him as a human being to make him happier in life.An act of role reversal is made here where the happier half is the bum and the sadder half is the wealthy family, so the film gives a sincere look at how some people live their lives and how some are happier than others. The problem is just in the way it's executed which is hard to explain. It's hokey and not as inspired as it would seem.Paul Mazurksy has a talent for squeezing the most out of his actors and giving them constant, incorruptible, shockingly well-built chemistry. Later in his career, he provided the same chemistry to Woody Allen and Bette Midler in Scene from a Mall, a movie that besides the chemistry, has little to offer. The setup between the three leads is anything but contrived and highly welcomed as they each give their own sense of screen magic.So, what is wrong with Down and Out in Beverly Hills? It's honestly hard to say. I sat through the whole thing, no interruptions, and upon finishing it I reached a quandary. I didn't know if I liked what I just watched. Sitting down, writing this hasn't helped much either. I think it's one of those films that is cute, warm, and gentle, but that's it. There's nothing wrong with that if that's what you're looking for, but there isn't much urgency or attraction equipped in the script. Just a bunch of characters wandering around, awaiting the next predicament to fall into.Starring: Richard Dreyfuss, Bette Midler, and Nick Nolte. Directed by: Paul Mazursky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of 1986</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not that 1986 was a bellwether for good film-making, but I thought this was the best film of that particular year. Mazursky's work as a director has famously been erratic, and this was the last good thing he did. Richard Dreyfuss was surprisingly good in this film, and it was a treat to see Little Richard, and his song "Great Gosh A Mighty" which some may not remember, came from this film (although no Oscar nomination for Best Song!). And a lot of the film's small touches (the doggie psychologist, the Jewish father always complaining there's not enough white meat in the Thanksgiving turkey), made this one of the few films I've ever laughed out loud watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny to see how little attention "Down And Out" gets today - bare-bones DVD release, a paucity of IMDb reviews, a modest Wikipedia entry - given that less than 25 years ago this was one of the highest-grossing comedies of its day. What happened?The stamp of the 1980s may be part of the problem. A very '80s look and vibe surround this social satire, where a bum named Jerry (Nick Nolte) is rescued by hanger tycoon Dave Whiteman (Richard Dreyfuss) and put up in his fancy Beverly Hills estate. Jerry finds ways to ingratiate himself with everyone in the household, even the normally hostile Whiteman dog Matisse. Dave soon finds reason to curse his generosity.I'm in agreement with ratnazafu's earlier comment that this film's connection to its time is part of its charm, though its pastels-and-neon visual signature is not for everyone. The script by director Paul Mazursky and Leon Capetanos is fun and arrestingly non-formulaic, but rather underbaked in such matters as who Jerry really is and what the issues are with the Whitemans' distrait offspring. Most critically, there's a tonal problem at the center - Nolte's direly realistic acting manner clashes with the film's overall cheerful and lightweight spirit."There's something very threatening about you," Jerry is told early on by Dave's wife, Barbara (Bette Midler).Nolte famously prepared for the role by living for days as a vagrant (insert obvious Nolte joke here), and I think the experience made it hard for him to settle into a comedy about being homeless. His gruff, bleary manner is established early and never quite goes away, even as the script paints him in the role of a smooth-talking rascal.In one scene, we see Dave and some new homeless friends parody the famous "We Are The World" song in a drunkenly over-the-top, amusing manner. Nolte is in the center of the frame, but tries to get out of the shot by hiding his face behind a pole. I don't think he saw himself acting in a comedy, and for the most part, he isn't.Dreyfuss and Midler, on the other hand, have a lot of palpable fun, and their careers deservedly got huge boosts from their performances here. At times Dreyfuss seems to be channeling Jackie Gleason, but it works, especially as he develops Dave as a genuinely likable character frustrated by his new friend Jerry's refusal to join the rat race. Midler does well with a tougher part, a shopaholic narcissist. "That was the cherry on the cake of my day" she groans when Dave tells her he saw their son in a tutu.Jerry finally achieves his breakthrough with Barbara through sex, a device the film not only plays up with a silly orgasm scene but repeats with the Whitemans' maid and daughter. The latter ravishment proves a breaking point for Dave, who loses it in a big finale which throws up as much fireworks as it can in a way that points up the story's overall lack of nourishment.Mazursky movies have a unique quality, full of ideas and visual invention, diverting enough so that you don't particularly mind even when they don't go anywhere special. There's nothing dislikable about "Down And Out", unless maybe you are Nick Nolte, but nothing memorable, either.</fullReview>

(TV)~~~~~~~~ (-:~ by now i am 29. one year ago i got the DVD and even now again, i watched the movie already 3 times again.to me the beauty in that move is: exactly all those gaps in between of the characters in that movie give it a wondrous atmosphere. i love the way the rugged gets lost inside the family without having any attachments towards the offers he gets from everybody. he remains completely non attracted.a similar feeling i got from "barfly" - Mickey Rouke being an alcoholic "bar-boxer" (-: cu? * DavidIn Germany "Down and out in Beverly Hills" is known by the title: Zoff in Beverly Hills)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>you can be poor, you can be rich, you can be.. happy ..This is a really cool movie. The first time I saw it, a few years ago, I enjoyed it so much .. I've seen it over and over.. and I can still apreciatte it ..Nick Nolte does a really nice job playing a man without a home, but who has certain happyness and good street friends. The scene on the beach shows that really well. And Richard D's character also gets that.. In the other side a rich, but not so happy family. Nick Nolte brings hapyness to the family .. proving that money isn't always happyness..It's a really good movie, hope it gets out on DVD R2 at my country ASAP..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rich, Bette, and a 'bum' in Beverly Hills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that this movie was nominated for awards and only took one of the 4 or 5 nominations, is just perplexing. Bette was fun and did a good job, she was nominated. Dreyfus, was superb as Dave Whiteman, tongue-in-cheek, I love it! Richard Dreyfus was not nominated. But 'Nolte' as the Bum Baskin, 'Jerry', should have at least been nominated, that is absurd that he wasn't, in light of a 'capitol' performance! I had not seen this movie in many years. I had seen so many others and thought about viewing this again, when I finally bought the DVD, I was blown away! This movie hasn't lost and inch of it's original comedic height. Nolte (Jerry Baskin) looked as if with every step he took, that he was about to fall off the end of the earth. He looked like a street guy with atrophy in his muscles, from sleeping on sidewalks. He played down and out and 'bum' to the very edge. It was the best bum in any story that I have seen or could remember. I was interested in following this character through more than one or two scenes. For instance, in the park, staggering through after the absence was felt in regard to his 'Little tan dog' he bellowed out questions to passers by then, found himself at the mall. While inside, he abruptly inquired to the patrons interrupting their conversations and meals with no awareness or understanding as to what's going on with anyone, but himself. Then afterward when he's escorted out by two mall security guardsmen, his reactions, words and inflections were just 'picture' perfect. I have worked in places where there were many a transient at times and 'Nolte' being that character, with his attitude and abilities, just became, 'King'. In addition the two lead characters have something in common...dog problems! 'Matise'(Mike the dog) steals part of the show and chews on it a little. It was a riot when he got 'insensed' at 'Little Richard' and became a little anxious!! This little fellow, is a double-threat...'cute' and 'funny' too. He is a great supporting k-9 cast member. Mike does a great job as the family pet who ends up as jerry's little side kick.Not too far down the line, the introduction to 'the family' through Dave was a classic cinema moment in modern times. He 'up-ends' the whole apple cart, here. The even funnier parts are how things eventually turn and shift for Ole' Dave. I enjoyed the politically incorrect wit and sharp comedic retorts. The characters are developed to a 'T' and they interact and play out in absolute excellence. I would only recommend this to people that will understand and enjoy a hard driving politically incorrect film, with the enjoyable cynicism that this has. But even for those not well versed in movie intellect, this one is hard to miss, it really drives it home! It's infectious and in a way very timeless in some of the overtones. I rate it a Ten.

		<shortDescription>he came, he saw, he slept with all the women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Down and Out..." is an enjoyable enough, light mid-'80s time capsule directed by Paul Mazursky ("Moscow on the Hudson"). It is a reimagining of the far superior film "Boudu Saved From Drowning"--a movie by Jean Renoir that preceded it by 54 years. In this version, which features a good line- up--Nick Nolte as the central character, a vagrant; Richard Dreyfuss as the man who takes him in; and the always capable Bette Midler as Dreyfuss' laughable wife--Nolte's character, after being permitted to stay in the swanky home of Dreyfuss', who saves him, ends up bedding not just the mistress and the wife, but also the daughter. Unlike the source material he also ends up sticking around it seems. This movie is worth a watch, it's just not particularly memorable, there is nothing special about it--and it seems like Dreyfuss has played the same sort of character many times. In "What About Bob" he also portrays a middleaged family man whose life is turned upside-down by a guest. In this case the guest was first invited, and all the womenfolk want in his pants. And, like "What About Bob," also a far superior flick, the family man's fam/etc. all seem to like the guest more than the ineffectual patriarch. The Dreyfuss character gives the Nolte character a look at the very end like "You totally took over, didn't you? Not sure how I feel about that, even though I basically like you too." But at no point did I feel sorry for the Dreyfuss character, a philandering, quite ordinary and not so likable rich guy. This movie is good enough to spend part of a lazy afternoon on--just expect little other than a competently made, somewhat funny film with a better-than-average cast. If you want to see essentially the same story but a much more worthwhile version of it though see the excellent "Boudu Saved..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun skewering the Hills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barbara (Bette Midler) and Dave Whiteman (Richard Dreyfuss) are a wealthy Beverly Hills couple. He makes clothes hangers and is sleeping with the maid Carmen (Elizabeth Pe?a). She's obsessed with gurus and new age stuff. Their son Max is bitter with them and always filming with his camera. Their daughter Jenny (Tracy Nelson) is away at college with eating issues. The family is weird Hollywood and even the dog has a psychiatrist. Jerry Baskin (Nick Nolte) is a bum. His dog has left him. He tries to drown in Whitemans' pool. Dave rescues him and invites the not-so-grateful homeless man to stay. Orvis Goodnight (Little Richard) is the next door neighbor.It's interesting that grumpy Nick Nolte is not likable at the beginning. It's also interesting that he becomes more likable as Dave becomes more angry at him. At first, it concern me where the movie was going with the character. It may not hit with big laughs but it's biting in skewering the Hollywood stereotypes. In the end, it's a fun time with some memorable characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello everybody. It's my first review and I am not very sure It's gonna be the best. I'll try. I love cinema since I was a kid. It made me dream so soon and I tried my best my life to be the nearest to the fantasy world. This movie was very touching to me in some way. I don't know exactly why, but I felt very identified with its different characters. I think the story was very cheerful and funny. We all know that it doesn't have to be realistic to express that strange human nature in ourselves. I think this movie is a satire that talks about the immature people trying to give a sense to their lives. This premise doesn't change the fact that, even if it is silly, it is, to me, very endearing. Firstly, I like the principal character, because of his courage and his impertinence. Probably, this is which I will more identified with. Secondly, the rich family really made me laugh, each one of them, from the wife, so alienated in her superficial and material life, full of appearance, to the kid, the typical adolescent who doesn't know what to do with his life, so careless to his parents. Then its the servant, a sign that is a middle-high rich family of Beverly Hills, one of the most riches cities in the world. She is a Latin woman who doesn't have a hight level education and she soon choose to believe that she is oppressed by her boss. So she became Marxist. I know that this story sounds absurd, but I think that this picture is probably one of the best entertaining comedies I ever seen. I like watching it from time to time. I probably will watch it again soon. I like very much the rhythm of the film, its music and its montage. It's a very swift movie, easy to see. Nothing complex. Even though, you can always feel that the filmmaker is talking about deep matters. That is the good thing of art. You can always discover new reviews and feel new experiences across them. Im very sorry about my English. I'm practicing because it's been a long time a didn't practice. I hope to improve it on the future. I would like to write much more in the future. I have spent a long time watching thousands of movies and I want to share my experience and my opinions. I hope anyone to like it or find it useful. I'm sure there is many people here who loves cinema as much as I do, probably more. I'm not watching by now so many movies as I used to do, but I still feel for films a deep love and respect. I've been thinking a long time that films have many to give to the people, not only entertaining but culture, freedom and learning. I know this is to simple to be written, but I need to be clear, so I could find my way to be happier in the future. I think we are all destined to be happier if we make and effort for that, the right thing. Thank you very much to all who have red me. I hope to write soon again. Kind regards and wishes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Mazursky's career may have its ups and downs, but this is an up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years playing singular souls, Nick Nolte got a comic role in "Down and Out in Beverly Hills". He plays homeless Jerry Baskin, who after losing his dog decides to drown himself in a swimming pool. He might have succeeded, had the pool's owner Dave Whiteman (Richard Dreyfuss) not seen him. So, Dave takes Jerry into his posh Beverly Hills house, with some pretty wild consequences.Maybe overall, this movie isn't anything really special, but it does have some funny scenes. Bette Midler is just great as Dave's unfulfilled wife Barbara, who finds new fulfillment with Jerry. I really liked the beach scene. It's a pretty funny movie, and it shows that, while director Paul Mazursky's - who has a supporting role in the movie - career may be uneven, he can certainly do good movies. Also starring Little Richard and Elizabeth Pena.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie from the beginning to the end. I think the song of 'Talking Heads' is very suitable and amusing. Nick Nolte performs again a character of a poor man, now more poor than before. I think any other actor could do a better acting for this kind of role of this film. It's very funny to me the sequence when Dreyfuss want contract Nolte for a job in a production line in his clothes-hunger factory, and Nolte answers him this is not in his line!. Jerry (Nolte´s character) don´t want to be tied to any place and want have a free way of living, but he is sentimentally tied to his companion (the dog). At the end he can´t resist the temptation of a good life with a family who loves him and a way of life with comfort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunny, light and fairly amusing happy-go-lucky comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Down &amp; Out in Beverly Hills' is a good film in retrospect. It's one of those bright, `just for fun' comedies that existed between 1982 and 1992. Sadly this genre that consisted of feel good movies such as `L.A. Story', `Mr. Destiny' and `My Blue Heaven' doesn't exist in the fast moving world of today. Anyway, the film isn't perfect and has plenty of bad flaws.One of the problems is the way the film grips at the start, but into the last half-hour, it begins to ramble and loses your attention. It could have done with some rather un-necessary scenes being excised. In the supporting cast, the acting standard is a bit ropey. Even though the film is only 99 minutes, it only barely going into overlength and getting too nonsensical. Only one more quibble- the title. Surely they could have come up with something a bit more attractive than `Down &amp; Out in Beverly Hills'. But the film isn't completely marred by these flaws. The acting standard is quite good. Back in the days when we could understand what he was saying, Nick Nolte gives a terrifically eccentric performance as the happy-go-lucky tramp brought into this stylish environment. Richard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler are quite good in their respective roles as the neurotic husband and the spoilt rich wife. While the rest of the acting isn't anything above adequate, the characters themselves are likeable. With the flamboyantly effeminate teenage son, the anorexic daughter and even a rather pointless cameo from rock &amp; roll superstar Little Richard.Even if it tends to bumble a bit towards the end, the theme song (Once in A Lifetime) starts and ends the film on a good note, leaving you with nothing but memories of the good things in the movie. There are some flaws in the narrative and in general, but if you don't take the film seriously, then you'll probably like it. I did and I though it was good. So I give it 6.4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Character Comedy Of Panhandler Amongst The Jet Set</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dave Whiteman is a successful businessman whose family are more than a little neurotic. One day, Jerry, a homeless man, tries to drown himself in Dave's swimming pool. Dave rescues him and takes him under his wing, and Jerry's different take on life and the world has a strangely beneficial effect on the whole family.This is a great culture clash comedy drama with lots of funny scenes, super performances and many intriguing little comments on family values. Dave is the perfect father-provider but nobody appreciates him, he's unable to communicate with his children and his wife's materialism and phony-baloney mysticism is ridiculous. When Jerry enters the scene, he becomes a buddy, a lover, an entertainer, a consultant, a father figure, even a dog trainer. Wisely however, the film avoids becoming too sentimental - whilst he may be interesting and well-travelled, Jerry is also an inveterate liar who is happy to exploit his position and his charm for all it's worth. In their opulence, the Whitemans have forgotten how to talk to each other and how to have fun, whereas while Jerry prizes his vagabond freedom he also conspicuously enjoys the good life. Dreyfuss and Nolte are both terrific in the leads, the former's nervous energy nicely balanced by the latter's irascible pragmatism. Midler is hilarious in support, as is fifties pop star icon Little Richard as the next door neighbour. The movie has a cool glossy sheen thanks to Donald McAlpine's ultra-sharp photography of the brilliant blue California sunshine. There is a nice little score by Andy Summers (of The Police) and a great opening title sequence featuring Talking Heads' memorable song Once In A Lifetime. Mazursky and Dreyfuss followed this with another great (but lesser-known) comedy, Moon Over Parador, which is well worth catching if you can. A funny movie, this is a remake of the 1932 Jean Renoir film Boudu Sauvé Des Eaux.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood's Idea Of A Bum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood borrowed the underlying premise from an old, old film called "Boudu Saved From Drowning". Writers dressed up the story to fit a 1986 audience. The rich Whiteman family lives in luxury in Beverly Hills. One day, in walks a tramp named Jerry Baskin (Nick Nolte). The plot then plays out as "comedy" and satire, as these two social class opposites interact.The script's plot points are in-your-face obvious; there's nothing at all subtle here. Scriptwriters try too hard to make these plot elements funny, and the result is that, except for the amusing expressions of the little dog, Matisse, there's very little that is actually funny. Characters, and the actors that play these roles, are mostly just grating.The best performance goes to Bette Midler, whose character Barbara is an emotionally frustrated rich woman, who employs a yogi to help her overcome the trials and tribulations of being wealthy.The rest of the cast is not so hot. Nick Nolte, as the bum, mostly just plays himself; neither Nolte nor his character persuades us they have ever had a hard day in their lives. Tracy Nelson comes across as an entitled Hollywood insider who got the role of Jenny, a spoiled 1980s prima donna.But the award for worst performance goes to the annoyingly overeager Richard Dreyfuss, another insider, who shouts and overacts his way through the entire film. Indeed, this film has a serious problem with overacting. I guess it's a way to try to compensate for the lack of humor in this so-called comedy.Cinematography and production values are fine. And I liked those interior scenes wherein Bette Midler walks out of her plush bathroom through a cascade of mirrors; that's nicely done. The film's score is not the least bit inspired. And the final fifteen-minute segment collapses into silly chaos, with an ending that is not remotely credible.Time-bound to the 1980s, "Down And Out In Beverly Hills" looks and feels dated. It strikes me as a film produced, written, directed, and acted by an ensemble of Hollywood insiders, none of whom have any idea of what it's like to be homeless, and couldn't care less. Homelessness is just another impersonal topic about which Hollywood can make a bundle of cash. Poor Mike, the dog that played Matisse; that dog needs to find an agent that can get him into better films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't watched this since the late 80's and just watched it again. It's really a masterpiece. It's a psychological/sociological/historical expose about the California life before the crash. It's also very prophetic in many ways; Such as Dreyfuss' character, Arnold was humping his help, all the hanger makers are in China now, and alternative medicine/practices are endemic outside of California now... :-)Prophetically also was Nolte's pre-incarnation as the "Dude" Labowski played by Jeff Bridges two decades later... I have a family member that became a millionaire from property value growth, growing a business, and then selling it all before the crash. Dreyfuss, Midler, and Nolte have proved to be three of the best performers of our lifetimes. Anyway, try it. You'll like. I'd love to see the Cohen brothers make a sequel or remake... :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disparity between the rich and poor has been around forever. These days it seems to be growing each day. Ideally we should all be able to peacefully coexist, but we don't live in that world right now. There have been a number of books and films made on the subject. Some treat the issue very seriously, others satirically. Take this film, based on the French play 'Boudu sauvé des eaux' and film of the same name. It involves a wealthy Beverly Hills family taking in a homeless man. The result is a smart, often funny satire.Pros: Great work by the cast. Intelligent script. Steady direction. Good score and soundtrack. Some good satire. Some particularly memorable moments, like the massage scene. Well paced.Cons: Dated in some aspects. Contrived ending.Final thoughts: With a cast like this one, how could they miss? Fortunately, they didn't by a longshot. Really great satire isn't easy to come by. This is an example of one that soars more than flops. The hair and decor date it some, but it holds up well otherwise.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

Soon everything is turned upside down for David.The premise is good enough, but the movie lacks... oh, what do you call it... oh yeah, laughs.

But the movie has other problems, besides its utter pointlessness; the most serious one is that it's rarely funny. It adds up to a rambling collection of episodes, most of which are passable and watchable enough, but none of which is funny or meaningful or strong enough to stop the film from sinking.

		<fullReview>I watched this flick some days ago, expecting a rather funny movie, since my TV guide called it a comedy. After I finished watching it, I tried to recall how many times it managed to get me laughing. Very few, I realized. After skipping through some of the reviews on this page, I wondered why so many people thought this movie was funny at all. To me, it was more social satire than comedy; bored, rich and neurotic white people trying to spice up their lives and a bum impersonating everyone they want him to be, helping and using his hosts at the same time.The script tries hard, but fails to produce many laughs, and the cheesy ending scene destroyed it all, wasting a potentially great cast. If you're interested in rich Beverly Hills residents' problems, you may take a look, but if you're searching for some good laughs, you're going to be very disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with my family when I was a kid. My family loved it, but I hated it. To this day I still don't know whatever possessed me to watch this inane movie. It's about this unhappy rich family who's lives are forever changed once some stranger tries to drown himself in their pool, and changes their lives forever. They also meet a variety of unfunny characters who do and say just the lamest things you could imagine.  The family and the characters they meet, and the situations they get into weren't at all funny. What's so funny about a teen girl with an eating disorder or a son who's confused about his sexuality? The dialogue is just as cheesy as the movie's title. And just the whole movie and the scenes and all of it were all just total blasphemy. Heck, I've seen more humor in Ed Wood movies! If you want to see a comedy please sit this one out. It's also another movie that's on my list of 'Worst Movies of All Time.'</fullReview>
