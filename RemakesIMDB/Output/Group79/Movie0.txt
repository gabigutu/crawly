		<shortDescription>Discovering Silent Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It struck me last night that I've never seen a serious silent film. Everyone's seen a silent comedy: Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the Keystone Cops... They've all been immortalized in the minds of every film viewer, and I enjoy them as much as anyone. But it seems a strange and almost disrespectful lack to never have seen anything but comedy; so many silent films were created, and the only ones I've seen starred waddling tramps.It was partially for that reason that I rented this movie. I had read about it on a film review site (the name of which escapes my memory) and decided it was worth the half-hour drive to the video store. The basic premise is that of a man relating a story that happened to him and his friends - their unnerving discovery of a crazed mountebank, Dr. Caligari, and his prophetic sleepwalker. It follows a series of murders and growing madness, keeping you in constant suspense and confusion until the very last scene.There's a period of adjustment when watching it - unfortunately necessary for a modern audience. The titles seem too slow. The camera seems to hold on scenes too long. The makeup on the actors' faces seem ghostly and horrible - even on the hero.But before long, the movie has you in its grip. You spend time staring at the architecture - buildings, doors, and windows that would have been funny in a Dr. Seuss book. In the film, they make you uneasy. The whole atmosphere is of a world gone wrong; like a dream worthy of Salvador Dalí. Nothing is square or straight. The buildings loom in on you; windows sweep upward, slanted or curved; doors are obscenely angled holes beckoning you to enter and be trapped inside.Throughout, the story defies expectations. Small plot twists confuse and mislead you until the final surprise, completely tearing down everything you thought the movie was about. Strange shadows and shots from inside alleys paint the film's world as something terrible, never allowing you a normal look at the village, never allowing you to enjoy the quaintness of it. Through it all, the grinning, hunched figure of Dr. Caligari hangs in your mind, pushing out rational thought.The movie is well worth your time; there's a certain pleasure in trying to capture the feeling of terror an early audience, unaccustomed to the visual effects we see every day, would have had the first time they saw this movie. It's an intellectual terror in the grand old style, giving you the same thrill you get from reading Frankenstein or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. At the risk of sounding cliché: two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of German Expressionism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made in 1919, "The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari" was literally years ahead of its time and remains a triumphant accomplishment in the genre of German Expressionism. Remembered mainly for its stunning sets, which featured crooked buildings and twisted landscapes, "Cabinet" also boasts one of the first attempts at a twist ending, something quite new and shocking for its time.Told mainly from the point of view of Francis, a young man who lives in the small village of Holstenwall, Germany, "Cabinet" tells the tale of murder and madness which seems to accompany the arrival of a carnival. Francis and his best friend Alan go to the carnival and are presented with the sideshow attraction Cesare the Somnambulist, a gaunt and hideous young man who spends his life sleeping in a coffin-like cabinet and seems able to predict the future when awake. Cesare (played by a young Conrad Veidt, who later went on to play the evil Nazi general in Casablanca) informs Alan that he will soon die, and indeed, Alan is found murdered the next morning. Suspicion turns to the eerie somnambulist and his strange keeper, a man called Caligari. As Francis desperately tries to solve the mystery and find his friends killer, it seems that the beautiful young Jane, beloved by both Alan and Francis, has been targeted as the next victim.This is a genuinely creepy film which delves deep into the mysteries of the abnormal mind...an uncomfortable journey to say the least. Everyone is suspect and, in the end, we must ask ourselves: "who is really the mad one here?" Subtle and ingenious, we see the world the way an insane person might see it; warped and confused, a nightmarish terrain where nothing makes sense and balance is not to be found. The impact of this film is still being felt and seen today, and for good reason. It is a shocking, disturbing masterpiece. I cannot recommend it highly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art = Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Caligari presents the viewer with a frightening vision of the world through the lens of German Expressionism.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It's truly fascinating. And, it really (really) is an art film, since it purposefully and strikingly exhibits the new art of the German inter-war milieu. So, be prepared for an other-worldly excursion into the "total work of art," or Gesamtkunstwerk, of this monumental and influential film.This film is best seen at night, alone, and with the modern soundtrack which is available on the fully restored version. If the DVD you're watching does not have (a) choice of two soundtracks (traditional music and much-scarier modern track), (b) tinted inter-titles set in a surrealistic (actually expressionistic) font, and (3) is fairly high quality, then send it back and get the restored version. The quality and completeness of silent films are a major factor in experiencing the art form as it was meant to be experienced. The modern sound track in Dr. Caligari makes the film much more accessible for modern audiences (the eerie effects in the modern track heighten the feel of the film for the modern viewer) - try both tracks, you'll see.It's surprising how frightening and impactful this film can be. You will have dreams about it, I promise. These between-the-wars German films are riddled with creepy foreshadowing for us in the present, who know what was about to happen in Germany.Anyway, I think the film is best viewed with NO NOTICE. You don't really want to know the plot (the meaning of the end of the film can be interpreted in radically different ways - keep that in mind when it happens). Only one note - artistically the German Expressionist movement is worth reading about after you see the film - you'll notice the theme of "death and the maiden" woven into this artwork. Also, this film is the direct ancestor of films like "Nightmare Before Christmas" and a lot more - you'll recognize the Expressionist look in many presentations in television and film.WARNING - I would NOT show this film to children. It's very subtly and psychologically undermining - you'll be thinking and freaking about this thing for months to come - such a thing shouldn't be experienced by children - it's an adult, art film (no, not that kind) made for adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caligari: A creepy, distorted gem of the silent era...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many of the films from the silent era, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari gets overlooked (if you can even find it!) for big budget duds, and runny romantic comedies. Directors of the period like Griffith, Lang, Eisenstien, and Caligari's Wiene, are never given the credit they deserve. And if credit is given, it is in small cultish circles in various pockets around the world.The set design here is amazing, not a single right angle can be found in any one of the sets. This may not only apply to the disjointed and distorted characters in the film, but also the state of Germany at the time. After all, the film was made in the dark ages in Germany between WWI and WWII. This point is validated by Siegfried Kracauer, with his notion of how the main character of Dr. Caligari can be easily interpreted to Hitler, and vice versa. Both controlled subjects with a form of "brainwashing", both were upset with current forms of society and government, and both were masters of deception. In a period where Germans were looking for direction, and let's face it, authority as well, Dr. Caligari embodied it fully.In the area of the players, all the names in the film turn out a literally "speechless" performance. Dagover, Krauß, and especially Veidt as Cesare (pronounced Chez-a-ray) are excellent in the use of gestures and motion to get their point across without using words. The camera, stationary as in most early features, uses the mise-en-scene effectively, letting us identify with characters such as Francis and Jane, and disjointing us from Caligari, and the Criminal.The use of lines and stripes, not only in the sets but in small places like in the good doctor's hair and on his gloves, adds to the telling of the character. Colour tints of the B&amp;W film also play a special part in bringing the whole film together. An amazing sequence where Caligari reveals his true madness, pits Caligari stumbling through the unequal streets of Germany while being haunted by textual ramblings written in the air. A marvelous achievement for it's time. And it adds so much.The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari has changed the way I look at horror films, and even films in general. I urge anyone reading this to pick up this film. The DVD offering is utterly fantastic with the restored print, an audio essay of the film, and production notes. Bypass the overblown "motion picture events of the year", and pick up Caligari, quite possible the greatest motion picture event in the history of motion pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of German Expressionism !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture is a masterpiece ! How could someone think in something like this at that time ? The film has really good casting ! Werner Krauss is excellent playing Doctor Caligari and Conrad Veidt (Cesare) too !This movie has an obscure and bizarre mood makes the film looks really scary sometimes ... The painted scenario gave the film the touch that it needed ! It puts you in a nightmarish world , gives you the sensation of claustrofobia , depression and madness ! The objects have a strange shape and an irregular geometry that collaborate for the maintenance of the dark mood !But the most important thing in this motion picture is the open ended story ! You´re never sure about the end ! It has so many ways of interpretation... It´s useless to try to define "one end" to this movie. You´ll be always asking yourself about the legitimacy of the man´s vision of the story.It´s not scary , just sometimes , as I said. But it´s dark and it uses the shadows and lights effects so well that I was amazed the first time I saw and I still amazed ! German Films of that time were really good !Congratulations to Robert Wienne and his cast ! It´s a masterpiece of madness and paranoia!Rating : *****/******</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expressionism At Its Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original message of this film is fairly pedestrian (an outcry against the weak authority in Germany at the time), although the political intrigue surrounding the production led to a fascinating framing story which re-established "the authorities," and in turn made the UFA happy enough to distribute the film. This suggests that in its own time the political message of the film was fairly powerful, but compared to the work done in such films as The Golem, Nosferatu, and Metropolis it is not so far-reaching.What sets this film apart from its contemporaries is its absolute commitment to the expressionist movement. Mutated sets, heavy dark/light makeup, light and shadow, and a Gothic storyline are classic expressionism. The photography is beautiful and so crisp that it creates an eerie sense that this hellish scene is actually the real world, and that our everyday lives are the delusional Technicolor dream of a madman.While there are many better movies made in this period, I feel that this one is the pinnacle of the imagery that is characteristic of the expressionist art form. It is an absolute must-see for anyone who is interested in the Expressionist movement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film on the same day that I saw Trainspotting, and those two films made me realise what cinema can really do. This is a film that tells it EXACTLY as the film makers see it. The warped visuals say more about its subjects than words ever could. The travelling fair is as twisted and ugly as all travelling fairs seem to be, and the expressionist sets and lighting sum up perfectly the sense of urban alienation in a very unnerving way. It's story is simple enough to be accessible, but don't expect a straightforward film - just let it speak to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>messiah of the terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most important film in horror. Moody and shocking this chiller is the height of German Expressionist cinema and the prototype for whole genres in horror. Using violent contrasts of light and shadow, surreal settings and distorted camera angles to represent madness, chaos and psychosis, its influence is still seen even today in the likes of John Carpenter and the emerging actor and director Stephen Armourae, who has been also influenced by the film in his artwork and as the composer Stephen Armourae-Perry. Its twists towards the end put everyone from Hitchcock to the maker of 'The Village' into pale imitation. This film is now neglected by the public as it is a silent film. It really needs to be seen and appreciated more. Robert Wiene the director clearly inspired by the First World War transferred that shock and terror onto the screen with all its starkness. Hos purpose was to present moral ambiguity of the plot and action as a commentary on the paranoia, imbalance and uncertainty of post was Germany. And another parallel: not only has it influenced Stephen Armourae, he too is a hypnotist and recurring themes in his writings and plays are the moral ambiguities of insanity and culture, and German society of the twentieth century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Francis (Friedrich Feher) and an old man are sitting and Francis begins to tell him a story, hoping to top the one the man just told him. The story is about a fair that came to his hometown of Hostenwall and a man, Dr. Caligari who was one of the vendors. Caligari's submission to the fair is his somnambulist, Cesare (Conrad Veidt) who has been asleep for 25 years and, under Dr. Caligari's willing, is about to awaken. He does and Dr. Caligari tells the crowd to ask him a question, for he knows the future. Francis is there with his friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski), and Alan walks up and asks Cesare how long he'll live, to which Cesare replies that he'll be dead by dawn.Alan and Francis both long for the same woman, Jane (Lil Dagover) and after they all three go home, we see, inside Alan's house, the shadows of he and his killer fighting on his bedroom wall. Francis goes to tell the police after he realizes the somnambulist's prophecy has come true. Back at Dr. Caligari's place, we see him feeding gruel to Cesare as he lay in a coffin. Another attempted murder takes place but turns out to be the work of a common crook not involved with Cesare and Dr. Caligari. More happens that's not really important. Francis goes to an insane asylum to see if the fled Dr. Caligari is a patient there but the worker he speaks with tells him he must go see the head of the institute for patient information, as he's not allowed to divulge that sort of thing. So Francis goes to the head's office (a skeleton stands upright in the corner) and it turns out to be Dr. Caligari himself.Francis gets the police over there and after looking through his books, they discover a historical book about the mythical Caligari, who did just what Dr. Caligari is doing now, back in 1093. When Dr. Caligaru arrives he goes insane, saying he must become Caligari and doctors in the institute put him in a straight jacket. Then the telling of the story is done. The film adds a framing device, though, in the present with Francis and the man he's told the story to. The two go back to the institute, Cesare is in the corner and Francis warns the old man not to accept one of his prophesies, for he should surely die. Jane is there also, and when Francis asks her to marry him, she says she cannot marry someone not of royal blood (huh?). Then down the stairs comes Dr. Caligari, whom Francis quickly gets in a scuffle with. He's grabbed by the doctors and taken upstairs. Dr. Caligari comes to the conclusion that Francis is manic and that his mania is caused by his delusion that Dr. Caligari is in fact the mythic Caligari who would wander from town to town with Cesare killing townsfolk. The last scene is of Dr. Caligari saying he has a sure-fire cure for Francis' mania.So was Francis the real Caligari? Did Francis kill Alan in the hopes of getting Jane to marry him? (After all, we never do see his killer.) With this appended narrative twist, the entire story comes into question. I have a feeling a lot of people would hate this but I found it very interesting, maybe even historic.The film is very dreamlike. All silent films are sort of spooky, but this one is more otherworldly. Everything is distorted and the camera, with that strange blackening, gives it an unstable touch like our most vivid dreams have. It's like something's been placed over the lens in order to highlight certain characters or visuals and cover up something else. I'm assuming the film used on-set camera tricks.The expressionist sets consist of slanted walls, crooked doors, weirdly misshapen glasses, paint splashed on stairs that bend. A background that is clearly a wall with painting. Trees that look like wires. The characters' faces are all pale white and the blacks are all stark. Cesare, specifically, looks like a cross between Frankenstein's Monster and Edward Scissorhands. The houses don't look like houses, they look like pieces of wood painted to look like a stage set.I can see influence from this film in the set designs of Tim Burton especially, and the narrative twist at the end must have influenced David Lynch in "Mulholland Drive."The print I saw was from 1992 and for a movie that's 83 years old, I was very impressed. There was very little grain and the lighting was fine. The only complaint I had was that some of the handwriting from Dr. Caligari's writings was a bit difficult to read and that has nothing to do with the print. The music is all organ that comes booming in whenever something evil -- usually Dr. Caligari -- is onscreen. It's hard to judge movies like these, but the visuals are wonderful, the music is spooky, the acting suitable and the pacing fine (it's a little over an hour). I would say this is an essential film, and unlike many "groundbreaking" classics, it's like nothing else you've seen.***1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through the distorting lens of the humankind's feeble grip on sanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having only started discovering silent movies recently, I don't have more than a handful of other non-talkies to compare it to. This however was not only one of the best, most compelling and unique silents I have seen, but also a great flick overall. It's all been said before, I'm sure, but I'll say it again: this is a milestone of German Expressionist cinema. It is also a class-A mind-phuck movie (excuse my French), one of those stories that'll leave you eternally scratching your head trying to figure out what you've seen, what to believe and what can be a plausible explanation for most of the creepy mysteries you've just witnessed. Right from the very opening scene, seemingly suspended in an otherworldly dimension, maybe somewhere in between life and death, in which the first line spoken is: "There are spirits everywhere", you realise you are in for a spooky ride (this is the ultimate Halloween movie, come to think of it!) Having studied theatre set and costume design at Rome's art school for a year before going to university, I was obviously completely fascinated by the set design choices here. Buildings and furniture, props and painted backdrops are elongated and deformed into blocky, savage, expressionistic, perspective-defying and proportion-less forms. Even the intertitles weren't of the traditional sort. The result is obviously one of unsettling the viewer further into believing themselves suspended in a reality where anything could happen - anything horrible or nightmarish, obviously. Nothing is as it seems, right to the very end. Btw, on a more frivolous note, I thought the character of Cesare the Somnambulist looked uncannily like something that might have influenced Tim Burton into creating Edward Scissorhands, or maybe even more, the look of some of the characters in Rocky Horror Picture Show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually stunning work of early psychological horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' may not be the kind of film that would shock today's audience, but its fascinating and horrific use of surrealistic atmosphere clearly had an influence on modern filmmakers such as David Cronenberg and David Lynch. While the story is not as involving as other German masterworks of the era, such as "Metropolis," it can be appreciated for its unique vision.The thing that really strikes me about this film is the way the set design reflects the unstable mind of the narrator. The exterior scenes often include painted backgrounds featuring houses with sloped roofs and jutting edges, along with mountains that seem to twist and curl upwards into the sky. Although these backgrounds are not three-dimensionally realistic, they convincingly depict the gothic, surrealistic atmosphere with imagination and verve. The interior scenes have a claustrophobic feeling that generates from the walls, which are often at odd angles and slanting inward as they rise. Much of the design appears to be influenced by cubism; even the sinister Dr. Caligari looks square-shaped. The lighting also reflects the chilling mood, with shadows haunting the nooks and crannies in the background.The characters in the film sometimes seem equally freakish. All the actors wear makeup that make them appear as pale as a ghost, and the men are decked out in dark suits and capes. Ominous figures approach the camera directly in two haunting sequences early on: in the opening scene, when we see Jane walking towards us in a ghost-like white gown, and in the initial carnival scene, when Ceasre steps out of his box. In the end, we learn that it is really Francis who was insane the whole time; thus, the sets during the story, which is told by Francis himself, reflect his disoriented mind. Not surprisingly, the bookend scenes where he tries to tell his tale to an old man in a garden are the only ones to involve natural surroundings, such as trees and grass.For a one-hour horror film, "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" requires a lot of concentration on the viewer's part, especially since the story sometimes seems fragmented. Nonetheless, it will no doubt prove fascinating for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Authoritarian Expressionism, a history of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original screenplay did not contain the frame that many use in their analysis of the film. As it was intended by the authors,it presents a story in which "Caligari represents the insanity of unlimited power, and his medium is the common man, which the authoritarian state trains to do its killing." The story was written by Hans Janowitz, a Czech, and Carl Mayer, and Austrian. They combined events of their lives to come up with a fantastic tale. Janowitz supposedly saw a pretty girl he wished to speak to but she was being followed by another man. He gave her up as lost but the following day he learned that the girl, whose name was Gertrude, had been murdered the night before. He recalled the suspicious man, who was also at her funeral, but he had no evidence against him and so said nothing. Meyer, whose father committed suicide, had to undergo many psychiatric examinations and grew to hate psychiatrists. They determined to write a script together combining these two things, but had no plot for it until they visited a fair together. There they saw an exhibit entitled "Man or Machine" in which a man performed amazing feats and uttered prophecies while under hypnosis?they had their story. It combined all three experiences into a horrific thriller. The story, however, was not to be produced as they intended. According to Otto Friedrich, the "authors of Caligari intended it not just as a horror movie but as a kind of revolutionary allegory." As such, the powers that be were bound to find it unacceptable. Producer Erich Pommer bought the script and added and opening and closing scene. In the opening scene Francis is sitting on a bench in some kind of park with another man. They watch Jane walk by, seemingly in a trance. Francis then begins to tell his story. After he is finished explaining everything that happened the audience soon sees Francis in the lobby of the asylum with many other people, including Jane. Francis begs Jane to finally marry him but she responds, "We queens are not permitted to follow the dictates of our hearts." As the much friendlier looking director/Dr. Caligari comes down the stairs, Francis begins screaming that he is Caligari. Francis is put into a straight jacket and put in a cell. The director/Dr. Caligari puts his glasses back on and once again looks fairly creepy. He then says, "At last I understand mania. He thinks I am that mystic Caligari?and now I also know how to cure him." Instead of a story about the triumph over authority, it is simply the babble of a madman. Simply appreciating the story and the meaning behind it is not enough. Instead of being played in an ordinary world, the entire set is expressionistic. Buildings are painted at angles. Doors and windows are crooked or rounded. Nothing meets at right angles. It appears as a world not entirely in the realm of fantasy nor is it completely on earth. Despite the story and the scenery being fantastic, everything is a reflection of the real world?including the fact that Cesare and Francis both lose in the end. The authorities win?in reality and in the film. Even the props lend themselves to this overblown idea of authority. The town clerk's desk and stool are set very high. In order to get to the police, the characters have to walk up stairs, and even still, their furniture is higher than normal?in case there was a question as to who was in charge. The shadows and lightening also reflect the film's expressionism. The backdrop was painted with extensive shadows to further the eerie quality. In addition, the entire screen is rarely completely illuminated. The audience's attention is focused on the important by using what would be a spotlight in a play. Sometimes only a person's face or the spinning top of a carousel can be seen at all, sometimes they are brightest while the rest of the screen is darker, and sometimes the entire scene is in full view. This gives it a very story-like feel and does much to enhance the movie. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a classical example of expressionism. Ironically, it is an expressionism tempered by authority. Regardless of what the audience of today thinks of the once incredibly popular movie, few would walk away from it feeling as though they had wasted their time. Original audiences may not have realized that it was, indeed, the story of triumph over authority, but those of today are better able to see this.</fullReview>

Its quite graphic in some areas too, this also came as a huge surprise to me.I can't even explain the feeling you get watching this, its like the deep dark secret of Alfred Hitchcock, John Carpenter and Tim Burton all rolled into one. As directors they've all made history in their own right, but this movie just reminds me of them in some way, its tough to explain.My version featured colorization of certain scenes, but it was done with a semi transparent color tint frame I am not sure the original featured this...Reguardless, if you have some patience and are in the mood for something a little different, try this.

		<shortDescription>The Grim Sleeper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1920 film gets extra points for originality. A young man, Francis, tells a stranger an odd tale of a carnival man, Dr. Caligari, who comes to town to show the locals his "somnambulist", Cesare. Cesare has been asleep for twenty-five years and only comes awake on the command of Dr. Caligari. Cesare sleeps in a cabinet resembling a casket. During the show, Cesare answers questions from the audience and predicts the future. When Francis' best friend, Alan, asks jokingly how long he, Alan, will live, Cesare answers, "The time is short. You die tomorrow." Big joke. Alan is stabbed dead during the night, just one of several mysterious murders that have taken place since Caligari and his infernal cabinet waltzed into town.I don't know how much I want to get into the plot itself. The ending isn't really predictable, so let's just say Francis manages to convince the police that Caligari and his somnambulist are responsible for the murders and there is a chase.However, the first thing one notices about the film is not the character, all of whom overact according to the standards of silent movies -- and Cecil B. DeMille's sound movies.After Francis launches into his tale, what one notices are the sets. This is one cockeyed world that he and his friends inhabit. It's a cartoon world. These are all indoor sets that seem built of plywood. The backdrop is a complicated suggestion of a mountain with a village on its slopes, but it's sloppily drawn, like the rest of the decorations, as if by a child with a set of finger paints. The carousel at the fair spins at 45 degrees from plumb. What passes for streets, buildings, roofs, chimneys, and interiors are all drunkenly askew, leaning this way and that, each on its own trip and totally indifferent to the leanings of others. One might say there isn't a right angle in the joint. I've never seen anything like it.The characters, their dress and grooming, fit right into this insane landscape. When we are first introduced to Cesare, when Caligari opens the door of the upright casket, we're treated to a close up of Conrad Veidt's face with its black eye shadow and the thin glossy smear of what looks like paste across his thin lips. And when he opens his eyes, it's pretty spooky -- the equal of Karloff's monster when he first appears and slowly shuffles around toward the camera. Caligari himself is adorned with an unruly aura of white hair and thick, goggle-like eyeglasses. He wears white gloves with three thin black strips on the back, just like Mickey Mouse.It might be possible to argue that this is expressionism for expressionism's sake -- but that's not the case. The framing story takes place in sets that more closely resemble the world that you and I are familiar with. The Boschian garden of earthly delights in which most of the story takes place is as crazy as it is for a good reason, which I can't explain here.There's no other film quite like it. Expressionism been pretty influential over the years, but the dark shadows and crooked streets of most later films are only dry, dead leaf echoes of this original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been a fan of Edward Scissorhands, but after watching this film, I realized where Tim Burton may have gotten the idea for his film. One of the great displays of German Expressionism, I especially felt the score (though added years later) was quite moody, bringing out all of the emotions one should experience in a film like this. The sets were so unusual, so strange, that the film felt more like a stage production coming to life on the screen. A milestone in film, and one which should be continued to examined even after all of these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite The Myth Of It Being " The First Horror " It Remains A Good FIlm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>German Expressionism in its most basic simplified term is " Expressing in visual form what the artist is feeling and thinking " It started in Germany at the start of the 20th Century and by 1920 found itself in cinema . THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI is one of the first German Expressionism films and remains one of the best , a fact reflected in the way it keeps slipping in and out of this site's top 250 movies The story itself is fairly simple to modern audiences but is far more complex than many movies from the period where directors still saw themselves as magicians rather than storytellers . It's not often that a film from these days has the type of ending seen here . What is typical for Expresionism is the set design which is bizarre and discordant . A fair come to town and a carousal spins in the background at a near impossible angle while the buildings are of a shape and jagged architecture that don't exist in any town you've seen in real lifeOne good thing about silent cinema ( The only good thing according to some critics ) is how easy it is to sell an non English film abroad . All that has to be done is swap the captions to a native language for the country showing it and then you've got something universal . Unconciously though CALIGARI remains an example of the German mentality of the time . Jewish film critic Siegfried Kracaucer brought forward the theory that Francis considers Dr Caligari to be a danger because he is an outsider and you can understand Kracaucer's line of thoughtUnfortunately one myth that has grown out of THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI is that it was the " first horror film " when in fact it's not . There is some dispute as to what was . Certainly I have seen a contender with the 1910 version of FRANKENSTEIN directed by J. Searle Dawley . It might have very metaphysical aspects to it but probably still qualifies as being under the horror genre</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Landmark of World Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War One sent a shockwave through the arts and one of the results was expressionism. The term is difficult to define; in a general sense, however, it refers to a type of art that makes a statement about internal emotion and psychology. Often linked to surrealism and cubism, in the 1920s expressionism became one of the dominate styles in visual and performing arts and was particularly associated with Germany.The 1919 THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI is perhaps the only film made in a purely expressionist style. As directed by Robert Wiene and designed by Herman Warm, Walter Reimann, and Walter Rohrig, everything about the film is exaggerated, off-center, and disorienting. The sets are strange, deliberately artificial constructions of flat surfaces in odd angles and broad strokes of paint; the make-up and costumes are equally exaggerated. The result is a unique look that has the paranoid essence of nightmare, and the story links with the visuals to remarkable effect.A carnival has come to a small German town, and among its attractions is Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) and "sonambulist" Cesare (Conrad Veidt). When awakened from his sleep, Cesarea makes predictions of the future--predictions of death! And through his power over the sleepwalker, Caligari ensures that the predictions come true. It is frequently described as the first true horror film. But while the story was shocking by 1919 standards, it was really the visual style of the film that outraged critics and the public alike; many described it as "degenerate," and it proved extremely controversial where ever shown.It also proved incredibly influential--so much so that it is virtually impossible for any one serious about film as art to avoid it. But there are quite a few releases that you should avoid: the film is in public domain, and the result has been a series of DVD and VHS "budget" releases that are dire to the nth degree. It is a matter of getting what you pay for, and while the KINO release is the most expensive print available, it is also the only one worth having. The picture quality is as good as it can be short of digital restoration and the film has been restored to its original tints as well.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the way movies should have always been done, right from the start until now.I first saw this film 1 year ago. I bought it on DVD based on recommendations of a respected A/V magazine, since they said it represented "the best transfer to DVD from a B/W movie we have ever seen". So I expected to calibrate my tv set with it, and to stash it with the other DVDs I never watch.But from the beginning, I was hooked. Why was everything so normal, then imagery became so... astounding? The first minutes of the film were crucial, since I really began to see that these movie was trying so hard to convey a meaning far beyond that of being an expressionist film. So I followed, and followed. And marveled at the weird angles, incredible set design, and at the story that was unfurling on screen. A feeling of nervousness began by the second half of the movie, since (I think) the sets had worked their magic on my imagination, and I was sucked deep into the movie. And when I thought the movie was over.... there was an ending any modern movie would love to achieve. Terrific!Watching the running commentary only made things even better, since every detail and nuisance was explained, tracing paralels with Germany of the 1920's, and exploring the motivation and inner workings of every character. What a movie!Highly recommended for late night viewing. Not a movie for watching with friends, though. This movie is like the finest of the fine wines: sip it alone, at your own pace, and you will find it well worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

It's Expressionistic cinematography is wonderful and suspenseful; it's no wonder that this film has influenced many subsequent directors and producers many years later.However, whilst it surely wouldn't have seemed like this back in 1920, it is rather boring through contemporary eyes. I'm sorry if this makes me sound ignorant, but today it plays rather slow-paced and un-scary, even compared to some of the other greats of Weimar cinema (such as "Nosferatu").Not a bad film by any means (I would recommend it), but "Caligari" seems more something of historical value and academic study to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will spoil everything in this review, so if you haven't seen the film and wouldn't like to know something rather essential about the plot, please don't read further. I'm writing this in case, ironically, you haven't read so far and have ignored the spoiler tag.The new restoration of this film, seen through by the great people at Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Stiftung, will be shown at next year's Berlinale in February, and we know that the Masters of Cinema series will release it on Blu-ray. eventually Should a treat, since this film deserves such meticulous attention, and more. I'm not in the business to say which film does something first, and it hardly matters in my books. But "Caligari" most certainly is masterful in what it does, and in some ways it's still so modern and so revolutionary it's quite impossible not to be enthralled by it. I am talking about the infamous "twist ending", sure. But in an age where every story seems to implement a twist or two every five minutes, this term has lost its power to me to fully describe to full effect of what was done in this film. So, the film is framed as a story narrated by Francis, himself a central character in the story being told. The shock twist, of course, reveals to us that Francis, Jane and Cesare are actually mentally unstable and locked in an asylum. In other words, what we have seen is actually a fantasy and we realize that the narrator cannot be trusted.This is very brilliant, and one of the most powerful and successful explorations of the notion of the unreliable narrator in the twentieth century. But the film goes further. What I speak of now is the use of architecture. The most beautiful visual clue in the narrative is actually planted in what we see, in the wildly imaginative sets and production art. This is one example where its reputation as a German Expressionist film actually stands in the way of us being able to enjoy it for what it is ?&nbsp;at least it did for me ?&nbsp;since it's easy to write off the set design just as "German Expressionist". But the reason why the film world looks the way it does is because this is a fantasy, this is a world created by Francis, who sees the world differently from us, hence he's labelled insane. But the most shocking revelation that the end brings is that what we've witnessed is not only a tale of a madman, it's actually what we've seen that has been, in reality, a film seen through a madman's lens. And indeed, doesn't the whole world seem to be about to fall apart, the houses crumbling onto themselves? And isn't that the point?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is where the good stuff begins...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The influence of this film simply cannot be over-stated. It is not only a picture that exemplifies German Expressionist cinema but it also arguably invented the horror film too. Sure, there were movies with horror elements before Caligari, but this is surely the one that formulated it into a full-length feature. Not only that but this is also where the art film began too. Films would simply never be the same again after The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.Of course the first thing that is immediately obvious is the bizarre visual aesthetic and bold set design. Everything is at uncomfortable angles. Trees and grass look like blades. Doors and windows are never symmetrical. Buildings are shaped in impossible angular styles. Everything is awash with extreme lighting, while the sets are painted with abstract and expressionistic designs. The crazed look of the film is of course meant to represent the insanity of the central character's mind. This must surely be the first time that cinema had tried to visually represent the subjective inner workings of a psychologically damaged mind. It also was pioneering in that the framing story where we meet the troubled protagonist also allowed for a flashback narrative and twist ending ? both revolutionary ideas at the time.Needless to say that the film features extreme melodramatic acting that was prevalent at the time in the silent era. However, despite all this, Conrad Veidt is terrific as Casare the somnambulist. This is a character that remains very compelling to this day. His combination of darkness with a ballet dancer's graceful movements is one that will never get old. Cesare remains iconic and always will be. Which is something which can be said for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari in general. This ancient film remains mysterious, evocative and bold. It's one of the most important films ever made and its dream-like ambiance is something that should be seen by anyone at all interested in the formation of cinema as an art form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any fan of horror or German expressionism needs to see this 1920 classic. Considered by many to be the first true horror movie, this is a story that doesn't need sound to get under your skin. Francis (Friedrich Feher) tells the story of Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss), who hosts a sideshow exhibit at a local carnival featuring Cesare (Conrad Veidt), a somnambulist who has been asleep for 23 years. Dr. Caligari is able to awaken Cesare through hypnotic suggestion for the entertainment of the onlookers. It seems that Dr. Caligari might have other uses for Cesare as well. Shortly after their arrival, town-folk start turning up dead. It isn't long before suspicion falls upon the tragic Cesare. But things are not entirely as they seem. Francis may not be the hero we are led to believe he is. Any review of this movie would be remiss without mentioning the set design. With nary a right angle in sight, the sets are as much a part of the story as the actors. The strange design certainly contributes to the madness the film means to convey and sets the mood for a truly creepy story. Don't pass this one up just because it is a very old and very silent film. It is a memorable story that is well acted and masterfully executed by director, Robert Wiene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still makes for an interesting watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I write this, 83 years have passed since they shooting of The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari. Since then sound, and later color, has made it's entrance into the world of film, and most of the films from this era has long since slipped into obscurity.Not this one tough. Through the years it has gained a somewhat legendary reputation, somewhat thanks to Bauhaus and other arty bands and their heavy use of imagery from this movie to design single-sleeves, T-shirts etc. But of course the main reason that this and a handful of other early expressionist works from Germany continues to hold a tight grip over cineasts worldwide is that it's distinct style makes for a fascinating watch.Here the expressionist style is taken to extremes, and most of this early horror movie plays against a background of twisted and tortured buildings and labyrinthlike streets. Forget everything you've ever learn about perspective and realism: more than anything else, this quiet little town is a portrait of the human soul in an extreme condition. It is unsettling but also eerily beautiful.The story of the reappearance of the infamous Dr. Caligari (a medieval monk, hypnotizing his victims thus forcing them to carry out his will) in a nice and quiet sleepy german town is carried through well, and his somnambulist (and perhaps Dr. Caligari's tool of murder?) Cesare can be quite frightening. There is also a nice twist to the storyline right at the very end that gives new dimensions both to the plot and the movie in general. However, the main catch with this movie must be considered to be it's twisted imagery and innovative style.That is what have kept us coming now, for over 80 years.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Atmosphere of Lunatics and Tilted Walls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Francis (Friedrich Feher) sits on a garden bench with an older and skeptical man, a woman named Jane (Lil Dagover), wearing outlandish make-up, sleepwalks in a nightgown as she passes them. Francis explains that she is his fiancée and that they have suffered a great ordeal. This bizarre opening begins a flashback of Francis' story, which covers much of the movie. Francis recalls that he and his friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski), who have a friendly rivalry for Jane's affections, had planned on visiting the local town fair at Holstenwall, Germany. The painted set of the town hall shows all the buildings cramped together at odd angles with narrow passages, weird window shapes, peculiar furniture, uneven stairs, and gray and black shadows covering the white walls. To us these distorted images convey the madness of twisted brains that belong to a different ethos. Now an ominous-looking man named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) seeks a permit from the town clerk to open a booth and present a somnambulist act at the fair (NOTE: somnambulism relates to sleepwalking, a disorder). Although the clerk harangues Dr. Caligari, he approves the permit. But the clerk is found stabbed to death in his bed late that night. Then, at the fair, Francis, Alan, and Jane enter Dr. Caligari's tent. Caligari summons awake the ashen somnambulist Cesare (Conrad Veidt) after he has supposedly been sleeping for 25 years (!) in a cabinet which looks like a casket. Prompted by Caligari to ask Cesare a question, Alan says, "How long do I have to live?" "Until dawn," responds Cesare, shocking Alan. Their fun over, the trio quickly depart. Just before the next day begins, Alan is seen through the shadows being murdered. Francis goes to the police with his suspicions that Dr. Caligari is behind the murders. At his wagon abode, Caligari tells the police that Cesare never leaves his cabinet without permission. The police soon pick up a common criminal who is about to knife an older woman. He is charged with the murders, even though he admits only to the attempted murder and not the previous two killings. As Francis and Jane continue to investigate Caligari, the doctor orders Cesare to kill Jane. Cesare creeps into Jane's bedroom and as he attempts to murder her, she screams and faints. Obviously attracted to Jane physically, Cesare carries her away and leads the aroused townsfolk on a lengthy chase across a crooked trail. Finally placing Jane down, Cesare falls from a height to his death. The townsfolk go to Caligari's wagon only to find the doctor gone and a dummy in Cesare's cabinet.Francis travels to a nearby insane asylum to inquire whether Caligari might be an escaped patient. An employee tells Francis that he must personally see the director of the institute as he is not allowed to discuss patients. At the director's office it turns out that the director and Dr. Caligari are one and the same. So Francis is certain that he was correct all along: Caligari must be doing the killings, and he just happens to be a lunatic asylum director. Francis summons the police, who head to the director's office, which is temporarily unoccupied. Rummaging through the director's books, Francis discovers that in eighteenth century northern Italy there was a huckster named Caligari who had a hypnotized somnambulist that he trained to commit murder. As he kept the book, the asylum director must have liked what he read. When the director returns to his office he is confronted with the dead Cesare and goes berserk. He states he must become the new Caligari. The staff in the institute put him in a strait-jacket and he is confined in his own asylum. Here the narrative ends, but the story is not over.SPOILERS: There is a major twist at the end. Francis, now through telling his tale in the garden, goes to the courtyard of the asylum with the old man. Shapes are now normal, and the tilted walls of the next sets are at right angles. Both men see that Cesare is alive and stands in a corner of the yard. Jane, thinking that she is a noble, rejects Francis by telling him that he does not have royal blood. Dr. Caligari comes down the stairs, and when Francis accuses the doctor of being the killer and scuffles with him, the orderlies restrain Francis in a strait-jacket. The doctor says that he has a cure for Francis. IT WAS FRANCIS WHO WAS DERANGED ALL ALONG; HE MADE UP THE TALE! And Jane, Cesare, and the old man are all lunatics in the insane asylum! That is why the buildings and landscapes are all distorted! Pretty heavy stuff for 1919/1920!This Gothic murder plot of a crazed doctor ordering a somnambulist to kill is more complicated. The ending (and story) is open for more than one interpretation. For instance, who really killed Alan? Could it have been jealous Francis? The movie does not tell us. And could the asylum stand for the corruption of the world? The film seems to serve as an example of what happened to the German animus after the shocking defeat in World War I and the subsequent breakup of the former German Empire. Furthermore, the humiliating Versailles Treaty of 1919 that was imposed by the Allies was appalling to Germans (only President Wilson of the USA tried to moderate). Those are incorrect who equate this artsy film with the rise of Nazism; it is too early in its base history. Another element is that the director and screenwriters had intended to employ an entirely different ending, but had to change their thought processes as they conflicted with those of the German authorities. "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is captivating ? one of the first horror films ? and is a significant breakthrough in style and in German expressionism. It continues to mesmerize.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Silent Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Caligari and his sleepwalking fortune teller Cesare (Conrad Veidt) come to the local fair. This event coincides with a series of brutal murders. What, if anything, is the connection? Widely (and falsely) considered to be the first true horror film ever made, we have to give it credit for all that it inspired. From films of its day all the way to Tim Burton's "Nightmare Before Christmas", the German expressionist art movement put to film creates a strong impression in the stark black and white.The sets are what really make this film. Rather than being shot outside (apparently due to lack of budget), everything was done in the studio, and the sets were painted. Even the shadows are painted and not actual shadows. What will strike the audience is how much the use of uneven angles was used -- windows, doors, walls and more are all slanted. If nothing else, this really aids in making the film memorable.While I cannot rate it as highly as most do (I found it to drag a bit at times and could have used about five minutes of edits despite only being 71 minutes long), it really is a must see for anyone interested in the history of horror or film. Or German expressionism, I suppose.The writers were influenced by the films of Paul Wegener ("Student of Prague" and "The Golem"), which led them to not only make a horror film, but an expressionist film. What level of the art is the writers' doing and which part the director, I cannot say. (On a side note, the producers wanted Fritz Lang to direct... it is anyone's guess how this would have affected the picture. Lang, of course, is a bigger name in early film than Robert Wiene, who made his directing debut here.) Allegedly, the beginning and end had to be added because of some sort of political influence and concerns about defying authority. Historian Siegfried Kracauer said of this, "A revolutionary film was thus turned into a conformist one." The stories I read differ on this and I don't know what to believe. The important thing to keep in mind, though, is how greatly the film varies with or without the bookends.The film is silent and not all copies are of the highest quality, so be aware of that going in. If you know this, it is definitely worth checking out. This is one of the first classics, and truly a necessary film for anyone who thinks of themselves as a horror fan.</fullReview>

Krauss tells the crowd that the mysterious Veidt "knows the past, and sees into the future." So, Mr. von Twardowski asks, "How long do I have to live?" Veidt tells the him he dies at dawn! - and, sure enough, a shadowy figure murders the man.Feher thinks the somnambulist is the serial killer threatening the village (a town clerk was the first victim). But, some think Feher knifed his friend, a rival for the affections of dark beauty Lil Dagover (as Jane), but why would Feher kill the clerk? When a completely new killer is caught red-handed, it seems like everybody wants to get into the act? "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is one of the most outstanding film productions of the silent era. The "Art Direction / Set Direction" - by Hermann Warm, Walter Röhrig, and Walter Reimann - so beautifully photographed and directed, should be counted among the best designed of any era.

		<fullReview>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is one of those films that, although almost 90 years old, has not lost any of the impact that early audiences must have felt. One of the earliest horror movies and one of the first in the movement known as German Expressionism, Robert Wiene presents a nightmarish world where nothing seems quite right and everything is just a little "off" from what is normally considered reality.The film opens with a telling of tales and the main part of the film is the telling of the tale of a sideshow in a traveling fair with a somnambulist attraction. However, strange murders start to happen around this somnambulist and Dr. Caligari, his handler. As the plot progresses, things are not as they seem leading up to an early twist ending that would seem to contradict the initial social message of the film.I like the surreal. I enjoy nightmares. And I suspect that is why I enjoy this movie so much. It is a slow paced nightmare, with an effective use of the contrast of light and dark, and a set in which the angles, corners and even the level surfaces are all wrong. The story is compelling, the acting competent and convincing and the soundtrack (at least on the version I watched) beautiful and fitting.For those who enjoy silent surreal films, this is one not to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In practically every book, essay or article about the history of cinema, "Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari" ("The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari") is definitely an obligatory stop, as its importance in the history of film-making is unquestionable. Born in the middle of the difficulties of post-WWI Germany, "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" was part of an artistic movement known as "German expressionism", where highly symbolic and surrealistic imagery was used to create a highly theatrical and experimental form of film-making. The challenge of low-budgets and the poverty of the studios ended up creating a visually arresting experience that became the trademark of films like "Der Golem", "Nosferatu", and specially, this now legendary movie.It all begins as a young man named Francis (Friedrich Feher) begins to tell what he claims to be, is the strange experience he has ever lived. It all starts when he and his best friend Alan (Hans Heinrich Von Twardowski) decide to go to the fair that has recently arrived to town. In the fair, they go to Dr. Caligari's (Werner Krauss) Sonambulist show, where the mysterious Doctor shows Cesare (Conrad Veidt), a man that has been asleep for years and has the ability to see the future. Excited, Alan asks the somnambulist how long he'll live, but Cesare answers that he won't see the next day. Terrified, Alan returns home, and soon the prophecy is fulfilled as he ends up as the next victim of the serial killer that has been haunting the town. As all clues point to Cesare, Francis decides to do his own investigation, but soon he'll discover what's the secret of the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. As probably the most representative of the "German Expressionism" movement, "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" presents us a shockingly different interpretation of the world with its irregularly distorted set design and the highly artistic use of light and shadows, creating for the first a time a movie that defies reality by becoming probably the closest one can be to watching a moving painting. While the credit for this brilliant display of creativity is almost never given to director Robert Wiene (due mostly to his irregular career), he makes an truly efficient job directing this movie, as if he was destined to do it.The brainchild of Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer, the nightmarish tale of Dr. Caligari is still one of the most inventive and influential story of mystery ever put on film. While the visuals are often the first thing that one notices in "Caligari", the screenplay is as influential (maybe even more) as the design, as the way the story is built (as a flashback), the thrilling climax and the even more surprising conclusion of the tale are now often imitated classics plot devices in suspense films. Francis' story of madness and horror revolves not only around the mystery of Caligari's actions, but also around the suspense of who will be the next victim of the unknown serial killer."The Cabinet" is really one of the best acted silent films ever made, with an effective cast that makes a considerably subtler performance than what was the norm in the highly theatrical days of silent movies. Friedrich Feher and Lil Dagover have the main roles, and really transmit the terror and the madness caused by Caligari and Cesare. However, the highlight of the film are of course Werner Krauss as Caligari himself, and the young Conrad Veidt as Cesare. Krauss delivers a terrific performance as the strange doctor, and Veidt shows the talent that would make him a star in the U.S. during the World War II. Overall an unforgettable cast in an unforgettable movie.As written above, the credit to this very influential film is often denied to Robert Wiene, whose apparently uneven career made him look "unlikely" to make this brilliant movie according to critics (when we compare his career to legendary directors like Lang or Murnau it's easy to make that statement), and many have been "suggested" to be the genius behind (From cinematographer Willy Hameister, to Fritz Lang) instead of Wiene. In fact, Wiene's bash has gone as far as it's often said that Wiene added the first and last scenes in order to please the government when in fact that addition was suggested by Lang himself.Probably nobody will ever know how exactly Robert Wiene achieved this marvelous movie, but what is know is that "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" went on to became the most important achievement of the "German Expressionism" movement and a movie that even now continues inspiring and influencing artists across the world. It's safe to say that the haunting nightmare of Cesare, will continue giving chills to many future generations, and few films can claim this achievement. 10/10. A brilliant masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's An Artistic Bizarre Experience That A Film Fan Should Watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deranged Doctor Caligari and faithful somnambulist (sleepwalker), Cesare, wreak havoc in a small mountain village in Germany. Murders occur and the investigation leads towards the somnambulist, but is everything what it seems?This is a film that is able to convey so much without ever hearing the actors speak. Yes, the film is a silent film, with the only sound coming from the piano played throughout the entire film, but that is what helps make the film so great. It makes the film more eerie and in the end, thought provoking. The story is told through a flashback from the main character Francis, the story itself is short and to the point. Yet this film manages to still be an influence today.With a distorted set design that blends well with the inter titles, one gets an uneasy feeling while viewing the film, something isn't right...you can't pin-point it till the conclusion of the film reveals what really is happening. The style of the film influences many works of art today, from multiple horror films to music videos, such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers "Otherside". The film has beautiful images that were created to distort the reality of the film, which makes it really stand out on it's own.Just when you think you've been able to solve everything, the final frame of the film makes you doubt your own answers. Creating debates for years and years as to what the audience had just seen. Caligari is one of the best German expressionist films, and is able to stand on it's own today. 86 years later and it still is able to shock and please the viewer. Caligari has stood the test of time is comes out on top.Known as the first "horror" film, it still manages to give the viewer the creeps. From the evil looking Caligara to the almost dead like somnambulist. Influencing film noir and horror, Caligari was years ahead of it's time. In the end, it's an art film. Everything about it is beautiful. The picture quality only enhances the viewer's experience in enjoying the film. I recommend Caligari to any film fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>important for the movement of expressionism and, more importantly, in the realm of fantasy and horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh what a tangled web the world of the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is. It may all be sane in the focus of a madman, or it may just all take place in a crazy world. We see this story in the context of a guy telling a story to his friend or someone on a bench- following the sight of a 'spirit', perhaps, drifting by, a woman in a white dress who is in a complete daze. The story is that of what we would assume is Dr. Caligari, who in a town that could easily be called a geometrical nightmare (all those shapes and curves!), goes to a fair with his own exhibit: a Somnambulist, a person who has been asleep for quite a long time and is just about to be awoken. The question he's asked is right to the point, and the response is too: "When will I die" "Tomorrow at dawn." This is not just a cryptic message, we see, as people start to be killed by a mysterious murderer, brought on (or just directly because of) the doctor and his Somnambulust.This is basically the story, and it's a very good one, even a great one in its dimensions of a mad scientist and his quarry. And of course when we suddenly get that great big twist (or is it a twist?) at the end, it gives the rest of the film a whole other perspective to read into. But what you go to see the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is not for the story, per-say, but for its unique perspective as a work of cinema. Despite the imitations, and despite (or in spite) or those who would dare to be inspired by the work (Tim Burton springs to mind without a flinch), it stands tall as a mammoth work - surprising since it's only 70 minutes long - by creating its own view of humanity and the world, of the way a civilization and houses and roads and places can or should or would ever look, and giving its own characters a mood of dread and the Gothic. If you ever need to drag someone to show them how to get "fantastical" with a set, this is it.Robert Wiene, along with being a competent storyteller, is just a superb director of his actors in these sets. While it would be a little much for me to go on and on about how glorious the staging is within these seemingly un-navigable roads, and how the walls sometimes seem to be closing in or giving an extra edge that you only get in a nightmare, its important to note how well the actors come off here. It's because of them, as much as Wiene and his crew (Willy Hameister especially), that one will remember Dr. Caligari long after it ends. One such example is just seeing Conrad Veidt, as the somnambulist, awaken the first time in front of the audience - it's so chilling and gradual that it draws one in completely, and looking in Cesare's eyes becomes all the more frightening. In fact, it's hard to tell which actor gives off the more horrifying aura: the scientist (Krauss, with a great crazy head of hair and catalog of evil facial expressions) or Veidt's cool demeanor.Another scene I should mention, which is simply one of the greatest scenes ever filmed and should be seen by anyone with a pulse: it's when Cesare, after seeing Jane Olsen come into the doctor's place to try to find her father and the two make bizarre eye contact, drifts into her bedroom at night. There's the contrast of dark and light, white and black, for one thing to note, how staggering everything is lit and staged in this setting, and with the walls and windows off-kilter and deranged. Then there's the body language of Veidt as he comes up to the window and into the bedroom towards Dagover - it's seemingly supernatural, out of this world, but still in it, which gives it a whole other dimension. And then the shock of when she awakens, which gives the scene full-blown suspense and danger. I would watch this scene over and over, though it's not the only one that would continually fascinate.Cabinet of Dr. Caligari doesn't carry the same weight of its director's name as Murnau or Lang in German cinema (sadly, Wiene made only a handful of other films seen outside of his native country), but with one film and its standing in the expressionist movement (or, I would also add, surrealist to the degree of its importance in dream/nightmare cinema) it's just as important, and potent today. Watch it in the dark, and hopefully not alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Most commentors remark on the `expressionist' sets and lighting. But these in fact were already common in contemporary stage productions, and just represented here as if they were stage sets. It is true that these have odd angles. But notice how the camera is always rectilinear: stationary, it shoots straight from eye level. That part isn't novel at all. The consciousness of the camera as a character comes from Eisenstein.But what is novel is the framing device which is the first example I know which plays with the veracity of the film's eye. And in THIS respect, the film is important. It is the progenitor of many experiments in folded, shifting narrative from `Rashomon' to `Mullholland Drive.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caligari's Cabinet of Awesomeness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920): Dir: Robert Wiene / Cast: Werner Krauss, Conrad Veidt, Friedrich Feher, Lil Dagover, Hans Heinrich von Twardowski: Intriguing silent film with cabinet symbolizing power or secret. Expressionistic film stars Werner Krauss as a hypnotist showcasing a somnambulist. When a series of murders occur the somnambulist is blamed. Highly influential and overly stylistic in terms of lighting and sets. Clever screenplay where everything is not as it seems with closing scenes that will have viewers admiring its sheer brilliance. Directed by Robert Wiene who establishes expressionistic filmmaking. Krauss plays the mysterious Dr. Caligari as a man with a scene that he will unleash at the fair. Conrad Veidt plays the eerie somnambulist whom Dr. Caligari unleashes. This zombie like character will terrorize and eventually abduct the girlfriend of the film's hero before the town people track him down. Friedrich Feher tells the story, and Lil Dagover plays his girlfriend whom assists in investigating Caligari until she is abducted. Hans Heinrich von Twardowski gets front row seats to the narration while both compete for the same woman. What is truly great about this silent film masterpiece is how nothing is what it seems. This film seems to have invented the "twist ending." Everyone appears as somewhat two-faced. It is a thrilling film that plays on the mind in more ways than one. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

I mean, it's out there in so many ways and never in his full length. Yes you are all correct, it only misses a few frames but still, nowadays we can see it restored and even on Blu Ray it looked stunning.Even for people who like horror this still give you the creeps. The shots used, the make-up, the expressionism of course and the close-ups of faces. And don't forget the use of lighting to create shadows. And if you have seen this one you will know where Tim Burton got his ideas for making props. I won't go into the story but the acting is sublime even as it all looks over the top but hey, it's expressionism galore remember. And for the Goths still walking among us this is also a must see. Remember those gigs from Bauhaus? Well, just have a look at Cesare (Conrad Veidt) how he do his performance and go compare it with Peter Murphy.Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari is out there and from now on full uncut, restored and full of extra's on the Masters Of Cinema series, the best you can get for those old classics and a classic it is...Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 5/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superior shocker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young man named Francis (Friedrich Feher) recounts his horrifying past experience to an older man. At a fair he'd attended with his friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski), he'd watched a novelty act involving a somnambulist, or sleepwalker. The somnambulist is Cesare (Conrad Veidt), a strange looking man who makes eerie predictions. When Alan is killed, Francis takes an interest in shadowing Cesare, until he realizes the truth of the situation.While still a relative newcomer to what is referred to as "German expressionism", this viewer can say that this movement created, for him, some of the loveliest atmosphere and scares to be found in the genre. Director Robert Wiene and company capture on film a succession of incredible images. "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is beautiful to look at and plays like a painting come to life. Light, shadow, and use of colour tinting are all extremely impressive. This is the kind of old style horror film that could legitimately creep out its audience, whether it's in the wee hours of the morning or not. This viewer watched a version featuring a newly added music score that did add to the mood at times, and was merely distracting at others.The primary asset is an amazing performance by the young Veidt, also very well known for playing Strasser in "Casablanca" near the end of his life and career. Veidt plays a character who, while undeniably creepy, is not entirely unsympathetic. Cesare does soften when he beholds the beauty of Francis's love interest Jane (Lil Dagover). It's the diabolical Caligari himself (Werner Krauss) who is the true menace. And Krauss is delicious, in a decidedly theatrical turn.The action is divided into six acts, and finishes with a very fun twist ending.Essential viewing for not just horror buffs, but film buffs in general.Nine out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(87%) A creepy, surreal, and very interesting oddity that could be argued marks the very beginning of the slasher horror sub genre; although this was made nearly one hundred years ago so don't expect any blood, frisky naked "teenagers", or detailed death scenes. This, truth be told, is something that really needs to be broken down and debated to get the most out of the more subtle and abstract themes and ideas. Throughout there are clear modern influences, most notably in many examples of Tim Burton's work, with its crooked trees, deathly pale characters, and warped buildings. Everyone with a fondness of classic cinema should watch this as it's as brilliantly unique as it is weirdly timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant early horror classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is great for a number of reasons. The cinematography stands out in a number of ways. This was during a point in film history known as German expressionism. Where films (especially German films like this) were known for their creepy cinematography. Twisted imagery, intriguing sets, and windows are anything but square. The plot is that a crazy mad scientist named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) is a mad scientist who has a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt) that tells people deadly predictions that come to life. Caligari and Cesare are suspected by the victim's friend Francis (Friedrich Feher) and Jane Olsen (Lil Dagover) as murderers. There are many stills in the movie that have become ingrained as part of movie history. The scene of Ceasre going up a staircase with his body spread over it. In the beginning of the film when Francis is talking with an elderly companion about Caligari is one of the earliest examples of frame story ever. This is really influential film to the horror genre. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extreme-Exaggerated-Expressionism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The impression that a Film had on Movie Audiences at the Time of release is a very difficult thing to quantify. Even reading Reviews posted simultaneously are only an account and can only attempt to verbalize Emotion. Essential as an Historical Document and Reflection, but nevertheless inherently incomplete.The exaggerated Expressionism on display here set the Standard but was never again attempted in such an audacious manner thereafter. The Style was imprinted on the Art Form but few bothered to take it to such an extreme. Its sharp heavy contrast and definitive distortion of the surrounding images of landscapes, buildings, and everything inanimate is the World these Characters inhabit and exist nowhere but in the imaginative recesses of the Mind.This Film is many things. It is considered by most as the first Horror Movie. The Psychological aspect was Groundbreaking. One of those that after seeing it remains in the Memory forever. Influential, to say the least, Daring, Powerful, and one of those that put Cinema on the Map. A must see for anyone interested in the Art of Films, the History of Films, the Film as Mind-Control/Propaganda, and not the least of which, as an early example of why Films became one of the most Popular and Successful Culture Phenomenons of the Twentieth Century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterful piece of art, unlike anything you've ever seen on film before!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I did not think much of it. Well, I've been wrong before, and was once again proved wrong here. This movie is amazingly good and stunningly beautiful. A work of art as well as a movie! The reason I did not like it the first time has probably more to do with the quality of the image on the VHS tape, than the movie itself. Combined with a musical score that didn't fit the movie at all, it was a rather dismal experience. Later I chose the music myself, and found that old Kraftwerk songs fit quite well to the mood of the film. Over the years we've been blessed with restored presentations of the film, featuring excellent musical scores, and the movie is once again able to shine in its proper context, as it always deserved.Set in a small German town called Altona, a young student, Francis, finds his closest friend, Alan, killed the night after a visit to an amusement park. He becomes suspicious of one of the exhibitors at the carnival, because his attraction, a sleepwalker and seer, had told him that he would only live until nightfall. The night before that the city's mayor had been killed. Francis takes it upon himself to investigate the murders, hoping to save himself and his fiancée, Jane, from the same fate.The film focuses on our hero and his search for Caligari, Caligari and how he protects himself and his somnambulist, Cesare, from the suspicions of the police, and the police's suspicion of an innocent man.The story of the film is classic as of today, but in 1920 the movie was quite unique. The most unique feature of the film being that it was the first ever with a surprise ending.The film can be seen in at least two ways: as a well layered and effective thriller/horror film, or as an advanced piece of art. The sceneries in the film are unlike anything I've ever seen before or after, with Tim Burton's artsy sceneries in some of this more Gothic movies as the closest you'll get, style-wise. The director amazes with his use of shapes and lighting to emphasize the plot and enhance the effectiveness of it. It's a risky endeavor, but he perfectly balances the risks of the sets either becoming too unrealistic and unsettling on the one hand, or of being too much style over substance on the other. But the sets fits the story perfectly, in their own unique way. It's unlike anything you've ever seen anywhere else, but you certainly wouldn't want it looking any different either. It is hard to imagine the film looking different than what we're served here, but they have actually tried making more normal looking remakes of the movie in the 60s. I don't really want to check that one out, though, simply because I love this piece of art too much to have it ruined by a different vision. Would you want to see another artist's take on Mona Lisa? Probably not...This was Robert Weine's masterpiece, and pretty much his sole claim of fame. All his attempts before and after this film to achieve something similar failed completely.The actors in the film make good performances. Few of us have probably heard of most of the actors today, but many will probably remember Conrad Veidt (Cesare) from Casablanca or The Thief of Bagdad. This is a German expressionist film, a type of film that emphasize on the gestures of the actors to make its point, rather than sound. This is done in a very good way in this film. Conrad Veidt is particularly good in his part of the somnambulist, with a very artistic and elegant take on the role. Take special notice of the scene where he tries to kill Jane; perfection, worth every penny of the movie alone!I will not say much more than that about the film, it has to be experienced! All in all, a truly unique and timeless film, as effective today as it was in 1920. A true classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a movie considered to be a German Expressionist classic. The Visual style had an influence on Tim Burton films (and that is clear) as well as it being one of the first movies to have a twist ending. So what did I think of it? I thought it was pretty good.The plot of this movie is that a man talks to another about a travelling fair, it has Dr Caligari in it, who owns a somnambulist show. When the fair arrives murders start to happen, including the narrator's (well it's silent so it isn't really a narrator) friend. Is Caligari responsible? Is he controlling the somnambulist in some way? or is it something else? Watch it and find out.Now I am not going to tell you a thing about the twist. It's not one of those ones where clues pop up that give you an answer. It is actually one that also fits in with the story.The visual style is something to comment on because at this point in time, film was in it's very early stages. The visual style to this movie is wonderful. It suitably looks as if this entire movie is crazy (which it is). I also read somewhere the backgrounds were made entirely out of paper, which if that is the case only makes me further compliment it. I might be wrong on that though.So if you want to see a very interesting silent film about insanity, one of the first twist endings or want to see an influence on Tim Burton's visual style then this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unmatched set design</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wiene's 1920 classic, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, was one of the first silent films I saw, if not the very first. While I am not sure if I would call it a good introduction to the medium per se, as it does not resemble much of what I have seen since, it was nevertheless a fine way to start.First and foremost, Caligari is a superb exercise in style. From the very first moment, Timothy Brock's ominous, almost perverse, score sets the tone for the film (that is, if you watch the 1996 restoration like I did), and after that, it never quite lets go. After a brief introduction taking place in present time, a flashback about a strange series of events in the small German town of Holstenwall begins. Of course, from this moment on, the deservedly acclaimed set design takes the center stage; as if seen through the eyes of a madman, the viewer is thrown into a wildly expressionistic world of tilted houses, painted walls and asymmetric objects that are truly a sight to behold, and that I have not seen in any films before it, or since.That the sets take away some focus from some of the other aspects is perhaps wise. None of the actors seem to possess any charisma whatsoever. Even Werner Krauss in what should be a grateful part as Dr. Caligari, does little more than to look as a, well, crazy doctor. Also, the film does not have the most memorable plot ? it does drag a bit, and I never really felt like I wanted to know what would happen next, since it all seemed pretty straightforward. However, the excellent twist ending certainly redeemed the story, and there were a few great scenes before that, such as Dr. Caligari's haunting experience in the woods, and the mysterious scene inside his cabinet. In any event, possible complaints notwithstanding, the film comes a long way purely as eye (and ear) candy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The design, the shadows, the warped artificial reality - The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari is both a classic in horror cinema and also a prime example of German Expressionism, without which would be missing a number of great films and Tim Burton's movies would probably look a hell of a lot different.The story is a simple one: Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) turns up in town as part of a travelling fair, with his somnambulist known as Cesare (Conrad Veidt). The doctor has Cesare in his power and can wake him as part of his act to get a prediction or two. But if Cesare predicts death then death will occur. Francis (Friedrich Feher) thinks he knows the disturbing truth but does he have an overactive imagination?Some people may not watch black and white movies, some people may not watch silent movies. Hell, some people may not watch movies from any country other than their own. Nevertheless, they should give this one a watch. It's got great atmosphere, fantastic visuals, a slim story that manages to grip you as it unfolds and just everything in the right amount that makes it a very deserving classic staying on the lists of many horror fans.While the acting, by those mentioned and also Lil Dagover and Hans Heinrich von Twardowski in two other main roles, may sometimes be as exaggerated and stilted as many of the silent era performances were it just feeds into the dreamy, surreal vibe of the whole thing.Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer wrote the thing, and deserve a mention, but the most praise is reserved for director Robert Wiene, who made a movie that still impresses almost a full century later. Even more impressively, it still raises goosebumps in one or two scenes which is a damn fine achievement. Do yourself a favour and complete your horror self-education by making sure that you see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's another classic from the Silent Era. This German Expressionist film also commonly goes by the title of, Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari. It is considered highly influential due to its artistic direction and I'll discuss that in a moment.The story takes place in the German mountain village of Hostenwall. The tale is told in a series of flashbacks by the main character, Francis, who along with his friend Alan, visit an attraction at a carnival. There, they witness Dr. Caligari, who presents to the audience his somnambulist attraction, Cesare ? a man with a severe sleeping disorder who has the ability of predicting "future" events. Cesare informs Alan that he will die tomorrow, a prediction that later proves to be true. Eventually, Francis and his girlfriend Jane, try investigating Caligari and Cesare until the story produces an interesting twist.German Expressionism was an artistic movement that covered various mediums during the 1920's. In terms of cinema, European production crews had a difficult time emulating the more realistic and high-budget approach to film-making that was introduced by Universal in the United States. The reaction to this was a more "artistic" angle, one that touched upon a deeper meaning with the use of symbolism ? usually of a darker nature. Various intellectual topics were explored and would serve as a basis and inspiration for countless films in the generations to come. I like to classify The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari as an early approach to psychological-horror. The sets are constructed in a very angular and abstract fashion ? slanted rooftops and doorways. There are several instances of deep shadows in contrast with lighter tones. At first glance, it may seen absurd to compare the various visual styles in black and white film stock ? but they do exist. If you're familiar with Film Noir, it was a product of this early movement. Despite my praises of historical importance, I found the pacing of this film a bit slow. I still prefer Nosferatu, but the artistic direction is entirely different ? "Cabinet" it's worth seeing for that alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The birth of the modern horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Travelling sideshow magician Dr Caligari hypnotises his fortune-telling somnambulist stooge Cesare (Conrad Veidt) into kidnapping and murdering the locals of a German mountain village, in this hugely influential silent prefiguring Nosferatu and James Whale's Frankenstein. With its zombie-like killer and devastating twist-in-the-tale it anticipates everything from psychological thrillers like Les Diaboliques to stalk 'n' slashers such as Halloween. Meanwhile, Tim Burton owes about 80 per cent of his visual schematics to Dr Caligari. With their famously weird angles and painted lights and shadows, those German Expressionist sets not only echo the characters' skewed mental states but also saved a fortune on electricity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumphant masterpiece, just as interesting today as it was 89 years ago!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era when artistic cinema was as new to the world as moving pictures themselves, few talents around the world dared to explore this new medium to enhance the transmission of their artistic movements. Few directors and cinema-makers actually dared to take the second step, and make both an entertaining 'movie picture' as well as one that could be thoroughly analyzed and interpreted by audiences. Robert Wiene is one of those, and his silent film "Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari." is as good as silent films get...when it comes to German silent films, at the very least.The film was ground-breaking in every sense of the word. Combining a nightmarish and complicated plot with the artistic sensibilities of expressionism, exemplary storytelling and all the up-to-date cinema techniques, he delivers a classic for the ages. The movie is definitely surreal and ambiguous, but if forced to find a plot, we might say that it's about a certain Dr. Caligari, a nomad monk who arrives one day at a strange, exotic town where surreal shapes and caricaturesque/ghoulish settings are at the order of the day. This quirky, sometimes terrifying man has arrived just in time for the local fair, and he asks to have his act admitted therein. He travels with a large, rustic cabinet where the somnambulist Cesare sleeps, and when Dr. Caligari has him awaken before an awe-struck audience, he proclaims that this somnambulist can predict the future.Meanwhile, two friends strive to grasp the attention of a lovely woman, and as they discuss how their friendship is not to be tarnished by their affections for the same woman, they are attracted to Dr. Caligari's show. One of the men, eager to have his future predicted, asks about his time of death, and (in a rivetingly taut scene) the horrifying somnambulist declares that he is to die at dawn. The man is murdered at dawn precisely, and when his friend tries futilely to find the murderer, the connection is made to the somnambulist's prediction.What follows is a deeply engrossing story with various unexpected twists and turns that shed some doubt not only into the identity of the murderer (who seems to have gone on a killing spree) but on the sanity of all characters involved. This is pure entertainment in nightmare form, and it is one of the first horror films (if it can be called that) that ever existed.The most memorable aspect of the film are the settings, of course. A gamma of twisted, surreal buildings and settings set the example for future directors such as Tim Burton, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Andy Warhol and Guillermo Del Toro. It gives the impression of a twisted dream we've entered, and it helps greatly with the dark, ominous mood of the story. As I've mentioned before, these aesthetics personify cinematic expressionism, and are a paramount in production design nowadays. The images linger with you even after the film has ended, and you feel as if you've just experienced something unnatural and mildly disturbing...but also something darkly enchanting you're willing to revisit over and over again.The melodrama is, of course, overacted like hell, but this is a silent movie after all, and were it not overacted we wouldn't have a clue as to what's going on. That's another interesting aspect about the film. It doesn't rely too much on the words on the black screens to carry the plot. In fact, the words merely state facts and certain important phrases, but we are left to discern emotions and personalities from the actions of the characters alone. It's simply incredible! This was made in 1920, but the character development and the way it probes into the human subconscious rivals that of any other screenplay nowadays.The cinematography is also another interesting thing to ponder about. The film is dark (in every sense of the word), and instead of playing with shadows, dark corridors and lonely passages (like most scary films), the camera feels perpetually darkened, as if the entire town were forever steeped in obscurity. Even the daylight scenes are mysterious and dim. The music, which sounds like a combination between a thriller score and a distorted circus background tune, deals even more tension and lack of comfort to the plot. In addition, there are countless fade-ins and fade-outs, and various segments of the scenes are filmed as through a peephole, giving us the impression that we're submerged in loneliness and darkness while peeking into someone else's nightmare.This is a perfect film. 89 years ago it was breath-taking, compelling and overly dramatic. Now, in 2009, it still holds an urgency, a "now-ness" that can still enthrall you, and you become so engrossed in the plot that the occasional black screen with words, the comical rapid movement captured by those old cameras and the almost hysterical overacting never seem to become a flaw, but part of the enchantment of the film. And as to the artistic interpretations of the scenes, the geometrical symmetry/opposite-ness of the events and the setting may have a whole load of explanations...but those, as in every work of art, are open to the sensibilities of the viewer.Watch this! If you love silent films, you'll adore this one. If you don't, you might just change your mind. And if you're looking to be introduced into this genre, this is a perfect place to start.Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The true proof that cinema = art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shall I compare this film to a summer's day? Maybe this Shakespearian quote is the adequate to express the beauty of this work of art. A painting, yes, this movie reminds me of a painting: the viewer makes his own idea, his own plot and his own message from the film. Wiene, a practically unknown director, achieves to capture our attention with exotic settings, marvelous characters and a plot that keeps us at the edge of our seat from beginning to end. Lots of critics admire this work because of its aesthetic value, but the content is even more interesting: hidden references to Nazi regime or Church, plus a surprise ending, gives a little extra spice to the formula for this great and shiny marvel in the world of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good History Lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are great because they are good no matter how old you are or what background they are from. Caligari is not one of those movies. To enjoy Caligari as much as I did you must have knowledge and appreciation for the beginnings of the horror/slasher films. If you do then I would definitely recommend getting this movie. It shows great insight into the world that would generate Nosferatu and in turn many of the much loved horror movies of today. It was probably one of the first movies to touch base on some of the issues that many later movies have talked about. Its sets are also outstanding. The jagged edges and impressionist styles really help the mood of the movie. It also has one of the first successful attempts at a twist ending. All in all, if you have the capacity to watch a silent film for an hour, I would definitely recommend getting and watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Can Thank This Film for Inspiring My Favorite Film Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This German silent is frequently shown in film study classes (which is indeed where I first saw it), so for many it may carry the taint of "homework," but please don't let that keep you away from it. "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is breathtaking, and you will not miss the presence of sound when you see what a visual feast this movie offers. Firmly rooted in the German Expressionism art movement, "Caligari" creates an entirely new world on screen that looks like a hallucinogenic version of our own. My favorite film genre, film noir, wouldn't even exist if the visual style of German Expressionism hadn't been introduced to the screen in the first place.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most innovative movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, maybe it's not the most innovative, though I can't think of anything that would steal that title from it, but if it isn't, it certainly is one of the most innovative. This 1920 classic basically invented the horror genre, the suspense genre, the expressionist genre, and the twist ending. All done in a haunting, surrealistic manner that will forever echo in your mind.The movie begins with one man relating his sorrowful tale to another: yes, the movie is a flashback. In a nameless town, (well, I didn't catch the name, anyway), the town's carnival is visited by the impish Dr. Caligari and his demented, prophetic somnambulist Cesare. The sleepwalker, who sleeps in a coffin when he's not sleepwalking, makes startling predictions of death. It turns out that he's always right because when he predicts you'll die, he'll come and kill you! But Cesare, a universal metaphor for soldiers who fight in wars, is a mindless and thoughtless automaton. He obeys the macabre orders of his depraved master, Dr. Caligari, without question or remorse. Finally, he's caught trying to steal a slumbering young woman and dies in the chase.In the conclusion of the film, we learn that Dr. Caligari is the administrator of a local insane asylum. When he learns that Cesare is killed, he himself goes insane in one of the most memorable special effects scenes in the history of cinema: he is haunted by the word Caligari, which is scrawled across the entire world in his fractured mind. Crude by today's standards, yes, but the distorted and bizarre effect possesses ten times the heart that canned digital effects have today. It's an earnest effort to disturb, and it succeeds. However, the twist is perhaps the first in all of cinema: the young man who narrates the film is a patient in an insane asylum, and made up the entire affair. Dr. Caligari, the villain in his delusion, is merely his doctor, while his romantic interest is actually another patient at the asylum.Most memorable about this classic is its visual style: in the first example of mise en scene, the landscape is portrayed as a crooked, nightmarish world of wild, splintered, and abstract shapes and angles, convoluted in a metaphor of insanity. Every second gazing upon such a twisted vision of a dark, Gothic world is a grotesque feast for the imagination. I can't recommend it enough.The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari itself stands as a masterful film, but in the long run is remembered as an influential one. The modern world of cinema would simply not be the same were it not for this expressionistic classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>075: The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) - released 2/27/1920; viewed 7/16/06 The 19th Amendment is approved, granting women the right to vote. The Treaty of Versailles is signed, ending World War I. President Woodrow Wilson suffers a stroke, leaving him partially paralyzed. Babe Ruth is traded from the Red Sox to the Yankees. Adoph Hitler presents his National Socialist program in Munich.BIRTHS: Pauline Kael, Donald Pleasance, Isaac Asimov, Federico Fellini, DeForest Kelley, Tony Randall.DOUG: With 1932 behind us, we go back in time once again to check out a few films we missed the first time around, starting with the film that launched a revolution of German expressionism, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. This is one weird movie, to say the least. It's also uneven, messy, and a little hard to get through, despite running at a meager 72 minutes. At no time during the movie does it feel like it's really happening; the backgrounds look like Salvadore Dali paintings with their spiky trees; scenes set outside are obviously shot in the studio; the doors are trapezoidal; the floors and walls all have squiggly patterns; the furniture is over-sized and oddly layered. This innovative lack of realism is what makes the movie a classic, with art direction of Warm, Röhrig, Reimann; this style would become a staple of all German expressionist cinema, including Metropolis and Nosferatu, eventually spilling over into the Universal horror films. Werner Krauss plays the evil titular doctor, and Conrad Veidt (Casablanca's Maj. Strausser is under all that make-up somewhere) plays his minion, Cesare. All the weirdness becomes clear (sort of) with one of film's earliest twist endings (which I will not reveal here); what seems to be an insane doctor carrying out a series of murders turns out to be something else entirely, and our hero narrator turns out to be unreliable. This film is nothing like anything else that came out in 1920.KEVIN: From the first frame, this is unlike anything before it. Films have always tried to convey emotion, sometimes a sense of uneasiness through the lighting or the sets, but Caligari creates its atmosphere in every inch of celluloid, with its freakish sets, over-the-top performances, and garish make-up. Watching it, we know it's not real, the doors are all shaped wrong and the walls look like they're about to fall into each other, but we're completely immersed in more and more whacked-out imagery and storytelling until reality itself is incidental. As Frances recounts the tale, he says, "It began in the town of my birth." We then cut to a bizarre and disturbing matte painting of this town, but it's a cluster of crooked houses piled all over a hill. I said, "If I was born there, I'd kill myself." Conrad Veidt is just barely recognizable as Cesare, and Werner Krauss looks like the devil's favorite doctor. It sure had my attention. Even so, I'm surprised that I was so apprehensive to watch such a milestone film, even given its short runtime of 75 minutes. But I'm glad I've watched it now, so that every time I see freaky imagery in a movie, like Universal's horror films, I know exactly where it came from.Last film viewed: The Mummy (1932). Next film viewed: The Wind (1928). Last film chronologically: Broken Blossoms (1919). Next film chronologically: Way Down East (1920).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Massively Influential German Expressionism Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caligari is up there with Citizen Kane as one of the most influential films in history. It played a huge part in establishing the horror genre(along with 'Nosferatu), and the unique language of silent film in general.Most of all, this is pure film ART.The distorted, painted sets, strange camera angles and even stranger plot contribute to Caligari's reputation as a true classic. If you want to try and pinpoint a time when film met art, look no further. This is a visual spectacular, a film that will leave you dizzy in it's aftermath.Of course it has faults. Most silent films do. But these are overrided by the true originality of the work, and the hallucinatory, spooky atmosphere created.A film that is an essential,'see before you die' type. It's not the greatest ever produced, but it sure is one of the most important.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this rather short. I had to watch this for a Film History class and was rather put off by the whole plot. I read the synopsis but felt it wouldn't be as good as its contemporary Nosferatu (ironically, another film I would have not seen if not for college). I was pleasantly surprised and strongly urge anyone with an appreciation for silent films to put this on your list of "Must See." Even if you don't have an appreciation for the genre or era, you can see parallels with modern film in the characters, setting, etc. The ending was definitely a surprise and, for me personally, is reminiscent of Memento (a favorite of mine). I really have come to enjoy films done in the German Expressionist time, and have actively attempted to view all the films of the German Expressionist movement. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari definitely ranks in the top three of best silent films. If you're skeptical as I was, I hope that you give it a shot -- you never know what you may like if you don't try it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real treat for a true friend of silent horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Couple of years have passed since I saw "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" but I can still recall it as a highly confusing, very arresting, truly peculiar and most fascinating film and from time to time I realize that it still haunts in my mind. It's obvious that silent movies got that certain special enchantment - simple black and white colors and the lack of all sounds gives the impression that somebody has transferred mad dreams into the screen. When I watched "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" I didn't clearly understood all of the story - to be perfectly honest I hardly even tried to follow it. Strange and twisted events, absurd atmosphere and the inconceivable, insane and illogical settings stealed my whole attention. The world "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" creates is a really imaginative place. After seeing the movie I couldn't stop thinking of it - I kind of felt like it had me hypnotized in some odd trance. In one point I wasn't even sure if the movie was good or bad but then I figured out any film that has so powerful influence on me can only be extremely good. I strongly recommend engrossing "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" to anyone who appreciates classic horror. This was a really unique experience - one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>German expressionism reaches a peak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is arguably the most popular and renowned example of German expressionism; it outweighs "Nosferatu" as the most prominent, well-known and influential film of its kind and its translation into the American audience has been greeted warmly, to say the least.I'm not so sure if, as a motion picture, it could really be graded against others. This is a very early movie and as such it's not altogether coherent and doesn't feature a brilliant plot, to say the least. Of course technically speaking it is inferior to some other movies made nowadays (as others on IMDb have been pointing out in their reviews) but so what! The quality of the craftmanship on the awkward sets and Wiene's direction more than compensate for its story's flaws.Yes, this is a very dated film in the sense that I don't think any teenaged audiences would be able to sit through it, and even many adults would be put off by it. It's definitely for film buffs, so I don't advise you to start playing it at your next get-together.However, if you are enthusiastic about film, I'm sure you'll find plenty of things to appreciate and even cherish here, and there's simply no arguing that the craft of the product is superb, rich and well-detailed -- forget CGI, this is true film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A memorable expressionist work - not to be missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a very small number of early films which have achieved the status of major classics, usually because they introduced some significant and important technological advance that was subsequently developed and exploited more fully by later movie makers. These films are required viewing for students in Technical Colleges or Universities who are training for a career in some way related to movie production. Most of these Colleges have carefully preserved 16 mm copies of this select group of films which are dusted off and shown to the students each year; but until recently it has not been easy for the ordinary movie buff to obtain copies than can be added to a personal collection. I have vivid memories of first seeing "The Cabinet of Dr Caligari", and many other early film classics, at a small repertory cinema which primarily catered for the students of the University I was attending; but I did not see them again for several decades, and this type of small repertory cinema is hard to find today even in major University cities. Instead many of these classic films have now been released as videotapes or DVD's and can be fairly readily purchased for home viewing by anyone with a serious interest in the development of the cinema as we know it. It is usually fascinating to watch them, but it is impossible to comment on them using the same standards as one would for a modern film. The Cabinet of Dr Caligari is a very significant film even among this small select group. It is a silent film made and released in Germany in 1920, and is now generally recognised as the first important film to have used suspense and horror for its primary appeal to its audiences. It's original role appears to have been as a political treatise, but it is now regarded as a definitive expressionist masterpiece. The sets are nightmarish with angular shapes and geometrical distortions that continually underline the differences between human perception and reality. They create a wonderful atmosphere for the telling of this Gothic story, which relates to a Dr. Caligari who demonstrates at a local fairground that he can use hypnotism to force a somnambulist he has in a coffin like cabinet to carry out orders on his behalf. Murder and abduction lead to Dr Caligari fleeing and being traced to a lunatic asylum where it is not clear whether he is an inmate or the Director. The nightmarish atmosphere is skilfully created and well maintained throughout the story, and there is a twist at the end which was new for films of this period but has been copied by numerous more modern directors since. The photography is clear, crisp and definitive throughout, but this only accentuates the atmosphere of fantasy created by the sets. Makers of modern music videos, who seem to believe that a sense of fantasy can only be created by showing a painful sequence of extremely short unrelated clips created with visually violent disco style lighting, should be force fed on this film until they reform their ways. Ultimately this film still provides very absorbing viewing, although some deterioration must have affected the available master copies and is still evident on modern VHS or DVD copies. There are also small differences between the various copies available, both in the accompanying musical score and in the use of tinting for some of the scenes. Other reviews in this database provide some information on these differences, but overall I can only recommend readers who do not know this film to seek out any one of the home movie copies and to watch it. It is not likely to prove a disappointment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film justifies the classification of cinematography as an art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was shot between 1919 and 1920, a few decades since the motion picture camera was invented, and the Lumi?re brothers were in the middle of their experiments with it. At the time, cinema was being considered as a new way of making art, and yo make art you had to marry with a serie of ideas: ideology, aesthetics, cosmogony, etc. In these terms, this movie belongs to the German expressionism, which is reflected in the entire setup: from characters make up to the background of the set.Having an average murder-mystery plot, the movie can be defined as a painting with some action occurring in it. The whole scenario was displayed following the same criteria as in expressionist painting: all diagonal and curve lines, evading the straightness and the cardinal orientation of things, wicked perspectives and proportions. Even the more minimum detail was carefully considered to fulfill the aesthetics needs. The result couldn't have been better, considering that the only visual trick they could do was to shrink/enlarge the camera's diafragma. Think that this was before the concept of travelling was even developed.Concerning the plot, yet it's true that it isn't really the great thing and that many people now a days find it boring, I got to enjoy it, further than its aesthetical function (I even got to laugh in a couple of scenes), and I highly recommend it, as a good old piece of art from which many of today's film makers may take some good lessons on how to approach movies. I'm sure that if they got understand that, then there would be much lesser crappy movies than there are now a days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Caligari on a region 4 DVD distributed by Force Video in Australia. It corresponds to the Eureka release in the US, i think. I thoroughly recommend it. Timothy Brock's score is the best score for a silent movie i've heard so far! Its such an authentic orchestral accompaniment that you can actually hear the breathing of the string players! Truly wonderful compared to the old organ or set classical or jazz music pieces which run alongside the movie instead of help tell its story. And what an incredible movie. One of my favourite silents so far! An eye-opening experience. If you haven't seen much silent cinema, you'll be shocked at how involving a silent can be. Caligari takes you to another place. The world of Caligari has a feel all its own, where houses are wonky, doorways triangular, people ghoulish, and everything like something out of a nightmare. One of the best pieces of what they call german expressionism. See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerily Enchanting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to place this film into words, because it tends to defy description. It is truly film as Expressionist art-while there is a plotline similar to modern monster movies, it has a strong theme of the evils of those in authority. Even though a framing device was later added to the film to cut back on this theme, it actually makes it even stronger, because it forces the viewer to question everything the film presents.The film's world is unique, with tilted, abstract settings, gothic characters, and the brooding soundtrack. Though the overuse of irises can be annoying, credit must be given for the fact that the filmmakers actually thought to come up with unique cinematography. The image of Cesare awakening, his eyes slowly opening then suddenly bursting open with fright is quite chilling indeed. Caligari himself is framed in many bizarre shots, giving him a commanding presence in the film.The haunting aspect of this film is the enigmatic characters. While we are first presented with a typical monster movie, with the evil Caligari sending sleep walker Cesare to murder in the evening, we are thrown a curve when the story teller turns out to be a patient in an asylum, populated both by the film's female lead Jane and Cesare, who died in the plotline, with Caligari as the head doctor. While this was added in later to make sure the movie did not ultimately rebel against authority (censorship still being strong in Germany at the time), this forces us to question-did the events we've been presented with truly happen? If so, did they really happen the way we've been told? Was it all the fantasy of a madman, or was there some truth to it? Though Caligari claims at the end that he can cure the protagonist, we get the feeling that he may not have his best intentions at heart.It is a shame that many people will avoid this film due to its age and its status as a silent film. I myself would have never heard of it had I not been enrolled in a college film course. It probably would not do well up against films of today with a modern audience-many of my classmates were confused. Though this film is confusing, that's the point-you have to mull this one over in your head and draw your own conclusions. That is the true staying power of this film-it never quite leaves your mind.</fullReview>

Shooting the film outside the studio would have completely destroyed the film's atmosphere. It would have been weird to find out that a madman's delusion is just like our reality. Because he is not expected to perceive things in the same `normal' way like we do, shooting the film in the studio and creating the madman's own world was the only way to show the wickedness of his reality. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari uses costumes in a functional way as well. We see Dr. Caligari dressed in complete black colors and wearing an overcoat as if he is trying to inform us from the beginning that he is the villain of the movie. On the other hand Jane, Francis' love (narrator), who is symbolizing purity and grace in his mind, is always seen in white dresses. However, as the ending draws closer, when Dr. Caligari is seen sleeping in his bed, he is wearing a white costume. As he was regarded as an innocent doctor by most people, his outlook changes to white as well. At the same time the audience is implicitly warned that seeing a person dressed in white (acting innocently) does not mean that he/she is actually innocent.Also when Dr. Caligari comes to get a permit to exhibit at the fair he has a very bad posture. He is leaning downwards and he is in one corner of the scene. This makes us interpret that he is a sly person who is different from `normal' people. Lighting was one of the crucial points in Caligari. Because of the financial problems of Germany at that time, lights were painted. There were also lots of contrast in terms of black and white as if trying to make a clear-cut distinction between the good and the evil. When Cesare comes to kill Mr. Alan (Francis' friend), we see the murder from the shadows of both men. Also when Cesare is on his way to kill Jane, we see his shadow on the wall. As he is wearing a black costume as well, there seems to be no difference of himself from his shadow probably meaning that he is a part of the night with his diseased soul. However there's hardly any camera movement in the film.in Caligari there is hardly any movement. Everything is stage-like and different angles are not usually used in one scene. Close-ups are usually done by narrowing the iris. There was only one panning and it was in the police station when the wrong suspect was arrested. Camera made a slight pan movement in attempt to show the small crowd's faces. It seems that this movement does not hold an artistic importance in the film.While Caligari can be regarded as representing the complete authority of the government over its citizens, Cesare seems to represent the obeying people. In the film, Caligari says that Cesare has slept for 23 years meaning that people are made to do things and that they are not complaining while doing them. On the whole, Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a masterful piece of German Expressionism which every cinema lover should see at least twice in his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art in its purest sense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can be said about this breathtaking film but that it is Art in its purest sense. The Cabinet, a sideshow act at a small German Town Fair, contains Cesare, a somnambulist or sleep-walker (this term had far more horrific connotations in 1919). He is under the care of the sinister seeming Dr. Caligari. Trouble starts when bodies start turning up, stabbed by an unknown assailant. The townfolk wait nervously for the next body to drop, suspicious of everything and everyone.This is all narrated to us by Friedrich Fehér, a student whose friend's death was foretold by the lurking somnambulist. He puts two and two together and goes to exact vengeance. Does he succeed? Well, I'm not going to tell you, go watch it and have a rip-roaring time.Though a lot of credit must go to the producer of this movie, Erich Pommer, the main attraction is the quality of the sets and costumes, designed by German Expressionists Hermann Warm, Walter Röhrig and Walter Reinmann. These dark, brooding designs push the film from a realistic recreation of life to a mystical new place where all is art and nothing matched this reviewer's humdrum imagination.A must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film does for the eyes what punk did for the ears. Dr Caligari through one medium stimulates all the senses. The images are so overtly stimulating that one is either entranced or else is switched off. By literally transposing the essence of German Expressionism to frame every scene, one is aware of voyeurism at it's most intrusive. The ending is the best ever, since it forces one to watch the whole film again to try to reconcile truth from fantasy. No film in history can match the stimulus created by Wiene in this film.

		<shortDescription>And When Dr. Caligari Went To The Cabinet, The Cabinet Was Bare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because this somewhat weird, German-Expressionist film (with its original colour tinting) is now 94 years old, I really did try to be lenient and cut it some slack with my overall rating of it.But, with that said, I'm sorry to have to tell you ('cause I'm not going to lie), the best that I could ever possibly give as a score for this silent-era freak-show would only be a measly 3 stars, and that's all. Regardless of its old age, it just doesn't deserve more than that.For one thing, at 75 minutes, this picture was about 20 minutes too long. And, when it came to its rather bizarre and deliberately distorted set designs, I found them, before long, to be quite boring, and literally under-whelming.You can be sure, had this fantasy film been made in the USA (circa. 1920), I highly doubt that all the snobs-of-early-cinema would still be falling all over themselves with absolute, undying praise for it, right to this very day.From my point of view, this vintage film's story was so simple that it came across as being downright simple-minded in nature. And, as far as the Dr. Caligari character goes, he was far from being convincingly sinister and treacherous. On the contrary, this dumpy, old fart struck me as being nothing but a stupid, senile, windbag who couldn't even scare a child.</fullReview>

However, Veidt died too soon at the age of 50 years old (1893-1943). Krauss died at the age of 75, despite both starring in this marvelous masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legacy of Caligari</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Between the varying and conflicting production testimonies of its many players, the endless bizarre legends and anecdotes serving as catalysts for various design and creative choices; between all this there is a small, independent, seminal art-house movie that premiered in 1920 to resounding accolades, praise and most importantly for all involved, money. It was a success that surprised most of the people involved, but looking back at Caligari almost a century forward, it's easy to see how the film was at first universally adopted as revolutionary, and then analysed to death by scholars over the coming decades to the point where the actual film?that is, as a work of interpretive art and not something that desperately requires classification and resolute distinction in terms of motivations, political ideology, historical placement, influence and social stature ?is often overshadowed by its lasting legacy as something more than just that.Rather than drive myself to madness attempting to unwrap the mystery of Janowitz, Mayer and Wiene's unending battle of dispute over who did what and why and where, I instead prefer to see Cabinet for what it is; a deceptively straight-forward murder-mystery that exists in a world of irregular angles and avant-garde design. And I'm not just referring to the movie's expressionist scenery which is, of course, what makes the most immediate impression on a first viewing. I'm also alluding to the twisted, dream-like state in which the characters move within their world, almost as if they were one in the same. You could argue, in fact, that they are cut from the same piece of cloth that never wants to settle down in a neat little arrangement until you wish to make use of it. Instead, both the characters and the world in Caligari demand your immediate attention from the very beginning and in a strange way it's hard to draw your attention elsewhere, even if everything does seem a bit otherworldly, strange and abstract.If you're looking for some sort of synopsis from this review, then best leave now. It's a relatively simple affair as I pointed out before, but even then there are many differing interpretations. My own is not in fact my own. Others share it, and it's relevant to us as individuals who see the movie the way we do, but the details of such a view aren't important to you as someone who?potentially?hasn't seen the film yet. Anyone else who has already seen it, more than likely already knows, or doesn't care. What is important, is simply the distinction that exists between Caligari and many films that came before it. It's open-ended, open to debate and, once more, refuses to be consolidated merely to straight, perpendicular angles with only one logical conclusion. This aspect, along with the overall style, atmosphere and artistic merit of the feature is what makes it special. On paper, it's nothing special, and by no means do I loft it as highly as other film historians, scholars or enthusiasts. Let me be clear. I'm not one to automatically prescribe "genius" to trailblazing films ahead of their time for that fact alone. Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a great film, and an extremely important and influential one for sure. But it's not the pinnacle of the movement it begins. It's not perfect, and no, I don't believe it to be a masterpiece. Masterpieces are timeless, and while it's very easy to watch and enjoy Caligari a century on, it's still mostly important because of the time in which it was produced. Again, it's a simple affair. Simple, but extremely effective. So much so that it caused a cinematic revolution, the echoes of which we still hear today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Awaken for a moment from your dark night!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen expressionist films before, "Nosferatu" and "Metropolis" are ones that immediately come to mind, but this movie is probably the most perfect example. Not saying it's the best, but the most perfect example. If Expressionism is defined as a work that elicits emotion through extreme visuals, then you'll readily understand the connection. Director Robert Wiene, filming with a limited budget and a confined work space, used painted sets that are disorienting in a way that keeps the viewer off balance. Adding to this feeling are characters who walk into and out of them as if through some invisible gateway, since one can't define exactly where reality begins or ends. Additionally, angular surfaces require people to walk either slightly uphill or downhill, and rarely does the camera dissolve or open to the center of a frame, but more often from a corner of the screen. All of these effects create an unsettled feeling and distortion from reality.So there's that, but the story has even more going on, because almost nothing is as it appears to be. It begins with the title - if you really think about it, there was no 'real' Dr. Caligari to speak of, the character attributed to be Caligari was the director of an insane asylum who was influenced by, one would say obsessed with, the work of a predecessor from 1783 by that name, revealed in Act V of the movie. In turn, Caligari attempted to duplicate the work of his namesake in waiting for a patient to show up who was a somnambulist, a sleepwalker, the purpose of which was to learn if that person could be influenced to perform certain acts that would have been otherwise out of character. In other words, he would hypnotize his patient to perform criminal acts, including murder! The business with the second, red herring murderer was an interesting diversion for both the viewer and the characters in the story. With Francis (Friedrich Feher) maintaining his vigil over the Caligari caravan, he watches what he believes is the somnambulist Cesare (Conrad Veidt) asleep in his cabinet, (coffin?), but is it really Cesare? One can observe Francis slowly going mad as the 'body' in the cabinet turns out to be a puppet, and he's on hand at the asylum to witness Cesare returned as a patient, while Caligari is strait-jacketed and placed in a cell, never to be free again. Seeing the new director and believing him to be Caligari, Francis completes his mental breakdown as asylum workers have another strait jacket handy just for him.The brilliance of the film is probably more apparent if one re-watches it immediately after seeing it the first time. As the picture opens, Francis is speaking to an older man who states "There are spirits. They are around us.", while Francis purports to tell him an even stranger tale. He holds to a belief that Jane (Lil Dagover), who passes into view as some ethereal specter, is his fiancé, though we learn at the end of the movie that she would not marry him because as a 'queen' - "We who are of noble blood may not follow the wishes of our hearts". The full circle aspect of what occurs in the story becomes evident when one realizes that Francis, Jane Olsen, and the older man, are all inmates of the asylum, and if you want to take it that far, are prisoners in the cabinet of Dr. Caligari as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first horror film ever and one of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) keeps a somnambulists named Cesare (Conrad Veidt) in a cabinet as part of a sideshow. At night he order Cesare to go out and kill his enemies. Will he be caught? The plot is not the main focus here. What is is the sets which are brilliant. They're all crooked buildings and things you would see in your nightmares and not in real life. This is an example of what was called German Expressionism. The settings keep you off balance constantly throughout the film. Even better is Veidt who's downright terrifying as Cesare. He was a very handsome man but here he looks terrible and frightening. There's also excellent direction and a twist at the end while somewhat predictable today was probably shocking back in 1920. Also this is reportedly the first full length horror film ever made. Only about 60 minutes and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge influence on the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first feature-length horror movie ever made (not counting the hundreds of shorts made in the previous two decades, usually under five minutes each), this is classic stuff and rightly so. With an age-barrier of nigh on a century you might think that this movie, seen today, is very dated, and you'd be right. The lack of dialogue (although there's a fine music score), the theatrical acting and static direction may make this movie an effort to watch but the effort is well worth it. My main problem with these older films is that sometimes they can be very boring with little action, but that's not a problem here; the pacing is fast and the film is short which makes the time fly by.The plot, involving Caligari and his murderous somnambulist, may seem deceptively simplistic at first glance, but there are lots of little tricks thrown in to fool the viewer. Also, other characters whose lives act as other plot strands, flowing in and out of the central thrust of the story. All this and a twist ending to boot.The acting is generally top-notch, if you allow for the acting style of the period. Werner Krauss makes the most of his bookish Caligari, complete with horn-rimmed glasses and odd-looking attire; his outlandish and very atypical character makes him highly watchable. Stealing the show, though, is a very young Conrad Veidt (later to go on and pursue a successful Hollywood career) playing the somnambulist, around whom most of the action is centred. Veidt's striking appearance (black clothing, white eyes, black sunken eyes) fits together well with his understated acting approach so that he appears very deathly and almost like a living corpse; just looking at him gives you the creeps. The supporting characters are humane and normal and thus forgettable, but fine.What is most striking about this movie are the sets, most of which were constructed form paper or cardboard. The abstract drawings, and the oddly surreal, angular walls create a visually stimulating fantasy world for the sinister events to take place in. Much has been made of the "painted shadows" employed to give the movie more of a balance between black and white and the effort pays off. Karl Freund's photography certainly brings out the atmosphere of the sets and they're unforgettable. Like Tolkien did with Lord of the Rings, all involved with the making of this film transpired to create a believable fantasy world which is similar to, yet very different, from our own; an alternate reality perhaps. Whatever the motivation, the expressionist art displaying itself here made the movie a classic.Seen today, the horror is subtle and all of the murders offscreen (aside from one memorable shadow-play). A far cry from the movies of today and, indeed, the wealth of absurdly violent (heads, bodies being chopped apart) shorts made in the early 1900s. Yet the image of Veidt stalking his victims through long corridors have undoubtedly influenced all that has come after it, from Lugosi's Dracula to Michael Myers in HALLOWEEN. Altogether, THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI is a horror classic which should be seen at least once by any fan with a passing interest in the genre, or indeed in the cinema, as this is a highly influential and important film in every respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A simple plot, but with a great execution, a gem every cinephile must discover, "The Cabinet...¨ is among the best of the best, even for its time.One can easily perceive why it became a classic: not only for the superb visual style, with those surreal, curved decorates that give the feeling of being trapped in a nightmare, but also for its dark, engaging and suspenseful plot (highlight scenes are the kidnapping of one of the main characters, and the last 20 minutes). A psychological thriller, which even has its moments of horror, as it's normally considered to be the first of that genre, at least in full-length format, if we compare it with, for example, short films such as "Frankenstein" from 1910. The uses of colors, framing, lighting, makeup, shadows, are all perfectly executed in order to give life to a nightmarish atmosphere.It is also important to note that it has the honor to be the film that founded the German Expressionist Movement, which would give us other treasures such as Nosferatu, The Hands Of Orlac, and Metropolis.Superb are also the performances, especially Conrad Veidt as Cesare and Werner Krauss as his master the doctor, who are already very creepy not only by their physical appearance, but also because they imbue an aura of mystery.And last but not least, the final plot twist (being also the pioneer film in using this device) encourages debate, and (why not?) further viewings. This twist, if it was not enough, was used in some later and recent modern films, with more or less variations, but I have no doubt that in its time it shocked audiences.A truly amazing experience. And it is already among my favorite silent films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's one mayor spoiler, but everyone already knows it anyway.Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is probably the first real horror film that set the bar, and had a large influence on later films. I can here say that the film might not be as scary as it was back in it's release, but it still stays creepy. City with it's oblique and curvy structures, shadows and sharp-pointed forms creates an eerie mood. The story is more of a murder mystery than a horror, where professor manipulates a somnambulist to commit murders. Cabinet is also remarkable for using a flashback in flashback. And that ending twist that is more powerful than M. Night Shyamalan could ever dream of creating. Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is easy to watch mostly because of it's astonishing expressionist style and on the edge of your seat story. Must see film for everyone. Especially those who are interested where their favorite horror film's roots lies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silent film classic that still impresses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review briefly discusses the film's ending, so don't read on if you don't want to know anything about it. I've been wanting to see "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" since I first read about it as a child (it may even have been in "Famous Monsters of Filmland"). This past Friday night, I finally got the opportunity to see it in a crowded movie theater, and 'Caligari' did not disappoint. The sets were amazing, and reminded me how lack of money can sometimes be a spur to creativity. While I found Werner Krauss' acting as Caligari very broad, Conrad Veidt was amazing as the somnambulist, Cesare. I had only ever seen Veidt as a mature actor in his villain roles, as Major Strasser in "Casablanca," and as the evil Grand Vizier in "Thief of Baghdad. He was quite a compelling and graceful performer as well as being a beautiful young man. Did he really die at only age 50? What an untimely death.I heard that the studio powers-that-be had imposed 'Caligari's' ending (which was not that much of a surprise, given the film's beginning) but that got me thinking about other movies that had "studio-imposed" endings and sometimes those are better than the endings the filmmakers originally had in mind. For instance, I don't think the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" would be as good of a film without Kevin McCarthy's high-tension narration, which was part of the studio-imposed framing story. Some people also think Hitchcock's "Suspicion" is a better film due to the (studio-imposed) ending, though it makes the story that comes before the climax less ironic, it also makes it far more ambiguous. In the case of "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," I don't think the ending in any way diminishes the power of the central story, which has the force of any nightmare. In some ways, the ending is brilliant because it shows how human beings incorporate real events and people from their lives into their dreams. It's like waking up from a dream and realizing that you have been dreaming. As for what the dream means, who can say? I believe it is a movie to be felt, not interpreted. See it, and let me know if you agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a very important one to put it in simple terms. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari has influenced many films from the noirs of the 40's to many horror films. The abstract style of the sets and the use of shadows and make up highlight a great story seeped in atmosphere.Good: As a silent film, the experience is purely visual. The set design is fantastic with nothing ever seeming based on a concrete world. All the buildings are warped, the pathways twist around wildly, and the general mood is off kilter. The film boasts fantastic direction in its use of shadows and angles to tell its story. The character of Cesare is suitably freaky with the actor doing a great job. The ending even serves as a foundation for many films to come.Overall, this is a classic in cinema. Highly influential and still stands up as a great slice of German expressionism art-house horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The German Expressionist film movement is one of the key movements of film history. Films like "Nosferatu", "Faust", "Metropolis", "Sunrise", and "The Golem" are all classic examples of this movement, but perhaps the most important entry of the German Expressionist movement is the haunting horror classic "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari".With a surreal set design that truly adds to the strange beauty the film creates, it clearly has inspired the work of filmmaker Tim Burton, among many others. It is quite surprising how much the film still holds up, considering it was made nearly 100 years prior to the writing of this review.Personally, I wasn't always kept too engaged in the film and found it to be, sometimes, a little slow, it is usually a marvel to look at and I found some scenes to be oddly haunting, and the age of the film really helped the mysterious tone it creates.Overall, it is quite the classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expressionistic style and story with an interesting ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have never been exposed to the visual style of expressionism before, you might find this quite off putting. This film uses a lot of expressionistic visual styles and is consisted mainly of oblique lines and weird angles not generally found in the environment. This is because everything you see was made on set even up to the lighting which was all artificial. The shadows too were painted. In this aspect, I find the mise-en-scene pretty impressive, as everything was artificially created and enhanced the visual style greatly. The story also reflects the expressionistic style in the film. Though the film makes the audience think we're dealing with a murder, what is real and what isn't gets muddled at the end, in what I feel is a pretty incredible ending. The film leaves it open for interpretation so that you could go whichever way, much like how Inception ended. Both narrative and mise-en-scene compliment each other greatly, and could even be used as a type of imagery of a madman's mind. I find this type of cinema quite interesting, though of course it is in black and white (with colour edits) and is a silent film. Plus the acting is theatrical, which is not what we are used to on screen and can make it a bit boring at times.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A devious hypnotist named Dr. Caligari arrives in town to promote his somnambulist in a wooden "cabinet" (basically a wooden casket) in the local fair, with a series of knife murders starting up as a result. Werner Krauss is the golem-faced Caligari while Conrad Veidt is his controlled victim (claimed by Caligari to have been in a twenty-three year slumber, only awakened for the fair), sent out at night to kill. I didn't realize this until I was reading some of the film's back story but the plot is related to the writers' aftermath in the military, using the Caligari character as a symbol for them while Conrad is a representation of themselves as soldiers manipulated into killing for their country. Anyway, when a local named Friedrich Feher is talking with an older man claiming spirits were responsible for ruining a life with his family, driving him apart from them. Feher claims that a methodically-walking woman moving past (Lil Dagovel) them is soon to be his wife. He proclaims that they have been through a lot and starts to tell the Caligari story. Where the three of them are actually located is a twist right out of a horror film.The film presents the village Feher lives in a visually askew style where the architectural structures, furniture, landscapes, and backdrops (distance shots of the city and mountains) aren't aligned or presented in a fashion we are accustomed to, angled and pointed in directions that describe what we see as off-kilter and irregular. The stylistics in the use of shadow (like the silhouette of a knife murder against a wall as it is being committed), and even how the makeup and eyeliner are used for the faces of the characters encourage this feeling that we are experiencing a world quite alien to our own. This is purposely surreal so that the twist (although against how the writers wanted to end their film) makes sense in the grand scheme of things. The painted sets and matte backgrounds correspond with the visually misshapenness of the village. It is not supposed to look and feel like a place that exists in our world, but the village is of another place entirely. The image of Dagovel, with her eyes totally devoid of life, walking past Feher in a trance, in her white gown is an instant grabber. Veidt's eyes opening for the first time, his slinky body dressed in black steadily leaving the cabinet, foretelling the doom of Feher's friend in a fair "performance" is another memorable scene. Krauss has a marvelous face for a silent horror/cult film. The way even the titles are designed in relation to the film's visual content (and there's this fab moment in the film when Krauss' thoughts are literally spelled out overhead to torment him) is extraordinary. Veidt standing over Dagovel's bed might just remind viewers of Nosferatu hovering over Mena?both are night sequences where the damsel is in bed at her most vulnerable. The whole insane asylum development and diary discovery sure take the film in a whole different direction in regards to Caligari. It is that fork in the road that the viewer takes along with the film that leads to an unexpected finale. The performances are very much heightened to match the presentation...so over-the-top as a description for this film seemed appropriate. And how the camera's eye opens and closes on characters to further emphasize where the story is going is a technique quite creative in how it tells its story.This is a silent film quite deserved of its rep, and the newly restored and meticulously "repaired" version that is certainly a patch over the public domain print is the best I've seen thus far. The differing color hues of alternating scenes, while unintentional by restorers, actually gives the film an extra otherworldy effect I wasn't expecting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the sleepy town of Holwenstall, the showman Dr. Caligari arrives to present his latest attraction ? Cesare the Somnambulist, a young man who has been asleep for 23 years &amp; who is under his complete control. He can also predict the future, telling one man that he has until dawn to live. The man is later murdered that night. The victim's friend tries to investigate but finds that there are some surprises up Caligari's sleeve, such as his real identity.The Cabinet of Dr Caligari is probably the most influential genre film ever to appear on the world's stage. It became a massive success at that time &amp; inspired everything else from other genre silent films (the likes of NOSFERATU &amp; Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS both owe a debt of gratitude) to modern-day efforts.The thing that made the world pay attention to in The Cabinet of Dr Caligari was the unique distorted worldview that the film pioneered ? it was the first film to offer up a subjective depiction of the world ? there was no reality on the screen, instead being a weird place that did not fit in with its surroundings. Not to mention the twisted set design that was really quite brilliant &amp; that inspired few direct copies due to its utterly alien way of narrative. The sets are all twisted &amp; crooked, with sharp acute angles &amp; bloated shadows everywhere you looked. Although the design also runs the risk of being completely hard to decipher ? there is no telling apart any of the structures or locations, instead giving the impression that it is a single stage set the actors are playing on.For a classic German expressionist film, the story &amp; acting are surprisingly weak. The story is uninteresting &amp; dull, not to mention dated. The actors tended to let their acting skills slip to the point that some prove to be utterly ham-fisted, particularly Werner Krauss as Caligari &amp; Lil Dagover, who overacts considerably as the damsel in distress. On the opposite end of the scale is Conrad Veidt, whose performance as Cesare is the stuff of genre legend ? his peculiar movements &amp; proto-zombie gait are the stuff of nightmares. Despite an ending that dilutes the nightmarish visuals as nothing but a lunatic's fantasy (something that will damage several other genre films throughout the history of film), the film's creepy influence will exert its own weird charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a 1920 German film directed by Robert Wiene, written by Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz, and starring Werner Krauss, Conrad Veidt, and Friedrich Feher - about a creepy old man and his freaky fair sideshow and the mysterious murders taking place during their presence. Direction: 2/2 Very strong direction. The director was very in control and thorough with his actors performances and setting the mood for the story. The sets are absolutely amazing, in a bizarre way. The colors, the shapes of the doors, buildings, windows, etc., the make-up, the behavior, was all so peculiar and well done. It definitely kept my attention. Acting: 2/2 Extremely dramatic. I would consider it too dramatic but I don't want to knock points off for different styles in different eras. It worked for this film, for sure. It was laughable at some points but it's a silent film so I understand that they had to be creative with communicating through their bodies. Dr. Caligari and Cesare were acted perfectly. They were so creepy and weird. They did a great job. Screen writing: 1/2 It's a silent film so really all I can do is comment on the story, rather than the dialog. The story itself was a trip. Creative, different, interesting. I really enjoyed this film. I was glad to find that it still spooked me despite being from a different time, from a different country, and honestly, because I just don't get spooked too easily. Definitely a fan of the story. I have to say though that if a movie constantly makes me think "Why did you do that?? You should have ??" then in my opinion, it could have been better. There were many times where the characters did things that were straight up stupid or just completely puzzling. Cinematography: 2/2 Good!! Gotta keep in mind that this was made during the very early years of cinema and the cinematography was either of their own invention or a technique borrowed from fellow film pioneers. Bechdel test: 0/1 Did not pass. The only female character was Francis's romantic interest and her only role was to be the prize and the dame in distress. Did I enjoy it? 1/1 I sure did! Definitely recommend it!Do I ever want or need to see it again? Yes, I would want to watch again. Do I ever want or need to include it in my own collection? Yes, I own it happily.8/10 Bye love you -Jessie Carlson</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Star of the Silent Era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is among the greatest films of the silent era and one of the most influential films in the early years of the horror genre. This is due to a number of inspired elements.Firstly the highly expressive acting and excellent costume design. The film is able to effectively form an identity for each of the characters without the use of sound, and with limited screen time. This efficient character development is crucial to keeping the viewers invested in the film's excellent and mysterious plot.Secondly, and possibly most significantly, the set design and visual style. The sets are probably the quintessential example of the "German Expressionist" movement, and its use with the film is simply ingenious when put in context with the ending. The simple but highly effective use of different colour camera tints throughout the film also add to this film's individualistic style. The use of blue tints in night time scenes, pink tints in scenes with romantic undertones and so on is a brilliant example of the film makers taking advantage of every resource available to create atmosphere, tension and to convey character.Thirdly, the unbelievably effective story. I shall not spoil it here, but this film has one of the most legendary twist endings of all time. The genius of the ending is still powerful to this day and one can only imagine the impact it left on spellbound audiences in 1920. However the story prior to this twist is an effective mystery on its own. The films greatest strength in terms of its storytelling is how it is able to convey so much through its visuals. Be it through the actor's body language or the masterful set design, the film almost doesn't require the exposition provided by the title cards.In conclusion, I hold this film as a true gem of the silent era, and amongst the most important early horror films. Brilliant is an understatement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece; decades before its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago, I repeatedly watched, and was mesmerised by, a beat up, 51 minutes long, black-and-white copy of this on VHS. I must have watched it every day for a couple of weeks after I bought it, and never got tired of it. In around 2000, it was restored to its original 69-minutes long, colour-tinted state, and I've seen it several times in that form over the years as well, and cannot decide which version I prefer.The unrestored, "rough" cut, as I refer to it, is static-y and choppy, with some occasionally weird edits and cuts, which only gives the actors' erratic movements an even more odd impression, and it plays several of the scenes at double speed, which reduced the runtime dramatically-- verses the restored print with more fluidity, and less jerky edits, and shows the film at normal speed. The black-and-white version of the footage has an antique look to its photography, while the restored version's colour tinting gives each scene a different feel. The subtitles are more legible in the rough cut; but the restored version has the original, skewed titles, giving the film part of its weird charm, madhouse feel, like its titles were drawn by the asylum inmates shown at the end.I cannot imagine what audiences must have thought, way back in 1919, as they sat in darkened cinemas and watched this, and as they walked out when it was over, the effect it must have had on their minds. Ghostly looking makeup on the actors' faces. Jagged edges of buildings, walls, seemingly the Earth itself. It must have been disorienting to the audiences then, as disoriented as it must be to the young man in the lunatic asylum telling the story of the black-clad (a reference to Les vampires?) sleepwalker and Dr. Caligari himself.Decades before its time, I wonder if any of the cast and crew were alive to see the many ideas from this film were recycled by Hollywood?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the annual carnival in Holstenwall, Francis and Alan visit The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The other worldly doctor awakens the Somnambulist Cesare sleeping inside the cabinet who predicts the future. Cesare predicts that Alan will die before dawn, and he is found dead exactly as predicted. Francis suspects Cesare and Caligari. The next night, Cesare is about to kill Jane, but instead tries to kidnap her. Jane's father and servants awaken and rescue Jane. Francis pursues Dr. Caligari to a madhouse where he finds the truth.This is one weird film. It's an early black and white silent German expressionism film. The sets are using the slanted absurd perspective that early films use to denote psychological instability. It is very effective. The entire film has an unstable feel to it that isn't effectively done in modern movies. For an uniquely weird experience, I recommend checking this out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outdated but Still Worth the Effort (mostly)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS The movie starts out with a strange man talking about spirits to another. The second man, Francis, begins a story about his friend, Alan, and their mutual love interest, Jane. He says the two went off to a carnival where they encountered the horrifying Dr. Caligari and a man that had been asleep for 23 years. This man, was able to tell the future and predicted the death of Alan, Francis's friend. The death would come to pass. The small town became cloaked in anger and fear in its pursuit to find the killer. The whole town sought the murderer to the point of even falsely accusing one man. As the race to find the murderer sped on, the somnambulist struck again, this time at Jane. Jane ultimately escaped, but the suspicion of this Dr. Caligari grew. He explains how he grew suspicious of Dr. Caligari and went to investigate at a local insane asylum. He says with his cover blown, Dr. Caligari went insane. As Francis ends his tale, the audience learns that it is Francis himself that is in the asylum. The entire story is merely the raving of a lunatic.It took me some time to finely understand what was going on. Most interpretations focus on the Expressionist elements and the plot twist at the end. They don't address the man who was falsely accused of being responsible for the murders. This, and the fact that the silent movie intertitles are often hard to follow make it quite complex. I'm sure they made more sense to the audience at the time, accustomed to such a format, but to me it only made the whole scenario harder to fathom.I did like how the scenery, shadows, lens, and shadows were done. I can see how Tim Burton is described as a "modern German Expressionist". I also like the exploration of insanity. These two elements are something I'm quite fond of. That said, I can recommend this movie to historians or fans of zombie films, but it does take quite a bit of effort.I'm glad I got the chance to explore a unique take on filmmaking, but I wish it didn't take me over five hours for about 75 minutes of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First, the Ultimate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly a full century old but still more astounding, overwhelming AND scarier than 99,9% of all the other horror movies that ever got released or ever will get released in the future. "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is widely ? and righteously ? considered to be the first true horror movie and will always remain a role model, a landmark and a masterpiece to everyone that is even remotely fascinated by the genre. The film embodies the pure brilliance of German Expressionism, with decors, lighting and photography that are simultaneously mesmerizing and nightmarish. The plot, countless times imitated but rarely ever equaled, narrates the macabre fable of a vigorous madman that uses a minion to commit horrible crimes for him. The impressively charismatic and naturally frightening Dr. Caligari passes by the town of Holstenwall during the annual fair and exhibits Cesare, his supposedly clairvoyant somnambulist ? which is some kind of permanent sleepwalker. Cesare predicts that a spectator will only live until the next morning, so when his buddy Francis discovers his dead body at dawn, he's convinced that Dr. Caligari is responsible. While Francis attempts to get inside the Doctor's cabinet and investigate further, Cesare develops an interest for his beautiful fiancée Jane. Time for Dr. Caligari to flee, but when Francis pursues him he discovers Caligari's true identity as well as his fiendish intentions. This film is unsettling, disturbing and incredibly petrifying from start to finish and there are several aspects contributing to its immortal strength. The gloomy and depressing interbellum atmosphere, the extremely well-written screenplay (courtesy of Hans Janowitz), the haunting architecture as well as the different color shades and the dreamy musical guidance (the version I watched featured music by composer Rainer Viertelboeck). Last but certainly not least, there are the unforgettable and indescribably marvelous performances of both Werner Krauss (as the titular Dr.) and ? especially ? Conrad Veidt (as Cesare the somnambulist). With his performance, Werner Krauss single-handedly set the standards for cinematic mad scientists ever since, while the image of Conrad Veidt, with his dark eyes and penetrating stare, is still more fearsome killer in history. This is undoubtedly one of the most influential and fundamental movies ever accomplished and there's only one rating justified for a monument like this; an impeccable 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even the Scenery Has Gone Insane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" has an obvious, undeniable influence on those early American horror films. It is doubtlessly one of the earliest mad scientist films. Cesare the Somnambulist might be brought to life through the power of hypnotism but he acts much the same as Frankenstein's Monster. He walks stiffly through the German village, murdering innocents, all at the will of the mad doctor. Most famously, he even abducts a fair young maiden, carrying her off in his arms. I try to resist hyperbole but, forget it: The classic American horror films would not exist without this movie. The entire genre would have been irrevocably changed without it.Of course, the main influence "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" had on the word was in its production design. I don't know what precedence existed for horror in 1919, if any. Robert Wiene and his crew decided to make a movie that would frighten not through blatant shocks or big scares. Instead, every aspect of "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is design to put the audience off-balance. Every building and structure of the village setting is at an angle, curving or jutting out diagonally. Doors are twisted slots cut in bent walls. Homes and buildings seem to pile atop each other. Bridges twist up and around. Even the writing in the titles is bent and jagged. It creates a sense of a world out of order. Madness rules over all. Even the scenery has gone insane.My personal favorite sets are those that make the human form seem unnatural by association. The wrongfully accused man hugs his knees in his cone-shaped jail cell. The triangular room and cramped windows make him seem like a sprite trapped in a frame. Caligari flees down a winding mountain pathway, disappearing into the distance. A police office walks over a bridge, one that twists senselessly around the land. The doctor's office at the hospital is visually striking. A skeleton dangles from the wall, seeming out of place amidst the warped room. After his insanity grows, Caligari is framed by a pile of books, his face twitching into a mad grin. Silent films couldn't depend on dialogue. Instead, the themes of the story must manifest in the image. "Cabinet" succeeds fully at this.Does this ninety-three year old movie still retain any power to scare? The pacing is undeniably creaky. Most of the characters are little more then pawn pieces. Yet "Caligari" has an eerie horror atmosphere all its own. Most of this can be accredited to Conrad Veidt's performance as Cesare. The Somnambulist is a mime from hell. Every movement is calculated and controlled. He is less a human being and more a moving statue. His earliest appearances bring dread with them. The murder of Alan is still terrifying. Cesare's shadow is cast huge on the wall. The murderer descends on him, the victim powerlessly to fight him back. There's something deeply nightmarish about this sequence. It strikes a primal cord. Cesare walking up the slanted building, the innocent girl in his arms, might as well be the film's ascension in cinema history. Maybe scary isn't the right word but "Caligari" is still powerfully strange.The Expressionist movement produced many fantastic films. Yet Robert Wiene was not as good a filmmaker as F. W. Murnau or Paul Wegener. "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" comes to a screeching halt in the last fifteen minutes. The story of Cesare is resolved about an hour in. A very long epilogue follows. We learn the origin of Dr. Caligari, how he was once an administrator at an asylum who became obsessed with the pre-existing legend of Caligari. Determined to recreate the story, he went insane himself and was locked up in his asylum. This, in turn, is revealed to be nothing but a fantasy of the lead characters. Turns out, the whole movie was the deluded rambling of a crazy man. All of this is laid out for the audience in extended detail. It feels extraneous and only delays the inevitable twist.A film this surreal is obviously open to interpretation. It's easy to see the story of authority figures gone mad with power and murderers lurking among the populace as criticism of the rising Nazi regime. Maybe. Or perhaps it was merely an attempt to create a unique film. Success. The film's influence can be seen all over pop culture, from the films of Tim Burton down to the art styling's of Lady Gaga. A mostly unrelated remake, that maintained nothing but the twist ending, followed in 1962 and another, nearly shot-for-shot remake came in 2005. At least that one had the good sense to perfectly cast Doug Jones as Cesare. Neither matched the strength of the original, a true classic for all cinema, regardless of genre. Even if the ending is bogus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is mad? Who is sane?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The films starts with a flashback of Francis telling us a series of strange events that involves crime and madness. Dr. Caligari shows itself as a strange man that presents a show in a fair: he manipulates Cesare, a sleepwalker. But then there's a turn in the story that involves a paradox: Caligari works as a director in a psychiatric hospital, so how could he be mad or be the guilty for the murderers? This is the climax point in the film. Francis with help of the doctors try to discover in some books and a diary of Dr. Caligari his secret and dark intentions. Dr. Caligari is a man of science and he is interested in hypnosis. But as is usual in horror films, he is obsessed and want to take his experiments to other level. To prove that hypnosis really works and that a person can manipulate other's mind through this method till the point that the hypnotized will make things that consciously wouldn't do, Caligari wants Cesare to commit crimes.When Francis discovers all this he is taken for a fool. But as black cinema, it is not so clear which person is good or bad and which one is sane or mad. At the end, all this flashback was just Francis' fantasy, because he is enclosed in the hospital with Jane and Cesare (other patients). The whole film could be interpreted as a critic to the German government for committing crimes through the domination of the German people. And this is what happened some years later in the Second World War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic what is a Classic with great music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I've just watched the version of 1993 with music by Rainer Viertelboeck. The music makes it for me, very much so. I see from the credits that several versions have been done with different music. I must have seen the original in a silent version waaaaaaay back when. Aside from the obligatory bowin' and scrapin' demanded for anything arty and old, I doubt if I was particularly impressed. I am not that wild about German Expressionism per se although there was a time in my youth when it was one of my favorite flavors of art. Time passes and now it seems to me to be.. quaint. I like the music though. As a musician I suppose I relate more powerfully to music than to painting.. and this film is self consciously a reification of German Expressionist painting or perhaps the graphics of the period. As a target of the motifs of Viertelboeck's music the film works very well and gripped me unlike any previous versions I have watched.Now for the spoiler: of course, the protagonist is a loony. He's an inmate in a loony bin who suffers from paranoid delusions. He believes the head headshrinker is an evil goon named Dr Caligari who has a sort of zombie named Caesare who runs around stabbing people for him.But thats the twist ending. Very very ho hum by today's standards. And corny too. At the end the headshrinker says "now that I know what this fellows delusion is, I can cure him." The End. Nowadays as the camera fades towards black the good shrink would of course do something bizarre to let us know he really is the evil Caligari.. but back in the day.. 1921 afterall.. that's not how you ended films. I think if I edited the film I would simply leave off the final intertitle giving the shrink's little upbeat speech to leave a tiny bit of doubt in the viewer's mind. Oh, but that's just me.I rated this Classic What Is A Classic a full 10 marks. Mostly because I like how the old Expressionist film works so well with Rainer Viertelboeck's music. The music and the intertitles have a gorgeous beatnik-esque flavor that I really like. Engagingly retro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside Insanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the first true horror films, the story features the sinister Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) and his not-so-lovable sidekick, Cesare (Conrad Veidt), who sleepwalks a lot. The general consensus among early critics was that the film anticipated the rise of Hitler and fascism, with Caligari as a stand-in for Hitler, and the German people as sleepwalkers under his spell.The plot is traditional in construct with its narrative continuity, to keep audiences engaged. Yet, characters are placed in a distorted world of angular shapes, tilted lines, and dagger-like forms that are anything but traditional. These jarring Expressionistic visuals are wonderfully exaggerated, suggesting that story characters live in a nightmarish world of insanity from which they cannot escape.Though the cinematography is in B&amp;W, the copy I watched had a slight reddish-brown tint. Shadows combine with the visual angularity to magnify a sense of terror. The film's director uses the iris camera shot, which opens like an eye into a scene, then closes, then opens again to the next scene.Prod design and costumes are super drab and shabby, reflecting the extreme poverty of the era. Makeup is exaggerated. Casting is fine. Acting is what one would expect for the silent film era ... overly animated gestures and facial features; and Caligari walks around bug-eyed a lot, which to audiences, then, emphasized his evilness."The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari" is a complex silent film that pulls together story traditionalism with the distorted visual forms of avant-garde art. Consistent with this intellectual and artistic vision, the film reflects deep cultural themes and implicitly projects societal trends. Viewers may find the story a tad slow. I certainly could not identify with any of the strange characters. Yet it's a must-see film for anyone interested in film history. And those distorted visuals are mesmerizing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Deserves a Standing Ovation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this movie 3 times; the first 2 times I was sort of in a flux about, you know, getting in the field of it and its set pieces; everything was chiaroscuro and the shadows accompanied the mood of ambient lighting and it cast it through the dawn with a great amount of caliginous weight; the 2nd time I watched it I was hooked to the mystique of Caligari and how he operated the somnambulist to his own better advantage; his science attire and the scoffing and spiteful look cemented him as a great archetype of that particular sage scientist.Now the third time watching it, I am able to truly appreciate everything - now understanding the distortions of an out of body world, the movie was made for people who can accept the escape into a journey; you won't feel the experience jolt you but you do feel the static track intervening and forcing you to.The unconventional way Caligari presents his circus act was really the way the movie was drawn out - You can tell that with all the animation that feels in the background, this was a blueprint for the character.The plot centers around Hustenwell Circus; Werner Krauss plays Dr Caligari, the owner of a mystery and a clerk. He is a mountebank with this mystery. The narrative starts off on a wall where they talk about the 1100's of the myth of that time; story is to be viewed from a different period in our own minds - and god what a wonderful and joyous period is represented!His mystery is Cesare, the somnambulist, played by Conrad Vedit (who was also in "Casablanca"). A prophesy is he, he predicts death for Allen, a person who asked for his future to be told, and as opposed to telling him, he makes it. It's a brooding story, with shadows covering explicit death, and the culprit being the biggest twist of all time! The etymology of the word "twist" was slowly changed after this movie. The prestidigitation is staged in a slightly boring but as to deceive you in the later parts of the story that only stimulates Caligari's thirst for death. The shadows truly do interpolate the saturnine characters (if you mean everybody) who are barely developed, but all in all, shocking. It's all thespian and it must be looked at as a theater in production value; the isolated colour on Caligari (when it's all black and it isolates him in one part) is exciting and binding, keeping your attention on this very weird and disturbed individual.My favourite part is when Cesare conflicts with his love for a woman or subservience to his master; he is instructed to kill her, but he is in a state of love for her as a victim. Of course, she frets and he nearly has no choice but to capture her. The way he comes out of the coffin is really like how Dracula would come out of his coffin (the Christopher Lee Version).Bits can be dragged out, like when they nearly arrest a culprit who nearly ends up not being it; and the ending is threatening but it leaves nothing to the imagination.However, in a positive light, the startling effects of the walls, rule of thirds of the people and the objectifying feeling give it wonderful charm. There is not many movies like this and while it has influenced parts in Metropolis (1927) and certainly opened the bar for new ideas, there is definitely never going to be a movie (except Metropolis) that will ever quite match it (there are more majestic movie, but in the sense that anything will ever fully imitate, it remains inimitable).I'm aware that there is 2005 remake that I have yet to see; interestingly, I have heard that the backdrop to it is used but there is actually talking in it. This may be detrimental to it, though. But still the craftsmanship and the ghoulish mood make this a must for movie buffs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The avant-garde arts arrive to the movie screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wiene's 1920 classic is one of the main representatives of German Expressionism, a movement that revolutionized film-making, and has influenced many later masters of the world cinema. We see here a different type of cinema than we are used to, different even for the standards of the time. The relatively new medium is seen as a chance to present a work of art which does not try to imitate reality, but where reality is interpreted through the artistic models of the Expressionism. In order to antagonize Hollywood's hegemony, the art directors convinced the producers to realize a film which interpreted cinema as a new medium, where different artistic disciplines could converge, and not just a glorified narration, as it generally was customary across the ocean. The result is the depiction of a world of wonky houses, angled roads, and sinister characters, and the effect is beautiful, very expressive, full of symbols and allusions, and definitely a novelty for that period. The avant-garde arts had arrived to the movie screens too, in the end, and the results achieved here could not be ignored ever again.So strong was the impact this film had, on audience and insiders alike, that many later directors drew inspiration from Caligari for their work. Let's think about Hitchcock for instance, or Tim Burton, or the American Film Noir of the 40s and 50s, and also to all the other genres or directors who were inspired by Caligari's themes and visual mise-en-scene.The plot revolves around the figure of stage magician Dr Caligari, and his dreadful ever-sleeping slave, Cesare the Somnambulist. They arrive into town for the big exotic fair, and strange events start to happen; are they somehow connected to this?This film is bound to fill any theatre where it might be shown, counting hordes of supporters and lovers, and rightly so. It is silent cinema at its best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit I enjoyed this, and it is not something hard to admit. It's a treasure for it's time, but it doesn't really measure up to other movies of it's genre now a days. Without the comparison of it to others, it had everything that a silent film 'needs.' Actors whose expressions and body language correctly motivated the story and proper wording. I'd watch it again, no doubt about that. But silent films in general are hard to get used to. Yes, it had a twist ending, and I liked that very much about it. The part about it I liked the best was the make-up, wardrobe and scenery. It kept me interested and I kind of understood it better. I would suggest this to anyone who is iffy on the silent films, it's most definitely an achievement there. But films in general, it's not nearly the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a summation and comment on the details within The cabinet of Dr. Caligari</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cabinet of Dr. Caligari, a strange and incredibly ambiguous film, which in its awkwardness still captivates even the most stringent of theorists. The film is centered on the character "Francis" who begins the story by telling of a "strange" story, in a setting that is barren and shows a zombie like woman, this will prove important later. The story is told with a flashback. Apparently, Francis and the titles namesake Dr. Caligari had quite the enduring story. The young Francis tells of Dr. Caligari, and his somnambulist or a so- called zombie named Cesare. The plot is that of a horror and murderous rampage involving Dr. Caligari and his Somnambulist. The murders begin at a fairground that Francis and his friend both attend. The occurrence of murders begins with the town registrar who did not give Dr. Caligari the time of day, or was simply rude to him. The plot then thickens when Francis's friend while at Dr. Caligari's tent the next day asks the somnambulist Cesare when he will die. The response given by Cesare was less than savory for that of Francis's friend. Cesare tells that the man will be non-existent by dawn. What do you know; the man was found dead the next day. Then the plot takes a turn after the zombie Cesare cannot kill Francis's girlfriend due to her striking beauty. The now angered and frightened Francis is sure the odd Dr. was behind the murders, so he begins shadowing his movements, to find that he has been tricking him with a fake Cesare to occupy him while the real Cesare was out doing his dirty deeds. The tale then comes to a screeching halt when Cesare ends up dying and the once heroic figure Francis visits the Psychiatric ward to find that Dr. Caligari is the head Doctor of the ward. Then in a schismatic spin of events the story turns and in a scene where Francis and the man he began telling the story to walk through the Psych wards grounds to find Cesare, alive. This is quite interesting and then it hits you. The entire story came from the mind of a loony bin patient, or did it. This question will be on the minds of all who view it after the final scene portrays Dr. Caligari speaking of Francis's condition, then saying the words "I can cure him" all the while with a big horrific smile! The film itself stands alone in its uniqueness in that it tells both an inner narrative and a framing narrative. By inner narrative I illustrate that the main character, Francis, tells a story within the framework of the absolute moment taking place. Then the framing narrative constitutes as the main character using the story in past tense as if he is telling the story as if it has already happened, like a flashback. This technique is known as a frame story, the acting of a flashback to tell the story in post tense.This film also incorporates very intense and emotive "mise en scene" or its elements of visual style. The character's internal state of mind was captured in the scenes, and the themes became easier to detect as the film progressed. The wild and edgy set designs allows the viewers of the film to understand how warped and tangled the mind of the narrator really is, and low and behold in its concluding moments the audience finds out why all things are warped. The main reason being, other than the narrator being a patient in a psych ward could be a much deeper meaning, seeing as how in the final words portrayed on screen.The true aspect that sets this film apart from others is it depiction of horror, the grotesquely painted faces of Caligari and Cesare. Both made to look deathly and undeniably evil. The almost cartoon-like atmosphere created by the sets, in that they seem too warped to be real, and the fantasy world portrayed is indeed sensible, after witnessing the surprise ending.The looks of The cabinet of Dr. Caligari are not the only thing that sets it apart, the tension and juxtaposition of both the inner and framing narratives proves to be quite the plot twist, leaving the audience with wonderment and questions in mind, there's no doubt about that. I think the directors intended that though, for the audience to be unsure, as they were throughout the story, form beginning to end, and as well, uncomfortable. This film makes anyone who views it uncomfortable, whether it is the set design and its elaborate horror and fantasy theme, the odd and off-put zombie and his master, or the twist ending. This film makes you think, and not just of a "who done it" sense, but of more so a "why: sense- as in why did that happen. Basically the point I am trying to convey is that the "mise en scene" relies on making the audience uncomfortable.Simply put, the biggest draw of this film is its fantasy like world, and the fact that it is not realistic. It was groundbreaking as well, seeing as how it was supposedly the first "art film" and one of if not the first feature length film shot in a studio. One thing that is for sure, the film is creepy, intelligent, and quite inventive and unique. It's a must see and a truly entertaining piece of art and cinematic history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The expressionistic scenery allows characters to travel through geometric patterns. The odd characters play against this background, using a classic horror story plot. What, exactly, a somnambulist is is never made very clear. I assume he was just a man, who, through whatever methods Caligari used, could do the bidding of his master. Most of the time he is asleep but awakes, makes pronouncement, and does evil. Caligari treats him as a son. He balances his work at the university with the basest venue, the circus sideshow. The images are striking. The excessiveness of the acting in silent films might be amusing to us today, but my guess is the whole thing was terrifying. There are also twists and turns including quite a satisfying conclusion. I saw this film many years ago. This time I had a chance to watch it with a more critical eye. I was much more impressed. I plan on seeing it again soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>art and society are the cabinet of Dr. Caligari</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film in a world cinema class, I thought "Tim Burton could have made this film." I thought this was the inspiration for Edward Scissorhands - he is a Cesare-type. The film is a flashback starting at an asylum, taking place mostly at a carnival, then ends at the asylum. An inmate is telling his story to the doctor. Sometimes, it gets a little weird and it's hard to tell what just happened. I recommend watching it with friends that like movies that don't need everything spelled out from them - this film won't give you the clues you missed along the way. It's more philosophical, not a mystery. It's hard to say who is the monster in this film. All the audience knows for sure are the innocent - even some of them, like the townspeople, they don't seem really guilt-free. This is an essential piece of film. Granted, it was the mother of a genre and it's an excellent example of German Expressionism in film but that's not why it's still relevant to present day audience. All students of art (all mediums), culture (including history and philosophy), and psychology should watch this movie. The film is highly imaginative, original, provocative, and disturbing. From beginning to end, not matter how many times I've seen it since that day in class, I am tremble - not in fear so much as awe. This is the movie I would show the kids at Halloween and discuss with them when they got much older.</fullReview>

But unfortunately, the story take by the wrong turn. I think, that the story could win more profit.But, we remove all this... we are with a charming movie. "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" had great performances and a good stage. I love the stages (for example, Caesar in the roof) and i love the direction.The movie it is an indelible print of German expressionism. And we cannot compare this work with others of their same genre (like Nosferatu), because the horror presented in the movie is about all that happens around of Caligari. In this little town, there is a mystery, out there is a lunatic, a fair, and a man that keeps a secret that this awaiting being discovered.In spite of enumerated defects, i believe that it is a good work, full with flunk and it presents a creative story about madness, very different what we see us now.If you had any chance to see it, do it.*Sorry, for the mistakes... well if there any</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant visuals, decent story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From watching this film, there were two things that stuck- the plot and the visuals (seems a bit trite, but to clarify, I thought that the score, movement, etc. was not noteworthy). The plot was interesting though not particularly advanced, but it is far more interesting to know that the framing story was an addition later in the process that the two writers strongly objected to (sorry if this is redundant with another post). They claimed that it reversed the film's meaning- something good to look in to if you're curious afterward.The reason to see this film is simple: the visuals. Watching the sets was more than enough of an experience for me to focus on- the exaggeration and contortions of them are beautiful. What I couldn't get out of my mind as I watched it as the expressionist/horror film it is was how perfectly the genres compliment each other. Horror allows the expressionism to show, as horror is largely based on the manipulation of emotion ratherr than thought. Which brings me to what amazed me- they painted the shadows on the sets. This, I thought, transformed interesting visuals to something beautiful.As a final note: if you are interested in Tim Burton, see this film. There's no question in my mind that this vastly impacted his aesthetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring:Werner Krauss, Conrad Veidt, Friedrich Fehér, Lil Dagover, Hans Heinrich Von Twardowski, Rudolf Lettinger, Rudolf Klein, Hans Lanser, Henri Peters, Ludwig Rex and Elsa Wagner.Directed By:Robert Wiene.Review:This 1920 silent film as of this moment is the most oldest feature length movie i have ever seen. It stands out as one the most influential films of the "German Expressionist" and also one of the greatest Silent-Black &amp; White horror movies which it definitely is. It also is said to be the pioneer of the Twist Ending fashion in cinema. This movie starts with Francis telling a story to someone so it is a complete flashback movie. His story revolves around a creepy and mysterious Dr. Caligari played by Werner Krauss and his Sleepwalking faithful assistant as you may call him Cesare who indeed is quite weird and scary. Dr. Caligari builds a cabinet in a village fair but they are connected in a series of murders. Francis and his friend Alan visits the village carnival where they happen to see Dr. Caligari and the Somnambulist Cesare, they goes inside the shop or cabinet to ask him a question whom according to Dr can answer anything. Alan asks Cesare how long will he live, to which Cesare answers before the dawn of tomorrow which really does come true. Francis along with Alan's fiancé Jane tries to investigate Caligari and Cesare but Cesare kidnaps Jane. Caligari orders him to kill her but Cesare refuses to do it as he is captivated by her beauty even though he is being hypnotized. Cesare runs taking Jane with her which leads to a very lengthy chase scene, there is also a dummy of Cesare created by Caligari to distract Francis. Francis later discovers that Caligari is the director of a local insane asylum and with help of some people finds out that he is obsessed with the story of a monk called Caligari who in 1973, visited towns of Europe and with his Somnambulist used to murder people exactly like he did. Caligari later on reveals his mania after he sees dead Cesare and is imprisoned in his asylum but that is not the ending at all.Twist Ending: (SPOILER)*The twist ending shows us that all that flashback was actually his fantasy and that he with Jane and Cesare are all the inmates of the insane asylum and that man that he think is Caligari the asylum's doctor who finally reveals the source of Francis delusions and says he would now be able to cure it.*This was the third Silent-Black &amp; White movie after Nosferatu and Vampyr i saw as it was available to see. I was really excited to see it since it looked quite visually stunning and experimental for that era. It did impressed me quite so much by the whole look and the ending of course which just shocks you like so much and you don't expect movies of that time to do so. This definitely is the first true horror movie ever made. It scares you and leave you thinking about it will shocked at what just happened. This movie takes a little bit of time to actually develop and for you to actually get into it. But once the whole Dr. Caligari and Cesare thing starts, you sure are going to love the whole excitement of everything. It keeps you guessing so much at everything that is happening, you try to find all the answers of who and why is killing everyone, could this be because of Dr. Caligari or is Cesare doing it while Caligari not knowing anything or is it someone or something else.The whole look of the movie creates a quite terrifying imagery of something that you would expect a horror story teller scaring you out with a hundred years old horror story of a place far far away because everything in that village the whole place looks weird to you. It is storytelling at its best and a near perfect masterpiece. It is visually outstanding and tells you so much, one of the best use of visuals and storytelling that director really takes it along together. Every development of the movie holds while taking you to the perfect finale which leaves you stunned, it holds your attention and interest towards the end. It may start slow and kind of not very good but picks up fast. Everyone is was nice in the movie but the character of Caligari is just one to remember, the actor playing him really did a good job. It has really good score and music to it with just outstanding set design. Quite Scary and terrific entertainment.Rating:4.5/5A-Follow My Blog: HollywoodAndMe.Blogspot.com</fullReview>

I felt as if the city clerk had it coming · Caesar, able to predict the past and future, foretells of the untimely death for a town fair patron in a crowd of paying Caligari spectators. The patron, Mr. Alan, is found dead the next morning. Caligari is immediately suspect· Dr. Caligari and Caesar are eventually found out but the townsfolk just can't seem to keep the good Dr. Caligari out of business· The evil does live on in the picture; the ending defies a conventional finish· This film might be difficult for some younger viewers that are used to having mind-numbing Hollywood drivel force fed to them. It's a film that requires you to work a little bit, as it is a silent film· I would like to believe that the set design was produced out of sheer ingenuity and creativity opposed to simply being due to a lack of money · Mise en Scene: The Godfather of horror movies, Caligari should be required viewing for any serious film students. Additionally, two viewings would be recommended for a full appreciation of this film's genius. For lack of a better word, this film is flat out creepy· I would compare the musical accompaniment to: Tiny daggers being jabbed into my heart and veins. The set, apparently created entirely in an indoor studio, is haunting and also has a sharp dagger like quality to it· Caligari and Caesar are truly frightening at all times. For that matter, every character in this film behaved in an otherworldly dead-like manner · Contrasting shadows, interwoven with light and dark colors add a horror element. The bizarre set construction and lighting creates an uncomfortable other dimensional aura which is a constant assault on viewer senses· Colored lens tinting is used to convey additional feelings of fear, sadness, and excitement. Iris in-and-outs are used to move between scenes· Caligari is a textbook example of various components that can be used to create individualistic and creative artistic outputs</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is an early German Expressionist film in which the main character, Francis, recounts his experiences with Dr. Caligari and his pet somnambulist, Cesare. A series of murders occurs after Dr. Caligari and Cesare arrive at the village. An investigation seeks to discover the murderer, while Francis attempts to understand Dr. Caligari's history.The set design is excellent. Although all the unnatural sharp edges and distortions were awkward at first, they give the film an authentic comic book style. It also imbues a unique flavor that is responsible for much of its timelessness. The costume work is also great, especially on Cesare. His appearance reflects that of a puppet, which perfectly fits his role as a tool of Dr. Caligari. Dr. Caligari definitely embalms the image of a mad scientist, which grows as the film develops. The protagonist, Francis, has an basic image similar to Cesare, but smaller and more human. This sets up some interesting comparisons between the three central characters (although you could argue that Jane is a fourth major character). In short, each character is distinct and likable, and of course well acted.I would give The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari a nod over the obvious film to compare it to, Nosferatu. Both are excellent and should be seen by any movie buff, but Dr. Caligari offers more innovation and has a more satisfying conclusion. If your interested in film noir or older horror films, don't pass this one up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Wiene's 1920 film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is one of the prime examples of German expressionism in film. In the movie, a man who later we find it is Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss), expresses interest in showing off something of his at the local fair. We are shown the fair and Dr. Caligari later reveals that he has a 23 year old man who has been sleeping for 23 years, and tells the audience he is to awaken him. Additionally, his somnambulist Cesare (Conrad Veidt), can allegedly answer any question about the past, present or future. A man named Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski) asks how long he is to live, and Cesare tells him only until dawn of the next day. This prophecy is fulfilled and sets off a series of tangled events involving murder, kidnapping, and inmates of an insane asylum.The entire story is told in a flashback by Alan's friend Francis (Friedrich Feher), one of the first movies to be told using frame story. This becomes important as the final plot twist provides ample space for ambiguity in the storyteller's tale.The aforementioned German expressionism is prevalent through-out the film. Some theories suggest that because of Germany's lack of access to American films during World War I, the Germans developed their own unique style, clearly influenced by the works of expressionist painters. This comes through to us almost exclusively through the art direction. In fact, the art direction of the film was done by Hermann Warm, Walter Röhrig, and Walter Reimann, who were expressionist artists. The sets feature distorted and oddly angled buildings and shadows (which were actually painted shadows as it was cheaper than actually setting up the lighting) gloom ominously on the set. This is not done without reason, and was indeed done to show the manic states of one of the characters (exactly which remains ambiguous).Unfortunately, and despite making some masterpieces, many German expressionist filmmakers, including Wiene in this film, may not have lived up to the full potential of their ideas. While they missed out of American movies of the World War I era, filmmakers like D. W. Griffith were progressing film-making techniques. The shots in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari are mostly long and medium shots, with minimal use of close-ups. Additionally, the camera remains completely static the entire time. The expressionism comes solely out of the art direction, whereas camera movements and cuts could have expressed the same insanity in more cinematic terms. However, this expressionism is still seen today in cinema (likely influenced by films such as these), in films like those of Tim Burton.The screening I saw of the film featured a contemporary score. The score certainly helped in setting the mood for the film, and at times highly intensified the situation. I was slightly off- put however when the saxophone solos occurred. It seemed off in a way I can't personally fully explain. It exuded an odd feel for what was essentially a horror score, and gave off more of dystopian ambiance to me.Although the static camera will always represent a slightly missed chance, Robert Wiene's film is still considered a masterpiece and will always be a poster child for the German expressionism of the silent era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is, for me, a tale of two movies. On one hand, there's no denying the film's historical significance or amazing "look". Instead of going into detail on the film's historical significance, I think that simply stating the fact that The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a German horror film from 1920 pretty much sums it up. As for the "look" of the film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a beautiful nightmare. The twisted images are something to behold. It's like a work of art come to life. The sight of Conrad Veidt dressed in black, looking like a shadow that has taken on human characteristics, slinking down a hall on the way to his next victim is an image that stays with you. The set design is brilliant. The skewed shapes of ordinary objects like windows and doors and the use of paint to represent light and shadows is stunning. Filmmakers today could spend literally millions trying to create the "look" found in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and never achieve anything nearly as memorable.But, as I said, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is the tale of two movies. Once you get past the film's place in history and the stylized look, you're left with the plot. And this is where I have problems with the movie. As I've said any number of times, I ultimately watch movies for entertainment. It may seem shallow to some, but if I'm not entertained, I can't in good conscious rate a film highly just because of technical or some other achievement. As a vehicle for entertainment, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari let me down. I was never drawn into or felt engaged by the story. The plot is so overly simplistic that I found much of the goings on dull. Don't misunderstand. My problems with the film have nothing to do with it being a silent movie. It may sound cliché, but some of my favorite movies (The Unknown being at the top of the list) are silent. It's unfortunate that the plot of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is in no way as memorable as the "look" of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>German expressionist contribution to cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabinet of Dr.Caligari may be the first true horror film and it certainly influenced the film noir genre which was so vibrant in the 1940's when a number of German film-makers like Fritz Lang (who was originally slated to direct Caligari) ran away to the US and brought their visual techniques with them.I can imagine how frightening Caligari would've have been 87 years ago and no one would have considered the acting over the top. Caligari is not frightening for modern-day audiences and the acting especially by Dr.Caligari is quite unrealistic.What makes the film magnificent and unique are the wonderful set designs. The German film industry was quite poor and in order to make low cost films that looked visually good, they made sets out of paper. In Caligari, the visuals are quite eerie - stairs that twist and turn, crooked doors and windows etc. But they have a strange kind of artistic beauty to them. The opening and ending are more "realistic" and there is a reason why which you will understand when you see the whole film.The whole set idea was given to Wiene by Fritz Lang. I believe Kubrick was paying homage to Expressionism in some scenes of A Clockwork Orange with the unique visuals of the sets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenging and Difficult, Caligari is a Must See For Horror Fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the history of difficult and influential films, I think The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari may be one of the best. First of all, it's a silent film made in 1919, with a dramatic music score used to prompt emotions and inter-title cards to provide dialog and story points (remember, Alfred Hitchcock got his start in the movie business by designing title cards for silent films).There is no synchronized sound; combine that with heavy stage-like acting and a bizarre production design where it is almost impossible to find a right angle in the settings and when you do, they seem totally perverse in the world as presented in the story. The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari can be a challenge for modern audiences.So, tough nuts! Who told you liking films or learning film history would be easy? There are just some things you have to get through. The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari was a challenge to audiences in its own day and is a classic in world cinema and should be known by anyone who even remotely prides themselves on film knowledge. This film opened so many doors and inspired so many people over the years as the quintessential psychological horror film.Like it or not, had not director Robert Wiene and his cast and extraordinary crew of designers made this film, we would not have the Halloween series, the Friday The Thirteenth series, or for that matter the Alien series, most of Alfred Hitchcock including Psycho; all of Stephen King especially The Shining and many other milestones. These films might not be your cup of tea and their artistic merit is often questionable, but horror is a viable film genre and that mighty oak mostly sprang from this little silent German film.The last time I saw The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was when I was at Temple Film School in 1978 and that was on a scratchy black and white print which was all that was available at the time. Since then, the Criterion Collection have put together as good a restoration of the original in the hand tinted version as you're going to find. It is available on DVD with some interesting extras. I highly recommend renting it.So, how does a story of a murdering somnambulist ("sleepwalker") from the 19th century translate into the 21st century? Very well, I would say. I had to watch the film recently for this essay and I was astounded at how well it held up, and this is a silent film from 1919! It was exciting, thrilling, twisted and conveyed on the screen what remembered nightmares are like. They haunt you, but you are still afraid to talk about them, lest you be thought weird.Well, Director Robert Wiene and stars Werner Krauss and Conrad Veidt (who would later play Major Strasser in Casablanca) didn't worry about coming off as weird. Krauss plays the titular Dr. Caligari with such menace that in the scene where he applies to the town clerk for a permit to display his somnambulist Cesare (Conrad Veidt) at the town fair, the head clerk laughs before giving permission, Krauss gives him a look of such pure venom, that when the clerk is later found murdered, it really comes as no surprise. Plus it's interesting to note that the black streaks in Caligari's hair appear to have been made by the same grease paint that dominates the set.The basic story of The Cabinet Of Dr. Cabinet is that Dr. Caligari apparently travels from town to town with his somnambulist Cesare and while in those towns he lets loose Cesare, (perhaps his id?) and kills anyone who gets on his nerves. Nice work if you can get it. There does not appear to be any financial, romantic or vengeful motive for the mayhem. This lack of motive may be why the film has resonated so deeply for almost a century.This is why the film may have to be relegated to the level of a terrible dream wherein rationality and logic are thrown out the door and all we have are our dream friends and dream enemies and at least for me (somewhat repressed as I am, but I'm getting better) they generally stay pretty well contained. But, if ever I were to lose control and they were to become manifest; it would be a bad day for a lot of people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, as is understood by anybody who takes even a second to research it, is basically the height of German Expressionism. It is the base of the psyche, an insanity so removed one begins to wonder if the movie is about insanity or if the makers were just insane.A man tells his friend about the story of Dr. Caligari, a demented stranger who enters his town during a carnival with a somnambulist who can divinate the future. The story traces a murder mystery that treads down contemporarily familiar paths, but the sheer audacity of the sets, costuming, music, and acting makes every moment unpredictable and confusing.The only problem with this German silent great is that a few of the absolutely astounding sets are obviously stages. Otherwise this movie is perfect.And creepy. Boy is it creepy. The characters don't even look real in their shapes and contortions sometimes, more like ventriloquist dummies or marionettes, though who would ever make such marionettes would probably need to be hospitalized. The music itself is so creepy it could honestly stand alone without the image and some wouldn't even tell the difference. Actually, it's mostly through the music that we're able to even comprehend what's going on, such is the twisted reality of the world we see.This movie is right on the edge, and it seems any more added to it would have made it topple over. It's its own fine line between the abyss and security. A must for fans of the absurd.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people consider "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" the first horror movie ever made, and I don't feel tempted to debate that. It all begins when Alan and Jane go to a carnival. They go to Dr. Caligari's (Werner Krauss) booth. He has a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt), who can predict the future. His prediction that Alan will die proves accurate when the latter is found murdered.Who is the perpetrator is not the important point. The movie, incredible beyond anything imaginable, relies heavily on surrealism and the depths of the mind. It is one of the many great movies produced in Germany during that country's Weimar era. You will walk away from this movie questioning everything that you've ever known and ever been taught.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptional and influential silent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to write an essay on this (already had to do that at uni) but I had to express my love for this film. The visuals of it are amazing and really last with you long after you have finished watching it.The influences on the director and auteur Tim Burton is clear for all to see and even Alfred Hitchcock was quite heavily influenced by German Expressionism in the very early days of his Directorial career (just watch 'The Lodger' if you don't believe me).It is an extremely effective style of film - the lack of sound only heightens the excellent eeriness that is so carefully crafted and built up through the film. The narrative is almost unimportant next to the literal re-creation of the nightmare. This is not a positive viewpoint of the world - one scene that stayed with me (and comes back to me everyday as I climb up onto my awkwardly high stool)is the man who represents authority - I believe he is a clerk or something of the like - perched on this ridiculously tall stool. Authority is both mocked and represented as a scary, out of control, dark force (Dr Caligari for God's sake is the keeper in the asylum!) The ending is satisfyingly open to interpretation - something that contemporary films should take note of. It's always a disappointment to watch a fairly good horror film only to have it resolved in a clichéd, boring, predictable way. Some feel rushed into a cheese fest of a happy ending - that simply does no one any favours and is actually quite an insult to film goers.Anyway - enough rambling. If you are, in any way, wavering about whether or not to watch this film JUST WATCH IT! You have nothing to lose and an image of an original, influential, skewered POV of the world to gain at the very least.</fullReview>

Now it may seem a bit dated now a days but this is still a landmark film that deserves it's reputation of a classic horror film i have not yet seen the remake and don't know if i want too. The plot is actually kinda simple and you MUST PAY STRICT ATTENTION throughout this movie or you will get lost that's what happened to me the first time i watched it and after just finished watching it a few minutes ago i must say it's not overrated it deserves it's reputation as a classic horror movie the photography and cinematography are amazing and i was amazed throughout the film. the acting is excellent even if they don't speak any dialog at all. Werner Krauss is AMAZING here as Caligari and had me in complete awe just the way he looked and acted convinced me. Conrad Veidt is also astonishing as Cesare and actually gave me the creeps especially his eye. Friedrich Feher is great here as Francis and does a good job here. Lil Dagover is beautiful back in her day and delivers a fine performance. Overall this is a must see for classic or silent movies or even for history buffs ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great way to get into silent movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caligari was my introduction to silent movies, about 25 years ago, and I am grateful to it for that alone. It came near the beginning of the great tradition of German expressionist films that included several by Fritz Lang (Destiny, the Mabuse series, Metropolis), G.W. Pabst, Murnau and others. More has been written about this film than nearly any other movie, including works by critics Lotte Eisner, Mike Budd and the treatise by Kracauer (From Caligari to Hitler). Get a good DVD copy, now available from Image and Kino, to appreciate the art design, which is a key element of the film. Conrad Veidt is great as the sleepwalker Cesare, conveying his tortured existence through his eyes and hands. Friedrich Feyer as Francis conveys the right mixture of madness and innocence, as is the heroine, Lil Dagover. Werner Krauss is excellent both as Dr. Caligari and the asylum director. The framing story, which was added near the end of filming, provides a nice twist to the plot and gives added meaning to the actions and events of the main story. Silent movie fans, if they have not already seen it, should enjoy this, and it is a good introduction to the great silent films of Germany made in the 1920s. 9 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best way to prepare to watch this film: Turn off the lights, purge your mind of all your modern day expectations of what films are 'supposed' to be like, imagine you're sitting in a smoky movie house in 1919.The most effective aspect of this film is the way the construction and painting of the sets throws off the viewer's sense of perspective in almost every scene. The fair scene with the ramp leading up to the whirling carousel in the background is one of my favorites. The scene near the beginning where the storyteller pokes his head up towards the ray of sunlight coming through the window in the ceiling of his dark, cell-like room is another favorite. The scene in Jane's bedroom as the somnambulist enters the window and comes towards her is unbelievably cool to watch.The asylum scene with the patient who thinks she's a nun wandering around, the somnambulist leaning placidly against the wall, and Jane, lost in her delusions fascinates me too, even though the set is pretty straightforward there.Best of all, the film is silent. No inane dialogue, no wise-cracking tough guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silence is golden, and this is why. Who needs sound when Expressionism will suffice? CALIGARI is "pure cinema." The images are stark, sometimes abstract, the mood everything. The clichéd ending can be forgiven, given that this may be its first-ever use in film. Without a doubt, one of the most important films ever made, horror or no. Probably inspired more filmmakers than any other silent movie ever made. Even Alfred Hitchcock cited CALIGARI as an influence. And where would Tim Burton be without CALIGARI...? (It's been rumored that Burton is planning a remake; he alone of the contemporary crop has the potential to do it justice.) One of those truly timeless films that never seems to age.</fullReview>

Sure, it may be dated, but modern films can simply never re-create the eeriness and mood of this all time classic. The final twist may not have been in the writer's plans originally, but it makes you think about it all. The set is fantastic.

		<shortDescription>A colourful black and white picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the first expressionistic films of the '20s. You can easily call this the very first horror-film ever made as many 'stiff' creatures (similar to this one here) were introduced later. I personally think of Nosferatu, Frankenstein or Michael Myers: they all appeared to be dead. "Das kabinett des Doktor Caligari" is a story about a hypnotiser who commits murders through his somnambulistic helper; or at least that is what a few are willing to believe. This great film represents the confusion and chaos of Germany in those years and it is a pre-reflection of the even bigger disaster that was yet to come. After all, let's no forget: this picture was made two years after WWI and facing and even more terrifying WWII.I don't speak German, but still I understood every bit of the storyline. Maybe that's because the German language and the Dutch one are so similar to each other. That's right! I saw the original - (well, original? I'm not that old!) I saw the restored German version. The ONE AND ONLY you should see in order to fully respect a classic such as this. Not that an American or French (or any other) version is that bad. Far from it: this is still a silent film and there's absolutely no talking involved; so you'd hardly notice the difference in language. But I believe that the German version is the only one that takes you through the whole 81 minutes (which is long-lasting for that time being) where other countries cut out certain scenes. And I think that's disgraceful! The story of this silent film is good but the ending is outstanding. Just when you think that you've figured out the whole thing you are given a plot that is so unexpected that you want to see this film once more.The story might be great all right, but I was more impressed with the way this film was made. For example, the quite unusual headshots of some characters that got their spotlight-effect because director Robert Wiene uses their head as a focal point to call attention to the expressions on their face. Wiene also uses many fade-ins and fade-outs in his film. Sometimes a lot (not too many fortunately) on a short notice. But he doesn't JUST use a fade-out followed nicely by a fade-in. This happens of course, but Wiene also likes to play and therefore experiment with these kinds of 'camera effects.' At a certain moment in the film you can see how he fades out in the left angle of the screen while the fade-in has already begun in the opposite corner.Who would have expected to see colours in a film of 1920? You could describe this picture as the ABSOLUTE FIRST colour-film ever. In a awe-inspiring way we witness how sometimes colours are added to this picture. How blue stands for night and orange for daylight and the colour pink is only used once but in an overwhelming way considering the fact that we're still talking 1920. Nearly at the end we see how doktor Caligari is haunted by the words "Du mußt Caligari werden" appearing all over the screen. Again, considering what year this film was made in, this is (once more) a 'special effect' - way ahead of its time.Obviously, being a silent film: the live piano-music is indispensable. The acting is fabulous and especially Werner Krauss as Dr. Caligari and Conrad Veidt as the creature are excellent. Some years later we would see the same Conrad Veidt (only older and less stiff) in an even better film (probably the best film ever made): "Casablanca"! All in all, this is one of the best and most important silent films ever made. And although films in such particular genre are for the most part underrated: this picture has been a very important influence for the later horror-genre. However, few people know this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hesitant to view THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI for a long time for fear that I would be disappointed in it. Having seen METROPOLIS, NOSFERATU, and THE GOLEM, I sensed that CABINET would not stand up well to those, all classics of German cinema. Well, I was right, CABINET is not as good as any of those, but is still a very well-made film and is as stunning as it was in 1920.A man sitting in a park tells the story of Dr. Caligari and how he visited a small German village with the fair and terrorized the citizens of the city by sending out his somnambulist, Cesare, to kill people. As a German Expressionist work, CABINET delivers the goods when it comes to set design and plot. The set design for the film features flattened jagged buildings and weird angles galore. The plot, which isn't much, has a spectacular twist by the final 5 minutes and drives home the aura of insanity the movie contains.THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI does slow down to a crawl during the middle section of the film, but picks up during the final half is as breath-taking to look at the entire running time. Modern-day filmmakers should take a few hints from this film. I can only compare the work of Tim Burton to this film and even he is not as creative as CABINET. Recommended for those who are patient and appreciate the visual technique of filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who appreciates silent film and films in the Expressionist style(think FW Murnau), I simply love The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. True, to some people the acting may seem exaggerated and some of the movements stilted. However I felt these added well to the paranoid and sometimes weird(in a wonderfully strange way) atmosphere and also to the titular character psychopathic state of mind. Werner Krauss is the epitome of creepiness as Caligari and Conrad Veidt also makes a memorable impression. The story is interesting, and Robert Wiene directs beautifully. But it is the way it was made that makes The Cabinet of Dr Caligari so unique and a milestone of its genre. The scenery is appropriately sumptuous and their lopsidedness added further to the atmosphere, while the camera work, sometimes deliberately odd, is the best aspect. In conclusion, a great film and a milestone. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few movies are as memorable or as creative as "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari". The story is simple but expressive, the key characters are interesting and unusual, and the expressionistic sets are unforgettable. The story and imagery are quite thought-provoking in examining the connections between consciousness, perceptions, and reality. It's been a long time since anyone made a horror movie this worthwhile, despite the apparent advantages of more recent technologies.From the beginning, the imagery and settings create uncertainty and an expectation of the unusual. When Werner Krauss and Conrad Veidt appear, their strange characters do not disappoint the expectations that have been set. They convey more with their eyes and simple gestures than many actors could express with pages of dialogue. The story is generally interesting in its own right, but its real value is in the themes and ideas it suggests about the complexities of the mind. Likewise, the unusual sets are certainly interesting to look at, but what makes them stand out is the way that they complement the subject matter. This all-out expressionistic approach could easily have gone very wrong in lesser hands, but here it becomes an ideal way to set off the rest of the picture."The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" repays viewers who watch attentively, and who have an eye for subtlety, even more than most silent films do. Watched only for the story, it would still be good, and watched only to see the visuals, it would still be interesting. What makes this such a memorable classic, though, is the combination of the two, in which the whole is even greater than the sum of the parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first time I've sat and watched Caligari, I seem to have been waiting all my life to get round to this moment. And the answer is: The jury's out and they look like the twelve angry men - I'll have to see it again to maybe obtain a more considered view.The plot is threadbare, but the arty sets and thus the atmosphere of the piece keep it going for the (untinted) 66 minutes for me. I can't help it I'm afraid, Weimar German films are quite often an effort for me however worthy. "Pandora's Box" should have stayed closed, "Nosferatu" should have slid off the boat, and "The last laugh" was on me (although Jannings was superb), "Metropolis" was much better at 90 minutes short, and "The Threepenny Opera" was devastatingly depressing. I suppose all memorable one way or another though!After this I can see triangles everywhere (hardly any equilateral though), the living room door is a rhombus and various polyhedral shapes abound: the sole effect on me. However, the ending is satisfyingly terse and is worth the price of the DVD alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Strangest Movies of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the newly restored version of this old classic and my hats off to the preservation folks for an excellent job. I'm a tremendous fan of German Expressionist films and had never seen this, the granddaddy of them all. What a treat...the sets alone are worth the viewing. It also has a spooky little story to tell with a nifty twist ending. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is on every cinemaphile's "must see" checklist, and is well worth the rental even with its short running time of 67 minutes. Make certain that when you rent it you get the National Film Registry restoration copy, then sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The extremely high ratings on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, towards the 1920, silent classic, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is well warranted. This influential early film from Germany, is lucky to have made it through the Nazi Germany regime, and also still have impacts on horror movies today, one example being Shutter Island. The story is impeccably written and the acting, although dramatic, is really well done. Conrad Veidt, who would later become a star, played an amazing Frankenstein like performance, which was a decade before Boris Karloff's role. Vedit played Caesar, a sleep-walking somnambulist whose movements were ominous and creepily calculated. Werner Krauss, was menacing and exceptional as Dr. Caligari, an evil figure controlling his somnambulist to commit murders. It's best to watch this movie by paying attention throughout and to watch cold without research because it does present quite the twist. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, a little outdated to myself, is a must watch classic film (7/10) that is shown often in college film classes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It even contains a twist ending!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often this movie is touted as the first full length horror movie. Watching silent movies that are no slapstick comedies requires an effort for me and without the intertitles it would even be harder to follow. Despite its age the images were still pretty sharp. In silents the cast has to rely more on gestures and facial expressions to make the story work. The creepy faces of Dr. Caligari and sonambulist Cesare make this movie work very well. The plot is pretty simple and is explained into detail. Or at least that's what you as viewer think. At the end of the movie the viewer is surprised with a twist that I definitely didn't see coming. OK that questions the brilliance of newer horror working with this idea too. All in all for a first a very good effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*This is the first in an ongoing series of reviews I intend to write about the best of European cinema. I will be reviewing films in the order in which they were released.* The first thing that strikes one about Caligari is just how evolved cinema has already become by 1919. Not only is the film quite technically-sound but the so-called "grammar of cinema" has already matured to the point where many of the narrative conventions with which we are overtly familiar today are well and truly already in place.Most reviewers focus on the expressionistic sets and, rightly so, as they add to the feeling of the uncanny that permeates the story. Also of interest is the use of tinted film to convey atmosphere, a technique also used to great effect in Hitchcock's "The Lodger".The metaphor of the sleeping man who commits horrendous acts of murder is perhaps best read as a metaphor for the recent war: the German people, like the British, Austro-Hungarians and so on had seemingly been asleep to the potential for catastrophe and blindly walked into the horror. It is only now, with defeat and the fall of the Kaiser that they can awake and look back on the madness of those recent years and the deaths they individually and collective caused.Perhaps the end of the film, in which the Director hopes he can cure the protagonist, expresses a sense of optimism that the people and culture can now be cured from the madness and suffering of war.Alternatively, if one holds to the belief that the Director really is Caligari and the protagonist is sane, perhaps the text is a condemnation of those in power, specifically the Kaiser and his generals, as the real madmen of society.Overall, this is a fascinating film that reflects the impact of the War on German society. Let down only slightly by slow pacing in places it nevertheless remains a strong and eminently viewable piece today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really dug it. Putting aside all the inherent concerns with silent films, I, at once, both enjoyed watching it and appreciated its vast influence. Not just on Gothic auteurs like Burton, but also on pretty much every horror film of the past 80 years and every film with a twist ending. The style is simply fantastic. Wonderfully expressionist set design and a great use of makeup. Even the title cards added to the style, a refreshing change from other silent films I've seen. The narrative structure is incredibly influential and the brilliant twist at the end is even moreso. Also, the music, even though it was a modern addition, was quite bizarre and fit the film perfectly, even including sound effects. A true delight of a film and a must-see for anyone who loves dark, twisted, Gothic fantasy horrors, as I do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director: Robert Weine, Script: Hans Janowitz, Carl Mayer, Cast: Werner Krauss(Dr. Caligari), Fredrich Feher(Francis), Conrad Veidt(Casare), Lil Dagover(Jane Olsen), Hans Heinz von Twardowshi(Alan)Many people consider this to be the first horror film. I personally have heard about horror films going back to the 1900's. However, this is probably the first full length horror film. After the Great War(world war 1),a new style of film emerged in Germany called the expressionist film. Dr Caligari is the probably the first and one of the most famous of these films. The was the start of the golden age of horror. German made expressionist films where better than Hollywood made films of the time. Dr. Caligari is considered by many film buffs to be the most influential of all silent films. I have read somewhere that before Dr. Caligari, most films where made in a documentary style. Everything was depicted realistically. Dr Caligari was the first film to portray events and scenarios that are not real. That is how most films are made today.No doubt, world perception changed after the Great War. This distorted view is very evident in Dr. Caligari. This film has a surreal, psychedelic quality where everything seems sort of oblong and out of proportion. Dr.Caligari had a big influence on the films of F.W. Murnau (Nostferatu, Faust)and Fritz Lang (Metropolis,M)as well as the Universal Horrors of the 1930's such as James Whale's Frankenstein and The Mummy films. Its influence can also be seen in such films as Night of the Hunter. It is a fine example of fantastic cinema and a true film buffs film. Dr. Caligari along with Nosferatu should be in every horror fan collection. This is the history of horror!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>German silent horror at its best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of watching this silent film with a live orchestra at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Acts. The new score written by Ian Gardiner (which was also very good) was an ideal accompaniment to the film. Whilst not being as famous as the other great German silent horror film, Nosferatu, I feel that Dr. Caligari is much better. The thing that stood out most for me was the set used throughout the film. Impossible angles and uncomfortably small rooms (note Dr. Caligari's living quarters) lend an uneasy feeling throughout. I found myself concentrating on the backdrops rather than the characters at some points of the film, although Dr. Caligari himself must surely be one of the all-time greatest horror characters. It's a shame that most modern audiences will never watch this film with the same innocence as an audience of 1920 - today's horror films (bar notable exceptions such as Blair Witch and Ring) spend too little time on creating atmosphere, instead concentrating on poor special effects. Overall, an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit I think Caligari is a greater film than Nosferatu with better music (the old track with xylophone is a lot creepier than the '99 music), production design and a better story. But then: it is completely different subject matter and almost not comparable, apart from the fabulous expressionist sets and the fact that it's horror. It is a fantastic experience to see such a creepy story set in distinctive expressionist paintings. Not only the paint is done angular, also doors and windows and complete sceneries are BUILD in awkward angles. That is the most obvious feature of this film, although most admirers probably were inspired by the structure and the creepiness of the story. I was very impressed by both and it compelled me to see more silent movies. (BTW, was the cinematography done by Karl Freund or Willy Hameister?) Somehow the film also reminded me of Angel Heart (Parker, 1987) and Evil Dead 2 'Dead By Dawn' (Raimi, 1987).10 points out of 10 :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is historically important for many reasons. Themes that would become common in future horror movies found their influences here. The mad doctor is here, the zombie is here, the leaning over the bed of a damsel in distress is here, and on and on. The movie has a nightmarish quality based on the way it was filmed. Entirely filmed on small stages, it has the look of a stage production. The film was a great example of German expressionism, weird patterns painted on walls, almost amateurish ways of constructing sets, very distorted views of walls, doors and hills. It all makes the film look like a bad dream and it is a film you will probably look back on and wonder how much was real and how much are half-remembered pieces of nightmares you have had. The film does not hold up as scary or terrifying to modern audiences, but it is recommended for it's unusual look, historical importance and also for it's general strangeness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though this is a silent film, even though it's 81 years old, and even though it's hard to find copies of it, watching it is well worth the effort. 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' is in the same period and style (German expressionism) as the more famous original version of 'Nosferatu,' and if you liked 'Nosferatu,' see this. In my opinion, 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' is better. Watching this is an experience. The sets, the costumes, and the general macabre feeling create and add to an incredible world of fortune tellers, sleepwalkers, and lunatics, and you never see the unusual ending coming. This film's style has influenced many of the horror films which followed it, and other films besides - check out 'Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas' and you'll see that even a stop-motion film has been affected by the unique feel and design of 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.' It's atmospheric, it's creepy, and it's a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With expressionist set design of odd angles and shapes, Dr. Calligari is one of the most interesting looking films ever made, but that's about all it has going for it. The unique set design is enough to engage your attention for 5 minutes or so, but for the other 65 you will be all too aware of how horribly weak the plot is. It is 70 minutes long, but feels double.Watching a film like this will only be a pleasant experience for those who wish their art to lack subtlety. It is the artist saying, "Hey! Look at me!" as opposed to, "Hey! Look at my story." The set designs are no doubt meant to communicate what an odd world we live in, but in my eyes the murder mystery story of a sleepwalker who gets about killing people in the night probably would have sufficed for that purpose, without the need for the filmmakers to remind us it every frame.I've read the film has underlying political commentary that was relevant to the time it was made - but in my humble opinion - the best films are timeless, and can be enjoyed regardless of context. As I have little idea what the political situation was like in 1920 Germany, any commentary was lost on me, as it would all modern viewers who do not study history specific to that time. In other words: It has not aged well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari; or the birth of the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To watch "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" will mean more than just sitting do with some popcorn, a beer, and relaxing on the comfy chair. It is an experience. For a film that is 90-years old, it will mentally challenge, visually stun, and grossly entertain you for the mere 70-ish minutes that it lasts. The version watched, the "Special Collector's Edition" streamed, also provided with comic-styled flash cards that gave us this silent film's voice. Yet, with all this strength, the film isn't without its flaws. The brevity means quick segments, underdeveloped plot, and a twist that seems to come from left field. Watched within the availability of a group, there was decidedly a mixed feel about this film. Many enjoyed, and applauded, the German Expressionism used to create the world, as it has been eerily used time and time again in modern cinema (i.e. Tim Burton's "Batman"), yet others seemed to mock the unknown. They followed the film throughout the course, confused as to when it was going to wrap up, and when it did ? the ending seemed more rushed than surprising. While there were both applause and nays within the group, the one element that stood out ? which demonstrates the cinematic power of "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" ? is that they all wanted to see it again."Caligari" introduces a new viewer to the world of German Expressionism, and the creativity doesn't stop there. With bold, "Pee-Wee's Playhouse"-like doors, Burton-esquire buildings, and a dream-like town, director Robert Wiene (along with his set designer and cinematographer) was well beyond the 1900s. Their vision proved that dark can be fun, that the unknown will still scare, and the mind, well, it is a terrible thing to waste. Imagine watching this film in 1920, when the cinema was still an infant. The sheer horror that audiences would have felt ooze from the screen, it is dark, it is disturbing, and - even with standards today - it is scary. Audiences beware, this is no "Saw" or "Hostel", but the creativity behind this feature is stronger than these modern "classics". The argument could even be presented that if it weren't for this film, the horror genre wouldn't exist today. "Caligari" is that impressive. For those that haven't seen, be prepared.This film worked because of what our group was considerably mixed on, the unknown. For me, the uniqueness of the story allowed for depth and the macabre to soak through. Couple this with the visuals, and "Caligari" transforms into more than just pioneering cinema - it becomes a grandiose story that requires several viewings in darkened rooms. The cerebral nature keeps conversation flowing and that "unknown" that I have spoken of, strong. Yet, there is a fault with this film. While I praise the story, cinematography, and the twist; the development was a bit slow at times. Perhaps it is the fast-paced nature of today's movies, but the center of this film seemed to drag and push nowhere. The pacing begins strong, with an introduction into two stranded unknowns, but as the reveal occurs, one can find themselves dozing off - questioning the reason for one scene over the other (i.e. the entire wrong murder suspect). Yes, the value of those scenes do semi-make sense, but for a 70-ish minute long film, there were moments that were difficult to enjoy. Also, perhaps it is just this special edition, but the flash-card dialogue seemed a bit too uplifting for this film. Yes, they were easy to read, yes, the first couple were fun to see, but overall, the choice of these over your typical ones created a missing sense of dread. The dark elements seemed lighter, while the light elements seemed more positive than they should have been. If there were a fault with this film, it would be these small issues. I believe that the KINO edition perhaps does a stronger job with the flash-card issues.Due to the brevity of this film, I don't want to sound repetitive with the elements that I loved vs. those that I could have done without, so - to wrap this review up - here are two breathtaking, and innovative, scenes from this film that will go down in cinematic infamy. The use of "special effects" to show the insanity of the word "Caligari" thus into a surprising transformation. Unique for its time, it also showed that this film not only was bold visually, but also technically. The second scene that was favored was when our suspected murder walks away with our quintessential damsel in distress. The camera work, the artwork, the way the body looks real, but obviously isn't was planned precisely. These are two strong scenes from an already great film.Overall, despite my minor setbacks when watching this, I loved "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari". The visuals (again) were stunning, the story was breathtaking, and the originality of everyone involved far surpasses that of which is released today. The closest I could come to would be Terry Gilliam, old Tim Burton, or Fritz Lang (who was originally asked to direct this film). I suggest this to everyone, horror fanatics or not - this is just a great film and a strong piece of cinematic history.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A massive achievement for silent cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is one of the films that is often mentioned when it comes to German Expressionism, and the reason for that is simple - it's one of the best. Robert Wiene's horror classic epitomises the style of the era that it stems from, and takes in all of the classic elements including surreal sets, thick make-up for the actors and melodramatic performances all round. I wont be pretentious and say that this film hasn't aged, or that it can stand up against modern horror films on the same virtues; but in it's own way, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari has survived the test of time because the talent that it took to make it is still recognised today, and that is the reason that the film is still so highly revered. The plot follows a travelling fair man, Dr Caligari, and his somnambulist, Caesar. After asking Caesar how long he will live and being replied with 'until dawn', Alan is murdered and the somnambulist finds himself at the wrong end of the blame-stick. Taking Alan's wife Jane and running away, the somnambulist dies of exhaustion...but the story isn't over there, as the mystery of the doctor himself is still to be discovered! The sets used in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari are absolutely fabulous. Their lopsided appearance helps to give the film a dreamlike atmosphere, and this in turn helps the audience to buy into the movie because it allows the film to create it's own reality. I don't usually go into silent films expecting a story that will rival modern day films when it comes to plot twists or intricacies; but this film delivers even on that front! The twist to the story is really surprising, especially for the fact that variants of it are still being used today! This is where the brilliance of the film really shines through, as writers Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer created a story capable of today's audience all those years ago. It's really difficult to rate acting in silent films, as it's completely different to modern day acting; but it doesn't take a genius to work out that Werner Krauss' performance in the title role is worthy of praise. His screen presence is extraordinary, and he makes every scene that he's in. On the whole, this is one of the benchmarks of silent cinema - and if you're a film fan, you need to see The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</fullReview>

This is truly a ground breaking movie, not 'ground breaking' like a Bruckheimer film, but truly establishing a new medium.If you do not like subtitles, don't purchase/rent this movie. If you are expecting the movie cliché's of our time (romance, story book ending, attractive people wall to wall, over the top soundtrack/score, forced emotion, too many 'special effects') you will be disappointed. I never took a film course in college, but if I taught the class this would definitely be one of the movies I would profile, along with French Connection, The Godfather, The Exorcist, Metropolis, and Batman Forever (example of a truly bad film, which is ironic because Burton directed the first 2 Batman Films - thanks for nothing Joel Schmacher).</fullReview>

Not only is it a fascinating piece of film history, it's a creepily effective psychological horror movie with a twist I didn't see coming.This may be heresy--but I watched it through twice (on the Kino DVD): once with the original color tinting, and once with the color on my set turned off.

		<shortDescription>One of the most important films ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a shame that people dont take the time to check out classic masterpieces like this. A landmark film that helped pave the way for the horror movie genre this is a beautifully made intricate film filled with dream like expressionist imagery. To see this film is to see how extensively Hollywood has borrowed off the German expressionist era, tracing the roots of the conventions that we now associate with contempory horror movies such as Tim Burton's "Edward Scissor Hands". Its amazing how one film can construct such complex and intricate ideas laden through its simplistic narrative in just over an hour running time. If you like dark clever films that will make you think and that dont simplistically tie up its themes in a pretty bow for easy audiance consumption watch this film, rack your brain then watch it again and feel enlightened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched this again last night for probably the 15th or 16th time. It chills, it impresses, it gives you the shivers, it looks great, it has something new every time you see it. Yes, it might stand alone in its 'look' but that is part of its charm and why it has lasted so long. It even inspired heavy rock group Rainbow's 1983 video for Can't Let You Go ...! The film itself although a little primitive and artificial leaves you spellbound and I never get bored of it. Absolutely first class and a perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious creep show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who's really crazy -- the inmates in the insane asylum or the person who holds the keys? This extremely odd film addresses that question, probably considered outrageous at the time, about a doctor who acts out his hostility by keeping a sleepwalker in a casket -- only to send him out to kill people.The movie is long and drawn-out, with wildly abstract sets and an eerie score. I got tired of it many times but stuck with it because I heard it had an interesting ending. Werner Krauss is peculiar as the protagonist. Reading on Wikipedia that the actor was anti-Semitic makes him even more unpalatable. The other characters come across as somewhat cardboard, although the somnambulist (Conrad Veidt) does inspire several goose bumps. His characterization is the most intriguing thing about the film. The idea of a younger man being controlled by an older one for all of his 23 years, for use as a predatory alter-ego, is creepy for sure.The movie is somewhat pretentiously divided into six acts as if it were a classical drama or epic. Despite its many flaws I'm glad I persevered with this oddity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can be watched at 3-4x speed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the day when movies were new, you could film anything and people would watch it.Most movies you can speed up to 1.2x maybe 1.5x. This one was watchable at a whopping 3x-4x. You don't even have to be a fast reader! The actors pull faces and hardly move, which feels cartoonish. There are a couple of bits near the end where I slowed down to 2x but for the most part....Even at 4x speed not much happens.If you can't speed it up, prepare for a snore fest, a predictable plot and a twist that wasn't worth waiting for.The wacky cheaply made sets might pique your interest if you are into that sort of thing so I gave it an extra star for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Landmark and a Relic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Renowned today for kick-starting the expressionist era of post-war Germany, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is one of those films that would probably have long been forgotten were its reputation dependant upon storyline and acting alone. It is undoubtedly the stunning sets designed by Herman Warm that capture both the viewer's attention and imagination, with their claustrophobically tilting angles and distorted perspectives encapsulating the skewed perceptions of the madman who relates the tale of the sinister doctor. Director Weine makes imaginative use of a cramped stage, creating the feverish excitement and motion of a travelling fairground with just a couple of whirling tops in each corner of the screen and a dozen or so extras. Actor Werner Krauss essays a suitably creepy Dr. Caligari, and a young Conrad Veidt incorporates a darkly Gothic look as the somnambulist Cesare. The story drags a little by today's standards and the acting is strictly of the exaggerated gesture type, which can be a little distracting, but is to be expected of a film from this age. Surprisingly, given the influence of the German expressionist films of the 20s, there were only a handful of films that could convincingly be described as such. This is the granddaddy of them all and, as such, is worth a look by anyone interested in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DVD release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The DVD release is quite clean, and the musical score follows the action pretty well.Overall, the story is surprisingly catchy for a mute movie. The sets used for the movie are very original for the time: They are distorted in a manner that will remind of Beetlejuice, to exacerbate the strange mood of that story. I like the makeup, costumes and surrealistic props. The crowd scenes are well made for papier-mache sets. The colorization also enhances well the scenes to indicate transitions between night and day, inside and outside shots.Although I would not buy that DVD, it is interesting to watch, as it probably influenced other directors. It's also entertaining. I find it easier to watch than Metropolis, which is of worst DVD transfer quality, with a score that doesn't match as well and colorization that seems random and annoying. All libraries should carry it to educate people on the evolution of movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER BELOWThe twist ending in `Das Kabinett Des Doktor Caligari' impels the viewer to consider a great number of interpretations of the preceding narrative. One possibility is that Francis' story is an alibi concocted by his subconscious to free him from the guilt he felt after committing horrible crimes. The identities of the victims reveal Francis to be the most likely suspect; curiously, his story makes several different efforts to liberate him from suspicion. For instance, Francis promises Alan that no woman will affect their friendship. When Jane is attacked, only two people are awake: Cesare and Francis, who conveniently is shown to be spying on Dr. Caligari. I think it's also noteworthy that Cesare shares Francis' love for Jane, as well as his frustration at her unwillingness to acquiesce to his advances. Perhaps the relationship between Caligari and Cesare is a metaphor for the torment and self-loathing caused to Francis by his inability to control his own malicious impulses. Painting himself as a mere puppet, Francis frees himself from blame.Rating: 9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a dream painting by Dali...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much of Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari is an early vision of what later movies tried: picturing a psychoanalysis. Distorted scenery, a somnambulist sleeping in a coffin-like box, a terrifying evil man appearing and disappearing in the same postures before and after crimes are committed. The structure also follows that line. (spoiler)An happy man, his friend and soon a girlfriend too (and he manages to keep both). Then things get worse until he eventually finds himself alone in that world. Note that there was no flashback before the movie had to be passed by the censors, which I think would have increased that feeling of a dream turning into a nightmare.Bottom line: interesting, sure. But I am a lot more impressed by Fritz Lang's movies of that time (Der Müde Tod and especially Dr Mabuse der Spieler). Das Kabinett... benefits from a good storyline but it is not that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>allegory on the cutting room floor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caligari is perhaps the greatest of the German Expressionist films (though I'm partial to "Nosferatu" as well). One thing that is helpful in understanding the film is to know the background of the two writers, who were both veterans of the first World War looking to express their story through allegory. The surprise ending isn't the one originally scripted, and the writers were furious with it. I won't go into too much detail, since it's against the rules to spoil the ending, but I recommend fans of the film do a bit of research and decide for themselves what the ending change does to the film and its message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing, hasn't aged too well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I assume that "Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari", a movie under 80 minutes from 1920, would make actually more sense if you read the description of what it is in detail about before watching it. This, however, is not the purpose of a movie and if you do not understand really what is going on from the camera action and intertitles, then this cannot be described as a good movie.Well.. let's see. We have a man who presents a somnambulist named Cesare at a fair. In the same night several crimes happen, including murder. The film consists of 6 acts and the first problem is that the same action from the end of act 1 is repeated at the beginning of act 2. Why? Obviously Cesare is not only a somnambulist, but also a fortune teller, or I should say misfortune teller as he predicts that a man will get killed by sunrise. Which happens. The professor who presented Cesare is somehow creepy and funny in a strange way at the same time. Another problem I had with the film is the permanent overacting. Yes, there is no sound, but still it's not necessary at all to make the story heard. Anyway, the story goes on and people are seemingly constantly killed somewhere randomly.And then there is a guy who gets killed. But it seems he only wanted to frame the actual killer? So he is innocent, sort of. The somnambulist looks a bit like a thinner version of Frankenstein by the way. We see him approach a sleeping girl and he abducts her with a knife. But they manage to free her and she identifies Cesare as the one who did it. However, Cesare has been guarded and sleeping all the time, so it's impossible isn't it? Finally the action switches to an insane asylum and there is more to the professor it seems than we saw earlier as he seems to be the director. Anyway, it got way too confusing at this point to understand, so I won't even elaborate further. obviously the sleeping Cesare was just a dummy or so. And there is a love story and in the end thee is some kind of strange twist about who is actually insane and who isn't. Furthermore, we constantly see the people talking in this film, but there are just no intertitles to know what is going on or far too seldom. That is why I cannot recommend watching this movie at all. Just one final notion: Werner Krauss, the man who played Professor Caligari was only in his mid-30s at that point. Not unusual at all during the early 20th century that they did not cast old actors, but younger ones and made them look old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning achievement in expressionist filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best known films of the German Expressionist movement, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari continues to inspire and fascinate its audiences with its unsettling storyline, interesting characters, and most of all, its phenomenal production and set design by Alfred Kubin. Crooked, slanted, jagged, and twisted, the sets literally reinforce the tone of madness and nightmare and contribute to dozens of unforgettable images. But perhaps the most incredible legacy of Robert Wiene's towering film is the mind-boggling history of the Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer screenplay, which was based partly on an actual murder of a young woman at a fairground. It is worth the time of all fans of this film to read some of the amazing accounts of the production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic piece of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is yet another expressionistic masterpiece from the golden age of German cinema, when movie-making was still considered to be truly art in its purest form."Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari" is an quite odd looking but because of that also unique movie. It's expressionism at its very best. The sets are absolutely fascinating looking to say the least. The sets are shaped weirdly and because of that the movie gets perhaps a bit of a nightmarish feeling. For the fans of expressionistic cinema this is simply most definitely a must see.Another thing I absolutely love about this movie is the story. It's quite difficult to follow and understand at times and lots of it is left up to the viewers their own interpretation of the story and the ending in particular.The movie has a wonderful horror moody atmosphere that inspired many later movies from the '20's and '30's and maybe also even '40's of the last century. Before this movie many other short horror movies were made but this movie is widely considered to be the first feature length horror movie.The actors in the movie are quite charismatic. Werner Krauss as Dr. Caligari is really creepy at times, this is helped by his convincing looking make-up. He was only 35 during the making of this movie but the make-up makes him look like an 65 year old. Another charismatic character is played by Conrad Veidt who plays the somnambulist, Cesare. Veidt would also later play Major Strasser in the classic movie "Casablanca" from 1942.It's an odd and unusual looking movie but the sets and story successfully make this an unforgettable and highly influential, early horror movie, from the German expressionistic period of cinema.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Some great examples are Bruce Wayne becoming Batman and having a town such as Gotham City, plus odd and strange characters as Bettlejuice and Edward Scissorhands. Way before those 80's hits the expressionism started with The, Cabinet of Dr. Caligari you saw it all the skewed windows, odd shaped houses, odd facial expressions high chairs uncommon and way out of place.

This movie was one of the first real horror movies and is highly regarded in the genre.I recently watched it for the first time and had no idea of what to expect. It has very cool direction and I loved the sets of the movie. Overacting was a must in those movies to compensate for no sound, and I think the acting was superb. The overall story was boring to me, even 86 years ago I find it hard to believe this was considered creepy.If your like action and a bit of entertaining scenes when you watch a movie, then avoid this at all cost because its god awful boring. If you appreciate the classics and the art of film, then don't miss out on this?it's that simple 4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Pre-Everything That This Wonderfully Stylized Film Had Hardly Even a Way of Communicating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film tells the story of the deranged Dr. Caligari and his faithful sleepwalking Cesare, and their connection to a string of murders in a German mountain village.When I saw this in my cinema studies class, I gathered that many of my classmates were paying attention to the music, depending on it to indicate mood, as in change in key and tempo. It was, of course, not the same score played in the picture shows of 1919, but to them it also provided some sense of continuity, perhaps for me, too, as it was difficult to do so at such an early stage in narrative cinema without the use of cinematography and editing, both of which were extremely minimal. But as much as I admire someone's willingness to decipher a movie based on its music or other forms of film language, I think the audience should be able to produce meaning from it without straining. Even in the case of the most cerebral or complex films, it is something for which one should enjoy the challenge.Consequently, this is why silent films are obsolete. Some people still enjoy them because of their modern take on them, and some admire them, whether or not they honestly enjoy them, because of their historical importance. Nonetheless, I feel like silent films, especially one as early as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, had hardly even developed a distinct way of communicating.I am glad, for instance, that people in my class looked to other aspects of film language to grapple continuity, because in spite of the forces within a given shot, there is capricious transition from one shot to the next, and without the music, perhaps, one could be lost. One has to scramble to grasp the juxtaposing meaning of an image that follows another, the focal point of an image that is supposed to affect us.However, this is not to say that the content of the images doesn't fascinate. My hat is off to the Germans, who adopted their Expressionist style here as a means to differentiate their film, which they saw as a product, from the ocean that was the increasing import of American films. So they painted lights and shadows directly on the walls and floors and background canvases, and placed flat sets behind the over-theatrical actors.</fullReview>

However, the DVD version is no comparison. The colour tinting is terrible, the title cards are far too disjointed and slow to make any sense, and i don't know what happened to the soundtrack, but I almost walked out of the theatre. It was an experience that I did not enjoy, and watching it with my entire film class, I learned that everyone in the theatre, including those who had never seen it before, found the soundtrack quite awful. Do us a favour, and please release the VHS release onto DVD and keep the magic of Caligari as it was meant to be experienced.</fullReview>

I saw in a few times when lips would be moving and I would be waiting for the words to pop up but didn't.

This is a modern composition for the film by Dave Clarke, featuring synthesizers, a breathtaking vocal aria by Onalea Gilbertson, and a Theremin, which is an electronic musical instrument producing eerie warping tones, perfect for this setting. It is played by moving ones hands in the air between two antennae, controlling the pitch and volume. The device was invented by physicist Leonid Theremin in 1919 -- the same year the movie was filmed. A recording of Songs for Caligari, synchronized for the restored 1996 film, is available from the composer.

		<fullReview>This film is a must-see for lovers of silent cinema and is the first great film of the horror genre. That does not mean it was the first. While among the earliest horror tales, I say it is the first "great" one because it is a full-length film and has excellent production values. In fact, in many ways it's a wonderful film because it has such strange and over-the-top scenery representing the German Expressionist movement--with very surreal scenery and fantastic geometric designs. You just have to see it to believe it--it's that weird and original, plus it really adds to the dream-like quality of the film. Also, it rises to the level of greatness due to the fact that the film is not just a horror film but goes much deeper. I have always felt that great sci-fi or horror always has this greater depth and is usually a metaphor for modern life.The story is about the evil Dr. Caligari who is a traveling showman who uses his "somnambulist" (i.e., guy in a permanent sleepwalking state) to do his evil bidding. The account is given by a man who is trying to warn everyone about the doctor's evil plans. But, what more plot there is I will leave up to you so as not to spoil it.The only negative about the film at all is that it is a bit plodding here and there and the emotion is a little over-the-top even for the silent era. But, you also must understand that when the movie was being made in 1919-1920, this film STILL represented an improvement over the standard drama of the day and over-acting was more tolerable then than it is now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*I found The Cabinet Of Dr Caligari extremely interesting but virtually void of any entertainment value. I love watching movies that were made before World War 2 because i like seeing how they made films back then and also the acting. This didn't disappoint in that area but i found it really boring at times and hard to watch. It took all my powers of staying awake to erm ah er stay awake! Thank god it was only on for 51 minutes even though it seemed like 2 hours!The story is about a guy telling this other guy about why his girlfriend walks around like a ghost or something like that. He tells this guy about this other guy called Dr Caligari who has a sideshow with this other guy called Cesare with black eye make-up who sleeps a lot and can tell the future. He tells people they're going to die and then goes and kills them. Uh huh genius stuff going on here. I'll skip to the end. This guy telling the story is a patient at a mental institution and so is the guy listening and so is the doped up woman. If i interpret it right the story he was telling was all in his mind and took characters from real life and incorporated them in to his fantasy. And Dr Caligari is the head of this institution. It was kind of clever but at the end the Dr says "i know how to cure him now" and then it just ends. I was thinking "well i'm glad it's finished but how does he know how to cure the guy?".The ending is the best thing about this movie even though it was quite abrupt and it was still very interesting to watch. 4/10</fullReview>

I am sorry if I make people feel offended, but this is NOT a good movie, it's a good movie for the year 1920 and it must be treated as such.

I got a good laugh at the copying of the scenes, you have to have a careful eye to watch similar close-ups of the supposed Dr. Caligari. To some it up, great then, crap now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrible Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still do not understand how this awful film is listed among gems like Der Golem, Sunrise, Pandora's Box, Metropolis, Greed, Broken Blossoms, The Wedding March or Intolerance. First of all it's a particularly ugly film which set was painted by "artists" who were fifteen years late on cubism and fauvism. Unlike DER GOLEM, SUNRISE or VAMPYR it has terribly dated. The story is similar than Faust but without any depth or magic. It's nowhere as creepy as Vampyr or Nosferatu. The score is unbearable and some of the acting is ludicrous. Most of the people who defend this unwatchable film are trying to explain we have to reconsider it was made a long time ago. I still bet than when it was made some people thought it was incredibly silly, ugly and pretentious. Cinema is Cinema and not a mix of theatre and painting, Griffith, Lang, Murnau, Dreyer and Abel Gance understood it unlike Robert Wiene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, The (1919) *** 1/2 (out of 4) This horror classic from director Robert Wiene is the perfect example of what German Expressionist is all about. In the film, the evil Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) has his somnambulist (Conrad Veidt) carry out his evil doings while all of Germany is in fear of who this murderous creature is. The "story" to this film really isn't all that important because there's no question that the real highlight here is the terrific visuals that are on the screen. Those who have never witnessed what would become known as German Expressionism should certainly seek this picture out as it contains all the atmosphere, surreal visuals and at times creepy images that you'd need. It goes without saying but after watching this film you can clearly see the influence it would have on countless filmmakers going forward and not just the ones in Germany. Clearly this was an influence on the likes of Fritz Lang and you can't help but watch something like M or METROPOLIS and think that Lang was clearly inspired by the visuals here. I think there are some very powerful moments scattered throughout the film but one of the greatest happens early on at the fair when Caligari presents his "zombie" to the crowd. Just take a look at the terrific white face with black eye as it's in the forefront of some beautiful background images. The look of this creature is quite chilling and just see how the director films it and how important the background images are in bringing out the look of the creature. Another terrific moment happens towards the end of the movie once Caligari is locked up. I won't ruin what exactly happens but it's quite a treat visually. I think the best way to describe the images is that it almost feels and seems as if you're having a bad nightmare that you can't wake up from. Just looking at each scene it really does feel as if the director took hours setting them up and that you had to do everything right the first time or else the image would be lost. The bizarre sets, terrific use of tinting and the dreamlike nature really make this stand out. Krauss and especially Veidt are very memorable in their roles and there's no question that their performances help push the atmosphere even more. THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI isn't a perfect film as some of its story has become even weaker over time and there's no doubt that the film needs the viewer to pay 100% attention. With that said, anyone with a pulse should certainly check this film out at least once to see where an entire format changed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I would normally watch a Russian silent film as odd as this if it didn't feature in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically Francis (Friedrich Fehér) starts telling a story relating to his friend Alan (Hans Heinrich Von Twardowski) and his fiancée Jane Olsen (Lil Dagover). The story sees Francis and Alan going to a fair to see Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss), who exhibits the somnambulist (sleepwalker), Cesare (Conrad Veidt), who can predict the future. Alan asks how long he has to live, Cesare says until dawn, and the prophecy comes pass, Alan is murdered, with Cesare as the prime suspect. Cesare is on the run, creeps into Jane's bedroom, abducts her, runs from the townspeople, and dies of exhaustion. While (his "keeper") Dr. Caligari gets away, the police discover a dummy in the cabinet Cesare should be in, but Francis tracks the Doctor to a mental asylum. Supposedly Caligari is the madman who has created the sleepwalking monster, but in the end, it is in fact Francis revealed as the madman, believing Dr. Caligari is a madman from an older generation. Also starring Rudolf Lettinger as Dr. Olsen. Borrowing a lot from German expressionism, I can see that the use of the camera, face pulling, make-up effects and general weirdness caused sensation at the time of release. While they do look impressive, and I suppose make the film deserve five stars, it is very dated and a little laughable at times, but nevertheless, a must see horror. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, god, why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have one thing to say about this film: Germans shouldn't make movies. It was intriguing at first, but the charm quickly faded. By about the tenth iris fade between scenes, I was sick to my stomach. Then using the same technique to do closeups was about as impressive as a student film. I started to hate the movie moments after watching it, for its pretensions style. I'm sorry, I hate expressionism. It may work in painting, but it sure doesn't work for movies. Do you know why no other film looked like Caligari? Because it looked like donk!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bring on the remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps it is my own youthful arrogance that causes me to dismiss the early works of silent cinema with hardly a second thought, but making the excuse that filmmakers were simply "doing the best with the resources they had at the time" grows weak after a while, and delusions of art quickly drown in a sleepwalking haze. Coincidentally, that is what "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is about (I think): a puttering, squat man in creepy glasses unveils a somnambulist at a fair, who is also wired to murder at the good doctor's request. The imagery is slightly surreal, and the characters' exaggerated movements and facial expressions are typical of the increased film speed. The film is certainly artistic and unusual, but also bland, and lacking in characterization and dialog; too often the film rambles on without bothering to clue the audience in on what, exactly, is happening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll never see sombnabulist the same way again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly could not understand this movie, it seemed slow-paced and boring to me. Soon after a somnabulist in a fair predicts the death of a man a series of murders ensue. If you enjoy silent films then you should check out Caligari, otherwise I would reccomend you leave it alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Toilet of Dr. Calamari</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I arranged the reviews for this movie by rating, and got an interesting surprise: the lowest rating given by a reviewer to it at the time of writing was "4" stars. I hope after I give it its first "1" star review that Cesare won't come and cut my balls off!! This film is considered by most to be a "classic", a "masterpiece" and a great example of the art of "expressionism". I agree !! BUT ONLY if the English languages changes and they create a new dictionary in which "Classic" means "Primitive", "Masterpiece" means "Failed" and "Expressionism" is synonymous with "Hilarious".I sat through what seemed like 9 hours of stupidity, over-the-top acting and mind numbingly exaggerated facial expressions, holding myself from firing judgements before I see and comprehend the full work. This was a truly hard task, especially that I had to watch it on three parts on three different days because every time I ran the Kino DVD and watch for a while, I lost any desire to stay awake and fell asleep. I swear this did happen to me, not a figure of speech. And boy o boy was I rewarded at the end? That would be a "yes", if you consider a spit right into your eyeball by someone who has just eaten a chili-dog a "reward".Let me get to the point cause this thing does not deserve more time than I have already wasted on it. By the end of the film, I was left with no possible logical explanation for what might have took place. But reading the fans' comments, I found them to be under the impression that either of two scenarios could make a satisfactory explanation: 1) The Direcotr is in fact Caligari himself who is a murderer (or the mastermind behind Cesare's killings), and Francis is wrongfully incarcerated by the director to keep him from telling the truth.This is impossible and quite a dumb explanation indeed, because in that case there would still be other reliable people who have seen the respected director doing the sleep-walking show in the fair. This is in addition to the policemen who went into his tent and found the dummy placed in Cesare's box while the real Cesare was out killing. Did director put those witnesses and the police in the mad house too? Silly, ain't it? 2) The other explanation fans suggest is that Francis is insane, he did (or didn't, same thing) commit the crimes himself, and he has imagined the whole thing about the innocent director being Caligari the homicidal maniac. To support this explanation, they refer to how the settings and decor looked real only in the beginning (when Francis starts telling the story) and at the end (after he finishes it), while in between settings looked surreal and fantasied.This explanation is impossible too. If Francis was making it all up, then his story would have ended with something that happened to him that lead to the present situation (him in the mad house and the director free as a bird). For example his story would have ended with something like "and of course they took the director's word over mine and falsely accused me of being insane and here I am in the crazy house and no one listens to me". But how exactly would his story end with them finding out the truth and locking the director in the cell? What the hell is Francis doing in the mad house then? As for the settings being surreal in his story but realistic outside of it, this is simply a mass hallucination of some kind among viewers!! Right after they discovered the dummy and Francis went running after Caligari into the mad house, and while we were still watching the story from the madman's point of view, we see the mad house as real as it gets using exactly the same setting as used after Francis finishes his story and we are back to "real" world. And when Francis is restrained and locked into a cell at the end of the film, we are back to surreal settings/decor!!People are giving it high ratings for its historical and sentimental values, but a fair and subjective look would find it to be nothing more than a very tedious and boring work that does not make any sense. Some movies could still entertain you even after you put logic and meaningfulness to sleep, but this film fails on this level too, and for the life of me I could find absolutely no trace of the anti-authoritarianism theme allegedly hidden in it. Authoritarianism in Germany one year following its defeat in WW1? Wow!! I've seen die-hard movie fans go too far before, but never as far as to write a new history that fits their wishful thinking just to claim the superiority of a movie!!</fullReview>
