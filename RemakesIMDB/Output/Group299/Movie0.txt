		<shortDescription>A sweet little film ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...that makes a sharp turn in the first 30 minutes or so that takes it in a completely different direction from where it was headed when it started.The film starts with four con artists played by Chester Morris, Sylvia Sydney, Ned Sparks, and John Wray, on the make for some extra money in the big city with some well choreographed scams. What causes all of the trouble is that a tavern owner, Nikko, who is in on one of the scams - played by Boris Karloff of all people - has eyes for the girl in the group, Helen. Rather than send flowers, Nikko shows his affection by looking through a keyhole when Helen undresses. This naturally upsets her boyfriend and fellow grifter, Doc Madison (Chester Morris). Doc is given to extreme reactions and shows his displeasure with Nikko by dropping him several stories from the banister of the boarding house where the grifters live.Doc beats it out of town to avoid the police until the heat is off, and while he is on the lam in a rural town he discovers that the town has a faith healer known only as "the Patriarch" (Hobart Bosworth). The Patriarch is so reliable at healing that the town doesn't even have a doctor. Doc, always the entrepreneur, sees in this set up an opportunity for a profitable scam. Doc summons his gang to the small seaside town to help him. Just to make sure that the Patriarch is known far and wide as a faith healer, Doc decides to stage a miracle with the most visual of results - someone being healed of tuberculosis won't do. He decides to have fellow grifter "The Frog" (John Wray) "unwind" as a result of the Patriarch's power. The Frog has the ability to contort his body such that he looks like a hopeless cripple, which was a useful part of the group's scams back in the city. Likewise at the end of a hard day of scamming, he does the process in reverse by "unwinding". This trick is what made Lon Chaney famous in the lost 1919 film.Everything works out as Doc planned up to a point, but an extra miracle occurs at the time the Frog unwinds - one that rivals the Frog's unwinding in visual strength - that makes it clear to the grifters that the Patriarch indeed has real power. How will this effect the grifters' plan to cash in? Watch and find out.This film has some beautful seascape scenes, particularly those of the Patriarch as he goes off to meditate. It also has some interesting things to say about the ability of people to change, although I thought the transitions in some of the characters was somewhat abrupt. Hobart Bosworth is very good as the Patriarch and he is very effective at conveying deep faith and tranquility although he has few lines. Bosworth was probably quite good at this role because he had been a star of the silent screen and thus knew how to convey emotion without dialogue. Of course, Morris is always good as the angry bad guy and Ned Sparks is always good with the smart remarks.At the time of its release this film was a failure at the box office, probably because it starts out like a gangster film and turns into something quite different very quickly. I found it rather uplifting with good performances by some of my favorite pre code performers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offbeat Casting That Works !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Miracle Man is a hokey, overdone Paramount remake of a 1919 hit Starring Lon Chaney that is somehow oddly compelling. It is about a gang of crooks who think they have stumbled onto the mother lode of con games in the persona of a faith healer who is oblivious to their scheme. The movie picks up steam as it goes along and becomes absorbing and hypnotic,and the gang members outdo themselves in the acting department.I have not seen the original 1919 version of this film but John Wray, who plays the deformed 'Frog',gives what has to be the performance of his career. He was mostly a character actor and bit player but here generates what ought to have been at least a Supporting Actor award nomination (there were no supporting awards until 1936). And deadpan comic Ned Sparks? here he plays it straight and is very convincing - I can't recall him in a more prominent role. Usually he could be seen in snatches of one picture or another. Sylvia Sidney carries the load in the acting department with a performance that is both sympathetic and heartfelt. Hobart Bosworth plays the Patriarch and has little to do but to gaze heavenward and look enrapt.I would imagine this film is not for all tastes but if you have a chance it is well worth your while even if you are not religious. I saw this film at a film festival in Rome, N.Y. in 35MM, in a print restored by the UCLA Film Dept. It reinforces my opinion that the only way to see most films is in this format, in which the figures are bigger than life. That is the way movies were meant to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BORIS KARLOFF IS A TAVERN OWNER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a great classic and a play by George M. Cohan(creator of "Yankee Doodle Dandy") Three big city gangsters led by John Madison (Chester Morris)(Played Boston Blackie in the 1940's) has his headquarters in a Chinese tavern owned by Nikko(Boris Karloff) and he receives a percentage. The other members of the gang are The Frog(John Wray),a fake cripple, and Helen Smith(Sylvia Sidney(Fantasy Island '98 TV Series), Madison's girl. Nikko tries to win the heart and affection of Helen, Madison's girl and almost gets killed. The gangsters perform fake Miracle's and causes many problems. The film was a remake of a 1919 silent film. It is very well produced. There is a scene where real handicapped people are really cured which turns this film into a great old time classic, with Karloff playing a different role than the Frankenstein Monster in 1931.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Wray and Boris Karloff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1932's "The Miracle Man," a remake of the lost 1919 silent that made a star of Lon Chaney, should be better remembered than it is. John Wray admirably fills the role of Chaney's phony cripple 'The Frog,' and Boris Karloff, still a supporting player in the brief six month period after "Frankenstein," adds to its position as a pre-code Hollywood curio (Boris would never return to Paramount, which did very few horror films). Chester Morris, Ned Sparks, and Sylvia Sidney round out the quartet of confidence tricksters who get more than they bargained for when they take on 'The Patriarch' (Hobart Bosworth), alias 'The Miracle Man.' John Wray was enjoying one of his most prominent seasons, with memorable turns in both "Doctor X" and "The Death Kiss." As for Karloff, he only features in the opening reel, playing Chinatown tavern owner Nikko, slight Oriental accent not unlike his Chinese general in 1937's "West of Shanghai," whose lecherous designs on Sylvia Sidney are not reciprocated. Rather than accept his usual cut from Morris, he chooses to spy on the undressing girl through a convenient keyhole, earning him a well deserved fall from grace. Following "Business and Pleasure" and "Night World," Karloff's star status at Universal would be solidified by "The Old Dark House," with genre vehicles thereafter prepared especially for him.</fullReview>
