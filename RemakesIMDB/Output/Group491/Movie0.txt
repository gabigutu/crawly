		<shortDescription>Prime example of Italian horror, superbly captured on a widescreen DVD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a favorite example of Italian horror cinema, filled with the trademark qualities that have impressed genre-film afficionados for the last half century. It compares favorably with the highly-regarded, Mario Bava classic, BLACK SUNDAY, and features another major appearance by the mysterious beauty, Barbara Steele. The black-and-white cinematography and production design are nicely realized, and an appropriate atmosphere of menace and sexuality is skillfully delivered. All in all, this is a prime example of why Italian horror cinema deserves some appreciation. The music is by Riz Ortolani (of MONDO CANE fame). A very nice DVD from Synapse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Italian horror films of the 60's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two men(one being Edgar Allen Poe) in an English pub have drinks with a man eager to earn some quick money.He is dared to spend the night in a haunted house for a quite tidy sum.The catch is the dead of this particular house rise this very night.Previous people that have taken the dare didn't survive. The man takes the dare in spite of the warning.Once inside the tension begins to rise as the man is joined by previous occupants of the house.He is forced to watch their very own violent deaths as they are repeated this particular night every year.The ghosts then try to lure the young man into joining them,even the ghost(Barbara Steele) who has fallen in love with him.Will he survive to see the dawn?This is a very well made film.The scares are frequent and you actually care about several of the characters,ghosts included. The house/castle is grim and foreboding.The photography is great and Ms Steele never looked lovelier.The ending is a real twist that you won't see coming.Give this one an 8!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well executed old and very dark house horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well executed old and very dark house horror. Good set-up which includes the character of Poe, himself, alluding to the story in a London pub. Although from here it is pretty much the one guy who has taken the dare to visit the house on a particular night running from room to room either looking for or avoiding people, it is still most enjoyable. Plus we have the delightful and enigmatic Barbara Steele. There is some wooden dialogue and some unexplained bits and bobs but it is the super creepy atmosphere that is maintained throughout, that and the super musical score that keep this one moving nicely along. DVD originates from US and has a few extras</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Brilliant Gothic Tale With Steele</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antonio Margheriti's "Danza Macabra" aka. "Castle Of Blood" of 1964 is a beautiful and incredibly haunting masterpiece of Italian Gothic Horror, and after Mario Bava's "La Maschera Del Demonio" (aka. "Black Sunday") of 1960 and Roger Corman's "Pit And The Pendulum" of 1961 (starring the great Vincent Price) another must-see that earned the wonderful Barbara Steele her more than deserved fame as the most important female Horror icon in the history of motion pictures. But not only is the beautiful and brilliant Barbara Steele one of my favorite actresses of all-time, the screenplay to "Danza Macabra" was co-written by no one less than the cinematic genius Sergio Corbucci, who directed such ingenious Spaghetti Western milestones as "Django" (1966) and "The Great Silence" (1968). Italy's number 2 in the field (right after Mario Bava), Director Antonio Margheriti is one of the all-time masters of Gothic Horror, and "Castle of Blood" is doubtlessly his greatest achievement. Hardly another film works so brilliantly in creating an incredibly haunting, yet beautiful atmosphere as it is the case with this creepy masterpiece. When he encounters the famous writer of brilliant macabre stories, Edgar Allen Poe, in a gloomy London tavern, young journalist Alan Foster (Georges Rivi?re) accepts a bet from a nobleman, that he can not spend a night in his haunted castle in the night of all souls' eve. As soon as Foster enters the eerie castle, mysterious things start to happen. After a little while, however, he encounters an enchanting resident of the castle, the stunningly beautiful Elisabeth Blackwood (Barbara Steele). The mysterious events so far, however, have only been forebodings of the terrors the castle bears, however...The eerie castle setting alone would be sufficient to create a gloomy mood, the excellent black and white cinematography and a great score by Riz Ortolani create an incredibly haunting atmosphere that is eerie beyond comparison. The wonderful Barbara Steele is fantastic as always, I simply can not find enough words to praise this wonderful actress. No other actress has ever been capable of uniting ravishing beauty with the uncanny as it is the case with Steele, and no actress ever will. Besides Steele, the movie's cast contains another stunning beauty, Margarete Robsahm, and she also delivers a great performance. George Rivi?re's performance as Alan Foster is great, and the rest of the performances are also very good. "Castle of Blood" is outstanding in many departments: Barbara Steele Delivers one of her best performances, the cinematography and locations are beautifully haunting beyond comparison, the atmosphere is incredibly eerie... The film simply is a perfect whole of atmosphere, Gothic beauty and the art of terror. In short: "Castle of Blood" is one of the most atmospheric and greatest Gothic Horror films ever made, and must not be missed by anyone interested in the genre! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CASTLE OF BLOOD (1964) - Synapse DVD Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the start of this week, I received Antonio Margheriti's Gothic horror classic LA DANZA MACABRA (1964), courtesy of Synapse Film's DVD entitled CASTLE OF BLOOD, and I ended up watching it on Christmas Day! This was only my fourth film from this Euro-Cult director, who passed away only too recently; the others - KILLER FISH (1978), THE ARK OF THE SUN GOD (1982; aka: HUNTERS OF THE GOLDEN COBRA) and TORNADO (1983) - are hardly anything to brag about and, in any case, this was eons ago so it's as if CASTLE OF BLOOD was my introduction proper to Margheriti's work.After having read a number of mixed reviews (including Brian Lindsey's on the Eccentric Cinema website), I did not quite know what to expect but I must say that I was genuinely surprised by this film for I liked it a lot. I may cause a stir here but I would take CASTLE OF BLOOD over most of Argento's films, though that doesn't mean that I think Margheriti is a better director.The premise is hardly an original one and the pace is quite slow at times, but my attention was held throughout the film's entire duration. The opening sequence in a tavern reminded me of a similar scene in Jean Epstein's silent version of THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER (1928). Two other scenes later on were also reminiscent of THE CITY OF THE DEAD (1960): the ballroom crowd materializing out of nowhere, and the famous scene where a snake is decapitated is similar in a way to Christopher Lee's ritual killing of a parrot in the earlier film. Also, when the muscle-bound gardener attacks the newly-wed in her room, we are reminded of a similar scene between Boris Karloff and Mae Clarke in FRANKENSTEIN (1931). Then again, CASTLE OF BLOOD looks forward to THE ASPHYX (1972) in their common argument about a person or thing not giving up on life unless he or it is prepared to die.The film evokes a great atmosphere, considering that budget and shooting schedule must have been pretty tight: smooth and interesting camera-work (particularly some tilted shots used for disorienting effect), expressive shadowy lighting and the expansive yet claustrophobic sets, all of which are beautifully complemented by a fine and eclectic score by Riz Ortolani.There are several other qualities that elevate the film rightfully to its renowned place in the pantheon of Italian horror, not least of all is the presence of two highly attractive ladies - Barbara Steele and Margarete Robsahm. Steele effectively alternates between vulnerability and aggressiveness - thus building upon her dual roles in BLACK Sunday (1960) - by giving her character a sense of inner conflict (her willingness to die at the end rather than have to repeat the castle's 'night of terror' ordeal over and over), though her thunder here is often stolen by Robsahm who manages an admirable subtlety in her (relatively) brief and enigmatic appearance. Arturo Dominici, as well, is suitably imposing as the helpful but wily Dr. Carmus. Another noteworthy aspect is the film's portrayal of a world-weary Edgar Allan Poe in the guise of Silvano Tranquilli, who captures the famed but tormented writer's essence quite well (even with his limited screentime). Often missing in previous versions of the film is the lesbian subtext - introduced rather too abruptly into the story, but sensitively handled by the two actresses (especially in view of its shooting conditions!). On the other hand, a couple of gratuitous topless shots add nothing to the film and could easily have been avoided (though it appears these were intended for Continental versions only, much like the unnecessary striptease sequence in DEVIL DOLL [1964]). I am also baffled by a couple of other points: what exactly did Elizabeth die of? We see the gardener stab her, but at the end of the film she perishes beside her own grave in the cemetery! And can anyone explain those hanging bodies which Alan Foster (Georges Riviere's character) passes by immediately afterwards, as he stumbles outside the castle grounds?Where the film comes up short is in the stilted dialogue of the romantic interludes - if the Barbara Steele/John Richardson relationship in BLACK Sunday comes off as unconvincing, what about the Steele/Riviere match here? In fact, both young male leads are a detriment to the film: the he-man gardener character, especially, is laughable and breaks the mood of the piece, taking one out of the picture! Apart from this, couldn't they have picked one of the women to 'vampirize' successive victims?!Among the film's highlights are: the snake scene I mentioned earlier, which is genuinely skin-crawling; another uncomfortable moment is when the rotting corpse in the castle's cellar starts to move (who exactly is he?); the re-enactment of the murders, and the way it vividly captures Foster's desperation at his failure to stop them at every turn, not quite believing that what he is watching has already happened; the blood-craving ghosts' attack on Foster at the end, which reaches a fine pitch of frenzy before he is led to safety by Elizabeth - and to what he believes is freedom; Foster's violent death scene, then, is quite stunning - worthy of Bava or Argento at their best.As for the DVD presentation, I thought the Picture Quality neither better nor worse than expected; it was quite pleasant, in fact. Audio Quality, on the other hand, was pretty bad: distorted at first, then settling down to a fair Mono, which is disrupted on occasion by a weird and rather distracting hum on the soundtrack (as in the SON OF Dracula [1943] DVD from Universal). Extras are slight for this release, but well done nonetheless (especially Tim Lucas's typically enthusiastic and informative liner notes).Also, I did not find the English dubbing all that annoying this time around, and the transition between languages was smoothly handled overall. I was not so unprepared to this eventuality, however: I already have Max Ophuls' celebrated final film, LOLA MONTES (1955) - or rather a badly-cut version of it - on VHS (taped off Italian TV), which is presented in a similar - indeed, far more ragged - patchwork state, alternating between French (with Italian subtitles) and Italian dialogue; and the version of Jacques Tourneur's classic film noir OUT OF THE PAST (1947) that is always shown on Italian TV, also goes abruptly from the Italian dubbing to the original English dialogue! Anyway, the restored bits of dialogue in CASTLE OF BLOOD add some depth to the characters, so we must be thankful that these have been preserved in any way and have now been re-integrated into the main feature. It's a pity, however, that the alternate French-language track (reportedly in even worse shape than the English one!) wasn't subtitled in its entirety, as this dubbing is still the more natural-sounding.I am now looking forward to watching more Margheriti from this vintage, particularly THE LONG HAIR OF DEATH (1964) - his other film with Barbara Steele - but also WEB OF THE SPIDER (1970), the director's own color (and allegedly inferior) remake of CASTLE OF BLOOD, with Anthony Franciosa, Michele Mercier and Klaus Kinski - themselves no strangers to horror films. I'm not sure about his later work, however: for example, despite the acclaim heaped upon Image's DVD of CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE (1980) - which, incidentally, I failed to catch recently on a very rare TV screening - I find extreme gore off-putting, so I seriously doubt I'll ever get around purchasing that one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Italian horrors of the '60's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the many black and white Gothic horror-thrillers to come out of Italy in the '60's, this is undoubtedly one of the best. However, it is, of course, second to Mario Bava's masterpiece "Black Sunday". Both films star the mysterious and very beautiful British actress Barbara Steele who would become a leading figure in these creepy sixties shockers. Plot of this film deals with a cocky reporter(George Riviere) who is offered a wager to spend the night in a supposedly haunted castle. Predictably, he accepts the wager. The million-dollar question is, will he live through the night to collect his prize? Barbara Steele is a captivating "ghost" who roams the halls of the dark, sinister place and makes the man's stay there a little more pleasant. But as the evening passes on, other specters appear, and with less than godly intentions. Beautifully atmospheric chiller with Steele in fine form. A lesbian scene with Barbara and co-star Margaret Robsahm was cut from the film before it was released to the US. The movie was remade six years later and by the same director(Anthony Dawson) as WEB OF THE SPIDER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Barbara Steele's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been on a Barbara Steele kick lately. I love the Gothic atmosphere created in some of the older Italian and Mexican horror films. Barbara Steele was in some of my favorite Italian ones. Yesterday I re-watched 'Castle of Blood'. I'd forgotten just how good it is, it was even better than I had remembered. It was also appropriate viewing since we are going into the Halloween season as I write this. The story takes place on All Soul's Eve'. A writer accepts a wager to spend the night in a deserted mansion. We all know that is NEVER a good idea. It seems each year someone accepts this wager and never returns. During the course of the film we find out why they are sent there. The story behind some of the past murders is revealed for the writer during that night.In the past I must have only seen edited versions of the film. I was surprised to see the copy I had on this DVD showed a total nude scene when a couple spends their honeymoon night in the mansion. The bride is shown undressing and totally naked by a fireplace. I didn't expect that it, caught me off guard, a nude women in an older B/W horror film. I guess even in 1964 the Italians weren't as prudish about nudity as we Americans were in films of the same period. They also weren't afraid to present a straight out lesbian character. There's a woman in the film whose attraction to Barbara Steele's character goes beyond even their deaths. It's obvious she wants her badly.The film was over all a load of fun and full of spooky atmosphere, perfect for Halloween viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The DVD for "Danaza Macabra" (Castle of Blood) is very odd. That's because parts of the film are in French with subtitles and the rest is dubbed into English from the French. Sometimes, characters switched between the two in the middle of a scene! When I tried to get the film to be JUST subtitled or just dubbed, it made no difference! Odd, but still watchable.The story purports to be based on a Poe story, though I can't recall which one. In fact, the character of Poe appears in the beginning and end of the film--though it didn't look especially like him.A rich man makes a bet with a guy down on his luck that he cannot stay the entire night in a manner home. It seems like an easy bet to win--even if the house is very creepy. However, it can't be that easy, as the rich guy says that all those who previously took the bet died--yet this fool STILL wants to make the wager! While in the home, he meets lovely Barbara Steele within and falls madly for her. Later, however, he learns that she died more than a decade earlier! How can this be?! I could tell you more about the plot but don't want to spoil any of the suspense. See it for yourself to find out the rest of the story.This film gets very high marks for creating a creepy atmosphere. The house, black &amp; white cinematography and music work together to make for a scary looking film. As for the plot, it's interesting--especially because there are many twists and turns--so many that you are wondering just who is and who isn't among the undead by the end of the film.The only negative is that I felt sorry for the poor snake that was needlessly killed. Crazy as it might sound, I felt sorry for it and it hardly seemed necessary.Also, parents may want to know that towards the end there is a bit of nudity. A strikingly beautiful woman appears topless, but it's hardly necessary for the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Genuinely Creepy Miasma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen a Barbara Steele movie that I haven't liked, and have always been a sucker for a good haunted-house story (especially for such wonderful pictures as "The Legend of Hell House" and the original versions of "The Haunting" and "House on Haunted Hill"), so I had a feeling that "Castle of Blood" would be right up my alley. And boy, was it ever! This French-Italian coproduction, while perhaps not the classic that Steele's first horror film, "Black Sunday," remains to this day, is nevertheless an extremely atmospheric, chilling entry in the spook genre. Filmed in black and white, it manages to convey a genuinely creepy miasma. The film concerns a journalist who bets one Lord Blackwood and an author named Edgar Allen Poe that he can spend the night in Blackwood's castle on the night of All Saints Day, when the spirits of those killed in the castle reenact their fate. The viewer gets to see these deaths, and they ARE pretty horrible, for the most part. The film does indeed send shivers up the viewer's spine, and in the uncut DVD that I just watched--thanks to the fine folks at Synapse--even features a surprising topless scene and some mild lesbianism! And Barbara is wonderful in this movie; her otherworldly beauty is put to good advantage playing a sympathetic spectre. Her mere presence turns a creepy ghost story into something truly memorable. Not for nothing has she been called "The Queen of Horror."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very pale in comparison to Black Sunday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I saw Black Sunday (great movie) I wanted to see more of Barbara Steele. Castle of Blood was another recommendation from a while ago. Finally I have watched it. If not for Barbara Steele don't think I would have lasted through this one. Sure atmospheric, black/white cinematography but I'm nor really sure what kind of point the writer wanted to make. The whole back story of how all the ghost came to an end it was your typical run of the mill story pretty rich lady has a secret lover so the two men kill each other. More interesting was the pretty Julia having a lesbian crush on Elisabeth, that must have been something back than. Elisabeth and Alan Foster in love while both hardly having much interaction seemed more like both were in desperate need of a good lay. Didn't convince me at all. Alan seeing images of the past was interesting but than him yelling at the doctor and he young couple to watch out, I was like idiot they can't hear you they are already dead. And than the ending I was like oh yes he made it through the gate and than the gate itself spiking his head I was like oh please that is quite a retarded way to die. And than his voice oh yes Elisabeth I stayed for you, yeah right are you trying to make me believe you spiked your head on purpose? As a romance it might work but as horror not really, the story and its ending I thought were extremely lame. 5/10 points for the splendid cinematography, the beautiful ladies and the daring lesbian angle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good intentions pay off despite clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to explain the appeal of this movie. It's not a gem as some have said. But I wouldn't characterize it as Euro-trash either. The plot is not very original, and relies on standard haunted house conventions, perhaps pirating some from Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING (1963). It may also have a literary source in Bulwer-Lytton's story "The Haunters and the Haunted," which also tells the story of a disbelieving rationalist who wagers he can spend a night in a mysterious house where spirits relive incidents from past lives. The film is full of continuity holes (or should I say "challenges"), because many may be explained away. But the execution is flawed. Feral cats, sudden scenes of carnage, and other fright effects do not deliver the shudders.I must say, however, that the film held my interest, primarily because of the creepy, fog-shrouded sets that look better than they ought to on such a small budget, and because the performances are above average for this type of fare. And although the plot is full of old dark house clichés?slamming doors, billowing curtains, and mysterious portraits?some nice dialog makes it all seem less contrived somehow. There is no doubt that the director and writers were absolutely sincere.There is also some provocative sexual content and nudity following a tradition of salaciousness that seems to have been a necessary ingredient of horror films as far back as Hollywood's pre-code days. So if I were forced to assess whether this glass is half empty or full I would say it is slightly more than half full. This one might appeal to all those baby boomers who watched the soap opera DARK SHADOWS when they were teenagers in the '60's. It has that feel to it, only with better acting and writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great horror film remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this film at the West End theater in Louisville, Kentucky when I was a boy. The scene where Dr. Carmus finds the gardener's coffin, and the breathing dead body therein, was the scariest part of the movie for me, only intensified by the darkness of the film. I also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end, until I recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the Blackwoods was changed from Blackblood, due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family. I also noticed that as Foster first enters the gate of the cemetery, he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate, where he meets his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the Samhain and a young journalist meets up with Edgar Allan Poe in a London tavern and agrees to spend a night in a haunted castle from where no one comes out alive for a wager. True to its title, this is a macabre dance as the journalist staggers around the castle with a candelabra at hand and meets up with a variety of characters that may or may not be ghosts, including a seductive Barbara Steele in a nightgown, a creepy bearded Dr. Carmus whose name recalls Camus the writer but whose appearance has something of Ze Do Caixao/Coffin Joe, and a shirtless buff guy who seems to have wandered off a Maciste set. There's not much plot to speak of (in a script co-written by Sergio Corbucci no less, who'd go on to have a great career in the spaghetti western field, where Margheriti also dipped later in his career with AND GOD SAID TO CAIN) and whatever plot thereis is deliberately handled in the manner of a spooky story told at midnight around a campfire, the details intentionally vague and simplistic and with only a semblance of reality as is often the case with oral stories that pass from mouth to mouth and have to be easy to tell and remember for that reason. I like movies where characters wander through weird/surreal/eerie architecture (MARIENBAD, THE TRIAL) except DANZA MACABRA sabotages that hypnotic quality with goofy shenanigans such as candelabras being knocked over to the sound of cymbals and the protagonist tripping over stairs. Whatever the movie has going for it comes from those very qualities that mark it as an Italian Gothic horror film. The eerie dreamlike atmosphere and b/w cinematography capturing images of cobweb-strewn catacombs and skulls. Passable but not a patch on BLACK Sunday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Castle of Blood (aka Danse Macabre) ? Revisiting An Old Haunt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally saw this movie as a boy at the old Rialto Theatre as part of a Saturday afternoon matinée triple bill which also featured Vincent Price's "Last Man on Earth" and Mario Bava's "Nightmare Castle." I had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards! Though I didn't know it then, all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre. No wonder I was so scared! Though all three films frightened me, it was Castle of Blood that had the most profound impact.It was the first on the bill. I didn't even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first 20 minutes of the movie. That's lot to miss since the edited print only ran about 79 minutes (the unedited runs 87minutes). But despite this, the dark creepy atmosphere (complete with ruined castles, fog enshrouded cemeteries, shadows and cobwebs), Gothic set design, strong acting, and suspense (especially the last 20 minutes) scared the bejeepers out of me and made a lasting impression It took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection. Since it was a French - Italian import, it wasn't a movie that showed up on the late show in Winnipeg. I couldn't quite remember the title (remember I didn't get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless), and to make matters worse, the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles (aka Danze Macabre, Coffin of Terror, Castle of Terror, Long Night of Terror, etc...) and the USA/UK working title "Castle of Blood" was very generic, similar to dozens of other "b" horror and suspense films, making it illusive. But thanks to the internet and perseverance, I found it at last! What a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years! It may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when I was a boy, but as haunted house movies go, it's stands up well and compares favourably to similar iconic films of the period such as "The Haunting," "The Innocents" or "Black Sunday," The film is a fine early effort of Italian director Antonio Margheriti. It stars 60's scream queen icon Barbara Steele and features a well written screenplay by Sergio Corbucci about a sceptical writer (Georges Riviere) who, on a bet, spends the night in haunted house and unsuspectingly becomes part of an annual ongoing ghostly story. The hypnotic Steele is well cast as the ghostly love interest - as is Arturo Dominici as Dr. Carmus, and Margarete Robsahm as Julia.Many of the tricks Margheriti employs to create the film's eerie atmosphere (cobwebs, creaking doors, fog, etc) are bound to seem cliché to a modern audience, but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour. Rather than using body counts and special effects, the film creates scares the old fashion way, relying on a good story, stylish direction, fine set production, interesting camera work, and strong acting performances. Margheriti does a marvellous job taking these elements and building the film's suspense as the horrifying paranormal secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the unwitting writer.The film is not without faults. The pace drags at the beginning of the film (ironically, the 20 minutes I originally missed). This is probably worsened by Synapse films effort to restore the film to its original length. Though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored - in terms of the intro - it may have been more of hindrance than a help. The English voice dubs are merely passable and, in the restored scenes, the language shifts from English to French (English subtitles provided) which is sure to be annoying to some viewers.However, Synapse Films deserves kudos for the quality of the print. Clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly so.I enjoyed the film immensely and highly recommend it to aficionados of 60's Italian Goth films, or anyone who enjoys a good ghost story.Rob Rheubottom Winnipeg, MB Canada</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched this movie a number of times, and found it to be very good. This movie is also known as "Castle Of Terror", "Coffin Of Terror", and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele, is her usual beautiful/creepy self. George Riviere, the male lead, does a good job with his role. The whole movie is dripping with atmosphere, and there is a good deal of tension throughout. The camera angles are good and the acting, for the most part, isn't bad. This film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have the DVD uncut version, which is far superior to the edited TV version. Grab some popcorn, turn out the lights, settle back and enjoy.

		<shortDescription>The shudders have stuck with me for 40 years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was 10 or 11 years old, alone in my parent's basement on a Saturday night. It was being shown on "Chiller Theatre," a regular fright feature that I watched religiously as a young 'un. Now, I have seen many old horror films thanks to Chiller Theatre, but none ever stuck with me like "Danse Macabre," a.k.a. "Castle of Blood." I am 51 now, and only last year was I fortunate enough to locate a relatively recent, quality DVD edition of this wonderfully shudder-inducing supernatural classic, having thought I'd never manage to see it again. I have already watched it four more times, and cannot seem to get tired of it.They just don't make spook films like this one anymore. Haunted catacombs and mist-enshrouded graveyards just don't work as well in color as they did in black and white back in the day. Anyway, this one has Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, deliciously shadowy, cobweb-wrap'ed haunted castle sets, restless spirits re-enacting their deaths... and a wickedly ironic ending.IMO, this one's right up there with Robert Wise's "The Haunting," "The Innocents" (with Deborah Kerr), and the more recent "The Others."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When American author Edgar Allan Poe visits London, he is approached by British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a peculiar wager. Not believing Poe's assertion that all of his macabre stories have been based on actual experience, Foster accepts a bet from Poe and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that he cannot spend an entire night in the Blackwood's haunted castle. Once installed in the abandoned castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone, as he is approached by various beautiful women and handsome men, and a doctor of metaphysics - who explains that they are all lost souls damned to replay the stories of their demises on the anniversary of their deaths! The first time I watched this glorious bit of classic horror, I was mesmerized the entire time. I found the movie genuinely creepy and at the same time sorrowful. Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful. The music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing. The topless scene threw me for a loop, as I was not expecting it. It looks as Synapse did a great job with picture enhancement, because this movie looks damn fine for its age, and it's the Uncut International version, to boot. This is the movie responsible for me starting a Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barbara Steele - What more could you ask for?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Castle of Blood is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre being turned out in Italy in the 60s. The film has all of the right elements - old dark house, atmosphere, a decent story, and Barbara Steele. Steele makes most any film worth seeing.The story concerns a haunted castle. People have visited, but none have returned. Our hero makes a wager that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his winnings. But, the night he visits is a special night. It's the night each year when the dead return to relive their deaths.The only flaw I see in the movie is the running time. It almost feels padded. There is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens. Our hero stumbles around in the dark finding nothing of interest. But once he does find something, the movie picks up and become quite enjoyable.Castle of Blood is a definite must for Steele fans and fans of Italian Gothic horror in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant atmospheric Italian gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Italy produced a lot of really great and original horror films in the 1960's - and this is certainly one of them! The first thing you will notice about Danse Macabre is the style of the film. Shot in beautiful black and white, and due to director Antonio Margheriti's use of lighting; the film almost looks like it could be a German expressionistic horror film. This, coupled with the horror-filled plot line ensures that Danse Macabre is a film that truly captures the essence of horror. Of course, the fact that the beautiful Barbara Steele appears in the film doesn't harm matters - and the good news continues as, in this film, she gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in the films that made her famous. The plot is very aware of the time in which this was released, and so incorporates the great Edgar Allen Poe. We follow Alan Foster, a writer who accepts a bet from Poe himself and Lord Blackwood that he can't spend an entire night in the latter's creepy old castle. Everyone that has spent the night there previously has died...and our hero is about to meet the previous wager-takers! Nowadays, horror films don't tend to focus so much on each shot and the result is that there isn't much beauty left in the genre. It is refreshing, therefore, to see this film. Many of the shots here are incredibly beautiful - from the female side of the couple wearing just a see-through skirt, to my personal favourite - a shot of smoke creeping in from under a door. This my first Antonio Margheriti film, and even after seeing just this one; it's obvious that he was one of Italy's premier directors. Also interesting is the fact that screenplay was co-written by another of the Italian greats; Django creator Sergio Corbucci. The plot can meander a little too much at times, but there's always enough atmosphere on hand to make sure that the film never becomes boring - and the fact that it is always intriguing, even when the plot slows down, ensures the same thing. The way that Danse Macabre utilises the 'haunted house' theme is both well done and original, and helps to keep the story as eerie as possible. On the whole, fans of Italian and/or cult cinema will not want to miss this little gem!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Italian Gothic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the days before gore and sex took over, real horror films were made. Castle of Blood is, in my estimation, one of the finest, although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings. In an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent The Others, which was in the theaters a couple of years ago.Director Antonio Margheriti remade his own picture in 1970 titling it this time Web of the Spider (AKA Nella Stretta Morsa del Ragno). Why he did this I do not understand, although the remake starred Anthony Franciosa and Klaus Kinski and was very good in its own right. Perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to American audiences. I do not really know. It is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color.Castle of Blood is excellent Italian Gothic. La Danza Macabra is said to be an unpublished work of Edgar Allen Poe, who "appears" in this film. Poe and Lord Blackwood, owner of a haunted castle, bet American writer Alan Foster (George Riviere) that he cannot spend All Souls Night in said castle and survive. Foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it, for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts. It seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re-enact the crimes they committed in life. Lord Blackwood conveniently forgot to tell Foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next All Souls Night! It does not take Foster and the beautiful Elisabeth Blackwood (portrayed by the incomparable Barbara Steele) long to fall in love, even though their romance is doomed, because Elisabeth is one of the ghosts. I will not give the ending away, but will just say that Castle of Blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story. Comments. This film is greatly atmospheric, even by the excellent standards of the Italians. My personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody, and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this. In fairness, Web of the Spider was fine in its own right, even with color and greater brightness. I loved the lingering shots, something most modern day directors do not have the patience for. Indeed, when Alan first enters the doomed castle, we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room, the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms. By the time the first ghost appears, the audience is thoroughly primed and ready. There is wonderful dialogue between Alan and the ghosts, something else not often done in standard ghost stories. There are also memorable scenes, very visual for this type of film. Elisabeth's "murder" and the dance scene (reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in 1962's Carnival of Souls) were particularly good.Sadly, few general interest viewers will ever hear of, much less see, this film. That is a shame, for this one is a cut above the rest. I got my copy from Sinister Cinema and am not certain if it can be purchased anywhere else. For persons interested in this genre, it is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Help Me Make It Through The Night.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A reporter, Georges Riviere, accepts a bet that he can not spend the night alone in a broken-down castle. He loses.The story opens in a shabby London ale house with a chubby Edgar Allan Poe telling a horrifying tale. You can tell that it's horrifying because his eyes are practically popping from their sockets. Of his two listeners, the reporter, Riviere, scoffs. The other man owns a mansion two hours from the city. The place is supposed to be uninhabited but those who visit it -- which happens once a year -- are never seen again.Riviere is dropped off at the castle's gate by the owner and Poe, whose carriage then trundles off into the night in the film's most unsettling scene. Riviere enters the grounds and stumbles through a nightmare of thickets and bare hanging branches. Inside, the castle is filled with shadows and cobwebs. It's all reminiscent of Renfield's being dropped off at the Borga Pass and being taken by carriage to Dracula's castle.Well -- "Dracula" was itself a bit confusing. You will remember that Dracula shooed his female consorts away from the unconscious victim and sucked the blood himself. So what did the females eat or drink? How long could they exist without drinking blood? Why was Dracula such a hog? If Renfield was turned into a vampire, how come he could subsist on flies? "Castle of Blood" is even less logical. The castle turns out to be filled with spirits. Most of them walk around like zombies but at least one of them, Barbara Steele, of the enormous eyes and magnificent mammaries, is pretty lively. She no sooner meets Riviere than she throws herself at him, has the reporter declaring his love for her, and they spend some time in the sack together. (The camera pans to the fireplace, where the logs send up brighter flames.) I don't know what the attraction is. Okay, Barbara Steele isn't bad looking, but Georges Riviere seems kind of plain to me and gives a particularly ligneous performance.That's nothing, though. The spirits come and go. Their peregrinations make no more sense than they did in "The Shining." There can be a ballroom full of whirling, well-dressed, waltzing men and women, and in the next moment they're gone. One is a lesbian. The reporter shoots one of them, a dim muscle man, and he apparently dies, only to show up later thirsty for blood.They're all thirsty for Riviere's blood. It's going to keep them alive for another year, until the next visitor brings next year's supply. But just as the reporter seems cornered, Steele appears, sobbing out her love for him, and shows him the door to the outside, where it will soon be light.Riviere drags her along, screaming. Once outside, though it is still night, she drops to the grass and dissolves into a skeleton. Riviere beats it to the gate and slips through it to wait for the carriage that will pick him up that morning.Too late, though. Being outside the castle may have skeletonized Steele but it doesn't prevent the other spirits from following the reporter and slamming the gate shut behind him, impaling him on one of its spikes. Their voices keep repeating, "We need your blood. Now you are one of us." In fact, there is no blood from the puncture of the spike and nobody around to drink it. And if the spirits can wander around at will outside the castle, what's to stop them from wafting into London and treating themselves to a real repast of Dickensian losers? And, not that it matters much, but the elderly fellow who owns the castle shows up with Poe at dawn to pick up the reporter and they find his body held upright against the gate. Both Poe and the owner are properly shocked. Yet, what is the owner playing at? He seems to know nothing of what's up, but he sends the ghosts a fresh victim on the same night of every year? Riviere keeps checking his anachronistic pocket watch to see how much painful time has passed. I felt his pain. Castle of Tedium.Want to see a good, scary movie without a cascade of gore? Watch "Dead of Night." Want to see a good, scary, CHEAP movie? See "Carnival of Souls."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of fog, cobwebs, and dark shadows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Castle of Blood" is a title I had read about for years in catalogs such as Sinister Cinema and only recently got to see. Those distributors regarded it as an unknown horror masterpiece (like they do with most of their titles). I wouldn't go that far but it is a nice little Gothic horror film. Italy churned these out in spades along with Sword &amp; Sandal and eventually Spaghetti Western films. They're usually heavy on atmosphere, and this is certainly no exception. "Castle of Blood" is full of fog, cobwebs, and dark shadows. Its a nice film to look at and it often has an eerie feel. This can be contributed to director Antonio Margheriti who often does a good job. Plus, Barbara Steele is beautiful as usual and turns in a fine performance. Sylvia Sorrente, whom I know nothing about, is a real looker also.What prevents this film from being great is two things. First off, the pacing is really poor. With other films in the genre (notably the masterpiece "Mill of the Stone Women"), this is forgivable. However, "Castle of Blood" takes too much time on walks through the castle and it seriously drags the film down. Secondly, its not too scary. I know that standards have changed, but still Mario Bava's works from the period usually garner a few shocks out of me. "Castle of Blood" is still recommended for people into this kind of drive-in schlock. I find the character of Edgar Allen Poe to be particularly amusing, because its a well known fact that Poe never achieved any fame or recognition during his writing career. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gothic in B&amp;W</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest examples of Italian Gothic, "Castle of Blood" has everything you could ask for in a genre film and more, employing the basic elements of classic Universal Horror films with the over sexuality of 60's cinema, therefore turning the otherwise routine story into something fresh and original. Though Antonio Marghereti has something of a mixed bag career, this is one of his best achievements, whose stylish directing creates some haunting set pieces and evocative, nightmarish atmosphere that has never been bettered. Riz Ortolani's score is as darkly erotic as it's unique approach at the Gothic Horror, blending perfectly with the latter. Just as the soundtrack, Barbara Steele is perfectly cast as our protagonist's 'love interest from beyond grave', and whose awkward sex appeal is extremely representative of the film's own macabre sensuality. It would be interesting to see this back-to-back with Mario Bava's "Black Sunday", which has a similar tone as well as having Steele in the lead role. Both films are also probably the best of the dying B&amp;W Italian horror films, before it switched to hellishly colorful efforts, starting with Bava's equally mesmerizing "Black Sabbath" in 1963. Overall, 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric tale of a love beyond the grave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This complicated story begins fairly simply, with an English journalist accepting a wager from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he cannot spend a night in the haunted Blackwood castle. Once there, the writer wanders around the dusty rooms and corridors, until music and a glimpse of a waltzing couple lead him into an empty room. He sits at the harpsichord and starts to play the tune he has heard, and is surprised to be tapped on the shoulder by the stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood. She informs him with an ambiguous charming/eerie manner that she has prepared his room upstairs and that someone is always expected on this night...the Night of the Dead. Thus begins a startling series of supernatural events that bewilder the journalist all the rest of the night. SPOILER AHEAD: it probably won't surprise too many viewers to learn that the lovely Elizabeth is actually a ghost. This doesn't prevent her from falling in love with the journalist, but it does make things more complicated for them than for the average couple. This is a fun movie, with absolutely everything: ghosts, the spooky castle, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence ( though both have been toned down in the version most Americans have seen over the years.) The alluring, captivating Barbara Steele is the main reason to see it. She has a strange charisma unlike anyone else you've ever seen in the movies. Recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a fan of Gothic horror, then you're definitely absolutely guaranteed to LOVE this wondrous Italian 60's film "Castle of Blood". We're really talking about creepily creaking doors, eerie portraits that appear to be moving, spontaneously dying candles although there's no wind and smoke coming from underneath heavy wooden chamber doors. Speaking in terms of atmosphere and style, this masterful piece of Gothic film-making is one of the best out there; just one tiny league below landmarks such as "Black Sunday", "The Three Faces of Fear" and "Curse of the Crying Woman". The prominent directors duo Sergio Corbucci ("The Great Silence", "Django") and Antonio Margheriti ("Cannibal Apocalypse", "Killer Fish") are successful in all areas, including a powerful plot (one that is genuinely nightmare inducing), ultra-sinister scenery and filming locations, stylish black and white photography, spine-chilling music and a brilliant gathering of talented performers. Barbara Steele, starlet of the aforementioned "Black Sunday" and Italian goth-muse number one, shines brightly again as a spiritually tormented character and she's literally surrounded by excellent co-players. One of them, Silvano Tranquilli, even gives away a fairly credential depiction of author Edgar Allan Poe. The story involves him and another wealthy visitor of a countryside tavern challenging a brutal young journalist to accept a morbid wager. If he ? Alan Foster ? would survive spending one night in the infamous Blackwood Castle, he receives the astonishing reward of $10 and a newspaper interview with Poe. Needless to say the ordeal is much more dangerous than it sounds, even for somebody like Alan Foster who's a firm non-believer in ghosts and vampires. The night starts out great for him, as he even meets up with the stunningly beautiful woman of his dreams, but gradually he learns that Blackwood Castle is a hellish place where the ghosts of the previously deceased visitors are trapped for all eternity. I don't know about you, but this is seriously one of my favorite horror movie premises of all time. Co-director Antonio Margheriti clearly was proud of this film as well, because he remade it himself a couple of years later as "Web of the Spider". That movie had a handful of trumps, like for example the casting of no less than Klaus Kinski in the role of Edgar Allan Poe, but in general this original is vastly superior. "Castle of Blood" literally oozes with atmosphere and maintains a thoroughly unsettling ambiance throughout. This truly is one of the rare films that can make the hair on your arms and back of the neck rise with fear if you watch it in the right circumstances. Watch it late at night, preferably alone and in a candle lit room, and you'll get an idea about the true definition of horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first remember seeing this one back in the 70s when it was shown on late night television. Scared the hell out of me. But then, I was a teenager back in those days, not as jaded about films as I am now.CASTLE OF BLOOD (aka: DANSE MACABRE) is a fine example of the 60s Italian horror genre, along with Mario Bava's BLACK SUNDAY(1960), CURSE OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka: KILL BABY KILL) (1966) and Mario Caiano's NIGHTMARE CASTLE (1965). If you want spooky atmosphere along with great writing, then check these out as well. I also rate these along with those early Poe films that Roger Corman was doing during the same period.I saw the new Synapse DVD that was taken from a French print and it's a great improvement over that old pan-and-scan print that was making the rounds on television over the years. It adds a couple of minutes of dialog (in French) that don't really add much to the movie as whole, but it's nice to see it complete, without cuts. Unfortunately the DVD doesn't really offer any extras beyond stills from the film.One flub I noticed was in the opening scene, seeing the smoke-effects man next to the camera being reflected on the glass of the inn's front door. I guess the editors didn't catch it at the time, or maybe they didn't care, but it is something I didn't notice the first time. That's the wonders of DVD. You get to see all the flubs, mistakes and details that weren't apparent the first time around. But no matter.But no matter, it still gets a 7 on the imdb meter</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film dominated by raven-haired Barbara Steele, it was seen when I was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallid vampiric men and women stalking a castle, seeking blood. Steele is an icon of horror films and an otherworldly beauty, and the views of the walking dead pre-date Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD shamblers, unifying them in my mind.I don't see the connection between this film and THE HAUNTING, which is clever but ambiguous about the forces present. LA DANZA MACABRE is a b-movie without pretention, daring you to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. There's no such draw to HAUNTING's overwrought Claire Bloom. The comparisons to the HAUNTING are superficial.And no, this movie does NOT need to be remade. Not only is it a product of the Sixties, but the large percentage of talentless cretins in Hollywood cannot fathom MACABRE's formula for terror. That formula is based on one overriding factor: GOOD WRITING. Low-grade classics like CASTLE and Corman's Poe films with R. Matheson and Tourneur's OUT OF THE PAST share a commonality of strong writing. It's simple. Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them put a plot into today's cinematic mess. Besides that, let Hollywood attempt some original material for a change, and stop exploiting the obviously superior product of the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compares Well With the original `The Haunting'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a well-crafted, surprisingly spooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Exquisite black and white cinematography, flawless dubbing, superb casting, fairly logical scripting, deliberate pacing and a surprise (though totally appropriate) ending set this one apart. Only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt `love at first sight' between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivi?re) mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie.While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all of his stories are true. Incredulous, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood's castle, a night following Halloween when the dead walk. Alan cannot afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager.Unlike Mario Bava's overpraised `Black Sunday,' (aka `The Mask of Satan'), `Castle of Blood' is fairly restrained, making the few moments of violence even more dreadful, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space movies from the 60s.It's a pity the only version of this film I've found is badly deteriorated (and recorded) pan and scan version. Even so, it is well worth seeing, and cries out for a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with Robert Wise's `The Haunting'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterclass in Gothic dread</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was only recently that I discovered the wonder of the Italian Gothic genre, and I'm happy to say that this film is indeed one of the best. The crisp use of black and white photography makes the events portrayed appear stark and effective (Bava would have been proud), and the tone too is genuinely nasty. By the end of the film, the viewer is left unsure of what has occurred, only that in some way evil has won again, and will go on winning and winning for eternity. Added to that, it also manages to be extremely unsettling and very frightening in some moments.Director Antonio Margheriti (who later turned to adventure flicks like THE LAST HUNTER) keeps things moving along at a swift pace, ensuring that there is always something interesting happening on screen to keep the viewer occupied. While the plot is of the standard haunted house variety, there are plenty of neat flourishes, such as one of the actors actually playing Poe himself, researching material for a new story! The setting is excellent, a large and Gothic building full of fine furniture, layered in thick dust and cobwebs, where the stench of death is heavy in the air and terrible occurrences are played out in full.We see people die in violent ways, and although we know that they are merely playbacks and cannot harm the hero of the film, they still manage to be frightening. Especially the mysteriously half-naked muscular man, a murderer who goes around with a knife and stabs people, for what reason, who knows? The lack of knowledge about the ghosts makes it all the more frightening, as we only see what the character of Foster sees, nothing more, we are as left in the dark as he is.Georges Riviere gives a solid performance as the male lead, charismatic, romantic and heroic when the time calls for it. However it's the wonderful Barbara Steele who steals (sorry) the film as a ghost who wants to help Riviere, but in the end is unable to leave the building and crumbles away. Even darkness is thrown on Steele's apparently honourable intentions towards the living man she loves, as we hear her voice quite happily whispering "now we can be together" at the very end of the film, after the hero has been killed in a genuinely shocking way, just after we think he's safe. The rest of the cast all perform well, the actors and actresses portraying the spirits of the castle all intone their characters with just the right level of menace without exaggerating, especially the sinister Dr. Carmus character who first acts as our narrator but then turns out to be seeking Foster's blood like the rest of the castle's inhabitants.If you're in the mood for a good atmospheric chiller, then this knocks spots off even well-made competition like THE HAUNTING. Gruesome and frightening, CASTLE OF BLOOD comes across as something of a tragedy as its become lost in time to modern audiences, undeservedly so. It's a film which shows that budget and special effects aren't important, just strong camera-work and storytelling are needed to make an effective horror film, which this indeed is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hoping to score an interview with Edgar Allen Poe (Silvano Tranquilli), journalist Alan Foster (Georges Rivi?re) tracks down the author to a dingy London pub (the appropriately named The Four Devils) where he is discussing the subject of life after death with his old pal Lord Blackwood (Umberto Raho). When Foster reveals his scepticism on the subject, Blackwood bets that he cannot spend a night alone in his castle, a place reputedly haunted by its previous guests, all of whom have mysteriously disappeared during their stay...Fancy something really Gothic? Something set in a building where every door creaks, the only light is from a flickering candle, corridors are dark and foreboding, and paintings appear to come to life? Then look no further than Castle of Blood, a film so fog-bound, dust-covered and strewn with cobwebs that it sent my Gothic-ometer clean off the scale; Foster's home for the night is the kind of place that would even give Herman Munster goosebumps!Unsurprisingly, the Blackwood family pile's reputation as haunted turns out to be well deserved, the journalist spending most of the night bumping into a series of spooky occupants, including the enchanting Elisabeth (Barbara Steele), her love rival Julia (Margarete Robsahm), a musclebound killer (Giovanni Cianfriglia), and the creepy Dr. Carmus (Arturo Dominici); this superbly effective supernatural set-up gives director Antonio Margheriti all he needs to pile on the atmosphere and scares?Castle of Blood really does deliver in terms of macabre visuals and shivers.Perhaps a little too much of the running time is spent on Foster wandering aimlessly around the old castle, but with so many great moments?the scene with the decapitated snake, the topless ghost bride, the corpses hanging in the trees?this is one Italian Gothic horror that is genuinely deserving of its praise.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot of CASTLE OF BLOOD has been sufficiently related in the previous comments, so I won't repeat the details of Alan, penniless journalist, spending a night in haunted Blackwood Manor, falling in love with ghostly Elizabeth, and almost escaping from the other vampiric occupants. This strange, dark movie has fascinated me for years - and not only because of Barbara Steele's Gothic beauty, Take the character of Dr. Carmus, for instance - a ghost, but also a scientist who still seems as if he is studying the other ghosts - perhaps for a second edition of his METAPHYSICAL MEDICINE. Less frightening than elegaic, CASTLE OF BLOOD is unusual for a horror movie because it seems to reject the world of the living for the timeless life-in-death of Blackwood Manor, and the "shocker" ending is more ambigious than horrifying.</fullReview>
