		<shortDescription>First to emerge, even before Truman or Ed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course some movies and show have taken the idea (whole or part of it). Still the innovative idea of the reality show belongs to Louis 19. It's the story of an invisible man : he is nobody at his job, in the bus, for the kids. Even his mother keeps peeking on him. But one day he enters this contest and wins, making a show of his so-called life. He is followed everywhere, at every moment for good or not.This movie shows us a side of the media industry to which we are not accustomed to think about. How do celebrities deal with the fact that there will always be someone to watch you, even in the most private moments of your life? It's a great movie that showed me that Québec cinema match the American in some instance. But don't be fooled. It's not "another movie about reality show". It's the first movie about it. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why can't English Canadians make these films?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the most popular Canadian made movie in 1994, and it was made and shown completely to a French audience. Dubbed into English for later showing on television, it is still charming and entirely watchable, if no great work of cinema. Moreover, at least two major Hollywood productions on the exact same theme, "The Truman Show" and "Ed TV" were made well after this movie was released. But the real shame of Louis 19th is that almost all of the most popular and successful Canadian films of the past decade were made in Quebec in French for a Quebec audience. In addition to that, they proudly show off their Canadianness (in this case, by the main character talking about local children's TV shows, like the fondly remembered "Razzle Dazzle"). Meanwhile, this is the only year in a long time where there has been any really watchable films made in English Canada that are distinctly Canadian - "Duct Tape Forever" and "Men With Brooms". Meanwhile, Quebec continues year after year to turn out distinctively Canadian films like "Les Boys" (about hockey, you can't get more Canadian than that). Its not about money or talent - there are lots of great Australian films to choose from, and their industry thrives while English Canada's continues to die on the vine making cheap imitations of Hollywood movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A low-budget movie that is quite a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie wasn't made with a great budget, but the result was astonishing and unique. It talks about Louis Jobin, a very normal guy who wins a contest and who has to be filmed 24 hours a day.... and it gets on his nerves after a while! The concept of this movie was so refreshing and great that it was bought by Ron Howard for his movie EdTV, made in 1999 with a great cast composed of Matthew McConaughey, Ellen DeGeneres, Jenna Elfman and Elizabeth Hurley. Cool!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why make another one like it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I viewed this film dubbed in English three times. It was worth it every time.This is really a gentle comedy-romance that in spite of a few scenes could almost be classed as family viewing. It deals lightheartedly with themes of media invitation into and invasion of our lives with a delightful, humourous little twist at the end. Its Montréal location is an ideal setting for the story and gives it a local feel.Martin Drainville returns an excellent performance as Louis, the very average guy down-the-street clerk in the stereo store. We need to see more of him in any language.Known for some steamy scenes in the TV series "Scoop," with Roy Dupuis, (also starring Drainville) Macha Grenon drops her bombshell into a cameo appearance as Lola Laflamme in a discoth?que encounter with Louis.In order to preserve its original tone, one might want to view it with subtitles.</fullReview>
