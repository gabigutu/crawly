		<shortDescription>Nearly nothing like the Truman Show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame that due to the timing of when Edtv was released, it was automatically deemed a pitiful copy of the Truman Show, a movie that won our hearts the previous year. Now, I love the Truman Show too, very much, and I'll admit that I was was very uninterested in ever seeing a copy-cat version of it. It was until just a few weeks ago that I actually watched Edtv (even with the expectation that I would most likely not like it too much) and I must say I was pleasantly surprised!Not only was Edtv funny and entertaining, but it was nearly nothing at all like the Truman Show. I mean, the ONLY similarity is the idea of a live TV show about an "ordinary" guy. But Truman didn't even know he was on TV. He was just living what he thought was an ordinary life. All the cameras and microphones were completely hidden and he lived in a town that was entirely fabricated from his wife and life-long best friend, to the rain and even the sun. His is a story of a man searching for an escape from his everyday life, which little by little he is realizing may not be what it seems. Ed on the other hand was a nobody who was chosen to have a camera crew actually follow him around all day while he went on about his life. His life, and in turn the show, became more about instant celebrity as viewers became enchanted in watching this loser become a mega-star over night. People flocked around him just as much to meet him as to be on TV themselves and he endured some major struggles in keeping his life and relationships normal, which was impossible with his celebrity status and on-camera life.Both movies had a theme of America's fixation with TV, and more specifically Reality TV, but have different plots and overall themes altogether. I think Edtv was a very enjoyable movie and Mathew McConaughey and Jenna Elfman delivered fantastic performances. Not to mention the mind boggling, and I think underrated, job of editing such an enormous amount of footage. Considering that while the film cameras were rolling, the video cameras were rolling too, and just about all of the video footage you see was actually shot when you see it being shot, I think that Ron Howard did a great job of keeping track of it all and actually making it work. So when someone says, "Well, it was no Truman Show" they are absolutely right. I think it is a great movie that stands on it's own and should stand proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exposes The Vulgarity Of Reality Shows,And The Public That Loves Them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never liked reality shows,and when this movie was shown on cable I decided to watch it and found it really interesting.Matthew McConaughey plays video store clerk Ed Pekurny who lives with his parents and his big brother Ray Pekurny,played by Woody Harrelson.He is hired by a TV company that wants to do a 24-hour reality show based on his life,and Ed grabs the offer.In the beginning,the public tells Ed that his show 'stinks',but as they see him getting involved with his elder brother's girlfriend,the ratings go above the roof.What's more,when Ed makes out live with the bombshell to end all bombshells,that is Elizabeth Hurley,the interest verges on voyeurism.The icing in the cake comes when Ed's father suddenly turns up from nowhere,having abandoned him and his brother years ago.The film is a well-made documentation of the vulgarity of the public that makes up the television audience not only in America,but the whole world.Sex and scandal will always be the top-sellers,whether it is an ordinary man's tale or that of a celebrity.In fact,it is Ed's scandalous life that makes him America's Number One celebrity.McConaughey plays his role with ease,and so does Harrelson.Ellen Degeneres is good as the unscrupulous TV producer,while Elizabeth Hurley's brief appearance leaves the audience gasping for more.Quite entertaining and very candidly made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True TV launch their new concept ? Real Life TV, where cameras will follow one person's life 24/7 and put it all unedited on TV. When Ed is dragged into his brother's audition tape he catches the eye of the studio and he becomes the lucky subject of edtv! However when he falls for Ray's girlfriend Shari things get difficult and he finds that his new found fame is not all it cracked up to be.Stepping out of the shadow of The Truman Show came another film about reality TV and the nature of fame. However this has little to do with Truman in terms of content, instead it tries to be more of a comedy and tries to mix a little bit of social comment. The story is essentially a romance but it doesn't convince. It doesn't work simply because the whole idea of looking at fame, reality tv and studios is more interesting (even if it doesn't come off). The film promises much but doesn't fully use it's potential ? the comedy is never a funny as you hope, the look at fame and TV is never as clever or as deep as you think.It's a shame that it isn't better because the cast is good on paper. McConaughey is still a rising star (although needs a big hit soon). Harrelson is good as he usually is when in support and Elfman is pretty good as Shari. The support cast is great too ? Landau is funny, DeGeneres is good, Reiner is funny and wicked while lesser roles are filled out by the likes of Hurley, Dennis Hopper, Clint Howard. Get past these and you have tonnes of little cameos from the likes of Harry Shearer, Michael Moore, Jay Leno and George Plimpton.Overall this is enjoyable ? it's just that you feel that all of it's parts have potential that are never fully realised. It's OK but you can't help feeling that it's a missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrelson Rules!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EDtv will inevitably be compared to Peter Weir's The Truman Show but really they haven't much in common. The Truman Show took itself far too seriously. EDtv is a fairly black comedy, a satire on modern TV culture.The producers of a failing TV network decide to take a punt and try a new format - a real TV doco on an ordinary life.They audition and choose Ed (Mathew McConaghey), a rangy, slobbish video store worker who's been once or twice bitten in love; the sort of fellow who goes out with a beer mug tied around his neck.Ed takes on the challenge partly because he's pretty broke and partly because he's bored, urged on by his little hoper, small brained, big muscled brother Ray played by Woody Harrelson. A few days into the shoot Ray throws over his girlfriend Shari (Jenna Elfman) and Ed wins her as his new lover. Ratings soar!The talent of the cast (not to mention it's director Ron Howard) lends a great deal of life to Edtv. It's often genuinely funny. McConaughey uses that winning smile to perfection, even as he has an early morning, half asleep fiddle with his genitals. McConaughey is a major reason why EDtv works as well as it does.Woody Harrelson is a genuinely talented actor and can play a spoilt, selfish meat headed brother perfectly. Some of the best lines have been left to Al the boy's father played by Martin Landau as well as to Ellen DeGeneres as the show's producer.But it's the character of Ed and his family who really set the neurones firing. Unlike many American films these heroes are ordinary middle Americans, probably about as close as a mainstream American film could get to an English, Ken Loach/Mike Leach, style of middle/working class family. There aren't any chandeliers in Edtv.It's not often that these sorts of characters are treated warmly in these sorts of films and then we must ask how our own families would fare under this sort of warts and all scrutiny- probably about as well as Ed's.And it's also interesting to wonder how much the average Aussie would consider EDtv to be a satire given the popularity of Rikki Lake and her ilk, not to mention the Funniest Home Video types of programs. Is real life TV (is there such a thing) already even more outrageous than EDtv? Is EDtv outrageous enough to be satire?There are some dull minutes in EDtv (mostly to do with Elizabeth Hurley's appearance as a sex pot) but EDtv proves again that Hollywood isn't nearly as dumb as it makes out to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good morning! You're live on EDtv!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EdTv is a comedy, but also a very serious movie: if you notice our reality in the present days, full of cameras watching us everywhere we go, and even the reality show programs, you will notice that the main thing in the movie is not only to entertain, but maybe also to alert people about the dangerous problems of all this stuff. Ed Pekurny is a regular guy who suddenly gets invited to be part of a reality show. He accepts,specially because he wants the money that the TV executives are going to pay him. Gradually, what starts being funny and even a nice way of popularity becomes a nightmare,with Ed not having any privacy at all,specially with his girlfriend Shari.I found the end of this movie very cool. Go watch it :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first want to say, all those comparing EDtv to "Truman" just miss the point completely. They are as different in approach and intent as are "The Rock" and "The Birdman of Alcatraz" which both happen to be set in the same prison."EDtv" is meant to be a comedy with a lot of subtle and not so subtle references to the intrusive nature of the media. The characters are very engaging and well-acted. I laughed all the way through this movie. That's all I think it was supposed to be. It isn't quite as good as "As Good As It Gets" or "Analyze This", but I still give it 8 of 10!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"...and you, Ed, are no Truman Burbank!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EDTV is more concerned with "Ed" than "TV".In fact, throughout this dull and relentless tale of ordinary Joe Ed turned real-life 24-hour television star, Director Ron Howard consistently resists the obvious satire on the fallout of fame and focuses on the cloyingly saccharine romance that lies at EDTV's mushy core.If you doubt this (and considering Howard's track record, you may), visit EDTV on DVD and you'll be treated to numerous deleted scenes that satirically drive home the point that fame is indeed a bitch. Unfortunately, these scenes are also some of the darkest, funniest and most telling in the script. (An entire subplot about an EdTV imitator that ends with tragedy was completely eliminated from the final cut.) Why then did they end up on the cutting room floor? Howard can't seem to get away from Mayberry sentimentality enough to make EDTV the film it needs to be by it's very nature. In fact, the stars of the film (Hurley, DeGeneres, Harrelson) could have made a more interesting documentary on the price of fame than EDTV does at it's cautious best.All hail, however, the film's bright spot, Ellen DeGeneres. Yes, Ellen. With her balance of quirky humor and self-doubting charm, she manages to infuse the film with some sense of purpose and it is she (not wrongly cast lead Matthew McConaughey) that we care about.See it for Ellen. Or, better yet, rent THE TRUMAN SHOW and cap it off with a re-run of TV's ELLEN. I guarantee more laughs and heaps more satire than the botched EDTV can ever provide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>people who keep saying this is just like the truman show are stupid. it's completely different, and it didn't rip of anybody. both movies were probably being made at the same time. Truman Show has barely any similarities to EdTV. EDTV is a romantic comedy, light satire, and truman show is a drama. EdTV didn't get what it deserved at the box office and i respect howard whose direction is excellent, for releasing this movie when he did. Harrelson and Landau are hilarious and this is probably matthew's best performance i've seen of him. he really does a great job. jenna elfman too. Very funny, entertaining movie, and a great DVD. I laugh so hard when the camera man falls in the outtakes section of the bonus materials.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Television, The Drug Of The Nation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ed is a happy go lucky video store assistant going nowhere fast who finds himself attracted to his brothers girlfriend. So far so what? But this just happens to be occurring at the same time that his every waking minute is being broadcast live to the nation on the new reality show Edtv!Directed by Ron Howard Edtv is a first class film inspired by the French Canadian movie 'Louis 19, Le Roi Des Ondes'. Released shortly after The Truman Show its the superior if unfairly less well received of the two Hollywood reality TV themed movies. It did come up against heavy comparisons but is quite a different &amp; better film. Whereas Truman was totally unaware that he was in a TV show Ed activity volunteers for the job. Such is the currency of celebrity in the modern media age. Who are you if you haven't been on TV?The world of celebrity is the one we inhabit in the early 21st century. They are used to try to convince us what to wear, what to eat, what to drink &amp; even who to vote for! We are truly living in a celebrity culture, with shows such as Big Brother &amp; Survivor promoting the seemingly unstoppable desire by members of the public to become famous simply for being famous! Ed, slightly reluctant at first soon becomes seduced by this idea, an idea which turns sour.Ron Howards movie does have a lot to say about the issues of celebrity &amp; reality TV, but at its heart is a great romantic comedy which has more of an edge to it than is expected from the one time star of Happy Days. The pairing of Matthew McConaughey &amp; Woody Harrelson is inspired, they are great together sparking off one another. Natural comedic actors you believe they are brothers. Dennis Hopper puts in a good cameo &amp; Jenny Elfman is totally convincing as the female romantic lead. You really care about the plight of the characters &amp; the rest of the cast are also on top form. From Rob Reiners small role as a TV executive to the excellent Martin Landau as Eds father. He is one of the best character actors of recent years making truly varied &amp; believable performance in films as diverse as Crimes &amp; Misdemeanors, Ed Wood &amp; Rounders. Add Edtv to the list - his performance is comedy gold!The great acting would of course all be in vain if it weren't coupled with a good script. Thankfully Edtv has one. All the predictable hallmarks of a romantic comedy are here but with a sharper wit &amp; of course the reality show structure which brings a new dimension to the genre. Add to this Howards direction using all the tricks, styles &amp; conventions of reality TV. Sometimes you are watching the cameramens POV, sometimes Eds exploits are conveyed on a TV screen complete with advertising, at other times you are presented with multiple viewpoints of the same scene. These constant variations in style keep the film fresh &amp; interesting &amp; are further enhanced by the audience reactions throughout the film &amp; the TV led critique &amp; discussions about the merits or otherwise of the phenomenon that is Edtv. Together the acting, directing &amp; script really convince that Edtv is viable &amp; could exist!Overall this is a funny, well directed romantic comedy from Ron Howard. Great performances abound from all concerned. There is a deeper level to the film which isn't hammered home or done in a heavy handed way but is there none the less among the laughs. But just how long will it be before Edtv becomes a reality?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I like most of the players, I really wasn't expecting much from this movie. I wound up surprised by its freshness, wit and thoughtfulness. I feared a poor person's Truman Show, but this film took a lot of the same themes and spun them in different directions. The film lacked Truman's sadness and humanity but made up the difference with more concise and challenging social commentary (not to mention a better supporting cast). Issues of celebrity, entertainment, the media, the information age were all handled in interesting ways. When it needed to be abrasive and shocking, Ed TV took its shots, but it usually remained in a very comfortable and entertaining middle ground. As a viewer, I felt like someone who had spent the previous 15 minutes surfing channels before finally finding a gem worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ed Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey) is an everyday guy with a loser video clerk job. TV producer Cynthia Topping (Ellen DeGeneres) wants to do a 24/7 reality show for a failing cable network. They choose to do the show with Ed. His brother Ray (Woody Harrelson) is a bit of a douche. Ray breaks his girlfriend Shari's (Jenna Elfman) heart, and she falls for Ed.If there isn't the gimmick of a TV show, this would be a simple rom-com between McConaughey and Elfman. However, the movie is too simplistic about what a camera following somebody all the time would actually mean. This feels like a Hollywood movie of a Hollywood TV show of a Hollywood reality.Director Ron Howard doesn't actually do edgy that well. It's definitely not his forte. And this movie needs to get down and dirty, but Howard's light touch fails him here. After an interesting start, it quickly gets boring. It's a speed bump in an otherwise great directing career. The sad thing is that it's so obvious that Howard is not up to this job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Energetic, if Mundane, Semi-Drama About the Pressures of Celebrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A decent conceptual drama with a mildly sour twist of social commentary thrown in. Fresh into his career as a leading man, Matthew McConaughey plays into his typecast as a drawling, charming bachelor, this time spiced with the angle of a 24/7 reality show that broadcasts his every waking moment. Naturally, this eventually plays havoc on his personal life, especially when he picks up with his brother's publicity-shy ex (Jenna Elfman). Not quite as interesting or original as 1998's thematic clone The Truman Show, it's still a fair (if light) take on the cult of celebrity with some good, unexpected curves peppering the plot. McConaughey is unbearable in a few scenes, but he's at least believable as the naive, overnight celebrity everyman adopted by pop culture. Warm and charming at times, thin and predictable at others, it's a good effort with a curiously accurate prediction about the surge of reality programming that was on the horizon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"EdTV" is Hollywood's remake of the 1994 French-Canadian hit "Louis 19: le roi des ondes". I'm not going to compare the two films. The only reason I mentioned it is to set the record straight that "EdTV" (1999) is NOT a ripoff of "The Truman Show" (1998) since the screenplay was bought years earlier."EdTV" is a somewhat Orwellian comedy/drama about an everyman named "Ed" who falls victim to society's hi-tech voyeurism. Ed becomes the pawn of a bunch of network suits who broadcast (and do their best to ruin) his entire life to the thrill of millions of viewers. I think it would've worked better as a no-holds-barred satire (like the movies "LIVE", "ROBOCOP", "AMERICAN DREAMZ" or the masterpiece "BRAZIL", but director Ron Howard opts to take the kinder, gentler approach which ends up watering down the message &amp; its impact on us.Not only that, but today the story isn't as edgy as it might have been back in the 90s when reality TV was just budding, and we didn't know where it would lead. Today's audiences might think "what's the big deal?" and to be honest I found myself thinking that a few times during the picture. But I do remember the 90s and the whole reality-TV phobia which fueled such stories as this, and that's what made it an entertaining film for me. If you remember the 90s and your first reactions to the new phenomenon called reality TV, you might enjoy it too.At times the film teases us with challenging philosophies, in particular there's the intriguing line: "Ed is the apotheosis of a prevailing American syndrome. It used to be that people were famous for being special. Now they're considered special merely for being famous. Fame has become a moral good in this country: It's its own virtue" Unfortunately, the film never follows up on such thoughts and instead runs back to predictable drama, such as the girlfriend who can't deal with cameras invading her life, or the cliché about Ed being hounded by brainless fans all the time. These plot devices undermine the power of a film like this, reducing the film to passing entertainment instead of something more thought-provoking.The whole film struck me as being a very "Ron Howard" production, which means a shiny, polished presentation and a predictable Disney-like story with no real surprises or tension. It dazzles us with a great star-studded cast and a lot of gloss (the budget was an estimated $60 million... five times as much as 1999's Academy Award winner "American Beauty"). But I was much more impressed with the relatively obscure films "LIVE" (a satire about a reality show where the contestants play Russian roulette), "CASI DIVAS" (a great Mexican comedy/satire about a nationwide search for new talent), and an unknown comedy gem called "SPECIAL" about an ordinary chump who takes an experimental drug and becomes... uh... special. These 3 films deliver entertainment but more importantly they carry a lot of weight behind what they're telling us. "EdTV" had a few noteworthy scenes, such as the funeral confrontation between the two brothers, but these scenes were deleted from the final release and can only be seen on the DVD extras. The result is a somewhat breezy and entertaining but unimportant film."EdTV" is worth the price of admission, and it kept me entertained from start to finish. But if you want a little more substance to feed your brain, try to check out the other films I mentioned above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good premise, mediocre movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a bit of a shame that EdTV is always compared to The Truman Show, because it's really not a rip-off, just a lighter treatment of similar subject matter. With the rise of reality TV in the late 90's, loss of personal privacy was a hot subject and so it's quite legitimate for more then one movie to be made about it; and both movies treat the subject differently, Truman with a more philosophical angle and EdTV with a social one, and with a more comedic direction. And the story does bring its own message, one that's poignant and clear and aged well over the last decade of reality-reign.Unfortunately , none of that helps the fact that the movie just isn't very good. Ron Howard's directorial work, as it always is, is professional but hollow, using every trick of the trade ably and without soul. He can make it slide, though; or could have, if the script would have been better. The dialog may have been written specifically to sound everyday and authentic, but a lot of the lines would have sounded unrealistic if spoken on Big Brother. As for the acting - the horrible Matthew McConaughey actually pulls off a better-than-average performance for his abilities, but it's not enough to pull it together; Woody Harrelson is mediocre at best; much worse yet are two mediocre TV actresses - Jenna Elfman and Ellen DeGeneres - who told Ellen she could act? - who really fall short with very flat characters and very unconvincing deliveries. Some quality supporting actors - Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper and Rob Reiner in a terrific performance - and some nice cameos from Jay Leno, Bill Maher, Michael Moore and other prominent media men of the time, help it along but it's not enough.So for the story alone, it's worth a watch, and it makes some pretty interesting points about the role of the media in demolishing personal freedoms (and it's quite amazing that it was made before the Bush administration, because some direct connections could easily be made) and it's often enjoyable, but while The Truman Show and Pleasantville may be remembered for many years to come, EdTV is ultimately as forgettable as any middle-of-the-road American comedy.</fullReview>

Ahead of the MTV-type show it's satirising it essays all the attractions and pitfalls of such a dead-end genre. Inbetween are any number of clever appropriations of current TV shows and celebrities, and all the practical quirks of getting such coverage on the TV - the crowds, crazies and camera moves.Matthew McConaughey gives a stand-out performance as the eponymous Ed. Jenna Elfman is a terrific Renée Zellweger-type for people who find Zellweger trying. Martin Landau isn't just there to bolster his pension either.

Jenna Elfman, who played the hippie wife in dharma and greg, didnt really fit in the movie in my opinion. perhaps another leading lady, like renee zilweger or leelee sobelki would have done a better performance. this movie is on sometimes on tbs, and they usually do several repeats over and over again, so if you have the opportunity to watch cable, then watch edtv.</fullReview>

I also notice a lot of people compared it to the Truman Show I enjoyed the Truman Show but enjoyed this even more. This is partly due to the fact it was more realistic in that in The Truman Show everyone around Truman is acting and playing a part in keeping Truman from the truth. As you probably guessed the whole nation is gripped by ED similar to the way Big Brother is with audiences simple idea but is addictive we see this in ED's first few days on TV when people are criticising their roommates and partners for watching it soon they become hooked my favourite character was Ed's step dad Al every time Al spoke in the film I laughed every line he said was funny. Another thing I enjoyed most about the film is that in a way you felt as though you where really watching like the millions across America hooked on the Ed phenomenon which I think Truman Show tried to do but didn't really succeed in doing.

		<shortDescription>Reality is for people who can't handle TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an adaption of `Louis 19, le roi des ondes' a French Canadian film made in 1994, which, being French Canadian, got no US release to speak of, but was prophetic in predicting the rise of reality TV. You can of course indulge in voyeurism via the Internet, and the idea of a struggling cable company persuading some poor mug to have their cameras on him or her 24 hours a day is not so fanciful. What is a bit more fanciful is that an audience would find much continuing interest in such a show. In the original French Canadian film, the hero's life was pretty dull, so the TV executives tried to liven it up. Here, though, there is plenty of drama going on in the life of Ed, a 31 year old video store clerk, at least once the program hits the air. He becomes involved with his philandering brother's girlfriend, his brother hits back with a `spite book', he becomes the target of various fortune-seekers including an aspiring British actress (Liz Hurley, sleep-walking), a long-lost parent reappears, and various other calamities happen. The original producer of the show (Ellen DeGeneres) is sickened by the whole thing, but the station manager (Rob Reiner), buoyed by the ratings, insists the show goes on, until Ed finds a thoroughly satisfying way of escape. There is nothing particularly adventurous about the film ? Peter Weir's`The Truman Show', on a similar theme, was much more ambitious and `Series 7' was much more biting. I suppose Ron Howard is the Capra of his day. Here he has given us some reasonably lively entertainment helped a great deal by a very strong cast both in the major and minor roles. Matthew Maconaughey is quite outstanding as the good-natured Ed and he is ably supported by Woody Harrelson as his gym fascist brother. Rob Reiner made a good villain and it was a delight to see Dennis Hopper and Martin Landau as the two dads. Ellen DeGeneres had a little trouble establishing her part at the start but her wacky resignation speech made up for that. It all goes back to what P T Barnum said - nobody ever went broke underestimating public taste ? but at times I wonder whether people really want Springer and the rest. It would be nice to be able to watch TV with your children and not feel ashamed. Unfortunately for us Homer Simpsons of this world it's getting harder to find suitable family viewing. Well, we can always turn the bloody thing off, but then what would we talk about with our friends and workmates?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing AT ALL like "the Truman Show"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This poor film can't have one single review without the film "The Truman Show" being mentioned in comparison. I get sick and tired of this happening constantly to great films. "The Truman Show" is a drama, about a person being taken advantaged of without his knowing, and his fight for freedom and the truth. "EDtv" is a comedy (albeit, with some drama), about personal privacy, fame, and relationships. You cannot compare these films just because of ONE similarity: the main characters life is on TV 24-hours per day. A similar example can be seen with "The Sixth Sense". This was a fantastic film about certain characters being able to see ghosts. Two weeks later, a film named "Stir of Echoes" is released, and automatic references to "Sixth Sense" are made. Each film is fantastic in their ghost stories and twists. And yet, "Stir" didn't have a chance after reviewers compared it to "Sense". It was a great film, but it was killed before people had a chance to see it for themselves. Unfortunately, "EDtv" has this disease too.I never laughed so hard after seeing Matthew McConaughey's character bumble through fame, public opinion, and his relationship with (perfectly cast) Jenna Elfman. Even funnier is the supporting character (again, perfectly cast) of Ed's brother: Woody Harrelson. The most surprising, and perhaps most likable character, is the one portrayed by Ellen DeGeneres!! This is one of those lost, great comedies that few people have seen. I highly reccomend it - if you can, see it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haven't I seen this before? Oh yea, when it was called The Truman Show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I really liked this movie, but I believe it to be a very bad choice by the movie studio to release it at the same time as Jim Carrey's critically acclaimed Truman Show. While the `other' movie got a lot of much deserved press and Oscar buzz, EdTv was left behind to soak in that often traveled river of average movies. Matthew McConaughey is great as Ed Pekurney, the lucky man who gets to have every minute of his life broadcast over the airwaves for all to see. In its defense, EdTv is a completely different movie than the `other.' While The Truman Show followed the life of someone who wasn't aware he was being televised, EdTv gives Ed the chance to interact with the viewing audience. This opens a lot of new plot options, and creates the illusion that EdTv is on a different level than The Truman Show. McConaughey was an excellent choice for this role coming off of A Time to Kill. He is great at portraying the childish, yet tender Ed that the role calls for. Jenna Elfman plays Shari. Shari is torn between Ed, whom she has liked ever since they met, and her boyfriend Ray, Ed's crazy brother. Elfman sadly misses with her delivery and never really convinces the audience that she belongs. Woody Harrelson is Ray Pekurney, Ed's brother. He is spectacular in his role, and really brings together the whole craziness of a picture such as this. I suggest this movie to all who have seen The Truman Show, and want to see a different look to this similar idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, came out at the worst possible time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EDTV is actually not as bad a film as some critics made it out to be. It only came out at the worst possible time which was a little less than a year after "The Truman Show". McConaughey plays Ed Pekurney, a decent video store clerk and Burt Reynolds fan who agrees to have his life filmed for 24 hours. At first, not much happens and then it slowly starts to build up and becomes a national phenomenon. Woody Harrelson plays his dimwitted, fame seeking brother who is trying to profit off of Ed's show. EDTV takes a good look at fame and how it can destroy your life. I heard Ron Howard was considerably angry at the failure of EDTV and blamed Universal's marketing dept. EDTV is an all around good film, aside from a few missing things, it's good entertainment. Howard does good by not portraying the technical crew that films Ed, as sadistic people but decent guys just doing their job. Rob Reiner is good as a slimy TV exec and Dennis Hopper in a small role. EDTV was overshadowed by the echo of The Truman Show only the plot point is actually different. Aside from The Truman Show where a guy lives in a created world, unknowing that he is filmed, EDTV is about a guy who knows he's filmed and it just shows how his life is affected by the fame. Inspired casting.</fullReview>

The film boasts a talented cast but Matthew McConaughey has slipped from a stellar performance (a time to kill) to a lazy performance in Edtv. Sally Kirkland was just annoying as the mother and Dennis Hopper wasn't in the film to give him a billing. The film rested on four capable actors shoulders, ellen DeGeneres, Martin Landau, Clint Howard and Rob Reiner, they make it work. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not The Truman Show, but also a very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all: This is NOT a copy of The Truman Show. It's a movie that has some similarities to Truman, but the main idea is different. In The Truman Show, Jim Carrey is not aware of it, but in this movie, Matthew has signed to be on TV all day long. We get to see what this brings up for him and the movie has a great balance between comedy and drama. Well, not really drama, but it became more serious than I thought it would ( which was very good for the movie). The movie has a great and talented cast, including Matthew McConaughey, Ellen DeGeneres, Jenna Elfman and many others. Even tough it takes like 10 - 15 minutes to get started, it is a very good movie I enjoyed so much. Very funny but also serious moments. Don't think you should miss this movie when you've seen Truman. You'd miss a wonderful movie. I rate it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edtv is a credible and entertaining version of what television has always been about: voyeurism and exhibitionism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard got it right. Human beings are essentially voyeurs and exhibitionists at heart all the way to our own demise, given the opportunity. This film presents a believable view of the evolution of tv programming over time. Real people have been depicted on television since its inception, sometimes erudite and sometimes ridiculous. What was different in the distant past was that the interaction was basically one way. We were mainly voyeurs and the viewer could simply turn off the tube when no longer interested. More recently it has become apparent that the medium has a tremendous capacity for being interactive. Now we can be exhibitionists as well! Taken too far, however, our use of the medium is self-destructive.Hollywood and just about everyone else got it all wrong. This was the "real mccoy". It is too bad that it was released just a few months after the Truman Show, a much weaker film that relied on a far-fetched premise to evoke our sentimentality.And, hey, Edtv proved that Matthew McConaughey can actually act!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Ed T.V. the more it went on. It is creative and unique. And, it was directed by Ron Howard. Those are what make it an ok film. However, I liked it less than I thought I would. It ended a strong 8, but started out as a 6. Once Ed went on T.V., it became increasingly interesting. Prior to that, it was boring.Another problem I had with the movie were the support characters. I didn't find any of them particularly appealing - even Woody Harrelson (except his chicken dance which was classic). For the most part Rob Reiner, Dennis Hopper, Martin Landau, Ellen DeGeneres and Jenna Elfman were just adequate for the roles. Thus a downgrade of a point.Something about the premise of the movie just left me feeling a little less than enthusiastic. I consistently had a difficult time accepting it. Consequently, I have to downgrade it a point on that too.Add the slow start and you have a 7. Not a waste of time or money, but certainly not a movie you would want to see twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I watched this pleasantly funny, surprisingly entertaining flick by Ron Howard, of ANDY GRIFFITH and HAPPY DAYS fame, I noticed that the movie consists of alot, ALOT of television actors. Rob Reiner from ALL IN THE FAMILY, Ellen DeGeneres from ELLEN, Woody Harrelson from CHEERS, Walter Matthau from MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, Jenna Elfman from DHARMA &amp; GREG, and even Ralph Malph from HAPPY DAYS.I don't know how Hollywood works. It seems like every year there has to be two similar movies coming out near the same time and compete with each other. Whether its volcanos erupting or meteors hitting the earth or even computer-animated bugs, there's always a pair. The difference is usually that one plays as intelligence or serious drama and the other is popcorn fare. This movie, which battled the inventive and intelligent TRUMAN SHOW as a movie about real life on television, is of the popcorn kind.This movie is hardly a mirrored image of THE TRUMAN SHOW. Matthew McConaughey, as Ed, KNOWS he's on camera, LIKES his fame, and comes to exploiting himself. The only similarity, I can think of, it having with TRUMAN, is the numerous scenes in which real people are watching.EDTV is more of a satire of MTV's THE REAL WORLD, where producers try to exploit real dramas and conflicts of young people living together and sculpt them into likable and dislikable characters through editing.EDTV is LIVE on the air, so it's hard to sculpt Ed or the people he comes in contact with, but that's what is so fun. The people in his hometown watch his travels eagerly on T.V. and when they see him come walking on their street, they stick their head out of the window and yell for Ed, so they can be on TV. There's even a gang that follows Ed from time to time, and he is even asked to give out autographs. Ed's phenomonal show gets so popular, that there is a poll of whether he should dump his shy girlfriend (Elfman) or go with a sassy model he met on the Tonight Show (Elizableth Hurley). The high percentage go for Hurley because they want to see someone sexier and more attractive on the show, no matter how well she fits with Ed. Hurley's model hardly cares. She just wants to be on television, and the (near)sex-scene they have, all recorded live(!) is RED HOT (something TRUMAN lacks).I thought this movie would be more predictable than it is. You know Ed is going to eventually hate the popularity and fame and try to wiggle out of it as the network tries to keep him on to keep the high ratings, but how the movie ends was something even I couldn't have predicted. Jenna Elfman is very likable here, maybe because she isn't her usually aloof self. I like McConaughey, but he played his character so slacker-ish and gruff, he seemed drunk and high even as he was sweet and good-hearted. Harrelson shined, with the few scenes he had, as the brother who writes a book with the funniest title ever.Oh, and Jay Leno makes a very funny appearance.In conclusion, this isn't better than THE TRUMAN SHOW, because it doesn't strive to be. It's a Ron Howard film, so it's quite high-lit even as it tries to be risque. There are many scenes that are touching and sad, especially the one containing Dennis Hopper, but ultimately it's a movie that has more strength on video than in theaters. It fits your television nicely (maybe because it was intended that way). Where TRUMAN deserves an A, this runner-up deserves a marginal B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, "The Truman Show" was not supposed to be entirely funny (a "serious message" there), but I not only found "Edtv" funnier, I found the serious message--such as it is--more understandable and less pretentious. (Actually, this movie appears to be an imitation not of "Truman" but of "Louis 19," a French comedy released five years earlier.) I do not give this movie the highest rating because I think a lot of the laughs are cheap, yet I admit to being entertained, and that counts for a great deal in my estimation. I also enjoyed the twists in the plot and the way TV viewers in the movie directly relate to Ed (not a possibility in "The Truman Show" because that "show" is a secret kept from Truman). Martin Landau et al. turn good performances in "Edtv," a movie that has been under-rated just because it came out too close on the heels of the Jim Carrey vehicle.</fullReview>

There's a superficial similarity in their basic concept, but otherwise they are completely different (and I loved Truman - still can't understand what the Academy thought it was doing).There was not one dull moment, and at times I though I would pee myself laughing (and it takes a lot for me to say that to a world wide audience!) I don't remember laughing so much at the cinema since Speed 2 - but this time for the right reasons.So it was funny, but there were also genuinely moving sad bits.Martin Landau absolutely stole the film with some killer one-liners, but all the performances were fantastic (even Liz Hurley didn't make me cringe, as she poked fun at her own reputation) Ellen is great, as is Woody Harrelson (who looks uncannily like his on-screen brother) and I always love Adam Goldberg. Matt McConaughey is perfect, whether he's being a jerk or doing the right thing (oh OK, and damn cute with it.)The whole thing is probably enhanced by being so utterly believable, and ends with a great anti-corporate finger (literally, in fact, now I think about it)</fullReview>

The Truman Show and Ed TV does not make a genre.

Liz Hurley was one of the funnier parts - never have I seen such a one dimensional and comical character in what was promoted as a (semi) serious film!Woody Harrelson was as good as ever as Ed's brother (classic book he released called "My brother pissed on me"!), and Matthew McConaughey was back to one of his better roles since he so impressed in A Time To Kill.This film was well scripted and eminently watchable, and there is an excellently done conclusion as to how to stop the TV cameras following Ed and his family around.Jenna Elfman was vomit enducingly nice - although that's clearly what the character called for - and Martin Landau again shows us that his acting talent was wasted in that dreadful TV series Space: 1999.Definitely worth seeing and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More realistic than The Truman Show, but not quite as good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had the misfortune of coming out shortly after The Truman Show, a very different movie based on the same premise. The Truman Show took a fantasy approach, with lots of features that required suspension of disbelief: the completeness of the simulated world, Truman's questioning of a world that was self-consistent to him even where it was wrong to us, long-term co-stars who didn't feel guilty about deceiving him, etc. This movie took the realistic approach of someone fully aware of his situation, and trapped not by walls and deception, but a sucker's contract. They share the questionable idea that constant surveillance of someone's life can hold an audience, but make that believable by making the stars' lives interesting.The fact that it's more realistic than The Truman Show doesn't make it a better movie, but it's still very good. The people signing up for the show are thrilled by the idea of exploiting the good aspects of fame, but also skeptical right from the start. Still, they're either too eager to sign up or not clever enough to read all the fine print, and jump into a contract that exploits the power imbalance between ordinary people and a big business (even though the network had been struggling, it was still a big business).It's just right the way the executive who demeans Ellen Degeneres for her questionable idea, and gives her total credit for it, later tries to steal the credit for the show when it's a hit. Predictable, but only because we all know people who behave like that.A particularly clever detail is the way the continuous ads at the bottom of the show's screen progress from cheap-looking text ads for small businesses to spiffy graphic ads for national businesses, as the show's ratings rise.It's foreshadowed from the start -- the skepticism about the contract -- that Ed will eventually regret signing up for the show. But when the burden of fame gets to him, we don't have any idea how he can escape, and it seems he doesn't either. What does he do? That would be a spoiler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Opposite of The Truman Show-shouldn't be compared to it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the comments here compare EdTV -- flatteringly or unflatteringly -- to The Truman Show. This is a totally invalid comparison in my opinion, unless you intend to compare opposites. EdTV is almost the opposite of The Truman Show. Where The Truman Show was about TV as the ultimate deception (a man is totally shielded from the real world, and his fictionalized life is exposed without his knowledge for the amusement of the masses), EdTV is about TV as the ultimate truth-teller (a man is totally revealed to the real world, and his real life is exposed with his full knowledge for the amusement of the masses). Perhaps they're flip sides of the same coin, but they are definitely flip sides...calling it any kind of imitation of The Truman Show misses the point of the film. Its the antithesis of The Truman Show.As to quality, it is generally solid if not spectacular. There is a bit of a TV-ish quality to it...it would work just as well as a made-for-TV movie as on the big screen. It also suffers a little from some unbelievable moments showing how Ed can't have a private conversation with anyone without a camera six inches from his face. It's done for effect, but there's no reason the cameras couldn't have gotten the exact same picture from further away by simply zooming in. The performances are all pretty good. I especially liked Jenna Elfman as Ed's suddenly overexposed girlfriend. The screenplay is witty in places, if unremarkable.All in all, a worthwhile look at an extreme example of the voyeuristic nature of modern entertainment. A good rental. I give it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A light hearted look at the fame game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the critics got it wrong when they reviewed this movie as a second rate Truman Show. The latter, much more akin to Pleasantville, is an Orwellian parable on social engineering and the insidious corrosiveness of conformity. EDTV on the other hand has much less lofty ambitions and has perhaps more in common with Woody Allen's Celebrity. It is a light hearted and comical look at the idea of fame as a virtue, the achievement of which is enough to make you famous. It reflects the public's insatiable appetite for celebrity, and a belief that it is their inalienable right to invade other people's privacy. Ed Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey) is a video store clerk and all around good guy, who agrees to have his life filmed 24 hours a day for "True TV." Needless to say, once the cameras invade his life and lured by the promises of riches and fame, Ed loses more than he gains, including his privacy, his dignity, his family, his friendships and his girlfriend. All he is left with is fame and he can't barter that for anything, nor unshackle himself from its clutches. Shari (Jenna Elfman) endures the vilification of the American public that polls show, doesn't think she's good enough to be Ed's girlfriend. Ray (Woody Harrelson) takes advantage of the media frenzy surrounding his brother, to promote one self-serving scheme after another. The myriad lies and deceptions of his mother Jeanette (Sally Kirkland), and her marriage to second husband Al (Martin Landau) are revealed, warts and all, under the glaring lights of the camera. And long-lost biological father Hank (Dennis Hopper), miraculously re-enters Ed's life for personal gain. Rounding out the group of sycophants is Jill (Elizabeth Hurley), a ruthlessly ambitious model/actress who taps in to Ed's fame to advance her career. Setting all of this havoc-wreaking activity in motion is Cynthia (Ellen DeGeneres), the TV executive who seeks to appease the whims of her egomaniacal boss Whitaker (Rob Reiner). What we witness is Ed's ascension in to fame heaven, his fall to infamy hell and his eventual redemption when he regains control of his own life. While the omnipresent eye of Big Brother watches over both Truman and Ed, there is a significant difference between them. Truman is completely unaware that his entire life is being scripted by someone else. Ed not only knows his every move is being monitored, but he made the choice to allow it to happen. The flaw in both movies is that the "bad" guys are misidentified. Much like the Truman Show, where the evil manipulator gets his comeuppance when the hero escapes his virtual reality, Ed turns the tables on his so-called victimisers, the moronic TV executives. It seems to me that they too are simple peons in the fame game. The true culprit is the public; those who subsidise the invasion of privacy industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody Loves Ed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of us, if only for a moment, have wondered what it would be like to be famous. Now, we need wonder no more. In EDtv, director Ron Howard (Apollo 13, Ransom) takes a self-reflecting and often hilarious look into the not-so-private life of the celebrity. But the beauty here is that the celebrity here is not really a celebrity; he's just an everyday Ed Pekurny. When Northwest Broadcasting Company's (NWBC) flagship cable channel, True TV (a station devoted to Real TV-like documentary programming) falls so low in the ratings that they find themselves playing catch-up to stations like the Gardening Channel, programming director Cynthia Topping (played charmingly by Ellen DeGeneres) decides that it's time for a drastic change. So, in a last-ditch effort to boost ratings and save her job, Topping suggests putting an ordinary person's life on live cable TV. It's all live, 24- hours a day, with no script and no editing. It's the ultimate in True TV! Once the project gets the green light from station executive Jim Whitaker (Rob Reiner), Topping sets out to find her star. She eventually settles on Ed Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey), a handsome yet lazy video store clerk who just happened to be in a San Francisco bar where True TV conducts their talent search. Within days, however, Ed is propelled to superstar status, as EDtv becomes a huge hit across the country. Unfortunately, it isn't a picnic for Ed. His blossoming relationship with his brother's camera-shy ex, Shari, (Jenna Elfman) begins to fall apart due to the lack of privacy in Ed's life. Consequently, Ed's relationship with his brother and the rest of his family crumbles. It gets so bad that Ed is not even allowed at his estranged father's funeral because of the television cameras that accompany him everywhere he goes. It is at this point that we begin to question just whether being a celebrity is all that it's cracked up to be. At first glance, EDtv seems suspiciously similar to last year's hit The Truman Show. At least that's what I thought when I first saw the previews. But the two films are actually very different. In fact, Ron Howard pokes fun of the supposed similarities by casting Harry Shearer as a talk-show host (virtually the same role he had in The Truman Show). It's true that they both deal with putting the lives of people on television, but in all actuality the two films deal with two very different questions. The Truman Show looks at the ethical questions involved with putting someone on TV who does not choose to be there, and subsequently is all about the effects this has on the main character. However, EDtv is an exploration of the loss of privacy that results from being a celebrity, and how that effects not only the life of the celebrity and the lives of those around him. As Ed's best friend, John (played by Adam Goldberg) puts it, in one of the best lines in the movie: `With no privacy, there is no dignity.' McConaughey pulls off the innocence and charm that Ed puts in front of the camera quit nicely, but it's the supporting cast that really puts EDtv into high gear. Elfman puts just the right touch amount of emotion into her role, avoiding the selfish sob-queen stereotype that would have been all-too-easy to fall into, and Woody Harrelson is hilarious as Ed's self-absorbed big brother Ray, who sees Ed's good fortune primarily as a golden opportunity to promote his gym. Degeneres gives undoubtedly one of the best performances of her career as the programming director whose die-hard commitment to boosting ratings and keeping her job suddenly seem trivial when it becomes obvious that Ed is no longer enjoying all the attention he is receiving. And the supporting cast of EDtv phenomenal as well. Martin Landau as Ed's Lark-ridden stepfather and Clint Howard (Ron's brother, making his token cameo in a Ron Howard-directed film) as the show's pathetic director, make excellent contributions and keep the laughs coming. But EDtv is as smart and well-made as it is funny, and the message is clear: being a celebrity ain't all that it's cracked up to be. Perhaps after seeing this movie some audience member won't want to become famous anymore. As for me, I'd rather see for myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EdTV is a movie that keeps you laughing and engrosses you. Ed, played by Matt McCoughney, really fits well, and so does Ray, played by Woody Harrelson. The humor is not really sophisticated, it's just simple, silly fun. For some segments you get a little "Ellen" humor from DeGeneres, but she's a minor player. The movie tries to get somewhat serious at times, which I guess adds more to the realism. They want you to see what it is like to be on camera all your life, WHILE YOU ARE FULLY AWARE. This is of course opposed to The Truman Show, where Truman was unaware (until he started picking up clues). So you see a lot of realism (ie. hot-dogging in front of the camera, lots of makeup), and it made me feel like they could actually pull something like this off in real life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EdTV was a thoroughly enjoyable film. Although similar to The Truman Show in that a person's life is filmed, it differs in that Ed (Matthew McConaughey) "knowing- ly" agrees to have his life filmed by a tabloid TV show. The film shows the resulting changes in character and relationships due to this new found fame. Strong performances were made by Mr. McConaughey and Mr. Harrelson who plays his delinquent brother. They are extremely convincing as brothers. A fine performance was also made by Martin Landau as his invalid stepfather. The cast includes a number of other quality actors who portray people who are interesting if not always noble or likable. Although very funny at times EdTV is much more than a comedy. A very entertaining film! Three stars!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dull, and Perhaps Inaccurate Depiction of People's Desire to "Look".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I review a film, I like to try and elaborate on its good and bad points, however in the case of "EdTv", there aren't many good points to speak of. Ron Howard's film is cliched from beginning to end. There is not one surprising element, and the characters are quite dull, with the exception of Ed's brother Ray (Woody Harrelson), who is at moments, quite funny. Mattew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson look like they could actually be brothers, but McConaughey's performance is just plain dull. And speak of dull; people call this a "hilarious comedy". It had a couple of funny moments, but it definitely wasn't hilarious. As well, Dennis Hopper had a throw away performance as Ed's real father. Why bother getting a brilliant actor such as Hopper for a role like this?"EdTv" had a couple of minor elements that were somewhat good. First of all, Ron Howard captures quite well, the fascination that people have with seeing themselves on TV. Second, he repeatedly shows images on television, some in extreme close up, uncovering the individual pixels that make up an image, giving the viewer the feeling of the 'artificial'. TV is an artificial means to anyone's existence, whether you're on TV, or just watching it.The real problem with "EdTv" is its failure to take into account the fact that people act differently when they know they are being filmed. The concept of EdTv is to get into the real life of an average every man by having a volunteer allow a camera crew film every aspect of their life on live TV for two months. But the truth is, people, no matter what setting they are in, respond differently to a camera than to other people. We are lead to believe that this is Ed's real life. Well, it isn't! Early on in the film, Ellen DeGeneres's character says that if you drive by an accident, you can't help, but look "to see if there is that rolling head on the highway". At first I hated this line, because its so cliched in itself; I can remember having heard this line when I was eight or ten. It is however true, people do look and have that desire to look, but something such as an accident is a random and extreme event. These events are what people are interested in seeing. "EdTv" tries to develop a theme around people's desires to watch, but fails miserably. Psychoanalytic film theory has emphasized the importance of the 'look', or the gaze of the audience. This is reflected in its references to the audience as 'the spectator'. 'Looking' is part of an individual's self-definition and relationship to his or her environment. Freudian theory describes the position of the 'spectator' as that of a voyeur, who makes an object of those caught unwittingly in the power of his gaze. The voyeuristic look is one of the pleasures an audience finds in the cinema. One of the real pleasures of 'looking' is the power you feel in knowing that the person who is the subject of your gaze doesn't know that you are looking. "EdTv" doesn't even consider this as an option even though it hinted towards it at the beginning. Films such as "Blue Velvet" and even "Sliver" capture the idea that people want to see what others are doing without them knowing they are being watched.I think that "EdTv" would have been much more interesting if it had considered some of these possibilities. If what occurs in "EdTv" were to actually ever happen, I don't think it would be much of a success. I personally couldn't care a less about some program with a guy knowingly putting on a show for us. Perhaps if you could get into his life and videotape him without his knowing it, it might be interesting. I know this is a scary idea, and most people would not want to admit this about themselves, but more people would watch if the person being filmed had no clue, because that gives us; the audience, the power.*1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon entering the theatre, my expectations were minimal. I hoped to be entertained, at least. Alas, my fellow movie goers, it was not to be. And this is why: 1)The musical score left something to be desired. It neither reinforced the theme nor was it catchy (many of the songs are CONSTANTLY used).2)I found myself agreeing with the mock panel of social commentators that the script called for; they deride "EdTV" for the self-glorifying "boobery" that it is. The audience should never find themselves agreeing with the opposing argument.3)One shot of Clint Howard and everyone knows it's a Ron Howard film (not that it was much of a secret).4)The many-faceted foibles of the lower classes is celebrated to the tune of Bill Clinton and Jerry Springer. If I want to see how tough it is on the bottom I'll just watch one of the aforementioned people.5)This film's cup o' cliches overfloweth. Man rockets to stardom on the wings of neither effort nor perseverance and suddenly he discovers, life's not what it's cracked up to be--you can't have your cake and eat it too.6)Jenna Elfman's ever (more like FOREVER) weepy eyes were irritating. The audience doesn't feel for her, let alone feel sorry for her. It got so bad you simply couldn't stand the sight of her "breaking heart" (and I do use that term loosely). Again, the audience agrees with the supposed "EdTV" fans who don't believe Sheri (Jenna's character) is good enough for Ed.7)There is no rapport or sympathy for any of the characters, save one, Martin Landau. Perhaps it was indeed experience that allowed him to make us laugh at the right moments, but also pull our heartstrings when it was time.Only see this movie if you are absolutely desperate (you know, a gun to the head, Friday night and no date) and even then--Don't blame me if you are just as disappointed as I am.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has been unfairly compared with 'The Truman show'. Although the two films deal with the same subject matter, viewing of them both go into different directions.Matthew McConaughey (Ed) and Jenna Elfman (Shari) are terrific as the couple trying to get together but are forced to confront the camera at every turn. Woody Harrelson (Ray) is great as the Lecherous, fickle and then bitter brother (I won't spoil it by telling you why).Ellen DeGeneres (Cynthia) is great as the cable TV exec who is eventually torn between the job and conscience. Rob Reiner (Whitiker) does a brilliant job as the main exec who is a complete bastard.Ron Howard's direction is smooth and the editing is even better when you get the DVD and see how much was left out. It could easily have been far too long and got bogged down with detail.All in all there are great laughs to be had especially when Ed and Jill (Liz Hurley) have go on a date and may have to actually 'perform' for the cameras. It does ask the question 'How far will TV go to secure ratings?' That question is constantly being answered...This is just great fun. Try not to analyse it too much or you'll ruin it for yourself...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's It All About, Ed?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Texas home video store clerk Matthew McConaughey (as Ed Pekurny) attracts the attention of "True TV" producer Ellen DeGeneres (as Cynthia Topping). She wants to star Mr. McConaughey in a 24-hour reality show. At first, big executive Rob Reiner (as Whitaker) seems reluctant, but Ms. DeGeneres is a persuading advocate for "Ed TV". The TV show is a huge hit, as you may have guessed. The cameras capture McConaughey when he wakes up reaching for himself in sweatpants, and throughout his days. Release forms are signed by McConaughey's friends and relatives. Most often seen are worked-out older brother Woody Harrelson (as Ray) and UPS truck driver girlfriend Jenna Elfman (as Shari)...Everyone loves "Ed" but me. Look at all the fans. All ages, classes, regions, races, creeds, colors and gender preferences are portrayed as avid "Ed" supporters. Granted, McConaughey is a good looking man, but what is his character's appeal? He and his morning "chubby" are a bore. His romantic comedy adventures are not fun or funny. We could see Howard Beale's appeal in "Network" (1976) and get "The Truman Show" (1998). Now, perhaps director Ron Howard and the writers are making a point about US television viewers. If so, the years have proved them accurate."Ed" may intentionally be made a "common man." That's fine, but it still lacks a satirical bite...If you're interested in "movie, movie" making, "Ed TV" has an added interest in that it is a movie about motion pictures (albeit television). The production values are very high, with outstanding cinematography by John Schwartzman. The lighting technicians are especially skillful. Many scenes feature incredibly artful lighting. On televisions in the movie, the visuals are less than lackluster...Long-time followers of Mr. Howard will see his old "Happy Days" pal Donny Most in a minor role. Among the others is the director's brother Clint Howard. For some reason, the camera zooms in on Clint's hair transplant. By the way, we're shown a close-up of McConaughey clipping his toenails, but have no idea how he maintains that perfectly maintained stubble. Veterans Sally Kirkland and Martin Landau are Ed's parents. They do a fine job, and Harrelson is more than convincing as the brother. In fact, Woody looks like Matt's brother. Semi-sexual attraction includes the brothers appearing half-dressed and an arousing woman in thong. Beating all is Elizabeth Hurley (as Jill), who radiates sex...So, maybe "Ed TV" was about watching him have sex, all along. If so, you won't learn or see much.***** Ed TV (1999-03-26) Ron Howard ~ Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson, Ellen DeGeneres</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ed-T.V. (1999): Dir: Ron Howard / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson, Ellen DeGeneres, Martin Landau: Similar to The Truman Show that involves the hero's life to the public. The difference is that Ed is aware of the cameras while Truman must discover it for himself. Another difference is that Ed-T.V seems to address ordinary habits often performed in private. When a TV station receives low ratings, Ellen DeGeneres suggests placing someone's life on T.V. Matthew McConaughey plays ordinary video store clerk Ed. Woody Harrelson plays his brother who wishes to open a gym but is caught on camera with a naked woman. His girlfriend Jenna Elfman detests this and starts dating Ed but she hates the cameras. Insightful directing by Ron Howard who previously made Apollo 13. Terrific performance by McConaughey who plays off the ordinary guy. Jenna Elfman plays his girlfriend who grows frustrated with being rated by the media as Ed's girlfriend. This all pretty much ends with predictable results much like prime time television. Harrelson plays the brother jealous of Ed's success and oblivious to his own failures. DeGeneres counters standard material by solving the plot problem. Martin Landau plays Ed's stepfather whom Ed has a good relationship with. Interesting take on celebrity life capitalizing on The Truman Show. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Martin Landau Is Superb In This Under Rated Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie features one of my favourite Matthew McConaughey performances. And is a movie I think is horribly under rated. It's a movie I can watch at any time, good mood or bad, feeling well or feeling sick, winter, spring, summer or autumn. This movie always holds my attention. Plot In A Paragraph: Television Network, Reality TV, decides to have a show where they show the life of an ordinary guy, 24 hours a day And the ordinary guy they choose is Ed Pekurney (Matthew McConaughey) despite the fact that he didn't film an audition, but appeared on his brother Ray's (Woody Harrelson) audition tape. At first, everything is OK, but soon the presence of the cameras, and ensuing celebrity status cause problems and all sorts of family secrets are revealed to the world. Directed by Ron Howard, filled with great performances, and contains a great score by Randy Edalman and a great song by Bon Jovi "EdTv" was unfortunate to come out a year after Jim Carrey's "Truman Show" which all though also dealt with one man being on TV 24 hours a day, is a totally different concept, as the main star on "The Truman Show" didn't know he was on TV, and didn't know everyone in his life was an actor, in "EdTv" Matthew McConaughey willingly signs up for the show. Sadly it was considered an imitation movie and suffered in comparison at the Box Office.The full cast give great performances McConaughey and Harrelson are always reliable but Jenna Elfman and Ellen DeGeneres more than hold their own. Rob Reiner and Dennis Hopper are both fun and Elizabeth Hurley (Who I have never been a fan of) is perfectly cast as the fame hungry Jill.However, for this reviewer it is Martin Landau as Ed's stepdad who steals the show, He is both hilarious and heartbreaking. Anybody who wants to get into the reality TV world, which is 100% more popular now, than it is was when this movie was made. Needs to watch this show as a warning about the double edged sword of fame/celebrity and reality TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ed TV &gt; Japanese TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had different intentions when I want to rent this movie. I new that "Ed TV" had tried to cash in on the popularity of concept of "The Truman Show" and that would suck completely and I was not wrong. It was a boring, highly contrived, and unfunny film. However, I didn't regret watching it for as I mentioned I had different intentions which were more study and research-like rather than entertainment-like. Let me clarify:For the last 2 years I have been living in Japan. There are many strange and bizarre things about this unusual country in terms of culture, social interactions, and traditions some of which I guess some of you out there are aware of. However, here I would like to talk about a different kind of peculiarity of the Japanese everyday life-Japanese TV (JTV). The weirdness of the JTV transcends any historical, cultural, linguistic or whatever differences-it is just plain bizarre. OK let me try to explain in a few words: JTV strikingly resembles "Ed TV." Actually, the opposite.The Japanese broadcast TV consists of around 10 channels. A group of around 50 people (out of 125 million Japanese) called TV stars, could be seen every single day seven days a week on those 10 channels, as sometimes one person could be seen on three different channels at the same time. All of them are multitalented: they sing, dance, and act (both in comedy and drama); in one show we can see some of them as hosts and on another channel the same people are guests. Some of them, the chosen ones, have 3-4 shows each (as hosts). The others are being sent to foreign countries to try their food, ski or sea resorts, others are taken to some tribes in Africa, South America or in Asia to live with the indigenous people for a week or so and then cry as they leave. And all this is being diligently filmed. The same 50 people everyday. Filmed while playing golf, eating, surfing, eating, traveling, eating, working for example as farmers of constriction workers, eating, shopping, eating, fishing, eating, studying (foreign language or eating etiquette for example), eating bathing, eating, etc. and again eating. Yes that's right - eating comprises about 50% of the Japanese TV content. Amazing. You have to see it to believe it.Which one do I like better JTV or "Ed TV." I would say "Ed TV." 5 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

It happened with Armaggedon &amp; Deep Impact, it happened with the two Robin Hood movies &amp; it happened with this film &amp; the Truman Show. One film stared Jim Carrey (and admittedly was enjoyable) and made a fortune &amp; the other stared Matt McConahey and seemed to get nowhere.In EDtv the main Character (Ed perhaps?!?!) is given the job of living his life normally, except normal involves being followed round by a camera 24/7. Rather like The Truman Show, the character suffers for his public, although unlike the Truman Show, Ed is aware of his problems.I won't deny the plot doesn't go anywhere in this film, but in comparison with the Truman Show, this is an untimately much more realistic (and personally more enjoyable) film. The acting by McConahey, Harrelson (still can't think of him as anything other than Woody in Cheers) and the woman from Darma &amp; Greg is adequate, although nothing special &amp; the laughs are there. This film is only slightly better than average though. It's enjoyable to relax with a few beers with on a quiet night in, however it'll never win any awards (even though Martin Landau is excellent in it). So yeah, for entertainment values, a good film, but for genius &amp; creation values, simply average.</fullReview>

I must say that it did have originality, which I enjoyed and basically the only reason it was bearable to watch. Matthew McConaughy, Jenna Elfman, Ellen DeGeneres and Woody Harrelson star as "EdTV" just misses the target. While it is my opinion that it is a disappointment, I did enjoy how Ron Howard showed the life of a celebrity and all the trials and tribulations they face every day.With performances that were so-so, "EdTV" was a humorous look at celebrity life, which I enjoyed.However, I can't believe so many huge stars contributed to this film. It seemed as if they were more like cameos than actual roles. I give this film a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a real leap forward in the direction that so many movies have been trying to go for the last couple of years, among them Truman Show and Pleasantville, but none come close to EdTV. It's funny and savage and compassionate and devastating. It's us as a culture of vultures. The acting is first-rate, especially McConaughey, Elfman &amp; Landau.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just to clarify some previous comments, I am friends with the son of one of the screenwriters for EdTV, and the concept for this film was developed long before Truman Show came out, but it took longer to finish and release. In fact, my friend expressed to me the concern of TPTB at EdTV that if Truman Show came out first, people would assume that EdTV was a copycat, when that is not the case. BTW, I really liked this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, not too demanding, NOT 'The Truman Show'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since everyone has commented on this movie's resemblance or otherwise to 'The Truman Show', I'll skip that.The UK has been awash with docusoaps for the last couple of years. We've had families, driving instructors, airport staff and the catering corps is the only unit in the military that hasn't been given its own series.EdTV is the logical endpoint of this - what if the cameras kept rolling, there was no commentary and most importantly, what if there was no editor? Would people watch? For most of us, I doubt it, but that wouldn't make much of a movie. So the writers and producers have contrived a dysfunctional family and a good-looking lead. Whilst I couldn't hope to take the lead, I could recognise enough in Ed's family to make me cringe - I'm sure most people could see something of their own lives in the characters.After that, its left to meander to a satisfying conclusion. This is largely thanks to a natural-sounding script - not so funny as to jolt you out of the 'reality', but just funny enough to keep you chuckling.Most of the cast either play themselves or characters that we can recognise from our own experiences. However, particular credit to Matthew McConaughey who comes across as the nice-but-dim guy the producers of a real show would want; and also to Martin Landau - in a handful of lines he steals the movie.Gripes? No, not really, although the product placement appeared to be a little too prominent for my tastes, but I guess that's the way television is made these days as well.If anyone thinks that events in EdTv couldn't be driven by the media, they should check out how the UK press turned 'normal' people in the docusoaps into minor stars. EdTv handles these issues quite well without becoming overly excited.And that's how EdTv comes across - not overly excited. It often doesn't feel like a movie - more a glossily produced piece of television. It won't change your life but you'll have fun for a couple of hours.And now what do I read? Channel 4 in the UK wants to run a 24/7 docusoap and has been inundated with potential Eds... stay tuned, EdTv might be coming to your neighbourhood soon.</fullReview>

It is actually a remake of a French Canadian movie called Louis 19 and this movie was made in 1994, four year before the truman show. I do know why the producer of ED TV waited until 1999 to release it since the movie was in pre-production since 1995.

		<shortDescription>Similar to Truman Show yes, but also completely different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailers for this film, I immediately thought "Hey, they've just ripped-off that brilliant Jim Carrey film!". Maybe I was right. But after seeing EdTV, I have to say that the only similarity is that both of the lead characters are on TV 24 hours a day. Their differences are plentiful:Truman doesn't know he's on TV. Ed does. Ed plays to the camera, Truman doesn't know it's there.Truman is a celebrity at the start of the film and doesn't know it. Ed becomes a celebrity and knows about it.Truman's world is completely fabricated. All his friends and relatives are actors and everything exists in a gigantic studio. Ed's world is the real world. We see the affect of celebrity on his friends and family. Real people can meet Ed and influence the show.Truman has no relatives. Ed's relatives influence the story heavily (especially his brother and parents).The message from the Truman Show is unclear. The message from EdTV is plain and simple - you can turn anyone into a real celebrity, if you treat them like one. There are other messages as well - watch the film and find out.There are yet more differences, but hopefully I've shown that there are enough that these two films can be classed as different. I recommend that everyone see them both, because they are both very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't compare EDtv with the Truman Show, it would be comparing out of their respective genres, and we can't have that now, can we? I mean, how would you like it if someone compared "End of Days" with "Sense and Sensibility"? Right...it wouldn't work.The major difference is this: EDtv is "realistic" whereas Truman Show is more like a fairy tale. You're not supposed to believe it. You're supposed to take it to your heart.And since EDtv is supposed to be more "real", that's why it doesn't work as well. Only two or perhaps three of the main characters are vaguely believable, the entire set of blowhards that constitute the network owners are just a bit too mean to be for real and the overall scheme is a bit dumb - I mean, as soon as Ed becomes the TV star, he is no longer a normal person. And the entire premise is destroyed - the network will break their own contract!Well... I did enjoy some parts, except for Degeneres and Harrelson, whom I am REALLY beginning to get tired of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should *not* be compared with "The Truman Show"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that for some obscure reason is unfairly overlooked by the media and the movie audience. And, in the case of "EdTV", it also gets unfairly compared by other, more successful films. While "The Truman Show" and "EdTV" shares the basic theme, the films are *not* alike at all. Truman is not aware that he is being filmed and actors are surrounding him: his life is fake. In the case of Ed, it is his own choice to be in the docusoap, and while "The Truman Show" is a bit unbelievable, EdTV could be a fact almost any day now. The TV channels of today are unhealthily obsessed with people's private lives, and many people seem to be unhealthily obsessed by themselves. Docusoaps are taking over the TV world and I think EdTV is not very far away.I still think that "The Truman Show" is, by far, the better film, but "EdTV" is certainly a very entertaining film in its own right and I don't think it's fair to compare it to "The Truman Show". I've never liked Matthew McConaughey, but the part as Ed seems to be perfect for him. And Woody Harrelson is very entertaining in an supporting role as Ed's obnoxious brother. Very entertaining, but about half an hour too long. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's deja vu all over again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edtv suffers by the inevitable comparison to the similar and superior "The Truman Show" (1998). Frankly, I'm surprised that a director of the caliber of Ron Howard would be involved in the making of this clone. This will definitely not go down as one of his greatest films.The story involves a cable network called True TV deciding to televise the daily life of an everyman to the nation. A cast of talented people is largely wasted. To theirs and Howard's credit they, for the most part, almost carry it off. Unfortunately, the story degenerates into the Hollywood formula boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back formula, complete with the contrived happy ending.Matthew McConaughey stars as Ed and is one of the reasons that I didn't like this film. He is not believable as the main character and goes through the entire film looking like he needs a bath and a shave, and dressed as though he picked his clothes out of the laundry hamper. Woody Harrelson is wasted as Ed's brother. He has little to do after the first half hour. I think he would have been much better in the lead role than was McConaughey.Of the rest of the cast, Ellen Degeneres as the producer and Rob Reiner as the network executive are good, as is Martin Landau in a limited role. I would have liked to seen more of the Landau character. Dennis Hopper turns up all too briefly as Ed's long lost father and Sally Kirkland is over the top as his mother. Jenna Elfman plays the heroine and Elizabeth Hurley sizzles as the actress trying to seduce Ed for her own gain.In the end, EDtv is too much like but not near as good as "The Truman Show".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahh, doesn't it just make you wish Ed really was on TV? He just comes across as the most likeable guy in the history of cinema, and you can't help enjoying every scene he's in (which is most of them) and wanting more when the film has finished. The other characters are also very well cast and played, in particular Shari (Jenna Elfman) and Cynthia (Ellen DeGeneres). Oh and it has Liz hurley in it too so that can only be a plus (she continues to defy my concept of perfection...) The plot is ok, with some good twists and turns. The writer takes some good angles on a story which could have been a boring disaster. The comedic moments are sufficient but not quite on a par with the top comedies of late. After a while you start to get as annoyed with the TV cameras as Ed does, but luckily he turns the tables on the fat-cat producers and there's a happy ending.By the way, anybody who knocks this film for copying The Truman Show, go away because recently there have been 2 volcano films, 2 asteroid films, etc and there are genres out there which have been done to death and keep on rolling. You should be thankful that film-makers are probing the depths of new genres and not writing them off as soon as one film has been done.Oh yeah, and what was that kickass song off the soundtrack? - "this is real life, this is real love..." etc. Cool.Anyhoo, top marks (well 9 at least) for some good fun and games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what we talk about when we talk about TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get it straight: Ron Howard is not, and never will be, a Great Director. He hasn't Spielberg's faux-naive look, nor he has Stone's sheer (and sometimes uncontrolled) talent or Scorsese's technique. He doesn't seem to have anything to say, obsessions to share, you know, all the things from which you can tell a real artist from an entertainer. That's what he is: just a normal, plain, honest entertainer. And God knows we need genuine entertainers. There is no genius in EdTV. Do not expect to see any unforgettable scene, just witness how an ordinary look on ordinary life can produce a very good movie. Unlike The Truman Show, EdTV is a story where there is little to discover. Ed knows he's on TV all the time, the people know he lives in a real place and, at first it's all right with them. But will the intrusion of TV leave the lives of the characters untouched or, more likely, it will make them change, thus losing the "honesty" that made them worth watching? More "Tootsie" than "Truman Show", EdTV's structure is a perfect circle, a story about people being changed by sudden fame and their (hopeless?) wish to get (almost) back from where they started. The cast of actors is good, ranking from a great Martin Landau to a poor (although stunningly beautiful) Elizabeth Hurley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Media as the ultimate vampire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EDTV is a great movie about life, or rather, the loss if it. People have always been selling their possessions in exchange for wealth. It's been a long time since they started selling out even very private things (like their own body). EDTV is about giving away our ultimate belonging... our life. And the movie is very effective in showing how it's in our nature to complain about the loss of something only after such thing is gone. One might argue that the movie is quite lengthy, that it takes way too much time for the director to prove his point. But maybe Ron Howard wanted to test how morbid the spectators could really be... and I am not talking about those in the movie, I am talking about us. After all the only real "bad guy" of EDTV is the public itself, the only one who can never get enough of Ed's life and misfortunes. But where does this place us? We are not in the same position that EDTV's audience is... we do know "the head that's going to roll" (or whatever expression Cynthia uses. The version I have seen was dubbed in Italian). We know ED far better than those in the movie do. And it doesn't really matter that ED is a fictional character (what's fiction if not the representation of something that has just not happened yet?), he is real to us. So, if by the end of movie, we were still there gloating about it, well... We shouldn't be too hard on the people in the movie and their nosy attitude. One last thing. Saying that EDTV is a pallid remake of Truman Show, it's like saying that 2001 and Alien are the same thing just because they talk about space travel. Though the final message might be the same (ie "an ordinary but real life is better than a perfect but fake one"), the two movies walk two diametrically opposing paths. Truman show is about someone who thinks he has a life and then finds out that it's life doesn't not really exists, so he exchanges the former for the latter. EDTV is about someone who has a real life and gives it away in exchange for money and no life at all, just to eventually end up wanting the former back. Truman does not "know what he is missing", he never had a choice, because the risk he takes will always be better than nothingness. ED knows what he is going to miss, but he needs times to realize it.</fullReview>

Truman: Guy didn't know he was on TV.Ed: Guy WANTS to be on TV, and doesn't think about what it's going to do to himself, or more importantly, his family.I enjoyed this movie for what it was: A comedy. There were some serious moments, but over all it's a junk food movie. One you want to watch without getting some DEEP life meaning. It's a fun flick.I'd recomend it to any one. I'd have HATED to be Sherry though. There are a lot of women I know who's egos would be deflated if they saw the world was taking a poll on whether or not she was worthy of her boyfriend!! &lt;-- on that note, when Ed stops to look at the list of "who people think he should be with"... you just wanna smack him.

Likewise, it is not as good as the "The Truman Show" but it does it's job well.We see Ed living a normal life the way he normally does, but we also see how television twists that life, and removes total privacy from Ed and his family's life. Early on in the film, Ray (played well by Woody Harrelson) cheats on his girlfriend. Ordinarily, no one other than Ed would've known, but as a consequence of television, this act of unfaithfulness is broadcast direct to her within seconds.Ed tv works well at showing that television does remove privacy, but it does fall into it's own trap of setting events up to make it more interesting (a la Liz Hurley's character, Jill). All in all, it works well, and the ending is a treat.</fullReview>

Clint Howard as the director of Edtv (in the movie) with implanted hair (Yes, we all know why Ron is wearing a baseballcap) and Dennis Hopper who gets fired from his role in The Truman Show makes an appearance in Edtv. Edtv is very funny and can't be compared with another movie. This movie left me with one question though: When will Alexandra Holden get a serious part in a movie, instead of playing college girls all the time?</fullReview>

I went knowing this was a "no-brainer", but got pleasantly surprised by the performances of Ellen DeGeneres and Sally Kirkland. Wonderful characters I wanted to see more of. Unfortunately, they were supporting cast. Not a heavy thinker's movie, but if you want to just laugh, to escape for a couple of hours, see EDtv. You'll get what you went for, lots of laughs.

		<shortDescription>Tedious and dull misstep from director Howard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listless and half-baked, Ron Howard's EDtv never manages to quite make it off the ground -- which is too bad, considering the talent involved in the production. Yet another post-modern examination of celebrity and its insidious effect on culture, EDtv itself is a based on the movie Louis XIX: King of the Airwaves. The film is stilted, slow moving, and terribly unfunny, which proves to be a rather sizable liability when embarking on a comedy. Matthew McConaughey coasts through on good old boy charm as the affable video store clerk Ed Pekurny, but even his significant charisma can't bring the proceedings to a boil. I only laughed at one joke: brother Ray's (Woody Harrelson) tell-all book title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much funnier than real life version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edtv rang particular bells for me as the BBC put this idea into practice with a real family around 1974, when compact lightweight video cameras first made this "fly on the wall" documentary approach possible. For weeks a small crew recorded the tedious everyday life of the working class Wilkins family in my home town of Reading, 40 miles west of London. The Wilkins' dirty laundry was aired for national consumption (e.g. Mrs Wilkins' youngest child was not her husband's). Despite the juicy details, the result was dreary beyond belief, despite editing hours of footage down to an hour's transmission a week. It graphically proved the point that most people's ordinary lives are horribly boring to watch. Both in the real life BBC version and the fictional Edtv, working class people were ensnared by money and the "glamour" of TV into providing cheap entertainment by affluent, articulate middle class professionals.Edtv's hero is as charismatic as Martin Luther King in comparison with the Wilkins, and several weeks of his life condensed into two hours make very enjoyable viewing. The film is hardly a profound examination of the relationship between media and audience, but it illustrates very directly the nonsense of "objective observation" as far as most modern journalism and news coverage are concerned. The media instantly affect whatever they are trying to record, making the TV chief's insistence that Ed carry on his "normal life" (to satisfy the terms of his contract) both hilarious and fatuous (Bravo Rob Reiner for another comedy cameo to match that in "Bullets Over Broadway"). Any pretence of normalcy vanished the second the cameras moved in. As Ed realises too late: "Without privacy there is no dignity". This truism was horribly illustrated in real life by the Wilkins in one unforgettable scene when they discussed their 9 year old's poor school report with the weeping child in front of 10 million viewers. Pity that no one showed Ed a sample of the real life version before he signed his life away to the TV sharks....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EdTV is, for better or worse, the kind of fare I have come to expect from Ron Howard. It is no doubt enjoyable and even intelligent but somehow misses striking the deeper nerve for which, I believe, it aims. That said, this film is still well worth seeing. The sometimes over-extended McConaughey is well-suited to the everyman role of Ed, and DeGeneres's likable sarcasm works in her role as the ambitious TV exec who, after launching EdTV, has serious misgivings about the project. Also impressive are Harrelson, Landau and Kirkland as members of Ed's disfunctional but enjoyable family. Howard's use of cameos (Leno, Mahr, Moore, Plimpton, etc.) is entertaining initially but grows a bit stale. Dennis Hopper's performance as the long-lost father (beware of the cliches) is adequate but a bit too reminiscient of his work in True Romance. (This role was great once, but we don't need to see it again.) To fulfill the obligatory comparison, EdTV is funnier than The Truman Show but lacks the moral and emotional depth that made the latter so beloved. Criticism aside, EdTV is worth seeing for the laugh value. Final score: 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about a guy named Ed who gets his life televised 24/7. I'm getting tired of hearing people compare this to The Truman Show. To me these movies are totally different. They are both great movies. To try and compare the two is unfair to both. For one thing Truman Show is a drama while EdTV is a comedy. Another difference is that Truman's whole life was constructed for him by Christof and Ed freely chooses his fame. I saw The Truman Show as being about paranoia and who can you trust? EdTV is about the price of fame and what your fame can do to the people you love. It is one of the funniest movies of the year. Rating 8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard isn't going for the hole-in-one this time, like when he made "Apollo 13" and "Ransom". This time, it seems, he's just hoping to avoid water hazards and sand traps.Which he does."EDtv" contains a lot of terrific writing from the mostly-reliable team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (anyone remember "Splash"?), but it also features several good performances from its star players. In particular, the work done by Martin Landau and Dennis Hopper is simply miraculous. Landau has, well, never failed to come through, but Hopper is continually a surprise. He has only one major scene in the film, but it is something else. (BTW, the man's been in the biz since "Giant" in 1956--somebody just give him a darned Oscar!)In short, EDtv is funny, somewhat insightful, worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not groundbreaking, but not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard's latest movie seems to be a step backwards after RANSOM, where he tried a film which was outside what we normally associate him with, and didn't quite succeed. So while a satire on celebrity and TV would seem to be a step forward theme wise, it's been done before (this is a remake of a Quebec film called LOUIS XIX: KING OF THE AIRWAVES), and anyway this has more in common with his observational comedy THE PAPER than THE TRUMAN SHOW. The main problem, in fact, is the film mixes uneasily the styles of observational comedy and message movie, and if Howard had picked one tone, the film would have worked more. And one point of comparison with THE TRUMAN SHOW, which is otherwise a completely different movie, deserves mention; the way it treats the people who watch. In THE TRUMAN SHOW, the crowd shots are used sparingly, and we're meant to identify ourselves in them. Here, we're meant to look down on them as boobs, which is condescending.However, let it not be said that Howard doesn't know how to make people laugh. So as a comedy, the film does work pretty well. Also, he knows how to direct actors, so while some just go to the level of sitcom (like Elizabeth Hurley and Martin Landau), others find the meaning, especially the two leads, McConaughey and Elfman, and also Ellen DeGeneres. Elfman in particular I was impressed with, since this is a 180 from her DHARMA &amp; GREG character. Basically, it's not terribly deep, but it entertains.</fullReview>

Movies are gripping and absorbing, this was distancing. Movies invite a certain reverence from the audience, this invited us to laugh at in jokes, make our own comments and cheer wildly as celebrities such as Jay Leno, Ru-Paul and Michael Moore make cameos.While I laughed when I pay my nine Canadian dollars for a film I expect to be transported and this film failed to do that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I pretty much read everyone's review of this film before writing my own. Most think it's great. I think most of the people that loved this movie didn't appreciate the Truman Show. And that's fine. They can have their "EdTV" and while they're at it, they can watch similar films like "Batman and Robin", "Armageddon", "Volcano" and "Wing Commander". Why do I compare Ron Howard's "EdTV" with those? Because they're all in a big clump of movies that go together. It's practically a new genre. Movies that didn't originate with an actual IDEA. They just wanted to capitalize on another movies fame, by watering it down for the common idiot. The Truman Show was absolutely brilliant. It dared to expect a certain level of intelligence from it's audience. Because of this, we have a bunch of teenagers wandering out of a Jim Carrey movie, holding their heads because they feel like they've been forced to THINK. "It's just like at school, man". If you don't want to think, go see "EdTV". If you want a really intelligent movie, go see "the Truman Show". You can listen to the brainless cattle of the public, and they'll tell you which one is better. The one that has more sex and cheap cliches! You can bet films will get worse before they ever get better. Just another symptom of the Hollywood "let's-make-a-movie-that-morons-will-pay-seven-dollars-to-see" disease.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"ED TV" tells the story of a middle class man named Ed (McConaughey) who signs a contract with a producer (Degeneres) to have his whole life videotaped and shown live on television. Many people compare this film to "Truman Show" and although it has some similarities I don't agree with that whole-heartedly. Sure the plot has the same idea about it but the way Ron Howard approaches the subject is different then how Peter Weir approached it. Howard's film is more comical and satirical while "Truman Show" is more like a fantasy. "ED TV" has its clever moments and some funny lines (McConaughey's rise and shine bit on his first morning of taping is hilarious) but all in all, it doesn't win me over at the end. A scene where he falls on Elizabeth Hurley's cat left me groaning because of it's stupidity. The acting was up to par except Landau's performance as Ed's stepfather. This guy has to stop getting roles. He's overplayed. McConaughey was decent but the actor who really stole the show was Woody Harrelson. He might be an early pick for Oscar consideration. If you have two hours to kill and five bucks in your pocket it's worth seeing this film but don't go out of your way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than The Truman Show? Please. Granted, Edtv was an entertaining flick, with some good performances (notably Ellen DeGeneres and Martin Landau), and a funny script, but it was not the movie that The Truman Show was.Compare: where Truman endeavored to portray a show that really depicted human nature, Edtv gives us a 24-hour Jerry Springer episode. Think about it - what kind of person would actually go on Edtv? The same people who go on Springer - freaks looking for fame at whatever price.Beats the Truman Show on concept? WHAT?! What is more innovative, more original - a bunch of cameras following around a white-trash fame-seeker, or an entirely constructed world centered around an unwitting martyr to the voyeuristic instinct in human nature? What is more effective, Peter Weir's brilliant shots of hidden cameras, or a bunch of camera guys following Matthew McConaghey around? I mean, this is just a no-brainer.And as a social commentary, I challenge Edtv's supporters to name one original thought that this film presented. What, TV is bad, invasion of privacy by the media is bad? Yeah, that's innovative.Finally, I would like to echo Ben Nuckols' comments about the group of Edtv viewers. Simply put, they were a pathetic attempt at getting a PC cross-section of America. Yet at the same time, they were crassly stereotypical - two men, comprising the obligatory gay couple, show affection towards each other, and that's supposed to be a laugh. Ha ha, they're gay! Please.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie a great deal. But to see this movie held up as a masterpiece or even better than The Truman Show is ridiculous. It rehashes the same old things we've been hearing since the word "paparazzi" became a household term but never really makes any kind of innovative point.And think about it: did instant fame really hurt Ed? He got the girl, got money, forged new - and true - relationships with his family, and got to get it on with Elizabeth Hurley. Show me the downside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EdTV is a very entertaining movie with an excellent cast. It's impossible to avoid comparing it with "The Truman Show." That earlier film was stronger, I think -- more thought-provoking and resonant on many levels. EdTV seems to me to be mostly about our American obsession with celebrity. If you're on TV, you're a celebrity. And if you're a celebrity, you belong to the public.Ron Howard is, as always, a reliable workmanlike director. And the cast is perfect. Ellen DeGeneres is very funny in a role that becomes more sympathetic as the movie goes along. Woody Harrelson has some hilarious scenes, and Martin Landau is wonderful -- and very funny. And it's great to see Rob Reiner in a major role.All in all, a nice media satire with many memorable scenes, even if it doesn't top "The Truman Show."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Folks, this movie is a keeper! Everybody's been talking about, oh, it's just a cheap knockoff of The Truman Show, only with a stupid guy who volunteered... Not true. This is not a stupid movie. It's not as grand as The Truman Show, but on the other hand it is also more real. Ed is a regular guy; I wouldn't really want to be his best friend, but he's basically decent and I'd go hang out with him. :) And he does show that he is not as stupid as they think he is, and that it's possible to grab some dignity and happiness back from a society that's over-invested in polls and what we all think everyone else thinks. It's funny and sweet, and as a viewer remarks at one point in the movie, there are some great twists. It's not a Great Film or anything, but it is very watchable and you won't feel like you've wasted your seven bucks.And Ellen DeGeneres is really good in this movie. Her facial expressions are a scream! And most of her lines got big laughs from the audience. I'm a big Ellen DeGeneres fan, and I was so afraid this would be another Mr. Wrong, but it's really a good vehicle for her. And to see her jumping on the bed screaming "I'm the golden queen of television!" is worth the admission price, right there.The rest of the supporting cast was also pretty great; they made us believe in the mundane messiness of their lives. Their family saga was bizarre, but at the same time, you could see it happening to one of your friends. Woody Harrelson did an amazing job with his character, who was a horrible creature, but, like Ed, had a redeeming quality or two. OK, at least one. And that was one convincingly messed up family, too. Whoo boy.Anyway. Jenna Elfman is also really wonderful. Although I agree with one reviewer who said that they don't develop her character well enough for us to truly understand why she's so special to Ed, she is also very real. And I wasn't left thinking to myself, oh, those polls referred to in the movie are right, she's not that great... No. If nothing else, they showed us her depth of feeling and her tenderness, as well as her math skills. Elfman also shows us that she can play more than her wonderful Dharma &amp; Greg character; she does not bring any of that neo-hippie attitude to this character. She's just this girl, ya know? And she looks AMAZING in a UPS uniform.I don't know if the French original, which I'm afraid I haven't had the chance to see, was better. I don't know if it is inherently a worse movie than The Truman Show, but I think it's on a different plane from TTS anyway. They have different goals and shouldn't really have to be compared. So, the upshot of it is this -- here is a movie that is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grab someone you love to laugh with and see EdTv. Make sure you don't grab a red-neck though, 'cause they'll be looking for a reason to dislike Ron Howard's surprisingly unconventional film, that encapsulates a "big tent" view of American audiences. [I can hear those red-necks now, struggling not to laugh: "How dare they make this politically correct crap.so. funny!"]Since starting in the 80's with comedy hits like "Splash," and "Parenthood", and in the 90's with "City Slickers," "League of Their Own" and "Father's Day," nothing in the extensive screenwriting successes of scriptwriter Lowell Ganz suggested the ability to write the hilarious and satirical "EdTV."Guys will love the almost naively sexy, unglamorous, [and unexpectedly touching] yet bittersweet performance of Jenna Elfman as a young woman use a dislike for publicity as an excuse to run from commitment to Ed.Ellen also hits a career high-note in her best film role yet. Indeed, the second biggest laugh of the night came in a line from Ellen, when she, with a mostly straight face, gives Ed tips on how to make women happy.. [sorry gay gals, Ellen has no love interest on-screen]. Ellen and various other minor gay characters, blacks, and Hispanics are blended in as regular characters, along with the mostly white cast, adding to the humor, without much ado about their minority status.Having survived his first 15-Minutes of fame as a handsome face without convincing many of us he can actually act, heart-throb wanna-be Matthew McConaughey as Ed Pekurny has his funniest moment when, on his very first morning of having his life filmed 24-7, Ed wakes up with a familiar morning condition ..That's the bedroom-farce tone of the humor, unlike the more stuffy attitude of "Truman," to which "EdTV" will inevitably be compared.And don't think it's "Truman" or "Real World MTV," which "EdTv" makes hyper-hip Kevin Williamson-"Scream"-like self-contained references too. It's more like, what if "Truman," hadn't taken themselves so seriously and actually let go a bit. Not saddled with the unbelievable premise of a man raised inside of a "fake world" that bootstrapped the otherwise excellent "Truman," "EdTV," addresses a more realistic question:As "Real Life TV" shows explode on the television-because the networks discovered that not only are they cheap, but they are drawing bigger ratings than traditional predictable dramas -- what happens to the privacy and the lives of the people who are increasingly taken advantage of for 15 seconds or more of fame in this proliferating glut of "Real Life TV" shows?What array of misadventures can happen during and after the jokes to the unsuspecting average folks suddenly made famous-to their lovers, their family? It asks the larger question: can the newly famous recover their dignity, their privacy, after almost literally letting it all hang out on international television, emotionally and physically? Yes, the impact on the family starts off predictable, but Ganz layered in enough surprises to keep most folks laughing and surprised, and probably emotionally manipulated enough to care about Ed's posse.As Matthew McConaughey's youthful looks disappear into sunburned wrinkles, he accomplishes something he hasn't in previous roles-makes us forget about Matthew and finally loses his pretty-boy ego on his way to becoming a decent actor, and creating a believable, lovable, funny, character.If you liked "Truman," and aren't a red-neck, you'll likely love the satirical ribbing "EdTV" gives to both the producers of mass media, and the couch potatoes that feed on the increasingly degrading, spiral of television into desperate, cheap "Real Life TV" shows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given the choice, I would surely choose The Sandlot over The Truman Show. But despite the similarities Ron Howard's Edtv shares with Jim Carrey's true-to-life soap opera, I would say that this flick definitely deserves a look.You've probably read the basic plot line behind this movie; the hero, Ed, a 31 year-old video rental store clerk who clips his toenails in his spare time, is given the opportunity of a lifetime: the chance to be the star of "True TV" -- a real-time, unedited broadcast of one man's adventures in the urban jungle of San Francisco. Ed finds himself caught between loves, and the nation watches as his personal drama unfolds. Blah, drab.But what kept me from walking out of the theater and picking up a copy of The Sandlot on my way home were two very simple things, which unfortunately are so often overlooked in Hollywood: realism and truly tangible characters.Edtv effectively and authentically portrays American culture as obsessed with peering into the lives of famous. Naturally, as they look deeper into the personal life of Ed, they realize that everybody has skeletons in their closets, and that no family is in fact 'normal.' Furthermore, I like the perspective one of the characters throws in while Ed is attaining national fame: "It used to be that if you were special, you became famous; now if you're famous, you're special."Another thing I loved about Edtv was Ed's hilarious step-father, who copes with old-age with admirable levity, and of course, Ed. Ed is a really likeable guy, not threatening, not too sensitive. Basically, he's a guy you'd just want to hang out with. Also, despite the constant cameras, the crowds, Ed stays true to himself the whole time his life is filmed--not something you'd expect from an average Joe who knows that his life is the national topic of conversation at dinner time.Considering its TV-oriented genre, Edtv is astonishingly good. If you enjoy laughs and love stories, and are interested in witnessing the authentic workings of average American culture, Edtv is right for you.</fullReview>

All the colors of the emotional rainbow need to be there for him to stop the film. `EdTV' suffers from this problem as well. It shouldn't, the cast is the best Howard has ever had to work with. Matthew McConeghey really shines here in the lead role. I've liked this guy so much since he broke, but he has so much potential that just isn't being used. The goofy laid back charm the he showed in `Dazed And Confused' is deployed in this film. He shows a remarkable chemistry with co-star Jenna Elfman. With Elfman, along with Ellen DeGeneres, Martin Landau, Sally Kirkland, and Woody Harrelson, I was truly shocked to see all of these actors being so effective. They all hit their marks superbly, with Elfman especially good. The message of `EdTV' can be picked up on in the first 5 minutes, but Howard doesn't seem to want to take a chance that we might miss it. The lack of faith in the audience's intelligence is really appalling. The movie keeps stopping the action, or comedy, just to remind us of the moral of the story. Start-stop, start-stop... It's just too much of an erratic tone to really get used to. I found myself beginning to tire of this film as it kept slipping back into unneeded dramatics.Elizabeth Hurley is truly wasted in a poorly conceived subplot that seems way too silly for the film. I wish I could like this movie more, but Ron Howard won't let me.------------ 6</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mediocre "Truman" rehash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"EDtv" is "The Truman Show" lite. A product of the mass-media culture it pretends to abhor, it raises the same questions about media inundation and the decay of privacy, but with none of "Truman's" ingenuity. "Truman" challenged the audience, while "EDtv" panders to the easily entertained.Like "Truman," the main character is a man whose entire life is broadcast on television; the only difference is that Ed knows it. In fact, he dimwittedly signs a contract allowing a film crew to document his every move.All of the clever wrinkles that made "Truman" one of 1998's very best films have been ironed out of "EDtv" for the sake of mass appeal. Instead of Peter Weir, the Australian auteur who has puzzled and provoked audiences with daring films like "Fearless," "EDtv" offers Ron Howard, the Hollywood pro who puts no personal stamp on his movies. Instead of Jim Carrey defying expectations and expanding his range in a brave dramatic performance, "EDtv" gives us Matthew McConaughey doing what he does best, the only thing he *can* do: being Matthew McConaughey. Like "Truman," "EDtv" features cutaways to loyal viewers, but unlike the delightfully quirky collection of Truman-philes, Ed's fans consist of a politically correct cross-section of America--an African American couple, a gay couple, a trio of Latino chefs, and a dormful of girls at the University of Iowa.What's worse, "EDtv" offers no subtext. "Truman" was a multi-layered film: Aside from commenting on the power of television to shape our views and dominate our lives, it also explored humankind's relation to God (if there is one) and questioned the implications of living in a created universe. "EDtv" contains nothing beneath its explicit surface message: that the phenomena of instant celebrity and the destruction of privacy are B-A-D T-H-I-N-G-S.Ultimately, the film fails to engage the viewer. Howard's slick direction and McConaughey's superficial acting turn Ed into little more than a genial presence on the screen. Some viewers may care about what befalls him, but I wanted to grab the remote.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EDtv is an excellent look about how far our national obsession with fame can go. The actors all seem to be having lots of fun with the script, probably because they have had an actual experience like Ed does at one point in their career.Of particular note is Jenna Elfman, who plays completely against type and shows excellent range as a dramatic actress. Also good are Matthew McCounaghey, who finally lives up to his hype, Elizabeth Hurley pokes fun at herself in a few spots, acting well also, Rob Reiner, very funny as a corporate bigwig, and Ellen DeGeneres is very good as a voice of reason throughout the picture.This movie can be considered as a well timed message from stars to fans on showing what their life can be like at times. It is also bitingly funny, and all together, another winner from Ron Howard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a fledgling film critic:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EDtv is a brilliant study of television and the effects brought about by placing the entire life of a 31 y.o. man on cable TV. Unlike the darkness of The Truman Show (a decidedly lesser film), the laughs reign in a sparkling script. The acting is top-notch (save another overdone Sally Kirkland); especially noteworthy is the surprisingly GREAT turn by Ellen DeGeneres. This film proves two things: she can act beyond her silly sitcom (her writing Emmy WAS justified), and she is added to a list of actors better fit in wonderful supporting roles (with Madonna, Janeane Garofalo and Rosie O'Donnell). Kudos to Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman (a WONDERFUL addition!) and Woody Harrelson. -----an easy * * * * (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original, unpredictable, and absolutely hilarious. Fantastic all around, with its many delightful surprises, it will keep your attention the whole way through!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you first hear the premise of the movie, you think you know it. A man's life is broadcast on television. You think The Truman Show, MTV's The Real World, etc.... but the moment the house lights go down, and the picture comes up, you realize that Hollywood has never made a film like this before. Thank goodness someone finally has! From the very beginning it hooks you in with a little bit of comedic factor, a little bit of gross-out factor, a little bit of loser-boy factor and you're surprised at how funny it is to see a film actually doing things that really are ordinary, and moreover you're shocked at how funny those ordinary things are to watch. You fall in love with the characters because as outrageous as they are at times, they're quite believable. You know these people, they're your cousins, your neighbors, your co-workers, your friends, maybe even you. But most importantly, they're genuine, and you gain a new perspective on celebrity, the media and the common lives that we all have, as well as the dignity one likely risks for a taste of fame.The storyline develops well, and very quickly. Even though with hindsight every aspect shows a natural unfolding of events that are altogether too frighteningly real, at no point do you ever find yourself thinking it predictable. In fact it's the irony of the unpredictable yet true-to-life nature of the film that makes it so humorous. And you look at your own ever-changing fate in a new light under this screen setting that, as new as it is to movies, feels eerily familiar to you.This hilarious comedy is full of many, many surprising twists, amusing as well as heart-warming, and when you combine that good writing with good producing, directing and acting, you have one great movie. EDtv is a delight to watch, and the only thing you regret when you leave the theatre is that you don't know how Ed and all the others are doing now. Yep, folks, it's just a movie. But it's a darn funny one. So get away from your computer already and go see it!</fullReview>

Then when the show becomes extremely effective, and a hit, Ed gets trapped doing things he doesn't want to do.Overall everything here is pretty much OK, but that is the problem, it doesn't rise enough above OK to engage the viewer beyond amusement into belly laughs.

		<shortDescription>Reality check - great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When observing the cast I knew this film was a much watch. McConaughey, Elfman, Harrelson, Ellen DeGeneres, Dennis Hopper and Elizabeth Hurley are a guarantee for a great storyline. McConaughey is able to use his classic comedic skills to great effect as he stars as the central protagonist Ed who is going to be filmed 24/7. The plot spells disaster straight away for the character and instantly hooks the viewers who will want to know what this will involve for Ed and his family. With sharp turns and funny one liners the film keeps a steady and consistently funny plot as all the A star celebrities pull off excellent roles as different characters in the 'reality' world, exploring family, relationship and job issues, giving a great reflection of real life in a 'reality' world. One main reason the film worked was because the jokes are constantly in the dialogue but there are also physical means of humour, watch out for a scene towards the end with Ed and Jill. A great part is played by Woody Harrelson who stars as Ed's dopey brother Ray. Harrelson brings his comic talents to the part and brings a relaxed but also a sometimes serious edge to the character. The film adds a great aspect to the term 'reality'. I have recently watched 'The Truman show' which was fantastic. Edtv differs because it has more comic conventions than the Carrey classic. Personally I preferred 'The Truman Show' because of the seriousness and emotion conveyed but the emotional scenes in this Rod Howard picture are also ones to be admired, but both films are great and I have no hesitation in recommending them to you. Edtv is always believable in terms of context and with likable funny characters it is a film destined to be enjoyed, it has a very relaxed atmosphere and humour running constantly through all the big named stars and is therefore thoroughly recommended. The film has many comic conventions and predictability but is kept consistently engaging when viewers are able to gain emotion into the real life situations. With many different story lines being created it is a thoroughly developed and well thought-out plot, always engaging the viewers and is therefore a must watch for any comic wanting audiences of any age.</fullReview>

One day EdTV looks out the window and sees a sleek Japanese HDTV in the house next door and falls immediately in love. The two communicate by switching channels and speaking via programming. EdTV and his girlfriend play matchmaker to their respective owners until one day the sleek Japanese model comes to live with EdTV when their owners get married. The two TV's hook-up and give birth to a portable TV that is used in the new nursery. Okay, the movie is nothing about this plot, but it's more interesting than anything in Ron Howard's film. Rent The Truman Show, The Cable Guy, Celebrity, Amazon Women on the Moon, or The Brave Little Toaster for similar themes that are better.</fullReview>

Jill's Apartment, The footages of the viewers all over America, the dialogues and the twists.-The Worst: Woody Harrelson is the typical idleness American, which every funny sentence said by him loose 90% of the comedy. Rating: 7/10Ed Pekurny, is only an ordinary American, working at a video store, who thinks that there's nothing to loose by agreeing to be the newest star of the new TV show based on real life. This is an idea of a television channel on the verge of closing by the loss of audiences and money, Ed TV comes to save the day! Day after day the show becomes a real success and all of the sudden this video store employee becomes the newest national celebrity! Everything is good until Ed falls in love by Shari (Elfman), his brother's (Harrelson) girlfriend. As off that moment their private moments are broadcasted through television, becoming the audience's entertainment, the ratings are getting higher and higher, and hundreds of fans synchronizing the show to take a look at the life of this celebrity full of comedy and romance.Magnificaly directed by Ron Howard, with an amazing cast: Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Hurley, Martin Landau, Ellen DeGeneres, Rob Reiner and Dennis Hopper.Ed TV is the perfect example of quick fame, easy money and the share of the personal life with the entire country. By seeing this picture, the first thing the viewer can realise is that this is comedy a its most pure state, magnificently directed, wonderfully written, amazingly acted which results in one of the most enjoyable comedies not only of the year as of the decade! The dialogues exacerbate that comedy factor I was talking about, and that can allow us to realise that these characters not only are funny and have history, as they have depth, are not flat. This is the kind of movie which can be seen by almost all of the audiences, not the kiddies, nor the conservative audiences that might come out shocked. Anyway I don't mention the older audiences, as I suppose they have seen it all at their stage of life! These distinctions are made by some crude dark humour, some nudity, language and sensuality.One thing is for sure, it is much, much, much, much, much better than one of the most useless peaces of crap of the year, which was acclaimed by everyone, I don't know how, The Truman Show. Everyone seem to love Jim Carey (I don't), think he is funny (I don't) and think the movie was good (Holly God, that wasn't at all ? dude, it was even nominated for a bunch of Oscars, HOW????????) As someone said, everybody is a critic, and I am one as well, one of those that had a great time with Ed TV and almost got themselves killed by The Truman Show.However see this, enjoy it, watch this with your group of friends and you'll see how much it's worth. Overall a 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh shut up, you liked it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EdTV undeservedly acquired a less than enviable reputation for no other reason that the fact that it followed so closely on the heels of The Truman Show, an entirely different movie that had a similar plot foundation. So needless to say, there will be plenty of cynical but superficial comparisons of the two films, but EdTV is more than able to stand on its own.The Truman Show was a drama with some comedic undertones, but mostly because it starred the endlessly amusing Jim Carrey, who is funny whether he is trying to be or not. EdTV, on the other hand, is a romantic comedy in which some regular guy gets his life put on TV because he won the contest that was held to decide who the lucky star would be. The reason that this seems to be so similar to The Truman Show is because both films concern regular people whose lives are broadcast on TV 24 hours a day, but The Truman Show is a bout a guy who doesn't know that his life is a TV show and eventually begins to catch on, while EdTV is about a guy who is given the opportunity to be broadcast on TV, and all of the problems that this causes him.Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson work excellently on screen as Ed, the guy who is put on TV, and Ray, his energetic brother, who WANTS his life to be put on TV. You get a unique love triangle between the two brothers and Shari, the object of both of their affection. Shari is actually one of the better characters in the film, because the viewing audience soon proves to not be very fond of Shari, and Jenna Elfman makes this very believable with her nerve gratingly aggravating performance. Interviews with the public showed that people were fed up with her whole attitude about the whole EdTV spectacle, and I found myself feeling the same way. Every time she was on screen complaining I just wanted her to get lost. It is McConaughey and Harrelson who really made the film work, with their excellent performances (but what the hell was the deal with the chicken dance?). The film also very effectively evoked some genuine emotion at several points, particularly in the scenes that dealt with Ed's and Ray's torn family life. There area also some very well known actors, particularly Dennis Hopper and Elizabeth Hurley, who show up in EdTV for some relatively small roles. If you still aren't convinced that this is a totally different movie than The Truman Show and that it is hugely entertaining, or if you have seen it already and dismiss it as an unimaginative rip-off of The Truman Show, put EdTV on and sit in the room, do something to occupy yourself, and try not to watch it. I guarantee you that you will sit there and watch the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am in awe of how many people are gushing about this movie. I did not find it particularly bad, but I wish it was. At least that would have made it somewhat interesting. However, I was stuck with this dreary film for way too long. I found that the theme was far too obvious and preachy. People who love this film will get upset when I compare EdTV to The Truman Show. I agree that they are two completely different films handling the subject of mass media in totally different ways. However, I found EdTV much more joyless and lacking in imagination.Where to start. I could not identify one bit with the main character. We've had Matthew McConaghey forced upon us as the "next big thing." I did not empathize with him at all. I was not impressed with his irritating portrayal of a supposed sensitive, folksy, homespun guy. He simply bored me. I didn't care at all about the contrived subplots about his family either. I thought that the gross out scenes were lame. They seemed like last minute attempts to copy "There's Something About Mary". Especially the gag involving the cat.I was disappointed with an actress that has proved herself. Jenna Elfman deserved so much more. The script does not capture one ounce of zest for life and instant likability that is evident from "Dharma and Greg". Her character burdens the actress with whininess and a permanent squint.Ellen Degeneres' character was one of the bright spots. At least she managed some believable spontanaiety.I hate to say it but if you want a SMART comedy with actual SATIRE check out The Truman Show instead.</fullReview>

No one under 18 should be allowed to see "EdTV"--if they do, they'll realize how moronic adults really are: believe it or not, grown-ups, not five-year-olds, wrote, produced and starred in this movie. And of course, once the youth of America realize how stupid adults actually are, civilization as we know it will collapse, and Ellen DeGeneres will once again be given a major role on the big screen. But back to the "film"--the writing and acting are absolutely ABYSMAL. During the entire film, Jenna Elfman acts as if she can't believe she's been given a part in a major movie. I can't believe it either, Jenna. And Matthew McConaughey? I've seen more realistic, believable acting in a porn film. The sole believable, enjoyable character in the entire flick is the ex-girlfriend of Woody Harrelson's character, who makes a cameo to defend his virility. That 15 seconds is the only watchable portion of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With any comedy there is also a realm of truth and seriousness. The point of this film which I think the first reviewer missed, is that it is telling us something about the reality TV craze that has swept our country. Even after the horror of 9/11 which came after this film, we soon went back to the craze of reality TV shows where so called non actors who are real people are paid to be on TV whether it is the Bachelor or Survivor, they are often sleep deprived to be more emotional and make whatever happens on camera more intense. So how real is real when it is this contrived? In this film Edtv I see the insanity and ugliness of the producers wonderfully portrayed by Rob Reiner and Ellen DeGeneres. Ellen eventually so sickened by what the show is doing to Ed's (Matthew MaConaughey's) life that she helps him to get out of the live TV broadcast by blacking mailing Rob Reiner's character with some highly personal information. While the film is funny and entertaining, it also, if we are pay attention tells us that this need to be voyeurs into the so called private and real lives of each other is dangerous and even contrived to the point of ruthless by the producers who use Ed and anyone he dates and his family for their own success. Family secrets and mistakes are revealed on television in this film, in glaring ways that break up Ed's mother and step dad and he loses his new girlfriend thanks to his life being public.Gee, much like reality TV today! Yes, one can argue that the non actors real people who sign up should know better and whatever they get, they deserve. Maybe we should also know better than to be a nation that peeps through key holes. This film is relevant and well acted by everyone in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matthew Mconaghay and Jenna Elfman star in EdTV. EdTV has it's occasional chuckles but none of it really soars to the point in which we're entertained. The movie, in my opinion, just didn't work. Or not that well.Mconaghay is Ed, a guy that works in a video store. A television station(ran by Rob Reiner and Ellen Degeneres),which revolves around reality TV, needs a new TV reality star for an upcoming series. So, they find Ed, and he becomes the star.Ed,while being followed by his camera, discovers that his brother(played by Woody Harrelson) is having an affair behind his girlfriend's(Jenna Elfman) back. So Ed decides to woo her, and loses his brother's respect.As he soon learns, life on"EDTV" is tough. Such as he has to escape from his house in order for him to his girlfriend,and when they're having sex the camera crew catches them on TV. In which this causes problems on their relationship, along with the fact that the TV viewers don't like her.The majority of the characters are annoying. Excluding Ellen Degenres and Jenna Elfman. THe movie feels like it's unoriginal. Like it's a realistic version of "The Truman show",without the substance. Without the brilliance.EDTV is also unbelievably slow and long. It's not very interesting,nor very funny. It's a bit of a mess. There's nothing really special about it. Ron Howard has done better. Watch the Grinch or Frost/Nixon or something for good Howard.

		<shortDescription>One expected much more from Ron Howard...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard is one of the finest filmmakers Filmdom has witnessed, his body of work goes down as a LEGEND. He has made awesome films, while some have been disappointing. Unfortunately, 1999 flick 'EDtv' is one of those disappointments from the accomplished filmmaker.The problem with 'EDtv' is clearly it's writing, it's shoddy. The film lacks the bite, it had the potential to become a cult, but that magic is clearly missing. 'EDtv's tragic box office returns just proves the fact. Howard surely would agree, with what I am trying to say! 'Edtv' has 2 prominent pluses: 1. The Idea is really interesting. 2. The performances: Matthew McConaughey is excellent as ED, he carries the film on his shoulders. Woody Harrelson is, as always, superb. Jenna Elfman is first-rate. Martin Landau, Sally Kirkland, Rob Reiner, Adam Goldberg &amp; Dennis Hopper are perfect in their parts. Elizabeth Hurley is the best thing about this film, she looks like a goddess. Ellen DeGeneres stands out.Overall, a 5 on 10 rating. A film that could've been much more, giving a better a script. A correct example for the well-known Fraze; Body Beautiful Of Minus Soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Light hearted. Funny. Movitational. Smart. A Class movie. I was laughing throughout. Smiling at the end wanting more. Brilliant and realistic performance by Mathew, Woody and everyone. Very good script. Superb direction. No vulgarity. No special effects. No big stars. Some parts of the movie are even better than The Truman Show. "A nobody looser, accidentally chosen for a reality show becomes a superstar. Finds true love, respect of family and brother. Then has to choose between relationships and stardom." Best scenes are: when Ed's video is reviewed and selected; Ed gets up and a camera is on his face. When he and his brother are about to fight; The cameras following Ed's every move; Ed's final revelation and pulling the plug.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny, but serious comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a man on a reality TV show. His life is turned upside down after being on the show.This film is quite quick paced. It features something happening every minute or two. It also twists dramatically and comically every now and then, which adds to the surprise and fun. The situations that Ed encounters are funny, and is not repetitive or gross. The real life situations that Ed encounters are down to earth and could really happen to anyone, which makes his character convincing. Apart from comedy, there is also a serious side to the film, such as when the real father of Ed comes along. However, this subplot also ends in comedy, which shows that the filmmakers did a great job in blending various aspects of humanity into the film.It also examines what TV stations may do to keep the ratings up. Though it is a fictional account, it still stimulates people to think about this issue.This is a quick paced, drama packed comedy, with many surprising twists along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>entertaining but stained by blatant product placement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard has proved himself to be one of the most reliable directors in Hollywood with a string of solid dramas and comedies to his name. His collaboration with writers Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz produced the quirky "Night Shift" (1982) as well as "Parenthood" (1989), which boasts a wonderful script, great acting and to my mind remains Howard's finest film.With the same team on board my expectations were high for "EDtv". While it's hugely entertaining it is not in the league of "Parenthood". Still the Mandel and Ganz script is inventive, with much humor as well as much criticism of the media.Because of the proximity of its initial release with "The Truman Show" comparisons were unavoidable. But with time this comparison seems quite unnecessary since they really are very different types of cinema. While "Truman" was certainly more ambitious in every way, it was also pretentious. "Edtv", while not sparing its barbs towards reality television is ultimately a feel good movie.Leaning so heavily on its central performance it's Matthew McConaughey as Ed who really deserves much of the credit for the fact that "EDtv" ultimately works. McConaughey parlays his charismatic somewhat white trash charm with great effect. It's that charm that makes Ed's success credible and basically carries the film. There is fine support too from Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson and Martin Landau.A word must be mentioned about product placement. This is not an uncommon phenomenon in Hollywood, but I cannot recall a film which so blatantly and crudely falls prey to this really offensive practice, in particular as concerns Pepsi. Besides the intrusive brand name visuals, McConaughey is made to verbally choose Pepsi over Coke. It's terribly degrading to any film when done with so little respect for the audience and greatly surprising that a director of Howard's record and reputation should have allowed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EdTV makes us realized one thing that we should be aware of....Never sign any contracts until you have thoroughly read through the agreements! That aside, storyline, it is rather flat and a bit gross at certain scenes of the film. It lacks genuine humour and sentimentality, as compared to The Truman Show. The actors managed to put in commendable performances but the poor script did not give them justice. Some scenes were totally out of place and the flow of the show is rather haphazard. However, on the plus side, EdTV makes us realize that we can also easily fall into such situation, especially when we think of a quick way to fame, and fortune through the media.

		<shortDescription>Voyeuristic comedy that lacks charm, humour and enjoyability.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`EDtv' is an unfunny and often risible satire from an Oscar winning director who knows he can do much better than this. I didn't even realise it was Ron Howard until the end credits and was very disappointed to tell the truth. While the plot outline does seem a bit familiar to `The Truman Show', this film fails on almost every level. While it is a satire on the new fad of reality TV, this is too crude to take seriously. The murky, low-budget look doesn't help much either.Not only does this waste a good director but also a star-studded cast. The latest `Hollywood Hunkathon', Matthew McConaughey falls flat in the part as the protagonist of the movie. One major flaw is the fact that his attitude doesn't change in the slightest in any stage of the film, and that's a big downfall in these types of movies. Jenna Elfman does nothing to prove that she is a good actress. Even in the small, unimportant role as the significant other, she's a bad actress. There's a large supporting cast including Oscar nominees Sally Kirkland, Woody Harrelson and Dennis Hopper as well as Oscar winner Martin Landau. None of them do much with their parts and just pass time when nothing of much importance is going on. Another bad thing is the fact that the people they try to entertain are the audience who disapprove of this abrasive style of humour (and rightfully so). While "`he Truman Show" was a delightfully abnormal piece of art, `EDtv' is cheap and trashy. A good example of sloppy, poor filmmaking. My IMDb rating: 3.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edtv is a good movie but it was a bit preachy. The staff at a Television Network must have wanted a program so they go out to find somebody. Ed was at a bar with his friends watching the news. Ed tries to get a friend and his girlfriend Sherry back together so they can go on with the wedding but Sherry doesn't want him she wants Ed instead. Ed starts becoming famous he even gets his own truck. Ed's mother wants him to dump Sherry immediately. Ed discusses the problems he and Sherry are having on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno. Jay Leno makes a joke out of Ed and Sherry getting back together. But now Jill (Elizabeth Hurley) is falling for Ed. Ed is in for some saddening news his father Al had a heart attack. So he called the TV station on a payphone and said he wouldn't be able to make it. Sherry was ready to dump Ed. But she found it that Ed quit so they we're back together forever.

I don't usually like comedies, but this one kept me laughing most of the way through. I think some of its critics were looking for something DEEP or a POINT in this (perhaps something about the perils of our reality TV obsessed world), but I saw it as strictly entertainment for the sake of entertaining its audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EdTV is about an American TV named Ed who lives in a small suburban residence in New Jersey. One day EdTV looks out the window and sees a sleek Japanese HDTV in the house next door and falls immediately in love. The two communicate by switching channels and speaking via programming. EdTV and his girlfriend play matchmaker to their respective owners until one day the sleek Japanese model comes to live with EdTV when their owners get married. The two TV's hook-up and give birth to a portable TV that is used in the new nursery. Okay, the movie is nothing about this plot, but it's more interesting than anything in Ron Howard's film. Rent The Truman Show, The Cable Guy, Celebrity, Amazon Women on the Moon, or The Brave Little Toaster for similar themes that are better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A witty comment on modern media paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EdTV is about a normal San Francisco guy who becomes the star of a 24-hour reality soap opera within a few days only, but regrets his short-living fame within a short time as he finds out that there is no space left for privacy, love and personality. The direction of Ron Howard is well-done, cut rapidly in the style of modern TV choreography.Matthew McConaughy's performance is outstanding, playing the simple-minded, but honest buddy Ed. There are great supporting roles by Woody Harrelson, Dennis Hopper, Elizabeth Hurley and Martin Landau and a fine song sound track consisting of groovy alternative and dance beats.Funnily, just a few months after the German release of EdTV, a real soap opera series called "Big Brother" started on German television that showed the life of some common people all around the clock for three months in a row. This series was as popular and critizised as Ed's TV series in this fiction - so "EdTV" (like the "Truman Show") isn't just a contemporary satire of the media control visions of George Orwell's "1984", Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" and Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451", but a blueprint of real millennium media entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EdTV *** Ron Howard's "ED TV" is a very funny and often creative film about an ordinary video store clerk(Matthew McCognehy) who agrees to have his life filmed. McCognehy, Woody Harrelson, Martin Landau and Jenna Elfman all give top-notch performances in a film with some clever surprises. The ending, however, is a little too predictable, and it cant escape the fact thet the similar based "Truman Show" is clearly superior. Neverthless, this is still an enjoyable film in it's own right</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to write a comment because I am fed up of seeing this movie compared to "The Truman Show" and always coming off badly.While it is certainly true that there are many similaritires in the idea and plot this one wins every time for me. And here is why..."The Truman Show", while an excellent movie was set an some unknown time in the future, when it is possible for a corporation to adopt a baby towards the selfish ends of the corporation. Whilst adoption law may already be ropy in many places, I do not believe that "The Truman Show" could currently take place.EDTV, on the other hand, could happen now. Current viewer likes and dislikes would well mean that a show of this kind would have enormous audiences, and all in all EDTV is a very good and clear comment on our current society. Totally relevant to the world we live in. And therefore, much more interesting....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I quite enjoyed it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this on DVD and so reading the description I of course automatically compared it to "The Truman Show" - like everyone else here it seems. But EDtv is altogether different.Truman is about a man who's been put into a fake world without his consent and he gradually discovers that nothing what he considered as true is real. I think in this respect it's symbolical of how people live their lives in general.EDtv is different in that the main character agrees to go on show but he doesn't understand the wider implications of it. This film is much more realistic especially after shows like "Big Brother". Maybe it's too true to be appreciated by a wider audience.Of course, there are a lot of skeletons in the cupboard of this family - maybe more so than with other families. But I think that is part of what films and books are about. They're not real, they're just the essence of reality and thus more condensed.</fullReview>

There are a lot of very good actors. And the story is different. Is a work that we can't ignore, as we can't ignore Mars Attacks! 'cause he come after ID4. They are different. like these two are.

		<shortDescription>Good, but nothing beyond that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are hard to love so much as they are hard to hate. "Edtv" is one of those. There is nothing great or awful about it. In fact, it is an enjoyable film, but for sure it could have been much better.The story is about an ordinary man named Ed (Matthew McConaghey), who starts to have his whole life shown on TV. Suddenly, he starts to be adored by everyone, but this complicates his life, specially a relationship with his brother ex-girlfriend (played by Jenna Elfman). The problem with the film is just this- everything happens very fast. The situations are interesting, but they are also very sudden, and the story is sometimes irregular. However, the film has its hits. The cast, for example. Matthew, Elfman, Woody Harrelson, Martin Landau, Rob Reiner and specially Ellen DeGeneres give very good performances. Elizabeth Hurley, who should be more time on the screen, also shows her talent and beauty."Edtv" was compared many times to one of 98's best films, "The Truman Show". I think there are some similarities, but "Truman" is a mixture of fantasy and drama, with some comedy, while "Ed" is just a comedy. This comparison can explain why the film was such a flop (for your information, it went straight to video in Brazil).Overall, I think "Edtv" is a good film and good entertainment. It is nothing great, but is worth seeing. Just don't expect much. 7/10</fullReview>

Most of the reviews I've read have said EDTV doesn't quite live up to The Truman Show and I have to disagree. While I found The Truman Show to be okay, I truly enjoyed EDTV much better. Unlike The Truman Show this movie was more real and the plot tended to draw me into the movie more so because it was more realistic. I have no desire to ever watch The Truman Show again, but I would enjoy watching EDTV ever so often and this is coming from someone who watches very few movies twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truman trumps Ed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ed wakes up with an erection. Ed scratches his crotch. Ed clips his toenails. Ed falls over. Welcome to Edtv.If you don't find these things intrinsically funny, that's too bad. The script contributes little humour or wit of its own. Either we guffaw at a buffoon being a buffoon, along with the all the cable television watchers of America - a pleasure that soon palls - or we try to get what entertainment we can out of the story. Thankfully, there is SOME story, and although the basic idea is old news (forget `The Truman Show', there are a hundred dumb `real-life' cable television shows out there), if you're in an indulgent mood you might get something out of it. I did, at any rate.But be warned. Ron Howard, a director whose complete lack of style is almost a style in its own right, has made a mechanical movie, one that shifts from levity to seriousness to pathos with gears going `clank' in the background. Unlike `The Truman Show' it lacks sentiment, humour, drama and - worst of all under the circumstances - intelligence. Howard's only good film (`Apollo 13') was also marred by mean-spirited anti-intellectualism. It's much worse here. `Edtv' glorifies stupidity and positively wallows in its own brainlessness.In case I need to be point this out, that's not a good thing.</fullReview>

Its only major shortcoming is that perhaps it doesn't go quite far enough to show how damaging this obsession is to the subjects of such close scrutiny.Endearing performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jenna Elfman make this film well worth your time, and Ellen DeGeneres is effective in a role that doesn't make one think about whether or not she is gay. Also good in smaller roles are Woody Harrelson, Rob Reiner and Martin Landau. Kudos to Dennis Hopper and Sally Kirkland for effectively filling small, but important, roles.This is not The Truman Show, but is an effective social comment on our national voyeurism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good movie, thought-provoking, and nothing like The Truman Show. In this movie, the protagonist knows he's on camara almost all the time, rather than discovering it as part of the plot. The protagonist's character evolves with the movie, as well, going from a flirtatious fool who only thinks of himself, mostly (character's a "nice guy") to someone who puts his girlfriend's interests ahead of his own, most of the time. Good story, good acting... I think it's well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard makes good commercial films and that's exactly what this is. Film follows the formula all Ron Howard films have. Set up an interesting situation, show us a montage of how fun it is, throw in conflict, make it seem like the hero/heroine is in an impossibly difficult situation, have them get out of it and end with everybody all smiles and hugs. Nothing too deep or dark to offend anybody. I don't deny that I enjoyed the movie, and it was a lot better than "The Truman Show", but McConaughey is handsome and muscular but VERY bland and not a good actor, Elfman looked (and acted) terribly, and the feel-good ending was so fake and contrived I didn't believe it for one second. Also the film never showed to character of Ed as having ANY bad or dark side! Come on! NOBODY is that perfect! An OK film, but don't go expecting depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a good movie. Ron Howard has a way of making movies that somehow always seem to have a mainstream appeal. I think that is just him. Anyway, he has a nice touch and this movie is another one to consolidate his oeuvre. The movie is not overly subversive or as dark as The Truman Show, but nevertheless I think it shows the lengths to which executives will go in their quest for ratings. It was quite sad at times but McConaughey delivers an excellent performance and Martin Landau is excellent as his step-father. It is a very funny turn, once again showing his adeptness at comedy. Jenna Elfman takes a considerable move away from the TV character she portrays, and the rest of the supporting cast is good too. This is good movie-making with just a bit of an edge, but not enough that you'll lose any sleep I wouldn't think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Distracted as I was by seeing this film in some godforsaken corner of Queens for the 11:40 PM showing (I was on a date) the disarming cheerfulness and wit of the story and writing won out after all. Although comparisons to The Truman Show are inevitable, the difference here is that the protagonist has agreed to a one month run as the subject of a 24 hour live documentary for a failing cable station; (he will receive a "balloon payment" as compensation).Naturally the show takes off in popularity, assisted mightily by the many twists and turns of his very strange family's private lives- some of which are forgivably contrived.Ron Howard, who produced or directed this movie, also throws in parts for his brother (the one from the Star Trek episode with the baby faced alien spaceship commander; the Corbomite Maneuver), and incredibly for Ralph Malph from Happy Days, who looks ancient as a bit part network executive. Where was Potsie?The hero may be just a bit too much of an "aw shucks"-Texan accented- regular guy (he reminded me of the hero of Varsity Blues in this respect) but all in all it's a good show.

		<fullReview>edTV is an amusing movie but extremely lite-weight, especially compared to Truman Show, Network, or even Albert Brooks' Real Life. In Truman, we the audience were the bad guys, but since Ron Howard's such a nice guy he lets us off the hook and creates a buffoonish TV executive to take the fall, which makes too easy a target. Ed never sought fame and doesn't seem too affected by it, which means what's the point? Lousy use of San Francisco locales. Pleasant, but could have been better and edgier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the Truman Show wanted to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to make the obvious comparison between this film and the Truman Show. Neither of these films are going to be remembered as GREAT movies. But EdTV was what the Truman Show was not: Believable. I loved the fact that it didn't take itself all that seriously and feel that it needed Jim Carrey in a boat sprawled out in a cross-like position to make a God-awful point.The point both of these films should have been making was that it's not the television executives who implement these shows that perpetuate the stupidity, IT'S THE AUDIENCE THAT TUNES IN TO WATCH IT!!! Neither of these movies turned the camera on the audience (both in the fiction world of the TV show and the real audience watching the film) and said, "See, look what YOU'VE done." (because an idea like that would have been much too poignant for a studio film let alone not profitable enough). So Ron Howard and whatever ego directed the Truman Show both took the safe road. Ron Howard, however, at least tried to have fun at the audience's expense.The casting of EdTV was fantastic. My only regret was I wanted to see more of Woody Harrelson's character after such a great start. The acting was what you'd expect though I was really impressed with Jenna Elfman in this. I thought her character wasn't an easy one to play and yet she still wins you over. I was so severely disappointed with the Truman Show that this was refreshing. Had EdTV been released before Truman, Truman would have tanked at the box office. You have to give credit to Howard for releasing this movie with essentially the same premise only eight months after Truman was a so-called "box office smash". Obviously he thought he had something better, and I would agree that he has.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people do not want to see this movie because it has a similar plot as The Truman Show. I didn't really like Truman, but found EDtv to be very funny. I think the plotline was more realistic than that in the Truman Show. Ed is a video store clerk who does a video audition for a new show about a normal man's life. When the cameras start to follow his every move, he starts to enjoy his new found fame. When he falls in love with his brother's girlfriend, and she is followed too, she breaks off the relationship cause everyone hates her. Ed also starts to find ways to hide from the cameras. It is very funny and a much better show than The Truman Show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In response to what seems to be the first thing on everyone's mind: no, EDtv isn't just a remake of The Truman Show -- they're more like flipsides of the same coin. Truman pointed out our need to be an audience -- to attain voyeuristic pleasure from watching someone else go through their day-to-day life. EDtv, one the other hand, aims for our need for celebrity -- the need to be the person in the fishbowl, who everyone else is watching. It's a unique and intriguing idea.Unfortunately, EDtv doesn't quite live up to its promise. This isn't to say it's a bad movie. Indeed, it's a wonderfully enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours, and it's buoyed by outstanding and charismatic performances, particularly from Jenna Elfman, Martin Landau, and Matthew McConnaughey. However, it's essentially a feature-length sitcom -- good for a few discussions over the water cooler, but forgotten by the time next week rolls around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ED TV manages to fumble its entire concept by not making any statement aside from "people like privacy". It's only a featherweight comedy about a guy who's life turns upside down because he's on television twenty-four hours a day. The film never explores the nature of his popularity or questions the idea of "truth" that becomes perverted into a circus through public observation. This sort of intelligent scripting would not only have made the film much funnier but also more thoughtful and resonant. As it is, it leaves you with a few laughs and a lingering disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see a sneak preview of this because someone told me that, despite how annoying and trite the trailers were, the movie was actually good. WRONG. This film is an unfunny, leadenly unclever piece of time wasting nonsense. It's generally depressing, too.As if The Truman Show had never existed, This film comes out of nowhere with a bunch of huge stars and no ideas. Where Truman invited you to think about WHY we want to watch something like this, WHAT constitutes a life, and our own voyerism and cruelty to a character, this film's idea is that Being famous can really invade your privacy! And that's BAD!I also found it depressing, because where Truman invited you to think about YOUR place as a viewer of television, this film presents people all over the country spending hours watching Ed as if it's the MOST WONDERFUL THING THEY COULD POSSIBLY DO! At the end of Truman the film showed viewers being turned OFF by the unfairness of the show to Truman. Not so here-- they're ravenous for Ed, even when it's clear that they are making his life miserable. If this film had shown even ONE viewer who remained UNINTERESTED, it would have been much better off.What's worse is listening to people who think that this film has IDEAS. It does have ideas. BANAL ideas.The performances are decent, Matt McC being less annoying than usual, Rob Reiner being FOURTEEN TIMES as annoying as usual, and Ellen Degeneres actually being the best part of the film.The film ends with such a freshman-level, lurid and-- I have to say-- STUPID resolution, that I shudder to even think of it. Truman triumphed because he FOUGHT and GREW and FACED HARDSHIP. Not Ed.I hate to say this, but this is the kind of film that makes you WONDER about the people who like it (not to mention the people who made it). It's obvious that a lot of people like it. But, consider that a recent study showed that 50% of the American population does NOT know that the Earth goes around the Sun.When you see a sign that says "EdTV" RUN THE OTHER WAY.</fullReview>

Edtv does start small, but after a week or so he is the biggest star of TV that is only famous for being him. In his life on TV he is involved with Jenna Elfman as Shari, Woody Harrelson as his brother Ray Pekurny, Sally Kirkland as Jeanette, Oscar winner Martin Landau as Al and many others. Also starring director Rob Reiner as Mr. Whitaker, a brief Dennis Hopper as Henry 'Hank' Pekurny, Ed's Dad, Elizabeth Hurley as Jill, Harry Shearer as Moderator, Michael Moore and Jay Leno.

Moreover, it seemed like whereas "TTS" was more of a biting satire, "Edtv" was going soft - maybe trying to be cute - with cameras following a video store clerk (Matthew McConaughey). However, years of reality shows have shown just how disgusting TV can get. And these two movies predicted it. Although I do prefer the former, the latter actually seems to be portraying what we now know as reality shows.So, I will say that this movie doesn't do as good a job as "The Truman Show", it does have some funny scenes. I actually thought that Ellen Degeneres and Rob Reiner were the two best cast members. OK seeing once; Ron Howard has done better.

		<fullReview>I don't think there can be any doubt about where this movie got the idea. OK, reality shows are gaining a lot in success in recent years, but only one year before this movie was released, the brilliant movie "The Truman Show" with Jim Carrey came out. It's clear that they wanted a piece of the cake when they saw that the movie was a success. Even though I like both movies, I have to admit that my absolute favorite will always be The Truman Show.Both EDtv and The Truman Show are about a man who's entire life is filmed and broadcasted 24 hours a day as a reality soap. At first everything is fine, but than they want to end it (for different reasons) but can't, because the bosses don't allow it. Even though the main story line is the same, there are also some differences between the two. For instance, in The Truman Show, the subject doesn't know he's being filmed, while in EDtv Ed Pekurny knows all too well that he's being followed by the cameras. In the Truman show, everything is fake, the surroundings, the people, nothing is real. In Edtv, the man lives his normal life.The problem with movies that have about the same subject is that you always will compare them. And when you do, you will probably agree with me that The Truman Show is better than EDtv. Does that mean that EDtv isn't any good? No, certainly not. It's OK and stands out above the average, but it just isn't as good as The Truman Show. I give it an 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst take possible of the Truman Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very start, this film tries to convince the viewer that this is a horrible idea and should never be made. It's happens to be the only thing the show ever manages to get right. Edtv is nothing but shallow, boring, rude comedy. If watching an unshaven loser in sweatpants scratch himself, sit on the john, and clip his toenails is what you consider good film making, well then you're in luck.From the family in tanktops gathered round with ol' uncle Ben arguing and eating KFC, to the useless girlfriend who hates herself and loves her boyfriend's brother, this movie is so painfully stereotypical it's just insulting. The 'romance' boils down to a drunk idiot crying about her obsession with obvious jerks while the hero pats her back and tells her how perfect she is, at least until she'll finally sleep with him.There's not one joke, not one concept that I found to make this movie worth even a half hour of your time. The only way I could possibly recommend this movie is if you consider Jerry Springer to be the best television show ever made. And sadly, that's exactly what this movie relies on, the Jerry Springer effect. It even demonstrates in the movie as the show is so awful, the mindless masses zone out and follow along all day, forgetting about their lives. The Truman Show may be the best example of this concept, but Edtv is easily the worst. There's just no reason for this movie to have been made.</fullReview>

Did they get it right ? In my humble opinion - No . And if it's trying to be a satire I found it lacking , I mean there's not enough biting cynicism involved ( Though with Ron Howard as director what do you expect ? ) , maybe the producers should have viewed WAG THE DOG to see how it's done Perhaps I should ask how many people praising this film have seen the classic teleplay - No make that " Yet another classic teleplay " - from Nigel Kneale THE YEAR OF THE SEXUAL OLYMPICS where a TV audience watch a TV reality show where contestants are being murdered , a sort of BIG BROTHER mixed in with Agatha Christie .

		<shortDescription>Just a Pale Shadow of "The Truman Show." **1/2 out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer to "ED TV" I instantly found plot points similar to those of "The Truman Show," last years best movie. And in reality, "ED TV" is all but a pale, more vulgar version of that very movie. But what great material to reuse. I mean, after all, if one likes a movie with the same concept as another, chances are they're going to like both.The movie is about a failing cable company who decides to put a live TV show on the air in which a selected person's life is on 24 hours a day. They pick a nobody named Ed, who has no life, or interesting things about him, that is why people find it interesting to watch him. The show gets wondrous ratings, and the production company decides to continue with that show for larger periods of time. Ed gets tired of this, but can't get out, due to previously signed contracts and blah blah blah.There are plenty of entertaining sub-plots to hold the attention span of the audience. There is the long lost father who suddenly turns up after his son is placed on TV (Dennis Hopper). There is a romance between Ed and his brother's girl friend. There is the sex story with who other than Elizabeth Hurly. And a closing that works well in the most hilarious of ways.The opening of the film is quite slow, detailing the selected person that will be placed on live national TV. But even though there is explanation and introduction of all the colorful characters, this film really lacks depth and meaning. It's another one of those movies where you may enjoy for the time while watching, but after you leave the theater, you'll never think about it again. Because if there is no true concept or message behind the movie, then there is no reason to remember it.There are some very funny moments in "ED TV," I just wish Ron Howard, who has done better ("Ransom") would have focused a bit more on laughs other than just plot. Yes, the plot is somewhat interesting, but it's all done in a midcourse comedic tone, unlike "The Truman Show," which was all height and glory. "ED TV" blends tragedy and comedy together, reimbursing the old saying that there is funny material in every sad situation.I loved the performances from everyone in the cast. Matthew McConaughey shows us what he can really do with a juicy role like Ed, and he takes advantage of it all the way though. Jenna Elfman only proves that there is more to her acting ability than comedy, and delivers a satisfactory performance as one of Ed's love interests. Woody Harrelson puts some spike into the role of Ed's big brother. Both Ellen DeGeneres and Rob Reiner play perfect television producers. I liked Dennis Hopper, finally not playing a villain. Elizabeth Hurly acts deliciously as yet another sexpot. Martin Landau is annoying and perverse, but in the end does succeed in bringing forth his character appropriately."ED TV" doesn't quite work. It's a great comparison tool, however.</fullReview>
