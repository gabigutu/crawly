		<shortDescription>A true "classic". Please, please don't miss this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film maybe, 20 times over the last 30 years. It's one of the rare movies that entertains each and every time. Seeing movies like Flight Of The Phoenix only reminds me just how bad "Hollywood" has gotten.The plot. It is quite simple really. Survival. But how the writers, producers and directors mold the basic premise into a complex and compelling 2 hours of cinema is a delight. To watch Stewart, Finch, Attenborough, Kruger and company work in this movie is to see the difference between actors of yesteryear and movie stars of today.I am watching the movie as I type this and I'm watching Attenborough react to finding out Kruger's "secret". His laughter is both hilarious and pitiable. And the look of shock and confusion on Stewart's face says it all.As you can tell, I love this movie. I cannot vote it or recommend it highly enough. You would be well served to find this on DVD. Enjoy and happy flying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece from the good old days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with most of the people here that this movie is an overlooked gem. It always comes to mind when I think of movie classics, but most people I've known have never seen it. If it comes on TV or you get the chance to rent it, definitely give it a look.While the movie stands alone as a great suspense and survival movie with great dialogue and a greater cast, it also has some aspects that give it deeper significance. A couple of people have commented on the "old school seat-of-the-pants flying" vs. "mathematical engineering" conflict in the movie, and this is certainly a big part of it.Another conflict, subtler but just as important, has gone completely unmentioned here. That's the issue of the crew's mistrust of Kruger for being German. This movie is pretty important for the way it excellently touches on the tension many people still felt by the sixties on working side by side with the former enemy in the new postwar world. It's not an accident that the three main characters that have to come together to survive are American, English and German. "Flight of the Phoenix" is one movie that is timeless in its direct appeal but should be taken in context of the time in which it was produced in order to be fully appreciated.Taking these conflicts together, the overall message is clear. In the brave new world, unless we put aside old divisions and value input from everyone, no one gets out alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb All-Guy Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Flight of the Phoenix", based on the Elleston Trevor novel, has little more than one set and no costume changes; and the action is confined to the few yards around an airplane crashed in the desert. Yet its story is more gripping than most "action" movies.An old airplane owned by an oil company crashes at the hands of a crusty old pilot (James Stewart) whose bitterness and fatalism are brought out when he's forced to admit the crash was due to pilot error. His half-alcoholic navigator has insured that the plane was off course, and cannot be discovered by rescue craft (if any); he's a nice guy and becomes the mediator between the rancorous passengers and crew, but he lacks self-confidence (Richard Attenborough in a finely understated performance). The passengers include a company accountant (Dan Duryea); a shell-shocked employee (Ernest Borgnine, by turns touching and silly) sent home in the company of his doctor (Christian Marquand); a straight-laced British officer (Peter Finch) and his mutinous sergeant (Ronald Fraser); several oil company employees, including one who is always making vicious jokes at the expense of the others (Ian Bannen); and a German "designer" (Hardy Kruger) who went to the oil fields to visit his brother. Stranded in the desert with no hope of rescue, they debate various schemes for salvation, all of which fail, until Kruger tells the others he is an airplane designer and he has discovered a way to build a new plane from the spare parts of the old one. All it needs for a handful of unskilled men, living on a little water and no food but pressed dates, coping with unbearable heat during the day and unbearable cold at night, to transform themselves into aircraft manufacturers before they all succumb.All performances are good. Some of the actors (George Kennedy, the always interesting Dan Duryea) are woefully underused -- perhaps large segments of their roles wound up on the cutting-room floor. The major tension is the confrontation between Stewart's old-school pilot and Kruger's technologically self-righteous engineer (at one point, Stewart's character makes the incredibly prescient remark that one day the little men with their slide-rules and computers will inherit the earth).Even when they all decide they'd rather attempt building the new plane with hope than sit around watching each other die, new surprises spring up that compromise the whole thing.The script and the acting are solid, especially James Stewart in a different and challenging role. The music is sometimes overwhelming, and stings give unnecessary emphasis to some lines. Also of interest is the listing in the credits of "The Love Theme" which seems like a silly thing to call it.A superlative story of men living on the ragged edge of survival, working together but not necessarily getting along or surrendering their own values.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tension and drama are the making of a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where as many films with star casts have failed, this one does not.This film oozes quality by the bucket load. It centres round the story of the survivors of a plane crash who attempt to build a plane out of the wreckage. The tension is apparent from the start with the heat of the desert alone almost driving the characters to madness.The combination of brilliant script and excellent acting brings to the fore a brilliant film. Ian Bannen, in particular, gives gives both grit and relish in his possibily his greatest screen performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic example of conflict resolution and mastering challenges - and a great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This masterpiece is now 40 years old and has lost nothing of it's excitement due to it's fantastic, outstanding actors (Attenborough and Kruger have never done better from my point of view), director, scenery and the simplicity of the story itself. A plane lost in a desert, no help and a challenge to master by people, who never chose to master their destiny together in a hostile environment.The way the conflict is layed out can serve as an example for organizational conflicts, cultural conflicts, simply: whenever humans have to solve a problem that jeopardizes their future under resource constraints. Or even mankind on earth in the hostile universe, who need to solve their very own conflicts? All actors are able to deliver fully convincing natural emotions in this kind of situation to make the audience understand why humans usually fail to solve these conflicts. How many actors can you name today that are superstars and can do it like them? It's becomes evident how difficult the first step to compromise or to accept leadership of another person is, especially for western individuals. Accept leadership and downgrade oneself in the hierarchy, despite the fact that there is usually one solution which suits the groups interest as a whole better? How many leaders or e.g. managers are able to do this? In the end, the collaborative approach is successful, staged behind a general struggle for power, influenced by the cold war environment, containing an explosive mix of historical facts and clichés on British imperialism/militarism, American heroism, German nazihodd/engineering rational and various other aspects. You could easily work out how difficult the situation would be, if nowadays a e.g. member of priest of a Christian church would crash land together with a Muslim mullah. How would they be able to work together to master the hostility of the desert? Would they be able to accept a compromise? You can spend months to identify all the clichés that are used to increase the tension between the characters they have to understand to manage their faith, unfortunately you need a lot of historical background knowledge on 19th century till cold war to understand all the details, but that is only another good reason to start studying this.The movie also shows that every specific cultural background has it's advantages closely tied to its disadvantages, e.g. the heroism advantage of attack eaten up by a lack of rationality (for example due to alcoholism/boredom). Actually, this movie should be screened as an example for success for conflicts of international companies, global organizations or just humans between the frontiers of different cultures.And if this is too educational for you: It is even great entertainment, if you are just watch it from a pure emotional point of view. Myself being a German I would wish that we still can show of some of the engineering mastership that Dorfner shows of - however I'm happy that no technocrats are now ruling my country.In the end: What a masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film about the use of resources.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edwin Aldrin the second man to walk on the moon was asked once if he was in his spacecraft and his engine quit running and he was going to die in an hour how would he spend that last hour? He replied `I'd work on the engine.' This film essentially is about that same type situation. A cargo plane with passengers aboard goes down in the Arabian Desert and the survivors quickly come to the realization that they eventually will be found but probably by that time they will be dead. One of the passengers says he can build a flyable plane out the existing wreckage and they can save themselves. However he's never taken on a project quite this large before.  There are a number of little subplots with the characters to include a hard-nosed pilot, his booze guzzling co-pilot, a British Army sergeant who has a dislike for officers, A by the book British Army officer, A doctor, A mental patient, A cynical oil field worker, an accountant, and so forth. It's somewhat of an all star cast so it helps the picture. Although a little long the film is intriguing. The only damper on this movie is that Paul Mantz a superb pilot was killed in the making of it. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>A twin-engine propeller airplane, carrying a group of oil company people to a Saharan outpost, crashes in the African desert? On board, a handful of disparate characters: a jovial pessimist, a noble doctor, a 'frantic' fellow, a distrustful bitter pilot, determined to contradict most suggested plans; a British military officer who reacts in the only way he knows; an insubordinate sergeant who refuses to take any risk; an eccentric airplane designer proposing a seemingly impossible goal? and a nervy navigator who tries to hold the group together? The marooned survivors (with no hopes of being found or rescued) realize their best hope is the 'impossible': to accept the task of building a smaller plane, a "Phoenix," from the wreckage of the old?The depiction of the construction is fascinating as much of the true characters of the men (facing the savagely violent environment) come out under the threat of thirst, hunger, and exposure? The degree of their weakness, consternation, arrogance, selfishness, and cowardice is successfully described? Aldrich tries to build a film filled with self-sacrifice, crazed arguments, and, above all else, a slow descent into foolish acts by all? He keeps us in constant suspense, wondering if the rebuild plane will get successfully off the ground?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best survival films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I use snippets from this film in a project management class. It is hard to imagine how the casting could have been any better. Jimmy Stewart plays the part of the aging pilot with an adventurous past so well not only because he was a terrific actor, but because he really was an aging pilot with a an adventurous past. Richart Attenborrow (spelling?) is wonderful as the diplomatic copilot that stands between Stewart and the engineer played by Kruger.The dialogue was some of the best I've ever heard. "Mr. Townes you behave as though stupidity were a virtue..." You have to love it.I'm almost sorry to see this movie being remade since it was done so well, but I'll still line up for the new one just to see if the magic can be made to work twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great character studies in a survival context.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These comments are partly inspired by other comments and the message boards. This film presents a hypothetical survival situation and does a great job of showing how innovation and persistence bring the survivors through. Strengths and weaknesses are plausibly portrayed in characters who have depth and a mix of vices and virtues. That Sgt Watson does not suffer for his sin is just the sort of thing that makes this an adult movie. That's what "real life" is like. Often people who do the wrong thing seem to go unpunished, or worse, to actually benefit. You could get a whole other novel out of the Sgt's subsequent life. There was a real survivor story a few years back where a trimaran, the "Rose-Noelle" capsized, and the crew existed on the overturned craft for many weeks. There were tensions between people. Each individual seemed to be weak in some ways and strong in others - eg one guy was very despondent and was often treated with contempt by 2 others, but he was also far more patient at fishing, he caught a lot more than anyone else. The skipper/owner kept up his leadership role and the others resented him being hard on them (I thought no harder than was needed). When the trimaran eventually ran ashore, and they were picked up by emergency services, at least 2 of the crew immediately separated themselves from the skipper and never contacted him afterward, according to his book. When these two wrote their own book, they stated that they had taken food from the common store when they weren't being watched. I was flabbergasted that they would admit such a thing without feeling any guilt. They didn't express any anyway. In the 70s I read a self-improvement book about so-called "non-eroneous" people who would never worry about what other people thought about them or what they did. I now believe the old saying that "Only very competent men, or very beautiful women, or very rich people of either gender can afford to be totally forthright all the time." Hardy Kruger's character was a wonderful example of the "non-erroneous" person. His view was that he worked harder, he planned everything, he was essential to the project, so it was OK for him to take more water than the others. He openly admitted it when confronted by the pilot (James Stewart). However he changed his behaviour because he saw that he had to get people on-side if the project was to succeed. That a model aircraft engineers skills were as good as a full-size engineers was self-evident to him. He was not without his faults however. During the engine-starting sequence, he rather lost his nerve. He was not able to trust the best man for the task (the pilot), to do the task, without trying to interfere. Hardy Kruger is one of my favorite actors, very versatile, he always managed to please even when cast in utter tripe like Hatari!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding movie with an extraordinary cast and nail-biting direction by Robert Aldrich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie talks about a motley group in a small airplane piloted by a stubborn and obstinate man (James Stewart) and a navigator (Richard Attenborough) . The aircraft crashes on Sahara desert rounded by sand seas and passengers crew (Peter Finch , George Kennedy , Ronald Fraser , Christian Marquand..) have to survive against extraordinary odds and risks and they try to rebuild their plane in order to avoid sufferings caused for hostile elements . This has a well sense desert atmosphere filling one with revulsion for the conditions in which unfortunates are forced to exist stranded on an Arabian uninhabited spot : starvation , famine , heat , thirst , enemies and confrontation among themselves .This exciting movie is an intelligent variant upon the Hollywood scripts in which aircrafts crash in remote locations such as : ¨Airport¨ series or ¨Alive : Miracle of the Andes¨ . It's a thoughtful and broody film with excellent interpretations and an utterly male star-studded casting . James Stewart as a veteran and embittered pilot is the intrepid hero who's considered guilty of the accident for his error , he's magnificent likeness to Richard Attenborough , a previous RAF pilot and now a boozy alcoholic navigator in a damaged plane . Hardy Kruger as the cocky German engineer is splendid . John Finch as a rigid and stiff officer is very fine and similarly to his coward subordinate Ronald Fraser . Ernest Borgnine as a nutty with enormous eager to escape is sensational . George Kennedy , Gabriele Tinti , Christian Marquand , Dan Duryea are well but make roles quite secondaries . Special mention to Ian Bannen , as the group's mechanic , he only achieved the Academy Award nomination but he didn't obtain it . Frank de Vol musical score (Robert Aldrich's usual musician) is spectacular and lively . Joseph Biroc cinematography is glimmer and colorful . The motion picture is stunningly directed by Robert Aldrich . The second and recent version with Dennis Quaid , Giovanni Ribisi and Miranda Otto is worst deemed . Rating : Awesome and astounding .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable performance driven spin on the disaster movie genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Returning from an oil field with a plane full of crew etc going on leave, Frank Towns' plane enters a sandstorm over the Sahara desert and crashes. As various attempts at rescue or escape fail one passenger, Dorfmann suggests his plan to rebuild the plane as a smaller version and attempt to fly out, leaving the bulk of the damage craft behind. However tensions mount as personalities conflict as all the men face death.I had only ever heard of this film before I finally got round to watching it last night on television. I was aware of the basic plot and had assumed it was more recent that it actually was. I watched it assuming that it was made in the early seventies when the disaster movie genre was just starting to take off (sorry ? accidental pun). However this was made prior to this and is probably a much better film for it ? in the seventies the film would have required more spectacle, so the crash would have been much more dramatic and horrifying. As it is now, the film is more about the men under stress than it is about anything else.This is brought out well and the majority of the drama and tension within the film is as much from these conflicts as it is from the pressure to escape the desert. The film is longer than I expected it to be but it pretty much sustains itself for that length. The main reason for the film working so well is the cast, which has it's fair share of famous faces but also has more than it's fair share of good performances.Stewart is really strong in the lead (although, in fairness, there is no one main character) and becomes increasingly grizzled as the film goes on. His character is not without flaws even if he does come out of this well. Attenborough is also good but is less evident in the film than some of the others. Krüger has the least pleasant of the roles given that he plays a tough German. He manages to make the character likeable while still going about his task with a strict organised German air to him. Finch is good and is well supported by Fraser. The support cast includes strong performances from Borgnine, Bannen, Kennedy, Marquand and the director's own son is thrown in for colour!Overall this is much better than the disaster-type movie I had expected as it is a film where the plane crash isn't a blaze of spectacle and the death scenes aren't played out for full effect. Instead it is a tension adventure story that is driven by some great performances by a cast full of well known actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jimmy Stewart as good as ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The pilot character "Frank Towers" played by the wonderful (life) Jimmy Stewart is typical of the era it portrayed. Many ex-service pilots found work in the civilian aviation world - their training, paid for by Governments, was a cheap way of crewing aircraft. This film portrays such a pilot - taught to fly "by the seat of his pants" demonstrates the risks of such a policy."Frank Towers" flies on regardless of his navigator's (Dickie Attenborough) concerns, into a cloud of locusts. The engines air-intakes clog up and the outcome is inevitable. Hardy Kruger's performance as "Hienrich Dorfmunn" is a classic. As an model-aircraft designer, "Frank" fails to accept the parallel between models and "real" aircraft calling them "toys". His arrogance almost scuppers the plan to build a flyable contraption made from the wreckage of the crashed aircraft. The labour for this endeavour comes from the motley group of passengers whom include Earnest Borgnine as a simpleton, Peter Finch as a British Army officer with Ronald Fraser as his reluctant sargeant. Ian Bannen as "ratbags" plays the cynical Scot. Dickie Attenborugh's "Lew Moran" becomes the arbitor in a complex chronology of events which collectively conspire to prevent success. Stunt pilot Paul Mantz to whom the film is dedicated, died during its making. Clearly the aircraft with skis on sand was a non-starter, and "wheels" miraculously appeared during the take-off scene. This takes nothing away from the story and it is certainly gripping stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absorbing character piece that's acted accordingly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A transport aeroplane carrying an assortment of men crash lands in the Sahara desert, these men must group together in spite of their varying indifference's and build another plane out of the wreckage.It perhaps, on the surface, doesn't sound much does it? We as viewers are asked to spend over two hours watching these men interact with each other with differing results. The location stays the same, it is just sand, sun, and men awaiting death. Yet the film is one of the best exponents of the character piece because the characters each have their own personal hang ups. Be it carrying scars from the war, or a class difference of upbringing, or that demon addiction to alcohol, these men have to overcome themselves before they can overcome the biggest hurdle in front of them.Boasting what reads as a who's who of great character actors, The Flight Of The Phoenix becomes a riveting watch because we feel the stifled nature of their plight, because we are blessed to have these wonderful actors fully realising the great writing from Lukas Heller. It is absorbing, it is very sharp, and fittingly we get a twist that makes the ending even more rewarding.Highly Recommended. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a Toy !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flying across the deserts of North Africa, one can imagine how dangerous it would be to be stranded in the trackless ocean of sand. In 1965, a film called "The Flight of The Phoenix" appeared on movie marquee's around the country. From the first moment audiences took in this film, they recognized the distinctive traits of a true drama, which would establish for itself, the foundations of a classic. The tale is that of an outmoded airplane load of oil employees, who in conjunction with a couple of passengers, run headlong into a desert sand storm and are forced to crash into the forbidden wastelands below. Thus begins the impossible task of not only surviving in the empty miles of life-less sands, but to somehow return to civilization. James Stewart is Capt. Frank Towns, an experienced pilot, who realizes the 'push-button' age has made him obsolete. Richard Attenborough is superb as Lew Moran, the boozing asst. pilot. Peter Finch plays Capt. Harris who believes his army training and Sgt. Watson (Ron Frasser) will save the desperate group. Ernest Borgnine, plays Trucker Cobb, who's only concern is to move up to become line chief. Ian Bannen, Dan Duryea, and George Kennedy are the company crew. But it is Hardy Krüger who plays Heinrich Dorfmann, who astonishes disbelieving Capt. Towns and everyone else with his boost that with their help, the on-board tools and supplies and some undamaged parts of the crashed plane, he can design a model air-craft which will fly them to safety. Fantastic idea, but no one cares for his suicide plan. What ensues is a test of wills, against each other, the unforgiving landscape, hostile Arabs and the scant water supply and time they have left. *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing "Phoenix" years ago, maybe in the early 70s, when I stayed up late one night. It came on and for some reason I didn't bother to change the channel to something different and to this day I'm glad I watched it. It stayed with me and when I saw it again sometime in the 90s, it was as good as I remembered it to be. Maybe it's the story, the acting, James Stewart (in a different sort of roll being as far from dashing and handsome as any actor can be) - I don't know - but it clicks for me and I still watch it whenever it comes on. The actors are all good in their rolls and leave nothing to be desired. FX MOV is showing it as I type. The print is beautiful and the letterbox format beats pan &amp; scan any day.I don't know if I'll see the remake. It's hard to improve on a lot of originals and I don't think this original version needs any improvement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 'real' film in very interesting ways...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[MINOR SPOILERS] The novel this movie was based on fanned my imagination as a kid - I read and re-read it several times. Hadn't seen the movie in over 30 years until the DVD came out, and was delighted that my long-ago passion was justified - this is a great film. Well-plotted, good suspense, good cinematography, great attention to how people really react under extreme stress. In addition, the physical action is 'real' in a way no CGI film of today ever could be.Compared to the disaster films of the 1970s, the theme of the film is Promethean - instead of simply trying to escape, the characters do something fantastic - they come up with a way to survive that practically amounts to stealing fire from heaven. Gazing at a wrecked plane lying in the desert, Dorfman ("Stringer" in the novel) sees a new plane rising from the ashes, couched in the new language of math and aerodynamics. The rest of the film seesaws between who has the power of the future - analytic, engineer-style dreamers like Dorfman versus seat of the pants Stewart's pilot character. In the end, both are vindicated - only Dorfman can envision the Phoenix, but the Phoenix can't fly without Stewart the "outstanding" pilot.There's a moment of Christian symbolism (common in films of this vintage) when, after a night of exhausting work, one of the characters gazes at their work and comments "it looks like an airplane." Actually, the Phoenix looks like a cross with the sun behind it, in contrast to the crosses marking the dead on a nearby dune. Cool. This motif is repeated as the engine of the Phoenix powers up on the last day - a thrilling scene. There's even a Calvary reference where the half-dead survivors drag the cross-shaped plane to its launching place - if they endure this last trial, they will be reborn.But the most amazing thing for me is that the Phoenix was actually built for the film. The original author of the novel worked hard to make sure that the story was possible. The movie producers went further - they built the actual, physical Phoenix and flew it. One stuntman died, but it flew. Other scenes have the same reality that no longer exists in film - for example, A-list actors standing a few feet in front of an unshielded, roaring propeller. Wouldn't happen now.What would we have done today making this film? We would have hired a computer graphics company create an overhyped, impossible plane, that could only fly on their monitors. Not the same. In this film's climax we see a real plane flying. The film shares a common mood of the era seen in the real desert of "Lawrence of Arabia" and the real bridge in "Bridge on the River Kwai." Since film today seems destined to go 100% CGI in the future we won't be making films like "Flight of the Phoenix". Is this a loss? Whatever you think of the culture of the early 1960s, their entertainment had a "reality check" that has vanished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>grand adventure and great survival movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you haven't heard already, this movie is about a plane that wrecks in the desert, and the struggles of the survivors to keep surviving.The cast is all star: James Stewart is an the protagonist, an experienced pilot, but considered aged by a character who slowly emerges as his antagonist, Hardy Kruger, who is the young smart college guy who can save them. Stewart's character doesn't buy this, and the arbiter character, his navigator played by Richard Attenborough, tries to bring a peace between these two when he realizes it is the only hope they have of surviving.Meanwhile, other characters have other ideas of survival, notably a British officer played by Peter Finch, who has one troop, Sgt. Watson, played by Ronald Fraser. While Stewart dismisses Finch's plans of traipsing through the desert, he clearly believes it better than what he considers half cocked ideas by the upstart Kruger. He learns better, but is unsure of what he is learning.A brilliant look at clashes of personalities in a situation where everyone needs to work together. Even if George Kennedy and Dan Duryea are little more than bit players, it is good to see such giants. This is an all star cast, so some stars were relegated to smaller than usual roles. The characters are all well drawn and played.A brilliant and scenic movie, excellent in every aspect. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed at seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phoenix is one of the whole time greats. I saw it when it was new in the cinema and I must have seen it fifty times on TV since then, usually turning on half way in and then getting hooked again. I decided to get the DVD so I could watch it from the start.This movie has a great cast and a great story. James Stewart plays the pilot who feels he is responsible for the deaths of several of his passengers following a forced landing in the desert. Eventually, he and the rest of the survivors are persuaded by Dorfmann (Hardy Kruger) to attempt to build an aircraft from the remains of the old one. The survivors are a very mixed bag; Ian Bannen does a wonderful job as Crow the obnoxious one. Ronald Frazer has Sgt Watson is another beautifully played sad case but by the end of the movie they've done enough to make us care about them.Aircraft bits dominate almost every shot and the movie illustrates beautifully the nature of machines; normally we see aircraft only has complete things, continuous and perfect. We could miss the fact that they are made of parts, each one crafted to a determined shape. Parts which if put together in a certain way can subjugate the laws of nature.Dorfmann has to figure out how to make a plane from what's left intact of the old. He must come up with a design that's viable. He has to work everything out, how the old plane must be torn apart, how the parts of it will be moved around, and how they will be reassembled, how the controls must be rigged. In reality this would be an almost superhuman feat. Could a real life aircraft designer do such a thing? And Dorfmann is very young, what young engineer would have been involved in the entire lifecycle of aircraft production? But of course Dorfmann's company makes model planes, and Dorfmann has always had to design everything on his projects! The pilot Towns (James Stewart) has to surrender his authority to Dorfmann so that the new plane can be built. Towns doesn't believe the plane is feasible but he is persuaded that the project is better than letting them sit around waiting to die. Towns doesn't want to be responsible for more deaths should the plane get finished. Towns rails against Dorfmann long and often but always Dorfmann is right and Towns wrong. But Dorfmann knows he needs Towns' skills to fly the plane.After many problems the plane is finished and Towns must start it up and fly it. The point where Towns climbs aboard and pulls the ladder up behind him is very sweet. This is where the Towns takes the plane back from Dorfmann. He must use all his skill and experience to get the engine started.The engine can only be started with a Coffman starter, a cartridge system. If the engine does not start all their efforts have been wasted, but at least Towns won't have killed more in another crash. But Towns will have failed as a pilot if he does not get the engine started.In the event, of course Towns chooses to start the engine and is shown to have skill and knowledge that Dorfmann does not have. In one sense getting the engine going is the end of the story, Towns has finally made his choice and committed wholeheartedly to the project and in doing so got his self respect back.And now with the motor going the Phoenix has ceased to be a collection of useless parts, it's become the difference between life and death and every last one of them has made it happen.Paul Mantz a veteran pilot of movies from Howard Hughes's day was killed flying for this movie. Perhaps that is why the actual flying shots look a bit truncated; we don't actually see the Phoenix land and the scene where the survivors appear over the horizon looks rather naff and smacks of cheap TV movie. Well nothings perfect but Phoenix comes pretty close.BTW in the original story Krugers character is called Stringer, (model aeroplane fans will get it)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not just because of Robert Aldrich Directing that this movie is a must see. James Stewart, Richard Attenborough, George Kennedy, and a fine cast have a lot to do with it. The solid material and script the film is based on has a lot to say for the film.This plane crash film tells the story of humans surviving and then trying to pick themselves up after a plane crash in the desert. Stewart plays the pilot and the hero but in an Aldrich type of scenario he is the anti-hero. He admits his error causes the plane to crash. As it is obviously an old plane there is some conjecture to it all being his fault but he takes the blame anyhow.The cast and direction here are excellent. It is great that Turner Classic Movies has started running this as I have to admit this is a film I had not seen. The film is a bit long though when you consider rebuilding a wrecked plane, you have to factor that in. The movie avoids the drag of length with sold performances and a good script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Flight of the Phoenix" (1965) is a survival story about a group of men who crashland in the Libyan desert. A German airplane designer (Hardy Krüger) amongst them suggests utilizing the workable remains of the wreckage to create a new Frankenstein plane, "The Phoenix," and fly out. Although his scheme is initially perceived as mad they soon realize it might be their only legitimate way out.Even though "Flight" is a survival adventure it's just as much a drama since the setting is stationary (a relatively small area of desert) and there's very little opportunity for action, except the occasional punch or two. The action here is the tension between the men. First and foremost there's pilot Towns' friction with the Kraut airplane designer, Dorfmann. Towns (James Stewart) is a man of old-fashioned practicality whereas Dorfmann is a visionary. Between the two is Towns' assistant, Moran (Richard Attenborough), who understands &amp; likes Towns but sees the genius of Dorfmann.A stiff-upper-lipped British officer and his sergeant provide more tension. The officer always seems to make the quasi-heroic decision that, while admirable on the surface, is usually the dumbest choice. The sergeant realizes this and is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Does the British Army's chain of command mean anything in such a survival situation? Should he follow this boneheaded officer to a premature grave in the name of respect and loyalty or should he follow the wiser choices for the sake of survival? Towns despises the sergeant for choosing the latter, but is he really wrong? It's debatable.Other notables are on hand, like Ernest Bornine, Christian Marquand, George Kennedy and Ian Bannen. Borgnine's excellent as a half-crazed employee sent home in the company of his doctor, played by Marquand. One passenger resorts to constant joking and mocking to cope with the situation (Bannen).The film runs 2 hours and 22 minutes but the drama is so well-written it doesn't seem that long. Like all great films it pulls you in and holds your attention until the end.The film was shot, believe it or not, in the desert areas of Imperial County in SE California, as well as Yuma.DVD INFO: Some whiners complain about the DVD being butchered, etc. but I just viewed it and everything looked great and there were no scenes cut out.FINAL WORD: "Flight of the Phoenix" is one of the greatest survival adventure-dramas ever made. Although there's a little bit of datedness, the film stands head-and-shoulders above the 2004 remake.GRADE: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For whatever reason, most of my favorite films somehow involve surviving some ordeal in the desert. This one is certainly no exception. Although I have a tough time believing that the weakened survivors of a plane crash could build an airplane in the middle of the desert from parts cannibalized from their crashed ship, the acting is strong enough to allow you to suspend reality long enough to enjoy the film. Jimmy Stewart, borders on being a very unlikable character, Ernest Borgnine convinces you that the desert can drive a person mad, and Hardy Kruger makes you believe that a motivated German can overcome any obstacle. There hasn't been a film made that doesn't involve the viewer suspending something in order to enjoy it. This one is worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GOOD - This certainly sports an all-star cast with Jimmy Stewart, Richard Attenborough, Peter Finch, Hardy Krueger, Ernest Borgnine and Dan Duryea. It's well-acted and well- written, making the characters fairly interesting guys. If you enjoy stage plays, you'll like this.THE BAD - I don't like talky stage plays, and that's what this is, even though the scenario is out in the desert, with a bunch of guys trying to cope under tough conditions after their cargo plane goes down in a sandstorm over the Saraha desert.It turns out to be two hours and 20-some minutes of a bunch of bickering guys, along with character studies of each man. The most disappointing of all was Stewart's "Captain Frank Towns," another bitter irreverent guy like he played in "Shenandoah," (another '60s film, by the way.) Of course, the cliché of having the German guy (Hardy Krueger playing "Heinrich Dorfmann") as the worst character, is also in here. I made it through one viewing of this testosterone soaper, thanks to the "good news" written above, but I have no desire to ever sit through this again. It wasn't THAT interesting!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An earlier Benghazi nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How would you react if your plane crashed in the desert, you had a meager amount of water and a few dates to try to survive on, and no one gave a damn about trying to rescue you?Such is the plight of the fine ensemble of actors in this film. It's not easy to watch these tortured souls blister, needle each other, and waste away as the plane's guilt-ridden pilot, played ably by Jimmy Stewart, vies for the position of alpha male with a possibly crazy German who delays in revealing it's toy planes he designs and not real flying machines.It remained unclear to me why Stewart's character claimed pilot error when a blinding sandstorm had clearly mucked up the works. And way too much time is given to the German's ministrations over the damaged guts of the plane. In addition, it seemed quite lame not to demonstrate how the patched-together aircraft managed to land safely after finally regaining flight. (A written epilogue to the film notes that a stuntman died in its production -- could this be why?)For most of the rest of the film, the plot hangs together well, and dangers and pitfalls are rife along the way. When a band of nomads appears, at first we feel the survivors' jubilation at enjoying proximity to other human beings. Then we quickly absorb their paranoia as they ponder exactly if and how they should approach these mysterious strangers without having their throats cut.This exceedingly grim film ends almost miraculously. With so much realism earlier in the movie, I'm not sure I really cared for that. It's possible this production was inspired by the far-less-happily ending tale of "Lady Be Good," a US bomber lost in the Libyan desert during WWII. One topical surprise here is that in the movie, the plane had been headed to Benghazi, made infamous just weeks ago by the terrorism killings of US Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brains meets Brawn, Phoenix takes flight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing movie on several levels. First, virtually the entire film is shot within 100 yards of the plane, which has crash-landed in the stifling Sahara desert. Second, until the exhilarating finale, there is virtually no action in this movie -- unless your idea of bustling activity is the ponderous cutting and rebuilding of the downed aircraft. Yet this movie had me on the edge of my seat for the entire two hours. The screenplay crackles and the acting -- a sensational cast led by James Stewart and Richard Attenborough -- is in a word superb. It's an eclectic cast of characters, to say the least! At the heart of the film is the strained relationship between Capt. Frank Towns (Stewart) and Heinrich Dorfmann (Hardy Kruger), and it reaches a pinnacle in one of the most jarring movie scenes I have ever witnessed. Dorfmann, you see, happens to be an airplane designer and comes up with the idea to reshape and rebuild the busted plane into a makeshift airbus. But the tough, old-school Towns has little use for the egghead Dorfmann, and the two remain at odds right up until the Phoenix finally takes flight. In the end, Towns needs Dorfmann's brain, and in turn Dorfmann needs Towns' brawn. Without each other, the Phoenix never would have gotten off the ground.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have a hard time omitting this from my top 25 movies of all time. To start I have not come across this movie on ANY list of top 100 movies ANYWHERE. This movie isn't from the 90's so if you're looking for special effects you're better off watching Die Hard or Lord Of The Rings.... Flight Of The Phoenix was made in the 60's and relied more on acting than it did special effects. Honestly I thought Richard Attenborough did about as terrible a job of acting as he possibly could while Hardy Kruger (Heinrich Dorfmann) a virtual unknown more or less made the movie as good as it was. At the time I am writing this there was 2812 votes and it had a rating of 7.6 out of 10.... not bad considering it doesn't make the top 100 lists. I have to note I am very curious as to why 19 people gave it 1 vote and 11 people gave it 2 votes. Were they watching the same movie that I was? It is simply a story of survival and human reaction under very stressful circumstances. I have watched it at least 10 times and it keeps getting better each time. Knowing people in their 20's i can tell you right now most of them (97% or higher) won't like it because it doesn't have special effects and relies solely on the ability of actors who had to act.A MUST SEE movie if you are over 40... in my opinion of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this upon first release at least twice, and so am not unbiased due to the appeal of nostalgia. That said, if you are looking for Stewart to show his mean streak (and he had a whopper, just look at Rear Window when he talks to his fiancée!) you have come to the right movie. He's stuck with his past becoming more appealing than his present and future, and what middle-aged person has not had that feeling? The plot moves along with a satisfying pace; the work that is being accomplished to make a derelict flyable is actually shown. The characters work, and argue, and have understandable power struggles. The stakes are life and death, after all. Be prepared for one shocking reveal, shocking deaths, and a reasonable look back by at least one of the survivors, as he sees from his rescue plane just what hell he has been living in for miserable days on end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small passenger plane crashes in the desert. As it was off course, the likelihood of search parties finding it is remote. The mixed bag of survivors don't get on but, eventually, they work together to cannibalise the crashed plane into something which, according to the model plane designer among them, will be able to fly them to safety.This film has two strong motors driving it (which is one more than the Phoenix!). The characters are all strongly drawn, with characters which conflict - there is great drama within and among them, with James Stewart (playing somewhat against type) and Richard Attenborough standing out. Then there is the drama of their predicament and their fight for survival. All of this is played out against the eye-catching desert background (with Yuma standing in for the Sahara).This film entertains and holds the attention, with a seat-gripping and (literally) uplifting finale.

		<fullReview>Based on Trevor Dudley Smith's popular novel, Robert Aldrich's 'The Flight of the Phoenix' is a well crafted engaging psychological thriller that takes place almost entirely in a desert. Aldrich makes minimal use of equipments (such as props, costumes, special effects etc) and his execution of the story is quite simple which is why the film works so well alongside the solid writing and acting.The story is about determination and survival. Many films have been made on similar themes and yet Aldrich manages to avoid the use of clichés. The level of tension and sense of doom is remarkably well maintained and keeping the viewer engaged. The conflicts that arise among the characters and their ambivalent interactions are depicted sensibly.The acting is terrific. All the actors perform effortlessly. It's good to see James Stewart step out of his comfort zone and try his hand on something different and he does it so well. Attenborough and Krüger are just as good and they are supported by fine actors.Overall, Robert Aldrich has made a gripping and poignant film about determination, hope and survival. The film is decades old but it feels much fresher than most of what Hollywood's churning out today</fullReview>

Dorfmann claims to have a plan to fly out.There are probably way too many characters. Some of the lesser used characters should be left off the plane. Jimmy Stewart's character is way too much of a boy scout. It makes no sense that he goes on a search for Cobb. It puts him completely over the top into unreasonable.

		<fullReview>It's TWELVE ANGRY MEN trapped in the desert.A cargo plane carrying a handful of military personnel and civilians crashlands in the Sahara. No radio contact, 130 miles off course, with no rescue prospects, food and water for eleven days... One of the passengers claims to be an aircraft designer and outlines a plan to rebuild the plane from its remaining parts. Thus their simultaneous hope and damnation begins.Classic premise, moved from a desert island to just a desert.Written by Lukas Heller and Trevor Dudley Smith, FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX is a unique little gem, directed by Robert Aldrich, who would go on to direct the classic testosterone war film, THE DIRTY DOZEN (1967), but unfortunately also has the lamentable APACHE (1954) to his credit.Hardy Kruger is German designer and taskmaster, Dorfmann, who maintains he has worked out all the drag coefficients and stress factors for a rebuild; James Stewart is cantankerous American leatherneck pilot Towns, who has "flown every crate ever built," and disagrees with Dorfmann on just about everything, imbued with that American idealism that all it takes to be right is a good left hook and an unwavering belief, against all evidence, that he is right. Richard Attenborough is Towns's co-pilot, Lew, the mediator between Dorfmann and Towns.Peter Finch (long before he was mad as hell) is a British officer who believes he can walk across the desert to safety; Ernest Borgnine is a big baby, diagnosed as "mentally incompetent"; George Kennedy is along for the ride, Ian Bannen is the jovial Scottish bigot.Each character is well-defined and their clash of personalities, ideologies and solutions is what makes PHOENIX such compelling viewing; the tension is palpable, first on whether the men will survive, then during the inevitable disputes that arise over water rations, blame for the crash, leadership, whether to waste their few days striving to build a plane that might not fly, overarched by the classic he-man struggle of alpha leadership between Towns and Dorfmann.Like the mythical bird that rises from its ashes, one of the men christens the rebuilt section of plane "Phoenix" by painting its name on the fuselage.Dorfmann is a pragmatist and oversees the Phoenix re-building like a machine, factoring in unemotionally that one of the injured men is going to die, so will not need any more rations and needn't be figured as payload along the wings; while Towns regards all his passengers as humans, who should all strive to be alive at the end of their goal for their goal to mean something. Lew helps Towns finds the compromise - that allowing the men to work on a goal will give them morale and turn them into survival machines.Amazing that amidst the scorching expanse of desert heat, we yet feel such claustrophobia; as the sands close in, as their rations run out, as the makeshift aircraft is pronounced ready for takeoff, Towns and Lew discover Dorfmann was not lying when he said he was an aircraft designer... he just left out a key fact about what type of aircraft he was a designer of.It is such an astounding twist to the plot that Lew echoes all our emotions by belly-laughing and weeping at the same time, "We could die here - or we could die in that thing..." Things could be worse: they could have been in ISHTAR.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie; obviously you already know that from all the positive reviews about it that you've already seen. I have loved it since I was a youngster, and I have had the DVD in my collection for the last few years. It's always a joy to pull it out and watch it every so often, and I honestly cannot say enough good things about this picture.I think that the storyline is very realistic; going down in the desert is something that could easily happen in the right circumstances to anyone, and how a group of people deals with it makes a great premise for a movie. The fact that it is all scientifically quite possible makes the movie even better.The cast is an absolutely fantastic collection of Hollywood greats, and with all the combined acting experience that these stars possess you know that you're in for a great time with this picture, even before it begins. I have always loved Jimmy Stewart on screen, he's been one of my favourite actors for years, and I think that this role brings out all those wonderful strong emotions from him which stir me so much. It's why I love his performances.He is supported more than ably by Richard Attenbrough, Earnie Borgnine, Peter Finch, Hardy Kruger, and Ronald Fraser playing his usual supporting character, that of a man who is downtrodden but simmering beneath, and he finally puts his foot down at one point in this picture and makes a stand.I actually find it very hard to say who gives the greatest performance in this movie. Jimmy is fantastic, Hardy Kruger is wonderful as the aircraft designer, and importantly, the motivator to get the job done and therefore keep everyone else alive by giving them a purpose, Peter Finch is great as the soldier who wants to try to save everyone, and Ian Bannen is excellent as the very annoying Scottish stirrer whom I would have happily hit had he been in that situation with me. He won an Oscar nomination for the role, and deserved it. Earnie Borgnine gives a believable performance as the simple man who starts to show the effects of the heat and the barrenness of the situation. The movie is really a great example of everyone doing his best work and making the whole thing come together beautifully.By the way, I did not like the remake; it doesn't come anywhere near this picture in so many ways. You can't honestly tell me that the cast they chose for it could in any way compare with the true stars of the original. Most of the actors today just don't posses the screen presence that the old Hollywood greats did. There are a couple of exceptions of course, Harry Ford and Sean Connery to name the two obvious ones, but they are not involved here.The original Flight of the Phoenix is a great movie, with a fantastic cast, wonderful performances, and a great story beautifully portrayed. What more could a movie-buff want??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Aldrich at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Offering the last really gritty role for Stewart before he settled into his 'loveable gramps' era, 1965's The Flight of the Phoenix may run some 36 minutes longer than the disappointingly tame 2004 remake, but it feels half as long thanks to an engrossing script and a take-no-prisoners attitude from director Robert Aldrich that's a million miles away from the feelgood approach the studio took second time round. Rather than pulling together, as it becomes increasingly clear that the survivors of a plane crash in the North African desert are not going to be rescued, Aldrich sets his flawed protagonists at each others throats in a hostile environment that is driving them mad, with even his nominal hero increasingly turning his guilt at crashing off-course into anger at his passengers. The result is a compelling adventure drama with the gloves off.Stuck in a place where even nepotism can't save you ? the director's son William Aldrich and son-in-law Peter Bravos don't even make it past the credits sequence - Stewart's old-school pilot who has remembered everything and learned nothing soon finds himself at odds with Hardy Kruger's aircraft designer who comes up with the idea of building a new plane out of the parts of the old one. One making virtue out of stupidity while the other makes it a science, their clash of egos becomes far more important to each man than their possible survival. That it works is largely down to the contrast between Stewart's bitterness and Hardy Kruger's superb performance as the utterly ruthless, almost Nazi-like designer who calculates who will live and who will die and who unfortunately is all the more grating a personality for always being right. As Stewart points out, he's not concerned with getting out or saving lives, merely with proving his design will fly. And even if you already know it, the big revelation about his character in the last act is still one hell of a sucker punch.Although the two men gradually occupy centre-stage, there's an impressive supporting cast, with fine performances from Richard Attenborough's co-pilot, Peter Finch's by the book British Army officer and Christian Marquand's doctor, as well as solid turns from Ian Bannen, Ronald Fraser, Ernest Borgnine and George Kennedy (getting in some practice for all those Airport movies), although Dan Duryea, reunited with his old Anthony Mann Western sparring partner Stewart, gets the short end of the stick as the timid accountant who names the plane (though the two men did engage on a series of escalating practical jokes on the set). Amusingly Aldrich goes where Ken Hyman and Sidney Lumet refused in The Hill and adds a hallucination of an Arab dancing girl and a memorable love theme (Senza Fine, reused by Billy Wilder in Avanti) to help sell his testosterone-heavy tale as a love story in the trailers! A terrific movie, the only downside is that stunt pilot Paul Mantz died filming the film's finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Flight of the Phoenix is one of a handful of quasi-action films under the survival-against-the-odds sub-category. Other offerings include Ron Howard's "Apollo 13" and "Cast Away", both starring Tom Hanks. Even the highly controversial "Deliverance" starring Burt Reynolds and directed by John Boorman falls into the category. "Flight of the Phoenix" rises to the top of the heap particularly because of the first-rate cast, an absolutely believable script, and superb actor-directing which can't be beat. (The later remake of 2004 is not bad but can't compete with the original.) The essential plot of the Phoenix is deceptively simple. A group of diverse and not particularly likable passengers are aboard a cargo plane bound for Benghazi. Their pilot, Frank Towns (Jimmie Stewart in one of his finest roles) is a washed-up pilot who can only get bottom-of-the-barrel jobs as a freighter pilot. His co-pilot, Lew Moran (Richard Attenborough in an equally-compelling performance) is also a frustrated aviator. Their large bulky airship hits an unexpected sand storm, forcing them to wreck in the middle of the Sarah Desert. They have only a limited supply of food and water, no communication, and the remains of about 2/3rds of their original airplane which is beyond repair. Their first plan is to send signals, assuming some kind of rescue mission from their company will be searching for them in the desert. After only a few days, they realize, no search party is coming. They're stuck in the desert. Although only about 100 miles from the nearest settlement, it's impossible on foot, because they have no way of tracking where they would go, and they would lose more water from their bodies than they would be able to replenish in the desert.One of the passengers, Heinrich Dorfmann (Hardy Krüger in a perfectly cast role) informs the survivors of the crash they can build a new airplane from the wreckage which can take them out of the desert. He is an airplane designer-engineer and has figured out how they can create a working plane from one of the original engines which was undamaged. (The other had been destroyed during the crash.) At first Towns is skeptical that building a working plane is even feasible, and he worries it will take too much out of the men who are already suffering from lack of water. Then Moran and Dr. Renaud in turn offer their opinions: even if their chance is one in a thousand, they would rather take it than just wait around to die. Towns gives in, and they begin the project of creating a new plane from the one surviving engine. Then, late in the film, Towns and Moran learn that Dorfman has never built a large plane before. They ask him what he's done in terms of "the real thing", to be informed that Dorfman designs "model airplanes", but he's never built a large-scale passenger plane before.This film works as well as it does because of the acting and the script. The script never falls into cliché hyperbole which is often how these kinds of films are written. There are no "we must try to survive" speeches, resplendent in material of this type. One of the more interesting aspects is that the story is taking place not long after World War II, and some of the passenger-survivors are skeptical of Dorfman who is obviously either German or Austrian. Also, animosity between Towns and Dorfman evolves as the project gets under way, in which both begin to war with words regarding who is in charge of the project and ultimately the men. Two other characters, a captain and sergeant from Britain, seem at first to play their expected roles of officer and subordinate, but as the events play out, the Captain begins losing his authority over the subordinate sergeant.The Flight of the Phoenix may be my favorite survival film. Each character is fairly well-developed. Towns is the hot-headed frustrated pilot who can't quite decide on his course of action, a reluctant leader. Moran is the pitiable co-pilot who, at one point, feels guilty about their dilemma and becomes depressed. Dorfman is the self-absorbed engineer who, although brilliant, seems less concerned about the plight of their situation than achieving the largest airplane project of his career. Not to be missed if you want a film in which you'll be riveted from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Survival Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sometimes forget how much we miss Jimmy Stewart. He is the glue that holds this film together. It has everything one could want in an adventure/survival film. You have a group of desperate men, facing death by dehydration, water supplies almost nil. These people have a multitude of personality traits that are bound to clash. Of course there is the saint and the sinner. There is also the mysterious guy who hatches the plot to take apart a plane and rebuild it as a much smaller flying machine. Because he claims to be an aeronautical designer, everyone listens to him until he reveals that he has only worked with model planes. What starts out as hope begins to dwindle, even though he assures them that the science of aeronautics applies to all flying machines. Stewart is not perfect, but he has the bull-headedness and the respect of most of the crew members and when it comes to desperation, he is going to make it work or die trying. There is a terrific scene at the end where they must decide whether to use one of the only starter cartridge to clean the carbon out, limiting the possibility of starting the engine. It will have you on the edge of your seat. I first saw this in 1965 and remember it like it was yesterday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proper film-making: tough, masculine, unashamedly old-fashioned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX is a classic tale of derring-do and adventure, a sort of DIRTY DOZEN style movie in which a group of stranded survivors find themselves trapped in a hostile desert and must use their wits in order to survive. It's a tale of bravery, heroism and cowardice in equal measure, as each man must come to terms with what he can do in order to survive, and it's a perfect lesson of how working as a group can always outdo individual effort.The film is well-shot by Robert Aldrich, who brings the sandy locales to life, even if the studio-shot bits are fairly obvious in comparison to the genuine location shooting. The cast is full of solid, tough guy talent: Ernest Borgnine, Ian Bannen, Ronald Fraser, Peter Finch, George Kennedy and Richard Attenborough are fine, but it's Jimmy Stewart who headlines and holds things together as the old hand. Hardy Kruger bags the most interesting role as the engineer, and how many films about engineering are this gripping? I can't think of any others if I'm honest.A word of warning: avoid the horrid remake, which just slavishly copies the plot of this film but does everything wrong. I think the most annoying thing about it was the casting director's choice to put the inferior Dennis Quaid into the Jimmy Stewart role. I mean, what were they thinking?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic fight for life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(78%) A true fight for survival classic with a super strong cast including the great Richard Attenborough, and a harsh real sense of the arid, and very deadly setting. The life and death politics dealing with those in charge and those that are not in an ever worsening situation is handled very well as the truth behind each character eventually rises to the surface for all to see. Overall it's a tad over long, and the pacing is a little slack, but the story is a great old yarn style fight for life, and the fine use of score with Connie Francis almost haunting the soundtrack makes for a must-watch recommendation for all ages from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable old classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good old adventure movie from back in the days when Hollywood knew how to make them. I did not have any movies left on my to-watch shelf, at least none that I felt like watching, yesterday evening and I spotted that this one was given on Cine+ Classic so I decided to go for it.James Stewart was never one of my really favorite actors but he is still one of the more enjoyable old Hollywood stars and it is always fun to watch some of the old bunch. Since it is a fairly old movie it is refreshingly free of hysterical shouting and foul language for no good reason. When people argue in this movie they actually say something using actual arguments. Do not take me wrong, I do not mind the use of foul language in movies but not when it is just to shock or to cover up the lack of intelligent script.I am not sure that I buy in too much on the basic plot in the movie. To rip apart a plane and put it together again using only the material available at the crash site seems a bit too far out for me. There are also a few holes in it like that they where worried that everyone would have the strength left to finish the work but then several of them would cling onto the wing of an airplane using only their hands. Even with the improvised windshield that is rather ludicrous.If one can overlook that it is not a bad story though and with the good old-fashioned performance of the actors in it I quite enjoyed my 140 minute long sitting in front of the TV-screen yesterday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a story of conflict and survival...and there's a monkey!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this to be an extraordinary story of conflict and survival. Jimmy Stewart leads a cast of stars in this gripping story of oil workers and others who find themselves stranded in the desert after a plane crash that has killed some and left others fatally injured. Walk out of the desert, wait for help or fix the plane? What is the best course, and who is in charge? Thrilling human drama. One scene in this film stands out as one of Jimmy Stewart's best, in my opinion. Towns and Dorfmann are discussing Dorfmann's career as an airplane designer. Stewart's facial expressions are superb when he learns more than he wanted to about Dormann's job as an engineer. I've watched this film more than once to see that scene alone. I can't see the 2004 version surpassing the 1965 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stewart &amp; Borgnine Shine in this Desert Storm!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the horrible remake, I thought I would catch the original The Flight of the Phoenix, with some of my favorite stars, Ernest Borgnine, Jimmy Stewart and a few others.I've liked Stewart's early films from the Golden Age of Hollywood but he is more subdued in this picture. His plane, barely able to fly as it is, hits a sandstorm somewhere in the Sahara Desert, on his way to an oil field. The men aboard are mostly all miners. In fact, a few get killed in the first ten minutes of the film, but I digress! Playing the pilot who blames himself is well worth the watch. Stewart underplays this as well as using his fists with those who wish to oppose him. Despite his protests, some of the crew want to build a new plane out of the old wreckage, since they'd rather "die while doing something" than die and do nothing.Some of the men go crazy with the heat and wanting to be rescued. Borgnine practically recaptures his acting acumen he got from his Academy award-winning film "Marty" (1955) as he freaks out and runs into the desert than put up with his pals on the plane.The scene with the meeting of the Arab traders was fascinating ? I won't spoil it, but it was played from the aspect of the survivors and the horrific ending for a couple of the crew will gross you out. Much better than the remake, which went into what happened and how in detail, leaving nothing to the imagination.Richard Attenborough as the stuttering, drunk pal of Stewart's, as he tries to cope with his friend's obstinance and getting him to see that there is some hope in this desert of despair.Bottom Line: Big name stars, under-appreciated bit of entertainment from Warner Bros. The unlikely event of a plane crashing with just enough needed inside the plane to make a new one, and a psychological study of men under strain and lacking hope, far from any rescue. Worth a rental!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This original Flight of the Phoenix, fronted by the by then veteran Jimmy Stewart, who is one of my all-time favourites, remains ones my father's very favourite films - and he has no interest in movies, to the point where he generally doesn't know one film from the other, apart from the classic few - Great Escape, Bridge on the River Kwai etc but this is still the one he enjoys the most.It's a film that manages to still remain cross-generational, as I really like it too - a wonderful mixture of high drama, tension, pure survival and engineering. This might make it more a film for the boys, old and young, but that is just as applicable to the Great Escape which is a true family film, as this is, too.Robert Aldrich's direction is first class, with real, wind-strewn sand, broken down plane and heat. That sense of reality makes it more believable, you are almost a fly in the desert watching these men go about their sole and increasingly treacherous quest for sheer survival.The cast list is exemplary, too. Joining Stewart is a sea of famous faces, from Dickie Attenborough, George Kennedy, Peter Finch, Ernest Borgnine and of course, one of the outstanding performances of the era, from Hardy Kruger, the German who is initially so distrusted but who goes on to become their saviour. Ian Bannen is also memorable as the confrontational Scot.It's long but only in the value for money stakes - you get a lot of film and is never less than interesting, rising to compulsive viewing at its peaks. Its finale is also one of the most uplifting in cinema history.There's almost no point in comparing this classic with its 2004 remake, except perhaps that if you did like John Moore's effort, with Dennis Quaid, forget any indifferences you may have toward older films and see this, vastly superior original. This is a genuine 5 starrer, that's more like a 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exciting, well made, well acted survival in the desert story with a tougher and edgier than usual performance by Jimmy Stewart. Certainly more complex and thoughtful than most disaster/survival films, with some great twists, and a fun ensemble of characters full of intriguing eccentricities. No one character has a monopoly on moral righteousness, and even Stewart's 'hero' is a man with real flaws. A few story points push the bounds of believability or logic, and Aldrich makes one or two silly or dated choices, but it's stayed with me far longer and more powerfully than the vast majority of films in it's genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem from the golden era of movie making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am gonna have to say it's a shame that this movie is not in IMDb top 100, but then again the top 250 list isn't really indicative of anything as so many mediocre movies have made it to the list. Regardless, "The Flight of the Phoenix" is one of my all time favorite movies. Great direction, acting, story and above all chemistry between the characters is phenomenal. This movie truly represents the golden era of movie making that is the 60's and 70's (I must mention I was born in the early 80's). Hardy kruger's character as the aircraft designer is one of the most though provoking character I have encountered in movies. He doesn't speak much but when he does he leaves other characters in the movie as well the audience speechless. His character was well researched and Hardy Kruger was the perfect choice to play it. The second character that impressed me the most was of Richard Attenborough. There is a lot of friction between characters played by James Stewart (pilot) and Hardy Kruger (aircraft designer) and Attenborough acts as oil to reduce the friction between them and he does that in an outstanding manner. This is not to say other characters in the movie didn't impress me, there wasn't a single character that was unnecessary or not paid attention to. This movie is a work of art with every part chiseled to perfection. Its hard to imagine what it would feel like to be stranded in the middle of a hot desert with a limited supply of water and waiting for death on the other side of sand dune. But director Aldrich does a great job of playing those emotions perfectly and his cast doesn't let him down. A 10 out of 10?.I would greatly recommend this film if you prefer substance and story over CGI and bad acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are few things that I enjoy more than a good Jimmy Stewart film, there's just something about that voice which turn him from a good actor into a great one. Coupled with Leicester's finest Richard Attenborough The Flight Of The Phoenix was never going to fail.It kicks off with Stewart, Attenborough and the rest of the crew flying in an aeroplane over the Sahara desert, before a freak sandstorm causes the plane to fail and crash into the middle of the desert with no communications and only enough water to last them 10 days at a bare minimum. It's not too long before arrogant German Heinrich Dorfmann reveals he is in fact a plane designer and has built up plans to make a smaller plane from the remains of the one that crashed. Although is Dorfmann all that he makes out? Will the plane be built in time before all the water runs out? Will they ever make it out alive? A fascinating story of survival and adventure, which will keep you hanging in until the end. Dorfmann's revelation is hilarious and there is some fine acting throughout. Although not flawless to set almost the entirety of the film in one place was a brave decision and one that payed off well. All in all a highly fun film and strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Allegory and A Perfect Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is the secret to really appreciating Robert Aldrich's "Flight of the Phoenix". It has two levels. The surface level (which is the only one most of the comments and reviews address) is a tense "for men only" adventure story about the crash of an old company plane in the desert and the efforts of the survivors to rebuild the plane before their limited supply of water runs out. But what moves the film into cinema greatness is its hidden core, an allegorical story of the components of modern civilization and the way they mesh (and sometimes don't mesh) together in synergistic combinations. Pilot Frank Towns (Jimmy Stewart) is an old-school intuitive flyer (i.e. seat-of-the-pants), designer Heinrich Dorfmann (Hardy Kruger) is a modern problem solver with limited people skills who approaches the situation logically, and navigator Lew Moran (Richard Attenborough) is a natural facilitator who does not allow his own ego to get in the way. The remaining crash survivors are a cross section of society; two heroes, a coward, a burn out, a weakling, a bully, and a couple of average Joes. And the outcome is more real-life than Hollywood, as it is the least heroic of the group who survive. Ultimately, both logic and intuition contribute to the success of the plan. The credits are still rolling as the two-engine cargo/passenger plane drops toward the desert floor. Trusting his instincts Towns tried flying through a sandstorm, which fouled the carburetors. Blown off course from their original flight plan there is little hope of rescue. Frank takes responsibility for their situation and although resigned to his fate still tries to take charge of the situation. Joseph Biroc provides some excellent cinematography. Instead of focusing on "Lawrence of Arabia" desert vastness, he gets in tight among the characters, using off kilter angles to reinforce the broken technology and the personal conflicts. Aldrich recaptures the excitement toward the end of the film, turning this allegorical character study back into a thriller. "Flight of the Phoenix" is close to a perfect film, offering solid entertainment around a cerebral core. The producers of the recent remake apparently thought current audiences were incapable of appreciating the nuances of a film that operated on multiple levels, so they scrapped the allegorical elements in favor of amped up action sequences.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what I would probably consider a "guy's movie", as there are no women in the film, a fair amount of action and it's a tough little film to watch. I am NOT saying women won't like it--it's just this is not the type film traditionally marketed to women. In addition, almost the entire film takes place in on small spot in the desert, so some fans might be put off by its claustrophobic and static nature.Well, this is a survival film very reminiscent of John Wayne's ISLAND IN THE SKY, though instead of passengers of a plane being stranded in the ice-cold North, it's in the desert. Plus, unlike the Wayne film, their chances of rescue are nil, so they embark on a very radical plan to tear apart the wrecked plane and create a new plane capable of flying to civilization.The acting is excellent throughout and features a good international cast. The way the characters are written is also excellent. About the only negative about the film is that one of the stunt men was killed staging one of the scenes--it's a heck of a high price to pay to make a film.</fullReview>

But once we find out that one of the leaders builds toy airplanes, from then on it is just great.This was Stewarts last great role. No wonder he was a bomber pilot in World War Two. Only he could have given the character everything, and I do mean everything it needed. Just listen to him respond to Attenbouroughs attempt to cheer him as they are about to try to launch the plane, the way he drags out even answering him and then scathingly says, just grrrreat. So realistic it's chilling. And then once he climbs into the cockpit, from then on to the end, it is just sustained brilliance by all hands. Robert Aldrich is really in his element. Fabulous film making the likes of which is just not around anymore. And then comes the most chilling thing of all: the last lines of themovie, It should be remembered that Frank Manx (or Manz, cant remember the exact spelling) a fine man and great pilot gave his life in the making of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent adventure film is "The Flight of the Phoenix." The story, adapted from the Elleston Trevor novel, is about the sheer will to survive. The plot is simple, but it takes a lengthy amount of time for any resolution: a cargo plane crashes in the desert, and the survivors expend a tremendous amount of effort building a new plane from the damage. The fact that they all have the determination to take the risk in constructing the plane is quite astonishing. To them, their lives are worth whatever they have to do to escape from the desert, and I applaud them for it. (Don't read any further until after you have seen "The Flight of the Phoenix.") The cast of this picture could not have been better. My favorite actor James Stewart is brilliant as the tough, no-nonsense, grizzled pilot Frank Towns, who accepts full responsibility for the crash and cares deeply about the passengers' survival. Hardy Kruger is perfect for the role of Heinrich Dorfmann, the German aircraft designer who plans the construction of the plane and somewhat ruthlessly runs the whole operation to Towns' resentment. Richard Attenborough as navigator Lew Moran becomes the mediator of the tension between Towns and Dorfmann. Peter Finch is fine as Captain Harris, who makes two very serious mistakes, the second of which costs him his life. The wonderful Ernest Borgnine plays an oil driller named Trucker Cobb, whose mental exhaustion ultimately leads to his death wandering off in the desert. Not to mention Ian Bannen as the wisecracking pessimist Mr. Crow (nicknamed "Ratbags"); Ronald Fraser as the mischievous Sergeant Watson, resentful of Capt. Harris and finally mustering enough courage to tell him so; and Dan Duryea as the humble, nervous, God-fearing accountant Mr. Standish (quite the opposite of his villainous roles in, say, "Winchester '73" [1950] and "Night Passage" [1957]).The greatest joy of this picture is the elatedness of the remaining passengers upon discovering that the engine of their newly-built plane works. Towns has seven cartridges to fire up the engine, and the first four fail. After he uses a fifth one to merely clean out the cylinders (against Dorfmann's wishes), the engine finally works and the propeller is activated with the sixth cartridge. The survivors cheer, shout, jump, dance around, hug each other, etc., knowing that all their hard work in constructing the plane paid off. Other highlights include the following: One night while the survivors are resting in the hull, Cobb turns on his radio and hears a beautiful love song sung by Connie Francis entitled "Senza Fine," which deeply moves Gabriele (Gabriele Tinti), an injured passenger from Italy who misses his ailing wife; this "Senza Fine" theme is heard a few other times in the film when the camera focuses on Gabriele helplessly lying flat on his back in the hull and also at his eventual burial ground. Towns blows up at Dorfmann at certain intervals, most notably when Dorfmann uses an electric razor while Towns is trying to listen to Cobb's radio, and when Dorfmann reveals that he has been drinking more water in the emergency tank than his ration allows. Dorfmann explains to the crew how the new plane will be constructed, and Towns gives all kinds of reasons why Dorfmann is an idiot and why his brainchild won't work. When the new plane is practically completed, the day before the crew leaves the desert, Towns and Moran are distressed to learn that Dorfmann is merely a model plane designer; Moran reacts by laughing hysterically and crying at the same time."The Flight of the Phoenix" was a dismal flop for the box office at 20th Century Fox, but so what? It is an exciting edge-of-the-seat survival drama with a superb cast, touches of humor, and suspenseful action scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A light aircraft which is ferrying oil workers to Benghazi is forced to crash land in the desert during a sandstorm. The group organise themselves to await rescue but as the days pass they become increasingly aware that rescue is unlikely. A German passenger called Dorfmann formulates a plan to reconstruct the damaged aircraft into a smaller plane, and the others, while dubious about the chances of success, agree to try out his idea. It had been close to 20 years since I saw this last, so when I noticed that it was on television last weekend I decided to have another look at it. I had forgotten just how many famous actors were in the cast. They are all very good but James Stewart (as the pilot), Richard Attenborough, Peter Finch, Ian Bannen and Hardy Kruger (as Dorfmann) really stand out. Robert Aldrich's direction keeps the tension building throughout, as the men become more desperate and tempers start to fray. I am glad that I rediscovered this classic suspense thriller. Its easy to see why it was such a favourite on television around Christmas time when I was young. Sadly, they really don't make films like this anymore.</fullReview>

The fact that it is based wholly on personalities and the human need to survive only makes it better.Suspense is at a premium here, none of your CGI rubbish and all-action roll out. This is true cinema at its best.The best parts of the film revolve around the relationship between Hardy Kreuger and Jimmy Stewart, with one who knows 'aeroplanes' and one who 'knows aeroplane'. The difference is subtle but the effect is devastating. I marvel at the dialogue, and the understating of the predicament the survivors are in. No chickens here. They all deserve a medal for bravery in what would be a nightmare scenario. It only goes to show that sometimes, not knowing everything is the best course of action.My only criticism is that they ever sohwed the part where the survivors found out about Hardy Kreuger's real profession. That would have made it a 10/10 in my book.Superb movie, beats most current offerings hands down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cornerstone of disaster movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just noticed a brief summary of this film in local TV schedule and decided to see it. They didn't had CGI back in 1965, so I thought it was a little chance that "Phoenix" is just another "popcorn-godzilla-dumb-kung-fu" disaster movie. What was a real disaster - those commercial breaks every 20 minutes (though it was late after midnight!), so it took quite a long time to find out what the ending will be. Nevertheless it became absolutely clear to the, that after making "Flight of the Phoenix" there is no sense in trying to do something better of airplane crash movies. Especially in our "computer-calculated future", of which one of the characters spoke fearfully. (Still wonder, how they knew). It is painful to think, how "Flight of the Phoenix" could look if it was made in 2003... A 15-minutes completely digital crash sequence, 3 or 4 female characters (and even more love plots simultaneously), and they crash somewhere in Iraq after plane being hit by some bad guys' Soviet-made rocket. Fortunately, in 1965 they made not so stupid films. That means "Flight of the Phoenix" is not about the plane, or the desert, or crash, or survival tricks... It's about people. Arguing from the first minutes, challenging leadership, fading hopes, fighting... I'd even say sometimes "Phoenix" more concerns weakness and cowardice rather than strength and courage. 9 out of 10. May be today it looks much better than in time it was just released...It was a great pity to see that final credit about stunt pilot who died while filming the movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most underrated action/adventure flicks of the sixties.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(some spoilers ahead) Movie is about a cargoplane which crashes in the middle of an Arabian desert and the passengers' struggle for survival, culminating in the attempt to build a new plane out of the remnants of the crashed cargo.Phoenix has a magnificent all-star cast led by James Stewart, Richard Attenborough, Peter Finch, Ernest Borgnine and Hardy Krüger. and supported by excellent bit players as Ronald Fraser,Ian Bannen and George Kennedy (his first unofficial 'airport' movie !). Expertly directed by Robert Aldrich (from`Kiss me deadly' fame) who excells in this kind of all-male action thrillers. His next project would be the highly succesfull warmovie `The Dirty Dozen'.On top of that movie boasts an excellent and solid script. This is best illustrated by an important underlying theme on the conflict between the old and new era, in Stewart being the veteran pilot and Krüger as the German aircraft designer who is instrumental in building the so-called `ersatz' plane. When Stewart , while noting down in his logbook, reflects on his growing antagonism with Kruger he realises that `now the men with their calculators and computers will soon be taking over the world'. As Flight was made in 1965 this is quite a prophetic statement.Many IMDB critics deem this film overlong but this is nonsense. Movie takes it time to work out the plot and the wide range of characters. This isalso why the finale (will it fly or not ?) is one of the most thrilling you'll ever witness on the screen.They may already mention computers in the script but ofcourse there was not yet any eleaborate CGI available so the production crew had to entirely construct the plane from scratch that also had to fly for real. A first attempt resulted in the death of one of the stunt pilots. It is mentioned in the endcredits.It is no coincidence James Stewart plays the veteran pilot. He was a commander of a B-17 bomber squadron during WWII and led more than 15 missions over Germany. In 1968 he was promoted a brigadier-general in the reserve air force, thereby becoming the highest military-ranked Hollywood star ever.See also `Sands of the Kalahari' for a different treatment on the same topic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I concur with the reviews of the many others on this page who love this movie. I bet I've seen it at least two dozen times over the last 35 years--maybe more. One of the most chilling scenes for me is the one where Richard Attenborough's character begins to chuckle, then to laugh, then to belly laugh, and then the laugh evolves seamlessly into an uncontrollable maniacal sobbing/shrieking, expressing his terror and frustration at the awful situation he and the others are in. This sort of thing has been done by other actors, in other venues...but no one ever has done it better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filmmaking at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few films you can watch over and over and not get bored. This is one of those films. The set-up gives an automatic claustrophobic intensity to it, as a group of men are stranded in the Libyan desert after a plane crash. The locking horns of Jimmy Stewart and Hardy Kruger makes for great dialectic psychology as Richard Attenborough plays the mediator with a stutter masterfully. The film builds up for 2 hours to the crescendo: the firing of cartridge number 6. You will feel the joy of Attenborough as he looks at the plane as though it's God playing a practical joke and shouts, "You bastard!" Jimmy Stewart's best film. No hint of the cornyness of "Wonderful Life" here. This is a touch of Sixties Realism and a unique film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you think of classic cinema epics, films like "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Ben Hur" come to mind, but "Flight of the Phoenix" should fall in line right behind them. Unlike the others, it doesn't span a long time period, many locales, or monumental events. In fact, it is filmed almost entirely in one spot, covers just a few weeks time, and depicts an event of no real importance. But you'll feel as if you've actually lived those few weeks, the lives and actions of this small unremarkable group of people will have taken on a monumental importance to you, and you'll be cheering at the end. Make no mistake about it, the excellent acting, cinematography, and music are flawlessly combined to create a really "Big" movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strange Premise, Very Well Executed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very daring effort in so far as there is no sexual chemistry. The men - for good or ill - left their women at home. Eminently sensible if you're travelling.It is a study of attitudes towards disaster. What do you do? Sit around and hope? Go and find help? Or use your brains? This movie examines each scenario in turn and plumps for brains.People are driven by custom and culture. They think within their comfort zones. And for the most part, these are sufficient. However, when crises strike, they can be a formula for defeat. In order to prevail in a disaster you may have to think beyond the box. You may have to be radical - even ruthless. Sentiment is not conducive to survival. Nature tells us that.James Stewart plays the pilot. As such, he feels himself to be responsible for everyone. He's a 'good' man, with classic cultural mind-set. He's blinkered by his sense of morality, of right and wrong. He champions the sit-around-and-hope group. It's a hope he secretly knows is next to futile, but he can't confront the alternatives. I find him the least likable of all. In truth; everyone would perish under his benign mis-management.Dickie Attenborough plays his long-term side-kick. He's a weak, propitiatory figure, rather feminine in his willingness to curry favour. His character is a mender of fences and keeper of the peace. He's not sure what to do, but thinks that going for help in the scorching desert is definitely a loser. As it surely is.Peter Finch offers the military mind. He champions the go-get-help faction. He's reasonable and decent. But as a commissioned officer he's also a take-charge man, not accustomed to sitting idly about. It's bad for morale.The others tend to languish in self pity, grim humour, and hope.The man of the moment amongst this disparate crowd is a little German played by Hardy Kruger. I think the choice of his nationality is unfortunate as it tends to reinforce the stereotypic overtone of ruthless fascism. However, Kruger plays it with complete self-effacing conviction, and I for one find myself rooting for the callous little Kraut all the way. He and he alone has grasped the full enormity of their predicament. But instead of flailing about helplessly, or languishing in a funk, he has set his mind to determine how a logical re-application of their resources might be turned to account. He takes stock, makes measurements, does calculations, and produces a workable plan to build another plane from their wreck.The pilot, still wallowing in guilt (some passengers have died) and unable to think beyond the box, accuses the little German of being mad, unaware that he actually designs aeroplanes - albeit models.However, realising that resources are running low, and persuaded at last that any option is better than no option, he agrees to support the plan.But he is embittered and grudging. It is a rare and quite courageous part for such a 'big name' as Stewart to play. The character is far more flawed than favoured. Resentful of his thwarted authority, he attempts to vex and baulk the German at every stage of the way, leading to some wonderful little confrontations. The best lines of which are deservedly Kruger's.'Mr Towns, you behave as if stupidity were a virtue. Why is that'? and 'He (Mr Towns) has remembered everything and learnt nothing'.These are just two of several memorable little quips that invariable leave Stewart's character with lip-quivering impotence. Towards the end, this pilot bates his German antagonist with their seven engine-starter cartridges, deliberately wasting the first four. It's an astonishing and reckless display of spite that threatens everyone's last chance of escape. If anything proves his unsuitability for leadership it is this. And if he'd not been essential to the project; I for one would have shot him. Ian Bannen plays a slightly-unhinged Scotsman. He does it well. And so he should; he's been doing it often enough. Ronald Fraser plays a weak-willed flunkie, which is also something of a typecast. The excellent Ernie Borgnine plays the role of a man recovering from a nervous breakdown who suffers a fatal relapse. Together with George Kennedy and Christian Marquand they make up a fine character ensemble, which also includes a monkey.It's a long, slow, struggle of a movie, which is exactly what one would expect such a scenario to be. Their days are numbered, their resources limited; how could it be otherwise. It's also a race against time. Tempers naturally become frayed as fatigue and despair set in. All of the characters are well observed and believable. They're an interesting mix who you care for and curse, just as you would if you were one of them.Their survival is something of an anti-climax. They were only a short flight from an inhabited oasis. A short flight, but an impossibly long walk. It's an abrupt finish that doesn't quite satisfy me - another couple of minutes should have been added. But the story of logic's triumph over habit, and determination prevailing over doubt is a worthy one, and up-lifting. However dire things may look; you don't give up until you are dead. That's life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful; good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's worth watching. The plot couldn't be simpler. A plane crashes in the desert and the handful of survivors make a new plane out of the wreckage and fly it out. The story is rather too simple for such a long movie but that's okay, because the writers and the director flesh it out with some neat characterizations. What I mean is that this is not only a story about flying an airplane out of the desert, but a neat sketch of the people involved in doing it. One flaw, which I will get out of the way quickly. The poor Schmuck killed by falling machinery during the crash. His sentimental song is very catchy but doesn't fit in. Otherwise very neatly done. Well, as long as we're dealing with irrelevancies, let me mention the "hallucination" of the cowardly sergeant. She materializes out of nowhere on the desert and does a seductive dance. I've always liked Barry Chase and always enjoy the display of her pubic symphysis at the end of this dance. Actually, she's quite a good dancer and did some TV specials as Fred Astaire's partner.Those final moments when they're trying to start the engine are gripping. The make up is crummy. The score is okay. The story is good. The acting is fine. Acting. I like Dan Duryea. He wasn't a particularly good actor but he was a Cornellian and I like him for that. He's usually a weasel. Here, he's an okay kind of guy. Jimmy Stewart has a tough job on his hands, as an actor I mean. He had to portray a man who has misjudged someone. He has to show regret, which is not his forte. Hardy Krueger is the man who designs airplanes. He's good too. (They're all pretty good.) He's the equivalent of the Nazi in the boat in "Lifeboat", if Walter Slezak had been a neurotic. He has no mercy, not even for himself, and knows exactly what he's doing. Krueger was mixed up in the Hitler Jugend during the war, but I don't care. Should we all be held responsible for the peccadilloes of our 16-year-old selves? Stone the crows -- I was a BOY SCOUT. Anyway Krueger is good in this. He's even better in "Sundays and Cybele."If there is one outstanding performance it is that of Ian Bannon. "The war -- you know -- Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrwham!" He's superlative, not just here but in almost everything he's done. Of course you could call this hamming it up, but that's the point. The plot is so minimal that ham makes a fine main course.I ought to mention the climax, in which the men try to start the truculent airplane engine. They only have seven cartridges to do it with. Now, I'm sure you've witnessed this sort of thing a dozen times. The engine sputters. It coughs. But it WILL NOT START. But never, I think, has it been done as well as it is here.It's a suspenseful story alright but there's some embedded humor as well. I laugh every time I watch the scene in which pilot Stewart and navigator Attenborough learn that they've labored for two weeks in order to build the world's biggest toy airplane -- their dumbfounded expressions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Graceless Under Pressure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a success when first released, Flight Of the Phoenix plays well on television, though it's awfully long for what it is. Director Robert Aldrich does a fine job with his actors, all of whom are superb, and handles his simple story, concerning a motley group of men whose plane crashes in the desert and who must build a smaller plane out of the larger one in order to survive. It's either fly away home or die an awful and slow death in the desrt from thirst and starvation.As the pilot of the plane, James Stewart is uncharacteristically cranky and not perticularly likeable, which is the point. Peter Finch and Richard Attenborough offer fine support, but it is the smaller parts players, notably Ian Bannen, Hardy Kruger and Ronald Fraser, who steal the show. Fraser in particular stands out, as he plays a soldier who does not want to take orders, does not want to work, and would like to get home with as little effort as possible, even if it means faking an injury. I love this character, and Fraser plays him to perfection. He is neither hero nor villain, and a lot like those of us watching the film. Indeed, he is more truly an everyman than most allegedly regular guys who are heroes underneath types one normally finds in movies. That this man is NOT an heroic type, but equally NOT a bad fellow after all, makes him a remarkable fellow to find in a movie, though in real life he is, of course, a dime a dozen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably my favorite Jimmy Stewart movie ("Harvey" and "Rear Window" are close behind) but not many of my friends have seen it. That is unfortunate, because this is the perfect example of a disaster/survivor movie done right. Almost everything is done right, the movie concentrates in one area, making the set unremarkable, but therefore allowing the aspects of dialogue and character develop beautifully, while avoiding cliches and stereo-types. Jimmy Stewart, Richard Attenbourgh, Hardy Krueger, George Kennedy, Ernest Borgnine and Peter Finch all give great performances. My favorite character is the cowardly Sgt. Watson, his behavior in the survival is interesting to watch and see how is weakness of character unfolds. You can almost feel the suffering and heat that the crew is experienced. Overall, this movie is wonderful and surpasses the usual trash-collecting "disaster" movies that Hollywood never seems to tire of making. This is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the love of aviation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing The Flight of the Phoenix during the afternoon while I was in college with no late classes that day. As I watched it in the old Duffield Theatre in downtown Brooklyn, I was mesmerized by the terrific cast and the overwhelming sincerity with which they tackled their roles. Of course in analyzing the film, it's absolute nonsense what these plane crash survivors were able to do to escape their predicament. Build a plane out of the wreckage of the one they crashed in. Sheer unadulterated claptrap. But even viewing it today, it's a grand piece of adventure entertainment.The cast and direction are superb, there's not one bad performance or wasted line in the entire film. Robert Aldrich's direction is superb and considering he had FOUR Academy Award winners in his cast in the acting category, James Stewart, Ernest Borgnine, George Kennedy, and Peter Finch he's got the talent to work with.James Stewart even as a kid was fascinated with flight and every movie fan knows about how he enlisted and became a bomber pilot in World War II and served in the Air Force Reserve after, retiring as a Major General. He did previous films about aviation that didn't do so well like Strategic Air Command and the Spirit of St. Louis. Those films didn't do so well, but this one was a winner and Stewart's performance as Frank Towns, veteran pilot and leader of the group survivors, is a favorite of mine. Right at the beginning of the film in a conversation with navigator Richard Attenborough, Stewart reminisces about his early days as a flier and how you took pride in just getting to your destination. As he says those lines you can see in his face his love of his vocation, it's one of the most moving scenes General James Maitland Stewart did on the screen. You know Stewart must have jumped at this film for his love of aviation.Richard Attenborough, who come to think of it is also an Oscar winner albeit not in the acting category, has a great turn as the alcoholic navigator. Peter Finch who usually played characters with an edge or some complexity to them is very good as the brave British Army captain who Stewart and the oil company he flies for is giving a lift. Along with Finch is Ronald Fraser who's a sergeant and the opposite of Finch, shall we say not a king and country volunteer. They have a mini-conflict of their own in the film. Every one of these players could have been up for an Oscar, but Ian Bannen as "ratbags" the cynical Scotch oil worker got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor from the Academy. His lines have real bite to them.The main conflict is with Stewart and Hardy Kruger who plays the anal retentive Heinrich Dorfman who's an aircraft designer who comes up with the scheme to rebuild a new plane, but he needs a pilot of Stewart's experience to fly it. Their conflict, how it resolves, and who lives to take off in the Phoenix and who dies in the desert is the real story here.And for that, you'll just have to see this mesmerizing piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Flight of the Phoenix (1965): Dir: Robert Aldrich / Cast: James Stewart, Richard Attenborough, Peter Finch, Ernest Borgnine, Ian Bannen: Overwhelming disaster suspense about taking courage and obtaining hope. The Phoenix airplane goes down in the Sahara desert within a sand storm stranding several people and injuring others. Director Robert Aldrich avoids clichés by detailing the long hours, hot sun and hopelessness. They are in a manic struggle for survival as a German passenger devises a plan to rebuild the plane out of its own parts leading to a remarkable twist. James Stewart is superb as the flight captain blaming himself for those who died. Richard Attenborough portrays the flight navigator who struggled with booze, and reaches for possible solutions for their situation. Strong supporting cast includes Peter Finch as the captain who wanders off to find help and makes a tragic return. Ernest Borgnine plays a worker who makes the fearful mistake of following the captain and his body is found later. Ian Bannen plays a less than likable crew member who only adds to this great ensemble cast. We know how this will end. Unless viewers are expecting a dead end result then it is obvious that the crew will regain flight but that doesn't detract from any suspense. Great special effects of the wreckage resulting in an excellent example of survival and maintaining union. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . who is NOT one of Hitler's best buddies, for a change. In fact, the main antagonist of Stewart's WWII veteran pilot character Frank Towns in THE FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX just happens to be a German, who misrepresents himself. Sniffing trouble, Towns fights this pesky Kraut every step of the way, since EVERYONE WOULD DIE if this was based on a TRUE story. However, greatly detracting from the effect of this tale is Hollywood's insistence that the Nazis, the Confederates, and the Commies are all simply misunderstood peoples with hearts of gold who can out-think true American heroes any day of the week. It is somewhat puzzling that Brig. Gen. James Stewart, a red-blooded Yankee war great in real life, would have consented to play the brow-beaten Frank Towns character here, let alone the Benedict Arnold of the Skies in his earlier pilot flick, THE SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS. Obviously, Mr. Stewart was a better fighter than a script reader. Either that, or the military's cheap pay scale forced him to take roles beyond his true character just for the sake of getting a paycheck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I see popular films remade and then expect them to be as good or better than the original;then you realize that the original couldn't have been improved on and the remake was forgettable.This is the case of 1965's "Flight of the Phoenix". Simple plot of diverse characters aboard an Oil Company owned airplane caught up in a sandstorm that forces them to crash in the desert.My favorite character is the arrogant German Model Plane designer DORFMANN who comes up with the plan of turning the Twin engine aircraft into a single engine plane that will fly the remaining survivors back home.His arrogance and superior feeling over the other stranded passengers made you have a Love/Hate relationship with him.Even Stewart's character who really couldn't stand the man, knew he was their only real hope of survival so he had to humble himself to the wishes of Dorfmann...The film's cinematography was spectacular despite being just desert and a wrecked airplane.The diverse passenger characters all gave good performances especially the mentally challenged BORGNINE character "Trucker Cobb"...The only disappoint of the film is the ending.Veteran Aerial Stunt Pilot Paul Mantz who had done Aerial stunt work in movies going back to the 30's;was fatally injured toward the end of shooting and crashed the remade Phoenix Airplane. The last shot you see of the plane is in the air after passing over an oil crew below.You never see the plane landing because it had been destroyed upon Mantz's Crash.The final scene is the survivors walking/running to the water spring they had passed over...Although it was never really brought out Mantz was a known Drinker and had flown stunts under the influence more than once.No one really knows if it was pilot error or aircraft malfunction or Mantz may have even had a heart attack. However he still goes down in history as one of the Greatest aviator stunt pilots in Cinema History.EXCELLENT FILM!...s.m.</fullReview>

A rag tag group of men crash land in the Sahara with little hope of surviving unless they either walk out or build a new airplane &amp; fly out. That's the plot in its entirety. James Stewart is the pilot, a stubborn curmudgeon who thinks making a new plane is idiotic. Hardy Krüger is the engineer who tries to prove him wrong...though his experience at building planes is rather sketchy. Richard Attenborough is Stewart's right hand man and voice of reason. Peter Finch is a by-the-book British captain and Ronald Fraser his not so brave underling. There's enough suspense and angry confrontations to keep this movie moving at a fast clip. The excellent music score by Aldrich regular Frank De Vol is a major asset as is the cinematography by Joseph F. Biroc. The supporting cast includes Ernest Borgnine as an unstable oil rig worker, George Kennedy, Dan Duryea and Christian Marquand as a level headed doctor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Young Against Old in the Middle of the Desert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Flight of the Phoenix" is Robert Aldrich's classic survival story about a group of men who crash land a plane in the desert and must find a way out or die. James Stewart is the pilot and de facto leader of the group; they look to him initially as the most experienced and authoritative. But he eventually butts heads with a young German (Hardy Kruger) who claims to be a designer of airplanes and decides that the only way to survive is to construct a new plane from the undamaged parts of the old one and fly to safety. In Aldrich's hands, this plot becomes a study in generational conflict, with a younger, fresher attitude about things proving to be more valuable than the traditional. The film itself is very traditional in many respects, but it's this attitude about the younger generation that exposes its roots in the counter culture that was only just beginning to make its presence felt in the films of the time. If it had been made a decade earlier, Stewart would have been our hero, no questions asked, just because he was Jimmy Stewart. In the film as it plays out, Stewart's stubborn adherence to an old way of doing things would have resulted in everyone dying if they had followed his advice.Out of a terrific ensemble of male actors, Ian Bannen was inexplicably singled out with an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He's by no means bad, but if I was going to single out anyone, it would certainly be either Kruger or Richard Attenborough as Stewart's long-time friend and confidante.The film also received an Oscar nomination for Michael Luciano's editing. Luciano was a frequent Aldrich collaborator and received nominations for three other Aldrich films: "Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte," "The Dirty Dozen" and "The Longest Yard." This is a fun, exciting movie.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie, where plane crashes in desert, and, well, tough to say "spoiler" , since it is almost 50 yrs old and when the movie title says it all. Not to add that 90% of the movie is directed to this one, and ,as movie goes on, only possible outcome.This is like a Shakespeare play or something as sparse as "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?" Initially one would call it a 'small' movie.... a few characters and a one set stage. But after watching it, seems like a much bigger stage.It's a good story that allows an amazing ensemble of great actors to strut their stuff. Well, maybe a couple didn't get a chance to fully develop, and one or two might have been a bit 'over the top', but the three keys players were outstanding.May catch hell for this, but I think one of Jimmy's best. What I didn't know till quite a bit after watching this movie for first time, was how much a Flyboy Jimmy was. It was in his DNA. When he said in the movie: "Time was you could take real pride, in just getting there, flying used to be fun Lou, it really was..." You knew that character he was playing and he were one and the same.</fullReview>

Exciting and interesting film is a bit long, but also quite entertaining, and creates a believable atmosphere of desperation that makes the ending all the more satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Mr. Towns, you behave as if stupidity were a virtue. Why is that?" (Dorfmann)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the Arabian desert, this 1965 movie stars Jimmy Stewart as the pilot of a twin-tailed plane carrying about a dozen oil field workers home for R&amp;R, when a high flying sand storm clogs the engines and forces them down, off course, in the middle of nowhere, without a working radio. At first they are certain a search party will show up and rescue them, with only pressed dates for food, and enough water to last less than two weeks if rationed carefully. Much of the two-plus hour movie is a battle of wills between the stubborn pilot Towns (Stewart) who believes their only hope is to conserve and wait for a rescue party, the stubborn British military man who tries to march out of there, and the equally stubborn German engineer Dorfmann (Hardy Kruger) who believes they can piece together a new airplane from the wreckage and fly to safety. More than anything this is a character study of a ragtag bunch thrown together at random and forced to cooperate for survival. It is a bit slow in spots, and runs a bit long for the story shown, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I kept wondering when they would eat the pet monkey! SPOILERS are contained in much of the remaining comments. Needing more water, they rigged a still and got drinking water from antifreeze. Their trust was placed in Dorfmann when they found out he designed planes for a living. Only near the end did they find out he designed model airplanes. Still he was their only hope, the right side wing was cut off and mated to the left fuselage, which was cut from the main compartment. This would save weight and allow them to fly with only the one good engine. With Plexiglas fairings over the wing for each survivor, each man lay on top of the wing as the pilot in his snug makeshift cockpit flew the plane on skids down the sand and into the air, where they eventually landed at an oil field oasis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A desert storm? Absolutely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of my all-time favourites, because, like so many other great movies, it has the three magical ingredients; 1) a great story, 2) interesting, appealing, and (more importantly) plausible characters, and 3) a talented production crew.(BTW - if my condensation of film-making sounds overly simplistic, compare the original with the 2004 remake, and you'll see what I mean.)Why do I think it's so good? 1 Story-wise, I think it's as unique as you can get.A disparate group of (ordinary) men ? oil workers, engineers, a couple of soldiers, the plane's ageing crew ? crash-land in the Sahara, so far off course as to make rescue a pipe-dream. They're doomed, until one of the passengers, a young German engineer, suggests making a (smaller) plane from the crashed hulk ? and simply flying themselves to safety.His idea is met with derision by the pilot ? Frank Towns (Stewart), an alcoholic veteran relegated to ferrying men and machinery across Africa in his old rustbucket ? and sparks start to fly. Towns' stutteringly diplomatic co-pilot, Lew Moran (Attenborough) ? coerces him into compliance ? if only to give these doomed men something to do to stave off the inevitable. And so begins the tense, ego-fuelled battle between Towns and Dorfmann ? alongside the survivors' battle against time, the desert, and forlorn hope.2 Characters? I think the Stewart/Attenborough pairing was a masterstroke. Stewart is embarrassing as the alcoholic, has-been pilot, and Attenborough is sublime as his emotional punch-bag. Kruger is as cold and calculating as his slide rule. Then there's Ian Bannen ? cocky but fractious lad-about-town. Peter Finch's honour ? and the gringeworthy Donald Fraser's lack of it...I'll stop there.Wonderful! Mick, UK.PS My advice if you haven't seen either version: buy the original (VHS, ?1, scallop-edged tape, sale-no-return, local boot fair) and the 2004 remake (DVD, ?20, hologram security tag, high street outlet) the same day. Then place the 2004 version on the ground ? and stamp on it. Very hard. Heave a (deserved) sigh of relief. Then go home, drag your old VCR out of the loft, wrestle the clumsy old VHS into that clanky old VHS letterbox, cross your fingers that the previous owner took care of it, open the beverage of your choice, sit back, and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenged to died or do the impossible, they elect to live!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elleston Trevor's book is dedicated to those who, given the choice to do the impossible or die, "elect to live." To do so, director Robert Aldrich's plane crash survivors must fight not only thirst and desert heat, but each other?and themselves as well. Jimmy Stewart shines as the proud but aging pilot who cannot accept the authority of the cold and calculating German designer (Hardy Krüger) who knows how to rebuild their wrecked twin-boom Flying Boxcar into a single-fuselage makeshift craft?the Phoenix. (When he finally does, it's one of the most breath-catching scenes in the film?and in Stewart's career.) The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent. Standouts: Richard Attenborough as the alcoholic navigator who mediates between Stewart and Krüger, Peter Finch as the by-the-book British army captain, Ronald Fraser as his quietly (later not-so-quietly) rebellious sergeant, Ernest Borgnine as an oil driller "losing his marbles," and Ian Bannen, nominated for an Academy Award as an acerbic Irish oilman. Even the supporting actors?Christian Marquand, Dan Duryea, George Kennedy?are experienced leads! And the one female role in the film?an Arab dancer seen only in a hallucination?is played by Barrie Chase, Fred Astaire's TV dance partner. Frank DeVol's music is the perfect counterpoint to Aldrich's visuals?especially in the opening credits, when Aldrich freeze-frames each of the actors?including his son William and son-in-law Peter Bravos, playing the two passengers who are killed even before the credits are complete! The basic story begins when a Skytruck, a twin-boom cargo plane, takes off from a remote oil drilling station in the Central Libyan Desert. The passengers are oil drillers beginning a much-anticipated leave, along with a British Army Captain and his sergeant, and a cargo of worn-out tools being returned for replacement. The pilot, Frank Towns (Stewart), is an aging, veteran flier from the seat-of-the-pants-days, when "You took real pride in just getting there." When the radio fails, and a sandstorm springs up, he continues to fly on?after all, forty thousand flying hours amounts to a lot more than "a little local sandstorm." It's a bold decision?and, for the first time in Towns' career, the wrong one. The sandstorm is overwhelming; it chokes first the starboard engine, then the port one. Towns brings the plane down with a great deal of skill but very little luck; he slams into the dunes, breaking up the starboard boom and the undercarriage. Two men are killed, another critically injured?and as the days pass, the survivors begin to realize that they are stranded in the middle of a very big desert?and no one is likely to find them, at least not before the water runs out.The British Army captain and one of the drillers set out on a gallant?but hopeless?attempt to march a hundred and sixty miles to the nearest water point; another driller (Borgnine) has suffered a nervous breakdown, and wanders off into the desert. The score is mounting?and this is when one other man speaks up. He is a scholarly-looking young German (Kruger) who looks decidedly out of place among the hard-bitten oil workers?and he enthusiastically announces that they have everything they need "to build a new (plane) and fly it out!" They dismiss his idea as a poor attempt at humor, until they learn what he does for a living.He's an aircraft designer.The Skytruck is based on the real-life "Flying Boxcar." Envision a railroad boxcar with a cockpit in front, and, on either side, a boom?sort of like an outrigger?an engine, and a wing. If you take the port, or left-side, boom?separate it from the main hull, and attach the starboard wing to it?you have an approximation of single-engine, standard-fuselage airplane.And eventually, that's just what they do. Under the most appalling circumstances?with nothing to eat but pressed dates?with the water supply constantly on the verge of running out?with exposure raising and bursting blisters on their skin?they bash their wrecked plane apart and bash it together again in the shape of a Phoenix?the mythical bird that rose again from its own ashes.For James Stewart, it was the last really great role in an extraordinary career. His Frank Towns is not only an old-school flier whose day has already passed him by; he is an old man who chestnuts are being pulled out of the fire by a younger man: one of the "little men with slide rules,| as Towns pits it. And the conflict between these two is, if anything, a bigger threat to the building of the Phoenix than the heat?or the thirst?or the desert.Finally Stewart has what may arguably be the best scene in all of his many movies. The water is about out, while the pilot and the designer have fought each other to the point that all work on the new plane has ground to a halt. Finally Dorfman appears in the door of the fuselage and tells the survivors, "I want to talk to you. I want to talk to all of you." And when they're all facing him, including the pilot, he puts the question on which their survival hinges: "Mr. Towns, who is in authority here?" Jimmy Stewart does an amazing thing. He draws himself up to his full height, staring the younger man straight in the eye?and then he visibly deflates, and he sighs: "You are." The scene is lifted almost word-for-word from Trevor's novel, as is most of the story. The film opened in 1966 and?crashed, if you will, at the box office. Despite the all-star cast, a long desert survival story with an all-male cast (except for the hallucinatory belly dancer) failed to sell much popcorn. Instead, over the next forty years, it became a staple of late-night movies and home video, and has grown in critical stature until it's regarded as a classic.P.S. This should NOT be confused with the overblown, clichéd 2004 remake!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another of my favorite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A passenger plane piloted by Frank Towns (Jimmy Stewart) crashes in the African desert and for the passengers the struggle for survival has begun. Passenger Heinrich Dorfmann (Hardy Kruger), claims he can design a smaller plane out of the wreckage, and if they build it, they can fly out of the desert. Dorfmann is a quiet German with a slight accent, a nerd, who is perhaps playing a reconciliatory role here, with this movie being released a mere 20 years after the war.Dorfmann conflicts with pilot Frank Towns. Co-pilot Lew Moran (Richard Attenborough) stands between them. Towns says of Dorfmann, "He's always right", "That's what gets ya!" Towns laments a past time when men were men, "I guess these engineers, with their pocket pens and their slide-rules are taking over", "He (Dorfmann) doesn't even have to live to see it", "It's enough for him just to know." In a great line for nerds everywhere Dorfmann gets to say, "Mr. Towns, you behave as if you believe stupidity is a virtue." By the end of the movie these become just strong words among friends. Towns is a man of action and impulse and Dorfmann is a man of calculation and ego. In a sense Dorfmann's a 'Mr Spock' kind of character, to Towns', Captain Kirk, I guess. Perhaps, that even leaves co-pilot Lew Moran to represent Dr. McCoy -the super ego and the conscience. Actor Jimmy Stewart, who was actually a B-17 pilot during the war, does a great job bringing Frank Towns to life. Hardy Krugar, as Dorfmann, really brings this movie home also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made film that keeps your attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it several times since. It's a good film and worth looking into if you have never seen it. It runs a little long at 143 minutes but it's a nicely paced film with lots of emotion, conflict, duologue, tension and the dilemma that these people are in you can't help but feel a part of it. A cargo passenger plane crashes in the Libian desert and the survivors must keep their wits about them in their struggle for survival together and their imaginative plan for self rescue. To build a flyable plane out of the wreckage. This was adapted from the 1964 novel of the same name by Elleston Trevor that appeared in segment in Life magazine. Robert T. Aldrich is the director who directed such films as Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane, The Dirty Dozen, Ulzana's Raid and The longest Yard. Lukas Heller who worked with Aldrich on several of his films did an excellent adaptation of the story for the screenplay. Cinematography is by Joseph F. Biroc who photographed Aldrich's Ulzana's Raid, Emporer of the North Pole and The Longest Yard and also did such films as Superman, Brian's Song and Blazing Saddles. An all-star cast with James Stewart, Richard Attenborough, Ernest Borgnine, Peter Finch, George Kennedy, Dan Duryea, Christian Marquand and Ian Bannen. Of all those familiar names it was the less familiar to American moviegoers, Scottish born Ian Bannen who was nominated for the Academy Award for 1965 for Best Supporting Actor. The film also received an Oscar nomination for Best Film Editing. Bannen acted in films right up until his death in 1999 and appeared in 1995's Braveheart. Amazingly 41 years after this film three of it's living actors are still acting, Attenborough, Borgnine and Kennedy. It's a well-made film that keeps your attention and I would give it an 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Drama and Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie numerous times at the theater and on TV, etc. I think it is one of the best aviation movies ever made. The suspense in the final scenes of the takeoff captures the entire dimension of this film. I like its realism and forthright characterizations of all of the actors. I get very warm each time I see that sun blazing over all of the action. This is not a movie for those looking for a romantic comedy or an outright action thriller. Instead, it's a bold move into the lives of many different characters and their emotions and ambitions. I would recommend this picture to anyone interested in good acting, drama, and a little trip into a fantasy world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They don't make them like that anymore . I saw this movie as a child and thought it was good . Obviously far fetched but compare it to movies like Speed , Mission Impossible , The Fugitive etc . I watched it again the other day and really appreciated it fully . The best part about the movie is not what they did but the interplay between the different characters in such a stressful and seemingly hopeless situation. Frank Towns feels overwhelmingly responsible as he is in charge and at fault . He is at odds with Dorfman not so much because he thinks his idea is ridiculous but because Dorfman is showing the clearest thought in the crisis . This threatens Towns authority which has already taken a huge blow . The heated exchanges between the two are fabulous. The rest of the passengers all succumb in different ways to stress. Cobb is the weakest and cracks up. Harris goes to what is likely to be certain death at the hands of the Arabs and Sgt Watson knows this and refuses to go . Harris knows he has to go due to the situation. Crow deals with the stress with humour which does bring a little relief- mainly to himself. Attenborough is good as Moran . George Kennedy's character doesn't really get going though . Look at the cast , you know its going to be a good movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was certainly an surprise and delight to watch. I read Trevor's novel some 35 years ago in a "Readers Digest" short version, and was so fascinated by the novel (Norwegian title: "Fanger i ?rkenen" - "Prisoners of the desert". I am still able to remember complete sentences from the book! I was very surprised by the fact that the movie was so close up to the novel version. Even some of the actors were spitting images from the illustrations in my old RD book! I am only able to find one major difference between the book and the movie, where the book equipped the Phoenix with skies, but the movie lets it take off with landing gear with wheels. The movie was a beautiful meeting with my own childhood dream of building my own plane (I still dream, 35 years after...), combined with a intense excitement int the harsh environment, and threatening storms and desert pirates.

		<fullReview>The Flight of the Phoenix reflects the postwar period, when the German people were regaining the friendship and respect of the rest of the world, and were often portrayed as good guys instead of villians. The German engineer comes up with the only solution to the plight of the survivors of the plane crash in the desert. The marching solution proposed by the British officer is rejected by Stewart's character, and fails; others get their throats slit seeking help from desert nomads. Kruger's character enforces his authority even over Stewart's character, and in one memorable scene, the German completely cuts down to size those who disparage his experience building "toy airplanes." But in the end the German is not infallible. Stewart's character succeeds in starting the "phoenix" by firing all remaining charges despite the German's violent opposition, which changes to a big smile, and the two are best of friends after the flight to safety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Don't keep Uncle Heinrich waiting"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things you got with the abandoning of traditional norms in 1960s cinema, especially the ones about the obligatory romantic angle, you started to get these all-male wilderness dramas. And, as Laurence of Arabia proved, such pictures needn't be action-orientated no-brainers.Although it has some strong elements of thriller and a slightly techy bent to it, Flight of the Phoenix is effectively a personality-driven piece. It is the clashes, the drama and the commanding performances that give it its power. Jimmy Stewart shows more aggressive passion than is typical for his usual kindly persona, but he keeps the same old humanity at his heart. Still, this is fairly basic stuff for him, and it's more the supporting players we should watch here. Hardy Kruger is lumped with portraying a hard-hearted human-calculator, but manages to instill a degree of humanity in the character through occasional displays of craftmanly pride and boyish enthusiasm. George Kennedy plays the most bland of the survivors, but with his easygoing warmth he makes an impression. Ian Bannen was the only one of the crew to receive an Oscar nomination for his lively and very physical performance, although he is not really the best performance in the picture, let alone one of the five best male supporting performances of the year. He is also in constant danger of slipping into a Groundskeeper Willy-style parody. Then again, he is as much a stereotypical Scot as Kruger is a stereotypical German, Peter Finch a stereotypical army officer or Ernest Borgnine a stereotypical madman. That is one of the few problems with this picture: weak characterisation.Still, there are enough elements here to keep everything interesting, and the direction of Robert Aldrich is at its most focused. Aldrich had a habit of being a bit showy and needlessly bizarre in his technique, but here with the stripped-down elements he takes a more minimalist tack. He keeps props and pyrotechnics out of the way so as not distract from the intensity of dialogue scenes, usually framing characters against stark backgrounds. He will often finish a heated exchange with a meaningful wide shot, sometimes bringing the handful of graves into view as a bleak and poignant reminder. And unlike many a desert picture he doesn't show off the scope of the landscape, spending most of the time drawing us inward upon the men and their situation, with the occasional towering dune ? no rolling expanses ? the only acknowledgement of what lies beyond.What is not often remembered is that Robert Aldrich was also head of his own productions, and while he is far from being one of the top directors of this period there are certain things about Aldrich the producer that I like very much. There is of course his dynamic trademark of delaying the opening credits until the story really gets going, for maximum impact ? of which Flight of the Phoenix is one of the best examples. But there is also the sense of community warmth you get from a Robert Aldrich production. There is the way he had a little family of regular technical crew members and bit players. He chooses Dan Duryea, once a sinister baddie in numerous gritty thrillers, to play a sweet and simple middle-aged man, not because it is really necessary to cast the role against type, but simply because Duryea was a respected actor who was up to the job. You get an idea of Aldrich's personality when you see him introduce his own son in a bit part, only to have him killed off ten seconds later in a somewhat comical fashion, with a campy schlock-horror scream. And Aldrich, despite his reputation, always seemed to wring some emotional weight out of his pictures, examples here being little touches like the introduction of the tentative theme song Senza Fine, a tender melody on a tinny radio. In Aldrich's hands Flight of the Phoenix is less of a macho man film, and becomes more of a stirring human drama.</fullReview>

I was interested to see the original before seeing the remake and now I don't think I'll bother with the remake unless it gets shown on TV because you couldn't beat this cast.

		<shortDescription>A story about the struggles with pride, emotions, prejudices during a struggle for survival in a seemingly hopeless situation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tend to classify the 1965 version of "The Flight of the Phoenix" as an psychological action movie. The tension of the story is created not so much by the attempts for survival in an hostile desert environment but in the struggle between the will, the pride, the fears, and the intellect of the main characters. The characters, of course, are typified -as usual- for easy identification (the good, the bad, the evil, the brave, the clown, the fool, the strong, the weak, the brain, etc.). In this story, the intellect, academia, represented in the air plane designer, must triumph over emotion, prejudice, and years of "hands-on" experience of the pilot. The air plane designer wins the key argument with the pilot by stating that the laws of physics (i.e., aerodynamics) are the same, whether applied in small model air planes or in big flying machines. "The Flight of the Phoenix"' title is a dead give away (in reference of the prohibition of Spoilers contained in reviews); of course, the "dead" airplane is resurrected and flies again, just as the mythological Phoenix dies and resurrects for yet another flight. The story is worth a viewing. In reference to Robert J Maxwell's (from Deming, NM) pretty good summation, the comment about the actor Hardy Krueger's time in Nazi Germany's Hitler Youth is misplaced because it is completely irrelevant to the story and to the acting. Hardy Krueger was a kid during the Nazi time, and membership in the Hitler Youth was not always entirely voluntary. I just learned that a new (2004-version) of "The Flight of the Phoenix" has been released. It might be interesting to view the 1965 version and then compare it with the one released 39 years later.</fullReview>

At the other end of the scale the performances from James Stewart, Richard Attenborough, Hardy Krüger and Ronald Fraser are convincing portrayals of people that you know must exist in real life even if you haven't met them yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jimmy Stewart leads an entire cast giving good performances in this exciting movie about oil workers stranded in the middle of the Sahara. When they all discover Hardy Kruger's plan to rebuild the downed plane is based on the model planes he builds for a living, the reactions by the other characters are very funny.But, the heart and soul of any movie with Jimmy Stewart is....Jimmy Stewart, and ,of course, he is great as usual. A fun movie with a satisfying ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Flight of the Phoenix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of the main star, and I knew I was going to try it regardless of the plot. Basically a cargo plane crashes in the Sahara desert during a sand storm, with less than a dozen men on board. Frank Towns (James Stewart) and the rest of his crew are confident that people are searching for them, but it is after the water supply is limited and heat intense that they lose hope of rescue. But one of the passengers, Heinrich Dorfmann (Golden Globe nominated Hardy Krüger) reveals that he is a plane designer, and they hatch a plan to make a new smaller plane from the remains. It all seems to be going well, and there are only a few moments of despair and anger, particularly when Dorfmann admits to stealing valuable water, and when they see camel riding people, and next morning they have killed two of their group. I think the biggest blow though is when they get closer to finishing "The Phoenix", and Frank and Lew Moran (Lord Sir Richard Attenborough) realise Dorfmann may be mad, as he has only designed model aeroplanes. But there is a very good ending for all survivors when the plane runs and successfully takes them to civilisation. Also starring Peter Finch as Captain Harris, Ernest Borgnine as Trucker Cobb, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ian Bannen as Crow, Ronald Fraser as Sergeant Watson, Christian Marquand as Dr. Renaud, Dan Duryea as Standish and Cool Hand Luke's George Kennedy as Bellamy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best films ever made in my opinion. An all-star cast all give great performances and the story is first-rate. An aircraft carrying several passengers crashes in the desert. They then set out to build an flyable aircraft out of what remains. It's a story of courage, survival, faith and luck. This is one of James Stewart's finest films. The Flight of the Phoenix is one not to be missed! - it's what I would call a true classic film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting variation on the 'Hollywood Bomber Crew' plot line with strong casting which is puzzling at times; for example by 1965 Ernest Borgnine had built on his breakout role of Fatso Judson in From Here To Eternity and his Oacar-winning Marty and had been prominent in several memorable titles like Bad Day At Black Rock, The Poseidon Adventure etc but here he is killed off in the first half hour, similarly Peter Finch is given little to do whilst people like Dan Duryea and George Kennedy seem to be there only to make up the numbers. The bulk of screen time is shared between James Stewart, Hardy Kruger and Dickie Attenborough who was competent in a part that any Hollywood supporting actor could have played just as well. It's a good example of the Boy's Own Paper School of plotting and holds up reasonably well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good survival movie. Has all you would expect from the genre: good set up(ie crash and lead-up to it), taking stock, survival and then a plan to get back to civilisation. Character development is good: you learn much about the main characters, their backgrounds and motivations. Enough to understand the relationships and conflicts between the characters. However, not a flawless movie. The ultimate plan and its execution are quite far-fetched. There is quite a bit of dumb sentimentality, when practicality was required, especially from James Stewart's character. This did make Hardy Kruger's character more likable, as he was a total pragmatist. Good performances from Hardy Kruger and Richard Attenborough. As mentioned, James Stewart lays on the sentimentality a bit thick. Ernest Borgnine is a tad irritating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just about the best movie of its genre. The all-star cast is not for show, they all have meaningful parts and turn in consistently outstanding performances. The reconstruction of the aircraft is fascinating. However, since he also designed the radio controls for some of his models, Dorfmann should have been able to build a serviceable transmitter from the plane's own malfunctioning radio and/or Ernest Borgnine's transistor radio. This would have saved all but those killed in the crash but would also deprive us of a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing if you're looking for an action film; more a character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I'm on the short end of the stick here. I'm not at all a fan of this movie. I remember watching it on one of the network movie nights at least 30 years ago, and I thought it to be very boring. Now in 2013 I watched it again, and while I may appreciate it slightly more, I still think it's boring. And why? One simple reason -- virtually the entire film takes place on just one set -- the crashed airplane. And, that one-scene locked in feeling makes almost any film boring...at least to me.And it's too bad. The film had a lot going for it, particularly in terms of its cast. The key star here is Jimmy Stewart, who was aging very well in movies, and his acting here is superb. Hardy Kruger, an extremely handsome German actor, is just wonderful as the aviation designer who wants to rebuild the crashed plane and fly out of the desert. Richard Attenborough is fine as the co-pilot. Peter Finch is appropriately annoying as the British officer. Ernest Borgnine is good as the oil worker who had a nervous breakdown. It's nice seeing Dan Duryea in a role where he's not the bad guy! And George Kennedy plays the same role he always plays...George Kennedy. It's a great cast.The plot, overall, is okay. But unlike what you might think -- a plane crashes and they rebuild it and fly out of the desert -- it's not an action film. The action is restricted to about5 minutes in the beginning and 10 minutes in the end. It really comes down to who will survive and who will die, and make no mistake -- it's not a happy ending since many die. Who dies first is a bit of a surprise. This movie is a character study.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aramco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film depicts the story of western oil workers in a North African oil company named Arabco crashing in the Sahara desert and their conflict to survive. I think the name Arabco alludes to Aramco. I remember watching this movie on Aramco's TV "Chanel 3" they use to air it from time to time in the 80s and the early 90s.Aramco is the largest oil corporation in the world, it operates in Saudi Arabia., when we were kids we used to hear my father telling us stories about his work in Aramco and the oil explorations and the oil wells digging and stories about big fires and explosions. He worked with Aramco for 40 years since 1951. We have heard stories from him about the Americans who lived in the big compounds in Dhahran and Ras Tanura in the 50s and 60s. We have seen glimpses of what that era looked like in the pictures published by Aramco in their magazines and books and the films produces by the company. For me this 1965 film is very nostalgic it reminds me of the experience my father had in the oil industry. And the Sahara desert is a clear allude to The Empty Quarter desert where Aramco use to explore and operate. James Stewart in the leading role adds to the magic, at that time those old Hollywood stars contributed a lot to the bright and lovely image that people had in their minds about America and the American people. When we were kids Aramco was that image. It was America. I saw a remake of this film in 2004 and it was dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engrossing flight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's often been noted that "Airport" (1970) kicked off a decade long spate of disaster movies, but it isn't too much of a stretch to credit this film as the template for the cycle. It features a formula which was cribbed in various ways for other, later disaster films and like films after "Airport", the disaster IS the movie. The movie wastes no time in getting to the action. A disparate group of men are flying across the desert in a rather run down plane piloted by Stewart, assisted by Attenborough. An unusual title sequence introduces us to each man just as the plane is about to go down. (This is helpful to modern day viewers in figuring out who's who in the international cast!) Once aground, the men realize that they are in danger of never being located by rescue attempts. Short on water and with little to eat, they must form a plan for survival and evacuation. Cast includes Army officer Finch, German engineer Kruger, Catholic businessman Duryea, psychiatrist Marquand, future disaster movie regulars Borgnine and Kennedy and several other laborers and assorted passengers. (There's also a brief appearance by multipurpose dancer Chase, who made a splash in the '60's.) The film has a biting starkness to it in that it isn't afraid to dispose of characters, even characters whose billing is rather high on the pecking order, to get its point across. There is fine acting all around, though, at times, it is difficult to understand all the varied accents of the multinational cast. There is much (occasionally too much...the film is a tad overlong) interpersonal connection and contention among the men. Stewart and Kruger are memorable as uneasy allies in the plan to leave the desert. Attenborough lends strong support. Nearly everyone gets his chance to shine. The make up effectively conveys the dry, relentlessly hot setting of the film. Interest level builds along with suspense as a startling revelation is made right before the escape is meant to begin. As stated in the end credits, a top stunt pilot was killed in the filming of the film's climax. ***SPOILERS*** As a previous poster noted, several aspects of this film were lifted and/or rethought for the film "Airport '77". Comparisons of the two provide fascinating parallels and include: The way the lead actor is credited, the way the plane flounders, being miles off course, the deaths of the annoying musicians, the severe leg injuries of men who are worried about their wives, the passing vehicle overhead, a punch in the face, two people leaving to seek help and on and on! Kudos to the poster who caught this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically great; but why should I care for a bunch of cranky, quarrelling, middle aged guys?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of not-so-young survive a plane crash in the desert and try to make a new one from scratch, to get out of there. That's the story. I would have liked to give a better review for this film, as this is one of the classics of the 60s which seemed destined to last. Unfortunately I can't. The fact is, FOTF has aged badly and on that point I'll have to agree with the younger generation--which gets a pretty rough deal in it, anyway; they're all killed at the beginning. So let me put it this way: would you root for the survival of a bunch of cranky, washed up, middle agers who can't even stand each other? I did it back then, but that was when I was a teenager and Stewart, Borgnine, Finch, were the De Niros, Costners, Harrison Fords of the day, so we went to see their movies and got caught in them, no matter what. But today's audiences don't relate in any way to them--and I hardly do it myself--so if they watch FOTF they'll most likely do it like I just did now, with much interest, even enthusiasm at times, but feeling no emotion whatsoever when characters die, are killed. And that is the filmmaker's fault; he neglected to build true characters and give them a background, a human profile, maybe trusting that the star value would be enough to carry the movie. That was perhaps true then, but not anymore; these characters are simply cardboard cut outs; stereotypes with familiar faces?where are the family photos here, the personal hobbies, the love interests? Nowhere (except for Dorfmann's). Not coincidently, the only one for whom we feel anything is the Italian, which gives us the best bit of the movie--the most beautiful also--when dying and listening to Senza Fine, the preferred tune of him and the love of his life. As for the rest, only two elicit any sympathy from me: Dorfmann, as said, and Watson, for refusing to be a fool and gallantly commit suicide, even at the risk of a court martial.The worst mistake the filmmaker did here, for the sake of the film's enduring value, was to kill the young at the beginning, which immediately alienates and disconnects young audiences, something he got away with at the time only because of--as said--the star value of Stewart et al. What is left then is a collection of guys who don't have much of a life to go back to, so we don't really care if they live or die. Do we really care for a simpleton who, if rescued, will go back to a life of misery, as said by himself? Or for a suicidal fruitcake of a British officer who seems to be begging to get killed, with his hare brained schemes and his idiotic stubbornness? (That's why I pity Watson and sympathize with what he does to get rid of him). Do we really care for a perennially cranky, stubborn, self righteous, has-been of a pilot who's not only the responsible for the crash that got them there, but who's bent also on putting every possible obstacle--that thing won't fly!--to the only one chance they have of ever getting out of there?. As for the rest, the accountant is wasted, he doesn't have a life to go back to, and the navigator is a loser and a drunk--as said by Towns himself. That doctor looks like just coming out of a bad divorce (maybe there his eagerness to commit suicide) and the Scot is a giant bore. What's left is George Kennedy's character, which have precious few lines--a pity--and probably the only guy who got a life waiting for him elsewhere, besides Dorfmann. (Now, I understand, national stereotypes were the norm in movies during the 60s and that the moral of this one is that former enemies may join forces when facing common problems, also that the Germans must feel good again about themselves, but that is not enough to carry a classic through the ages.)This is a film that can be watched with interest, even excitement, but with hardly any emotion. (the only thing that really matters is, if the contraption will fly or not; all the rest, who lives or dies, is of little consequence, so we're told). The cinematography is good an so the acting. The camera work is mostly adequate; no superfluous wide shots of the desert here, the lenses always on the action. The flaws are in the plot and in the character development Depts. Question again: who are these guys and why should I care about them?--one never really answered, not even put forward. That's the main problem I have: they seem happy to leave, but to go back to what? About the plot: at a time of no Apple or Microsoft, the nerds used to turn to electronics. Why Dorfman, a royal geek if you ever saw one, who's able to build RCs for models planes, didn't try to fix the radio, or tried to build a new one, instead of engaging in such a doubtful project?.I'll give it 6. One for Senza Fine alone. Maybe I'm too tough on my grading, but I can't help comparing these men's ordeal with that of the--very real--Chilean miners, or to that of the three fugitive astronauts in Capr. One for that matter, and conclude that they were behaving just like spoiled brats.</fullReview>

In general, the acting was way over the top, awkward, and amateurish. (Apologies to James Stewart, Peter Finch, and the other well-known actors involved.) The dialog was stilted and unnatural. The musical score was horrendous ? at times, it was incredibly loud, annoying, and in-your-face.The movie seemed overly long ? it needed some serious editing, particularly in the long middle act of the picture. The ending, on the other hand, seemed rushed and just a bit too short (especially given the lengthy nature of the rest of the movie).I really wanted to love this movie.

		<fullReview>A plane crashes in the desert, and the only obvious possibilities of survival are to wait for rescue or to walk to civilization. The survivors know that neither option is likely to succeed, but their ability to agree with one another ends there. Whether you like the movie may depend partly on whether you agree with its "Lord of the Flies"-like premise that, outside of the constraints and comforts of polite society, humans are more likely to conflict with one another than to cooperate. In this film the cooperators, chiefly Richard Attenborough's alcoholic co-pilot and Christian Marquand's worldly doctor, are sympathetic characters whom I wished to see survive the ordeal. I hoped other characters would survive only on the condition that they first became more relatable. Perhaps being stranded in the desert is indeed a more soluble dilemma than the problem of being surrounded by detestable, combative people.</fullReview>

Hardy Kruger, Richard Attenborough and, of course Jimmy Stewart, are the standouts; but Ernest Borgnine, Ian Bannen and Ronald Fraser are particularly good here. In spite of the fantastic story, there's some very observant psychology explored here, and even a touch of sexual tension in a brief cameo appearance by the only female cast member, Barrie Chase, and through Connie Francis' lilting version of the song SENZA FINE. Intelligent adventure films like this one are a real rarity. The music score is by underrated Aldrich collaborator, Frank DeVol, and it's particularly effective in the climactic scenes. A major winner, at long last available in a budget-priced DVD from Fox, in it's correct widescreen ratio, and with it's original-release matrixed stereo soundtrack.</fullReview>

It's an interesting exploration of group dynamics and the evolvement of social hierarchies under pressure.Or it's a Boys' Own adventure story about the survivors of an aircrash in the desert building a fresh plane from the wreckage of the original one and flying to safety in it. If you still live at home with your mum and spend a lot of time in your room playing with your computer you may prefer the former description of the plot to the latter. Once you've accepted that they obviously aren't all going to die of thirst,it's just a matter of making a bet with yourself on which ones are going to be got rid of because the new plane won't be big enough to take them all. With the exception of grizzled veteran pilot Mr James Stewart,none of the survivors is safe from the dread hand of the grim reaper. An unsympathetic bunch,it is hard to care one way or the other about their fate. And they all overact alarmingly,including - unfortunately - Mr Stewart. Mr Aldrich elicits a "Jimmy Stewart" performance from the great man deep from within the actor's comfort zone.It's entertaining - indeed it's the most entertaining part of the film - but it's hack work all the same. After 2 and a half hours I was glad to get out of the cinema and down a pint of lager:"Ice Cold In Alex" - now that was a good movie about a mixed group of people in peril in the desert..................</fullReview>

It would be hard to beat the original with James Stewart and a great cast, but I guess with all the new special effects, I'll be first in line to see it. The new cast looks pretty good...not sure about Dennis Quaid taking over the role of James Stewart, but hope he does the role justice. Among other notables in the new cast is Giovanni Ribisi from the recent Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and Miranda Otto from Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King...either they've added a new character or most likely she'll reprise the role of Barrie Chase.

This movie popped into my mind almost immediately. It was so boring!! I just remember how disappointed I was as the movie unfolded and we didn't go anywhere! There was just nothing that I think was redeeming regarding this movie. Two and 1/2 hours of the same setting right around the plane was almost too much to take. I remember wanting to leave but couldn't for some reason or other. I did enjoy some of the actors like James Stewart, Ernest Borgnine, and Dan Duryea, but having an entire movie set around a plane in the Sahara desert was just too much for me to enjoy. Now, maybe I feel it was boring because I was only 14 years old when I saw it at the movies. To be honest, I don't think I could sit through it again for almost 2 1/2 hours to see if I was wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I brought this film to see Peter Finch's performance with the idea that if James Stewart was starring it couldn't be all that bad. I was right it isn't all that bad, parts of it are even quite good, but there is something about the whole thing that I'm just not all that comfortable with.Performance wise the four stars are fine, Stewart is obviously in his element, and Attenborough, Finch and Kruger all put in good efforts. Visually it is all fine, and well shot, although all the sand started to annoy me after a bit (but hey it is set in the desert).The story however is were it starts to get slightly unstuck, the plane crashes, and we know Stewart at lest is going to get out of it somehow, so for the movie to excel the in between part was going to have to be great. As it turned out it was reasonable, but no cigar. Through out the whole thing I couldn't help but wishing they would get on with it a bit quicker so I could go and do something else.This film didn't make me smile, the only time it crabbed my attention was when Finch and the doctor guy got their throats slit, and the only time I started to enjoy it was when the plane managed to fly again because it meant I'd almost reached the end. However the reasons for my apathy to this film are more due to personal taste than it being a bad production, so perhaps watch it yourself and make your own mind up.</fullReview>

With Captain Stewart over-enunciating all his dialogue (as if he'd gone deaf or, perhaps, thought the rest of us had) and the other men performing in a game of one-upsmanship, the drama at hand becomes stilted and inert.

		<fullReview>Stewart (Capt.), Kennedy and Borgnine head this male-star cast aboard a doomed WW2 carrier plane which crashes in an Arabian desert. Tension sort-of-mounts, tempers flair, and rescue seems impossible.If this all sounds familiar, the plot of ?Phoenix' was practically stolen, scene for scene, and further exploited in the disaster film `Airport '77.' This latter movie also starred Stewart (playing the millionaire, luxury 747 owner) and Kennedy (aircraft mechanic, "Petroni"), wherein a custom-made commercial airliner crashes in the Atlantic Ocean, instead of the sand.</fullReview>
