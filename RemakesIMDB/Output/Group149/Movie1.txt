		<shortDescription>The politically correct version of the flight of the phoenix!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost 40 years after the original the 2005 version shows how much the world has changed. To start off with there is a woman passenger in this film unlike the original where the only female was an exotic Arabian dancer (although a mirage). In this version the frail girl passenger is a foul-mouthed oil driller who wears the obligatory tank top and spandex pants once the boiler suit has been discarded.In addition to this we have two black men, one who is the co-pilot. In the original the Mexican dies in the ill-fated march through the desert however in 2005 the Mexican survives. (The writers are probably sensitive to the many Mexicans who die trying to cross the Arizona and Texas border in hot conditions). In fact he defies almost certain death when the wing of the new construction collapses on top of him but survives. In 1965 the cocky Scotsman survives but in the 2005 the Scotsman perishes in the shoot out with the nomads. Interestingly, we are still aloud to use nomads as the cruel bad guys, again in the original it was the Arabs who were the barbarians, that won't cut today, so it's probably why outer Mongolia was chosen.However, the writers slipped up with their choice of the anti-hero. In the original the blond hared blue eyed bespectacled trouble maker was a German called Dorfman, who menacingly portrayed the stereotype of Nazi arrogance and superiority who audiences back in 1965 (20 years after the war) could easily hate; yet he turned out to be the hero in the end.To bring it up to date and really be politically correct they should have used a Muslim. We all could have hated him but then hailed him as a hero in the end too. All in all a pointless remake and for die-hard fans of the original they may have a hard time swallowing this one. The original, which is a longer movie, is superior in portraying the hopelessness of their predicament as well as the underlying tensions between the survivors. Cowardice and bravery are on show in the 1965 version, but in this one ---, just stupidity!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ho-hum remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Flight of the Phoenix" is at best a so-so remake of the fine Robert Aldrich adventure classic from1965. The plot in both films is fairly simple and straightforward. After a plane crash lands in the Gobi Desert, the survivors hit upon the notion of rebuilding the damaged vehicle in the hopes of flying it back to civilization. Dennis Quaid assumes the role, originally filled by Jimmy Stewart, of the pilot who, against all odds, endeavors to lead his passengers to safety.Although the new version follows the original fairly closely in terms of both character delineation and plot development, the story doesn't seem quite as fresh today as it did when we first encountered it close to 40 years ago. Perhaps what's missing is the guiding hand of a master craftsman like Aldrich to really deliver the goods (John Moore, a far less distinguished director, is manning the controls here). This "Flight" feels awfully predictable and rote, as we plow our way through each of the various survival threats, rescue attempts and internecine personal conflicts that are standard in all such tales of survivors stranded in a hostile environment. Each of the characters steps out of the shadows to have his or her own Moment in the Sun (yes, in this version, there is actually a woman aboard), before receding dutifully into the background to allow the next person to do the same. About the only intriguing element in the story is the fact that the main character, the pilot of the plane, has to actually be talked into participating in the Quixotic rescue plan. Thus, he is a leader and a hero more by default than by design.Although the crash itself is fairly impressive from a technical standpoint - despite a rather phony-looking, computer-generated sandstorm that brings the plane down - once we end up on the desert floor, the movie doesn't do a particularly effective job conveying the truly grueling nature of the predicament these individuals are facing. We never really get the sense that they are just a few water droplets away from dying of thirst or heatstroke. Moreover, the feat that they are able to accomplish seems barely credible - from a sheer mechanical engineering standpoint - given the lack of resources and expertise with which the group has to cope. The main weakness with a film like "Flight of the Phoenix" is that, when the plane goes down, we're stuck in the desert right along with the characters, and if they don't have anything particularly interesting to say to one another, we can feel just as stranded as they.Thus, despite a few quality moments, this "Flight" never manages to get off the runway. Check out the original instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are planning to see this movie, don't bother. It's a poor remake of a very good old movie. As a pilot, and from a pilot's point of view, the crash scene was completely unbelievable. If you aren't a pilot, you may enjoy the crash scenes, but I can tell you that the plane would have been in tiny pieces before it ever hit the ground. Once it hit the first sand dune, it would have broken up into small chunks after the first ground strike.The interaction between the actors was forced, and never really developed.The most unbelievable part came when yet another! freak sand storm comes up and the Phoenix is sitting on the sand and starts to lift up as if ready to fly. A few moments later, you see the fuselage of the original plane rolled over by the wind. Yet, the Phoenix doesn't get blown away (even though it's got wings (the fuselage doesn't)) and it's trying to fly as the wind picks up.Next, we see our heroes sitting on the sand and the Phoenix is almost completely buried but the sand blown around by the sand storm.Quite dramatically, the decision is made to dig the plane out of the sand. Give thought to trying to dig a 2 bedroom house out of a 10 foot drift of sand after spending a week or two in the desert with little or no water, a few cans of peaches and you have an idea of the task facing our heroes. To get an idea, just go out in your yard and dig a hole 2 feet deep and 2 feet square. It will take you a LONG time to do it. Imagine doing it under the conditions described above! Yeah, right! The next scene shows the Phoenix dramatically out of the sand, clean and undamaged, and ready to fly! Once again, yeah, right.Finally, our heroes get the plane started with a hoard of Mongolian Marauders chasing them into flight. Of course, there is the perfunctory scene when a cable to the rudder is shot away by automatic rifle fire and the engineer has to climb back on the fuselage to dramatically fix it while keeping from falling off or getting shot by the hoard of horsemen. Ho hum.And, of course, we all fly off into the sunset.Get a copy of the Jimmy Stewart version. A much better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woeful - many factual and logical errors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's just a few things that make no sense...1. They fly out of a mine site in Mongolia (Gobi desert - frozen high altitude wastelands). But they crash in a hot sandy desert that looks pretty much like the Sahara where they are all running around in short sleeves. How did that happen? They flew from central Asia to Africa? The Gobi just got 40 degrees hotter with a whole lot of sand? 2. Aeronautical dude says the plane is overweight. If that's so, how did it get out of a high altitude airfield in the fist place? And it didn't just creep off the ground if ripped into the air at a ridiculous rate of climb.3. Last night when the new plane is ready, it gets completely buried in a sand storm, except for the tail. Damn! What a sandstorm. A whole plane buried in one night. But even more amazing, they dig it out in one day using only one shovel. So that's say .... a couple of thousand tons of sand? And that's not even counting the runway, which presumably would have been buried too.4. They decide to earth the plane in an electrical storm. Well that would make it a brilliant path to ground for an electric strike, ensuring that it gets completely destroyed. Passenger jets get struck by lighting quite often but they always survive because the lighting doesn't have a path to earth through the jet. Grounding of planes is to prevent static discharge during fuelling, not to dissipate a lighting strike.5. The petrol cans explode when some sparks drift onto them. Don't they always on Hollywood? (dangerous part of the world). Petrol does not explode unless it is in the exact ratio of 14.7:1 with air. That's why cars need a carburettor. Otherwise, it just burns. Anyway setting fire to the spillage on the outside of a can won't make the contents inside it burn, let alone explode.6. An exploration site gets shut down, but the workers don't know until some some dickhead pilot turns and up says he's there to take them home? Yeh, right, that would happen.Tons of other unbelievable nonsense. Not worth spending any more time to write about it. I got ripped off with this DVD. Worst movie in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Flight of the Repeat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparing this new version to the original would be comparing a farm horse to a thoroughbred from the Kentucky Derby. This version has new actors filling the shoes of established characters, and yet none have the quality to hold the story on course, causing it to crash like their airplane. The original had James Stewart and Richard Attenborough, both with performances worthy of academy awards and established the foundations of a true classic. In addition, the rest of the cast stood of themselves and even Ronald Fraser gave a most stirring performance as Sgt. Watson. Superior veteran actors like Peter Finch, Hardy Krüger, Ernest Borgnine, Ian Bannen, Christian Marquand, Dan Duryea and George Kennedy, all gave the original solid star power and allowed the Phonix to rise from the screen into the memory of it's viewers. This new version has Dennis Quaid as Frank Townes, sympathetic enough, but far less convincing of his character. All in all, the new version falls, like most remakes, well short of the original. Sorry, but this film should have been left in the desert with the remains of the fallen airplane. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable movie with some great style, but ultimately Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've not seen the original, before you ask, but I do know of it, and quite frankly I'm sick fed up of remakes. Yet there was something that attracted me to this story, the cast was one. A nice multi-national crew featuring Dennis Quaid, Hugh Laurie and Tony Curran, and the fact that it's a very simple story with nothing other than desert and cast to deal with. It kind of gave me the feeling of a slightly larger Ice Cold in Alex.Unfortunately I was watching it on Sky and at my parents, that means no surround sound and the picture was cropped, damn Sky. However we didn't seem to lose much of the feel of the movie.The cinematography value here is high. The movie looks great, it does seem as though they have high production values. The opening sequences with the plane flying over sand dunes are superb, and then when it hits the storm the effects are excellent and it's at that point the action really kicks in, before that we were introduced to the varied multi-national characters and their initial roles. The crash sequence is well filmed and edited and builds the tension superbly, all the shots here are believable, and have you on the edge of your seat. After this the action really dies down for most of the movie, only restarting at the end, when the believability also flies out the window in favour of Hollywood action.Quaid is very good in this movie, an actor who I wish we really did see more of. The rest of the cast is an interesting ensemble from Curran to Kevork Malikyan, and it works well. I know that when I see a lone Scotsman in a movie it usually grates like hell with me, partly because they are usually played by Americans, but also because it just doesn't seem to fit, here it does because the entire cast is a mishmash of people. It really does feel like a group of remote oil workers.The plane designer, played by Giovanni Ribisi is a terrible character, slimy, loathsome, and someone that you would expect to be a serial killer. Ribisi plays him really well, and through the movie the tension is built in a series of near clashes between characters, until the final clash which turns into a satisfying climax for the character and the movie.Disappointingly the ending is very formulaic and makes all the Hollywood bells and buzzers flash and bleep, therefore making the Studios and their misinformed test screenings happy. Through the movie a band of vicious Nomads are mentioned, and a small clash occurs between some characters and a Nomad scouting party, but apart from this they are pretty much useless and are merely a very poor tension building device. This is surprising when the rest of the tension building moments are so much better formed.That said, there are some idiotic moments where you just cannot believe the characters and the decisions they are making, never mind some of the outcomes. My father was almost shouting at the screen in despair.All said it is an entertaining and effective movie, just suspend your disbelief concerning the reality of the situation after the crash, and grit your teeth through the Hollywood ending, and you've got yourself a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Good as the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the 1960's Flight of the Phoenix is very unsatisfying. The character development is not as rich as the the James Stewart version. Dennis Quaid simply did not portray the depth of emotion that James Stewart did in the original. Giovani Ribli was good as the model plane designer but again he didn't get enough scenes and Harvey Kruger's portrayal had a lot more edge. Also missing was the Richard Attenborough character who keeps the Phoenix project going. His role was combined in the characters of several of the cast in the remake.Now, I am not saying this is a bad film. I view it as a companion piece to the original. The special effects were awesome. Being trapped in the Gobi or Sahara (as in the original) was more meaningful to me when I saw the vast desolation of the desert in this remake. See the original Phoenix for its wonderful character study and see the remake for it's special effects and you have one fabulous picture. The original Phoenix stands on its own. My recommendation is see the original and then view the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No comparison to the original movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the original movie Hardy Kruger commented to Jimmy Stewart something to the effect that "the only thing outstanding about you is your stupidity". Interestingly enough in the remake, stupidity seems be the only thing that "outstanding".I have been on foreign oil drilling assignments and can guarantee you that you would never see a woman anywhere near a drill rig. As a matter of fact, the same thing applies in the US. Women just do not work as roughnecks. You do see women engineers and professionals, but never as workers.The remake is just plain lame and an excellent example of "corporate" creativity trying to milk a good story just one more time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic example of how NOT to do a remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have the greatest respect for producers and directors. Regardless of the quality of their work, they must struggle to bring their personal vision to film, and this requires intelligence, technical proficiency, artistic sense, and the skill of a great storyteller. So why do so many directors do remakes of classic movies that deliberately do away with the qualities that made the earlier version(s) as great as they are? Why not fiddle with the less important aspects of the movie? In the original "Flight of the Phoenix", there are several aspects of the film that are essential to the movie; the complete absence of women, the contrast of the claustrophobic setting of the crash site against the vastness of the desert, the lack of backstory for the characters, the revealing of the hidden hopes and fears of the characters through pure dialogue, and the total isolation of the men from outside influences (with the exception of the encounter with the Bedouins.) The 2004 version of the movie basically does away with all of these elements, and the result is not positive.The original movie was basically a stage play, with limited special effects and a setting that could easily be reproduced on a stage. I don't believe that John Moore improves the movie in any way other than the introduction of some brief, but impressive, special effects.I also have to point out that some of the reviewers have obviously never seen the original 1965 version, or, if they did, they paid little attention to it. One reviewer, for example, observes that the pilot, Frank Towns, has to be talked into leading the effort to rescue themselves, suggesting that this was somehow a new element in the story. Fans of the 1965 version will recall that this was a major plot element, wherein Towns did not wish to be responsible and did not believe that the effort to rebuild the plane would be successful.As many others have said, see the original first. Then, if you really want the 21st century special effects, see the 2004 version.Additional Comment: I just watched this again because a friend had not seen it. These people were the dumbest fools that ever got stranded anywhere. Not to mention that, aside from a minor touch of sunburn,they stay in miraculaously good shape without hats, sunscreen, or any other significant protection.** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the ashes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the more successful 1965 film of the same title was shown on cable recently. We were curious as to how the great screen play by Lukas Heller had been adapted by Scott Frank. The film, directed by John Moore, has taken the action from the Sahara to the Gobi desert. The result is a thriller that has some good moments, but in the end, doesn't improve in the better made earlier film.The scene for this new version takes us to a remote spot in Mongolia where a woman engineer, Kelly, and her crew, are evacuated because the company she works for decides there is no oil to be found in that remote spot. Next, we watch as an aircraft piloted by Frank Towns, arrives to take everybody to Shanghai, China. A mysterious man, Elliott, who doesn't have anything to do with the oil company, comes along for the flight to China.On the way, the plane suffers an accident caused by the terrible sand storm affecting the region. They land on the desert with only minor casualties. The aircraft seems to be out of commission, but Elliott, who tells the stranded passengers that the plane could be rebuilt, gets to act as the leader of the whole operation. In fact, he is an engineer who knows how to do it. Since they have the proper tools they begin to transform the wrecked cargo plane into something that resembles a toy model, which Elliott promises will fly. Little prepares us for what really turns out to be Elliott's real job.The film has some moments, but the direction doesn't take it anywhere. The cast does what it can with the material they have been given. Dennis Quaid, Giovanni Ribisi, are seen as Capt. Towns and Elliott. Miranda Otto, a good actress, plays Kelly, who didn't exist in the early version.Seen as a curiosity, it will entertain, but for a better take on the same subject, a look at the former version will be more satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An instantly forgettable - a film that rewards no one with renewed viewings. I got the impression no one cared about this film - certainly not the actors and all the tech stuff was thrown away . So how do you build a plane out of a crashed one ? That bit was skimped over but if so, where was the film's plot ? There was no love interest, no real threat (except at the end when the 'Nomads' lined up on a horizon in the way I think I have seen in many Westerns). Everyone phoned in a performance on this movie and it should have been scrapped on the runway.I trust everyone will be tempted to see the original 1965 film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So many flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do not waste your money. This remake is extremely flawed, and my child could have done a better editing job. For the first 10 minutes, I thought it was fantastic. But, once the plane wrecked and came to a complete stop, so did the movie. The other IMDb threads cover the flaws, so I won't repeat. Rcristia's entry contains just a sampling of the many annoyances and distractions.If I were forced at gunpoint to find something positive about the movie, it would be Giovanni Ribisi. Excellent, funny, worth a $1 video rental just to see him.On the other hand, Dennis Quaid, who I really enjoyed in Frequency, Far from Home, and The Rookie, sucked. Especially during the flight in the sand storm, when I would think a pilot would be at least a little apprehensive, he delivered his lines as though he were taking a leisurely Sunday drive in the country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A plane that was sent to go relieve workers on a site that wasn't yielding any benefit results crash lands in the desert on it's return trip. Slowly but surely each and everybody that was on the plane (those who survived anyway) begin to realise that this was some sort of sabotage mission and therefore begin to band together in order to survive. The ones who refuse to band together find themselves on the wrong side of the desert when they come face to face with tribal rebels which as you know can only result in war torn death battles. Giovanni Ribisi stars as a very frightful passenger who claims that he can redesign the plane (if the other passengers help build it) and get it flying again. It's amazing to see the scenes in which they struggle to keep the food supply and fight over every little drop of water that isn't accounted for. Dennis Quaid plays an angst ridden captain and Tyrese Gibson (in yet another riveting performance as an actor) plays his co-pilot. The most stunning scenes are however stolen by Ribisi who will have you at the edge of your seat with his eccentric and volatile behaviour. Give this man an Oscar already! He deserves it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second version of the Robert Aldrich's classic with spectacular crashing on the desert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture deals upon a varied bunch aboard airplane after locking-out an oil rig . The group is formed by an obstinate pilot (Dennis Quaid), a navigator pilot (Tyrese Gibson) and the passengers crew (Hugh Laurie, Miranda Otto , Jacob Vargas , Giovanni Rivisi..). The airplane crashes on desert of Mongolia (in first version was Sahara) and they must survive and hold numerous risks , odds , dangers , hardships and try to rebuild their aircraft from the wreckage in order to prevent the suffering caused for hostile elements : sandstorms , burn sun and Mongolian enemies. Misfortunes on desert atmosphere filling one with revulsion for the conditions in that unlucky are forced to exist stranded at uninhabited place : famine , warming , thirsty , bandits (in this adaptation have more importance than the first) and taking on themselves .Movie is a thoughtful change about the Hollywood screenplay of the plane that crashes in far countries as : ¨Alive : Miracle of the Andes¨ or ¨Airport¨ series . The film is based on Lukas Heller novel and screenwriter is the actor Edward Burns . It's an intelligent and dramatic movie developing the narration about the plane construction of riveting manner and with a semi-male star-studded , exception of the enticing Miranda Otto but in the original adaptation was totally masculine . Dennis Quaid acting as a stubborn pilot is nice although he doesn't reach to James Stewart who was greatest but he feels embittered considering himself guilty of the accident for his error . Tyrese Gibson as navigator is cool but in same role Richard Attemborough was better as a boozy alcoholic co-pilot . Giovanni Rivisi interpretation is first-rate but he copies the terrific playing by Hardy Kruger and imitates even the physical , bleaching the hair . Other secondary cast : Hugh Laurie , Jacob Vargas , Scott Campbell , Tony Curran , all of them are very fine . Sensational music score by Marco Beltrani. Motion picture was rightly directed by John Moore , though with no originality .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AT first look, you wouldn't think much of this movie. It is, after all, a remake, and remakes and sequels rarely do as good as the original-with the exception of Spiderman 2 and Shrek 2, and some others. But i think this movie did a fine job balancing the new actors in the same storyline. The story is about a group of oil drillers, who after their company is shut down, has to be flown out. En route, the plane encounters a storm and crashes in the desert-miles away from civilization. Giovanni Ribisi gives an awesome performance as Elliot, the passenger who has a plan to rebuild a new plane out of the wreckage of the old one, using only what they brought with them. Dennis Quiad also does a good job portraying Captain Towns, the pilot. His character is the one everyone looks to after the plane crashes, and although uneasy about everyone looking to him, manages to get them out safely. The twist in the movie is 40 yrs old, but when it is finally revealed in the film the actors do a great job reacting to it. Flight of the Phoenix did have some flaws, like the layout of the Gobi desert and the damage to the plane, but all in all i would give it a 7.5 out of 10. I would also recommend the original-just so you could see the background of how the movie was made in the past.</fullReview>

There is the crashed airplane midst in the desert with the passengers facing many obstacles to solve. This DVD invites you to spend a great and unforgettable moment with your home cinema and I will add it to my best of collection. The picture is superb and the story is perhaps very simply but the more interesting is how the passengers plan their survival. Then I liked very much Giovanni Ribisi that convinced me definitely. I don't remember every detail from the original one of 1965 but I think it seems to be more realistic than the new one. Why: in 1965 the special effects weren't so professional as in the last one. Please don't use too much CGI today and put therefore more original scenes in the story. Anyway, director John Moore succeeded again to create a good mix of action, adventure and special effects. My rating: 7/10. If you are interested in another survival movie don't miss the true story ALIVE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of "Flight of the Phoenix" was released at the end of 2004 and is a modern take on the 1965 film with Jimmy Stewart.THE PLOT: A group of mostly oil workers crash land in the Gobi Desert where being found by a search party is unlikely. One of the passengers turns out to be an airplane designer who insists that they can create a new plane with the workable parts of the wreckage. Although an outlandish idea, it may be their only legitimate chance at survival.The plot is exactly the same as the original version with a few notable differences: It takes place about 40 years later; it includes a woman (Miranda Otto); it features a more racially mixed cast; and it takes place in the Gobi Desert rather than the Libyan Desert (although it was shot in Namibia, while the original was filmed in the deserts of SE California).I'm not one of those people who hates the very idea of remakes. I'm open to filmmakers taking a heralded classic and modernizing it, like the excellent remake of "The Parent Trap." That's what we get with this remake of "Flight of the Phoenix," except that it's not excellent. But it's not bad either. Although there are some new touches that are as good or even superior to the original (Like Liddle's powerful line to Towns in the debris field, as well as the confrontation with the Mongols sequence), this modernization ultimately pales in the shadow of the original. Why? There's less focus on character development and therefore the movie has less interesting characters. Instead the filmmakers opt for scenes that might maintain the attention of those with ADHD, like an explosion scene, a lightning storm sequence and a dubious attack by the Mongol smugglers at the very end (shouldn't they have attacked while they were pulling the aircraft? Or earlier?). But the biggest negative is that the movie just lacks the brilliant dramatic flow of the original.The film runs 113 minutes.FINAL WORD: This would be a better film for anyone who hasn't seen the original, but if you've seen the '65 version it's just so mediocre by comparison. Still, it's worth checking out if, like me, you love survival films. And it is interesting to see a different take on the same basic story.GRADE: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of air crash survivors are stranded in the Mongolian desert with no chance of rescue. Facing a brutal environment, dwindling resources, and an attack by desert smugglers, they realize their only hope is doing the impossible...building a new plane from the wreckage of the old one.This film is good and bad. Most of the dialog is horrid and characters do stupid things making the body count go higher. However, the scenes where characters are killed off are actually tense and suspenseful. Who would know a film so bad with the characters have some really good scenes?I really didn't like the witty dialog to make the movie humorous. I really didn't like the stupid characters doing stupid things and we don't even care about them. But I do like the action scenes. There are so many situations in the film that makes the film tense and suspenseful.The acting by most of the cast are so-so to bad, although I liked Miranda Otto's performance. The special effects from the scene where the plane falls is fantastic!If you have seen the original, don't bother seeing this one because it's the same movie. For those who didn't, you can watch this but note the bad dialog and stupid characters. Watch this film with your brain turned off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed the first Phoenix. My flying friends (too young to have seen it) have enjoyed the second one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the movie. I was not able to catch it during the winter showing.I am trying to find out when it will be back (or if it will be back) on a re-run in the Des Moines, IA area or if it is scheduled for a cable TV showing.Does anyone have the info or a suggestion on where to find it? I'll appreciate your help.My special interest is that an old flying buddy was one of the half dozen amateur plane builders who journeyed to Oklahoma to build the Phoenix. They did not fly it but disassembled and shipped it to California. I saw the first "Phoenix", enjoyed it very much and still have good memories of it. I have friends (most too young to have seen the original) who feel the same way about this second "Phoenix". Keep in mind, my crowd are builders and fliers. They are adventurous and enjoy a good story. They thrive on those near impossible adventures. They are fault finders of technical things but they are not critics or reviewers. They enjoy yarns. They have many of their own. (Some are even true.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Great But Not Bad (for a Remake)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those audiences who have not seen the original (for whatever reason) I recommend the redux version. Despite its perceived shortcomings the film should appeal to them. Yes, this film is a modern version and adaptation replete with today's warped lingo. Nonetheless, director John Moore delivers a worthy product.And instead of panning his selection I applaud Dennis Quaid's inclusion. He's not Jimmy Stewart. No surprise there. Nevertheless Dennis does a darn good job in his rendition of the oft jaded Captain Frank Towns the pilot of ill-fated cargo plane. Although later he had some really weak even lame moments. One stand outs. It was his response to the female oil crew member's plea to search for a 'lost' companion.Initially stubborn and even oblivious to the plight of the oil rig crew, Quaid soon bends somewhat. He even shows some redemptive qualities. Ina sheepish voice, he replies."OK. I'll go."Still, Quaid provided a credible account of how a seasoned and journeyman pilot may have responded in a similar real life-or-death situation. For the most part, he did nothing.Fast forward...The real story and its rising star begins and ends with the appearance of 'Eliot', the aviation engineer (miniature as in models). Giovanni Ribisi takes control of the dire situation and the film. Moreover, he offers just enough contrast in his character to make the viewer wish to know more about him. then, forget the other cast members. Soon, they all rescind to the background as robots.And why not. Kaiser Eliot requests and then demands their complete obedience. Always mindful, he sets a lofty goal. His singular task and focus is to get the job done: build a 'new' Phoenix from the remains of the wreckage. Hey, it sounded good to me. If asked, I too would have jumped at the chance to help.More kudos...The cinematography was terrific. Especially satisfying was experiencing the wild, gut wrenching plane ride almost the moment after take-off. Minutes later the plane is caught in the fierce clutches of a monster Mongolian desert storm.There's no way out. Eliot, knows that too. After venturing to the cockpit, he bravely apprised Captain Towns."You're too heavy."What did Eliot earn for his sterling effort and sage advice? Towns, sternly rebuked him."Get back in your seat!"Thereafter, events got real interesting. First, the plane's radio antenna was sheared off...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exhibit A for not making remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the original, this is about plane crash survivors rebuilding their plane in the desert for a desperate escape plan.Like the original, the pilot has a conflict with the slide rule man who designs planes.Unlike the original, it is horribly written, horribly directed, and horribly acted.Three strikes, you're out.There just isn't anything going for this movie.First, it is horribly directed. We don't understand what is going on. The sound is so horrible, we can't understand what half the characters are saying, and surprisingly some of the minor character actors can enunciate, although few of the leads can.We are supposed to automatically know who everyone is, and what they're doing. This wouldn't be so bad, except the director indicates during the movie that we do know. Few things are more pathetic than having to explain your plot by having cronies in an audience do it for you. For example, the pilot walks after one man to bring him back (which was kind of silly in the original version, but at least explained by the fact that the first man had no water), and finds a dead man in a site visited by nomads, who is dead, and the man who walked off says he won a radio from him in a card game. No, it doesn't make any sense, you're right.Second, it is horribly acted. Quaid can't be blamed for lacking charisma, but he can be blamed for not being able to act. His cockpit lines sound like lines being read off a script. Very pathetic. In fact, all of the actors are very pathetic.But it isn't all their fault, because the third fault is horrible writing. These are all one dimensional stereotype characters we could care less about, and we even have the bigger cliché of the ones we care the least about being the survivors.I don't pan movies for being remakes, and try to be forgiving, but a remake should at least be as good as the original or offer something more. POSEIDON wasn't great, but it took some risks and tried a fresh approach. DESYAT NEGRITYAT was undeniably the greatest version of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, after at least 4 American movies of that title bombed out.However, too many remakes are simply pathetic. This is one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Movie is about a group of Oil well engineers who are stranded in the Gobi desert after the plane that came to evacuate them crashes. The movie is full of holes for those looking for them.But those who enjoy good acting this movie will bring some real surprise from almost all the actors. Giovanni Ribisi performs well as an arrogant engineer who is confident about his plane building capability even when he is exposed as a model (Toy) plane builder. I was also surprised by Hugh Laurie who performs as a "corporate man" who goes through various phases of confidence, dejection and courage. Tyrese Gibson as A.J, Miranda Otto as Kelly and Tony Curran as Rodney all did well.Scott Campbell as Liddle was another surprising performance. He comes forth as the key motivator who actually leads all by his exemplary actions. When Dennis Quaid as the Captain and pilot refuses to build the plane, he walks out into the desert to show his determination to "try" something and gives his memorable quote " All a man needs in this life is love. And if you can't give him that, give him something to hope for. And if you can't give him that then give him something to do." When Giovanni Ribisi insists everyone say "please" to him, and when everyone is shocked from his childish insistence, Liddle comes forth and says "Please".The movie is more about how people react in a dire situation and the director brings a host of different characters to live. I just saw this movie recently in video. And saw the previous review and was motivated to provide an alternative. Kudos to the filmmakers. By the way, this film never appeared in any theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mother has actually been recommending me to see this movie since it came out. These types of movies aren't usually my thing but since I found out that Jared Padalecki was in it and I am a fan I thought why not give it a try. I found a used copy and snatched it up. I have to say the movie is far from perfect and it seems like the screen writers didn't exactly do their homework (that's what fiction is for I guess). The movie was quite enjoyable. Dennis Quaide reminded me a bit too much of Indiana Jones and there was hardly any reason to have a woman in this movie other than political correctness. My largest complaint is the handling of the Davis character. Yes he is the naive young man of the group and he is hardly the star of this movie but his role is a bit unsettling to me. He is the first of the survivors to die... predictable but her is my overall problem with it. Okay he goes off to relieve himself in the middle of the night, during a storm no less, problem one was he extremely pee shy? How far did he have to walk? In the day they are in a valley of dunes so where was he in relation to the wreckage to have fallen down so far and get lost? I guess later on they show the "bathroom as being a little way off but it was a desert people, one huge litter box and he is a guy. I understand that he could have been pretty jarred by the fall and probably couldn't see well even with the lightning but if he was lost why couldn't he have just hunkered down and waited for morning? Am I missing something here? It seems as though he wasn't trapped in the sand storm till sometime the next morning so i doubt he died overnight. This brings me to my next problem. The survivors clearly waste their energy burying their dead earlier and then they waste more going off to find another lost one so why is it that after the storm was over didn't they even try to find the body? Most likely because they wouldn't have found it because of it being buried but still he couldn't have gotten that far. Which leaves me to my last issues... Why if they created markers for the others did they not for Davis? They knew he had to have been dead. The one guy seemed very heartbroken by his loss but yet they don't even mention him again the rest of the movie. Talk about disposable character. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I am just based but overall I still enjoyed the movie.</fullReview>

A place with no commercial air service? Any particular reason why or how he got there is never divulged in the movie. This is only the first of many glaring inconsistencies and nonsensical items in the movie. The only worthwhile bit in the whole flick was the plane crash, which is pretty spectacular.

		<fullReview>Dennis Quaid sure is in a lot of movies these days. It almost seems any movie that needs a solid actor but not at the Brad Pitt/Russell Crowe fee goes for Dennis.Flight Of The Phoenix is about a pilot (Quaid) sent in to pick up a team of workers (no name actors- they blew the budget on Dennis. OK maybe Giovani Ribisi) at a failed oil rig. On the flight home the plane is caught in a violent storm and crashes in the middle of the desert. The group agonises over what to do- to stay put and hope for help, to walk 100's of miles in the hope of finding help or something else. Eventually one of the group (Ribisi) suggests trying to make a new plane out of the old crashed plane. The team decides this is their only help. There's lots of obstacles that come in their way, making it even tougher for the gang. Will they make it? You'll have to see it to find out (or take a wild guess) It's not brilliant but held my attention. Sure, it got annoying at times but was better than expected when wifey pulled it off the video store shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1965 original is one of my all time favorite movies. It has great characterization, great story, great cast and is a testament to the power of understatement in film. Leave it to Hollywood to try to make an action pic out of a story that relies almost entirely on dramatic tension. This remake just plain sucks. Even without comparing it to the original, it sucks all by itself. The soundtrack is distracting and inappropriate and the acting wooden, (even from Giovanni Ribisi, normally a fine actor and one of my favorites) I don't believe in any of these characters and I don't really get to know any of them except Dennis Quaid as the inexplicably pissy Captain. The only marginally interesting character is the one who paints "phoenix" on the side of the plane. He has a few good lines and seems to be the only actor on set who isn't painfully aware that he's an actor on a set. It's as if everyone is reading their lines from cards and impatient to get out of the heat and back to their air conditioned trailers. The whole thing felt like the catering truck was always just out of frame.And, what was up with the plane repeatedly being dug out of the sand in one scene to the next? Especially toward the end when the whole thing was buried. One second it's under a ton of sand, then Quaid gives a little rah-rah speech, the next second they're dragging it across the flats. Engine cleaned and all? Very convenient and very crappy story-telling.I give this movie a high 2 rating only because of the cool CGI plane wreck. They should have just let it stay buried in the desert.</fullReview>

They build an entire plane that actually flies... in the middle of the desert... with no expertise apart from their little model airplane designer... right... If they can build a f****** plane then why cant they just fix the radio and call for help???Well those are the major things, I could go on and on, but quite frankly I'm just gonna stop here and try to forget that I ever even saw this movie...</fullReview>

Granted, I have never seen the original, so I can never make the comparison. Nevertheless, "Flight of the Phoenix" is still a very enjoyable film.After a devastating plane crash in the Mongolian desert, the survivors of the crash must band together to build a new plane from the wreckage. But with a limited amount of water and food, their time is slowly running out.Sure, the film is predictable, but the story kept me interested. Some of the effects in the opening scene of the sandstorm that brings the plane down, were awful. However, don't believe all the bad reviews here. If you liked previous disaster type flicks, I am sure you will enjoy this one.Definitely worth the rental, and because of this one, I will definitely be on the lookout to see the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Flight of the Phoenix (2004)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the TV series Lost made being stranded after a plane goes down hip, there was the Flight of the Phoenix. This is a modern remake of the 1965 original, and we follow a group of misfits who must play on one another's strength, and one man's ability to think out of the box, in order to make it out alive.Dennis Quaid plays cocky pilot Frank Towns, who together with his co-pilot AJ (played by Tyrese Gibson), are tasked to fly a group of oil-riggers out of their just-closed outpost in the Gobi desert. Led by a lady called Kelly (Miranda Otto), this group of men seemed close to that ensemble lined up in Armageddon.On a routine flight out of the desert, they encounter a humongous sandstorm, which Towns underestimates, and ended up with a broken plane in the middle of the desert. Well, you should know the rest, it's the usual distrust turned into camaraderie building opportunity, as the troupe gathers to build a new plane (hence called the Phoenix) by salvaging parts from the rubble. Sandstorms, electrical storms, and nasty nomads stand in their way, and it's kinda fun to see how our survivors overcome these challenges on their road to freedom.Perhaps what appealed to me was how this film was shot. My eyes were constantly glued at how it made the desert so enchantingly sexy. The special effects too were great, from the sandstorm, to the usage of effects to bring out the whole "what-ifs" scenario. Slow motion techniques were used sparingly, but nonetheless effectively.And I just got to raved about the music. You wouldn't think that Outkast's Hey Ya would make it to the film, but it did. But what takes the cake is the awesome use of Massive Attack's Angel during the entire scene when the group approaches a gang of nomads. Wow. I dig that song, and to witnessed it being used in that sequence, totally blows me away.Don't expect too much from the plot, as it's as simple as it can be, with of course, some plot holes thrown in. Questions like food and water will ring throughout the movie, but I suppose one can gloss over the fine details and accept that they had enough to tide them through.The Code 1 DVD contains deleted and extended scenes, and one almost 45 minute long making-of documentary titled the "Phoenix Diaries". It's one extremely detailed look at the making of the movie, without using too many footage from the final product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Flight of the Phoenix is a classic film for many good reasons. The people who have remade it in 2004 have mostly failed to understand those reasons and have made a disappointing movie where a very good one should have been easily within their grasp.My first complaint is the general dumbing down of the plot elements. The story line is pretty much intact, but the writers obviously are either stupid themselves or believe that the viewers are.Second, even while the story is dumbed down, the film makers have failed to present some basic points in ways that were clearly dealt with in the original. For example, the initial mysterious and unexplained shot of the starter cartridge for the motor, while an otherwise normal takeoff is performed (this would be a good time for them to explain how these old engines often needed to be started using modified shotgun style explosives), then later when the engine of the Phoenix is started, their use is not really made clear. People were leaving the theater asking what happened to the shotgun shells. How dumb of the film makers to screw things like this up so badly.Third, the disaster level is sensationalized to a point far beyond reason. A simple sand storm in the original was plenty effective, and suitably scary, to bring the plane down in the desert. Here, they have to whip up such a stupendous storm that you'd think the world was coming to an end. Also, the plane gets buried in sand twice; this is stupid because the work involved dwarfs the work of making a new plane (which should be the focus of the movie), and because when they dig the plane out they also seem to have dug out all of the surrounding desert as well. This is just god-awful stupid. And when the Phoenix is taking off, a character gets to crawl out on the tail to splice a broken cable (as if just getting it off the ground was not exciting enough), which would be pretty much impossible just down wind from the prop wash on a plane that is at take-off speed. Furthermore, piloting such a contraption should take all of a pilot's attention, but here everyone is high-fiving, goofing around and generally NOT PAYING ATTENTION the moment that the plane lifts off. Insanely stupid! What did they get right? Well, they obviously made a study of key plot points and made sure they had them in the new movie as well, even while they failed at everything else around. They got the interaction between the pilot and the designer right, the bit about special water usage, the alarming "one blast to clear out the cylinders", the point where the pilot has to concede that he is no longer in charge in order to keep the designer happy. The plane, both before and after the crash, look great.What else could they have done away with and simultaneously improved the movie? Well, the local bandits were a distraction; the original movie barely had the local Arabs, and it was not a major plot point. They could really have left out the jerkily (albeit currently trendy) missing-frame editing in the 'exciting' spots. And they could have certainly left out the distracting and irritating rock sound track (movie soundtracks are supposed to heighten the emotions or otherwise add something, NOT call attention to themselves). And having the plane fall into a canyon only to swoop out at high-Gs was another ill-conceived addition.My only hope is that people will go see this one, and in the course of doing so will hear that there is a much better version out there from 1965 IN WHICH THEY FLEW THE PHOENIX WITHOUT SPECIAL EFFECTS (OK, so it crashed later), then will rent or buy the excellent original and be re-introduced to a real classic.</fullReview>

The absolutely rubbish "songs" were even more inappropriate and intrusive. There wasn't one moment when I felt that the actors were remotely interested. The female part, thrown in as usual for politically correct reasons, was as excruciating as it gets. The manner in which the old plane was turned into the new plane was the equivalent of the "loaves and the fishes" topped only by the sudden transformation from the finished product being buried in the sand to being in pristine condition and lined up to fly very shortly afterwards. I've always believed in the magic of the movies but for sheer awfulness this travesty of a film takes the biscuit. It doesn't deserve even 1 but 0 is not allowed by the system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The characters and relationships in this film are dumbed down to fit today's standards of superficiality in adventure films, blunting the tension of the original and leaving little of its nuance. Quaid plays Frank Towns, a jaded pilot ferrying oil workers in his ratty cargo craft. Frank and co-pilot AJ (Tyrese Gibson) encounter a sandstorm so ridiculously monstrous.The plane's radio antenna is sheared off and the craft goes down hundreds of miles off course, leaving the survivors no way to call for help. Passenger Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi), an aircraft designer, initially draws Frank's scorn when he suggests they can build a new plane from the wreckage of the old and fly to safety. There are occasional moments of real kinship among members of the disparate group, but the overall dynamic shallowly flits from antagonism to camaraderie and back with jarring abruptness. One minute, they all hate each other, the next, they're devoted chums. As if surviving a crash, struggling to stay alive and constructing a new plane were not drama enough, the group is needlessly menaced by smugglers on horseback. These desert rats winds up a big distraction to the movie's climactic action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake That's Inferior To The Original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Survivors of a plane crash in the Mongolian desert work together to build a new plane.Look back at 1965, the original version of Flight Of The Phoenix came out, and it had a great lineup of stars like James Stewart, Peter Finch, Richard Attenborough, and Hardy Kruger, all who were absolutely superb. Fast-forward to 2004, and director John Moore takes the film and decides to remake it by tweaking it in a couple of spots and modernizing it. Basically, he decides to add what he likes most, some brief but obvious special effects and some plot elements that did not exist in the original. And what is the end result? Ultimately, we get a remake that is far inferior to the original. As somebody who saw and heavily enjoyed the 1965 film, I did try to give this remake a chance, but ultimately, it still was a fall from greatness. The movie basically does away with the idea claustrophobic setting of the desert and the revealing of the hidden personality traits of the characters, and on the whole, it feels less exciting and more as if they characters are attending some kind of summer school rather than trying to survive extreme conditions.The acting itself doesn't really have any redeeming moments. I do believe that Dennis Quaid is a good actor, but here, he was utterly wasted, as he sounded bored and like he didn't want to be here, he delivered as lines as if he was waking up to answer a phone call. The rest of the cast is basically the same, mostly because we don't see them much, such as Hugh Laurie, Giovanni Ribsi, and Tony Curran among others. The movie also tries to be politically correct by adding a female character (which the original was devoid of) into the plot. However, it didn't work, she came off as rather irrelevant and annoying. And not to mention that John Moore's directing wasn't good (well, this is the man who directed Max Payne, the remake of The Omen, and A Good Day To Die Hard, so it seems kind of natural)as he puts more into the concept than he does into the content.On a more positive note, I did think that the cinematography was good, and the music was good too, but unfortunately, those aren't enough to save the movie. Like I said, I did try to give this movie a chance, but it just didn't work out. Perhaps if I had seen this movie before I saw the original, perhaps I would have liked it. It's not one of the worst movies ever made, or even a bad movie for that matter, it's just a below average one that had potential to be good, but ultimately fell short due to inconsistent writing and directing.The bottom line, is that if you have seen the original, then you may want to think twice about watching this movie, as the original is the far superior film.

		<fullReview>If you're going to redo a great classic, Have some class and do it justice. This movie was a complete abortion from the minute the plane hit the ground. If you've never seen the original, just go watch that and throw this crap in the trash pile. The original is so good I don't know how it could be topped other than telling it exactly as the original and just add some good cinematography and effects maybe. I don't know why anyone would want to do a sub par version of an excellent classic. Delusional maybe??? I couldn't even finish watching it. Maybe that's because the original was so good I felt embarrassed for those that made this attempt and I'm sure they had a lot bigger budget than the original movie had. Whatever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why create a copy that is closely to the original?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well what can I say about this remake? On the positive side it had great music. However, it had none of the grittiness of the original. These people are fighting for their lives not attending some summer camp!!I do despair of remakes and this one is no exception although it does try to follow the original plot reasonably closely.Hollywood thickos (aka executives) there is a reason why films become classics! You wouldn't try to recreate a Beethoven concerto or a Rembrandt masterpiece so why think you can do it with film?This should not be interpreted as criticism of the actors and actress; their performances where great.Watch the original as well and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The phoenix has crashed again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flight Of The Phoenix stars Dennis Quaid, Giovanni Ribisi and Miranda Otto. It tells the story of a group of people who are stranded in the Mongolian desert after their plane crashes.Well the movie really started out realty fast so much so that we hardly know anything about the characters. Yes there were a few hints here and there but overall characters personalities were like a mystery to me. Also because of this we were not able to see any character development even in the main characters.If you want to see a group of people build a plane for over an hour or so then this movie is for you. There was hardly any conflict in this movie and whatever was presented was really dull. The filmmakers tried to add some elements of danger but they were just too far between and too little to save the movie.I also was did not like the story because it was largely very predictable. Even so I thought it could have been saved if by some chance at was presented in a different way to spice things up.Also I thought that most of the performances were ordinary. There was also the problem of there being way too many characters in the film, which frankly just clogged up the film.Overall this movie left a very sour taste in the mouth. The story was the main thing that brought it down and the performances were ordinary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX - I'm still waiting for it to show up on television - but when I saw this remake was on I decided to give it a go. I wish I hadn't bothered.The 2004 FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX is a dog of a film. It's as vapid, dull and uninteresting as the worst of Hollywood, an exercise in money-grubbing throughout, that never raises the tempo or provokes a moment's interest. Everything in the film is clichéd: the characters, the situation, the events that take place. It's all been done before; more than that, it's all been done better before.Dennis Quad is the belligerent pilot who crash lands his plane in the Gobi desert and who must lead a group of survivors in a battle against the elements. For some reason, there's a huge cast, most of whom get barely more than a minute or two on camera, which leaves them faceless and bland. Characterisation beyond stereotypes is zero, and the politically correct convention of throwing in a token female character (the unfortunate Miranda Otto) is irritating.The survival story lacks any kind of tension whatsoever; the characters never feel in any danger, or like they're a step or two away from death. The plane-building stuff is routine and boring, and even established actors like Hugh Laurie are given nothing to do. Giovanni Ribisi continues his tradition of playing exceptionally irritating characters, although he does get one decent twist involving his character. But the ending is pure hokum and the silly CGI effects spoil any attempts at credibility the film tries to muster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as other reviewers claim...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is based solely on the 2004 movie. I have never seen the original so there will be no comparison. I picked this film to watch largely for the cast - in particular Dennis Quaid and Hugh Laurie - and had no idea until after I watched the movie that it was a remake. While this is certainly not an Oscar contender, it's not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. It's a decent movie with solid performances by the cast. No, there's nothing original about this film, but then again, when was the last time anyone made a truly original movie? My suggestion: if you've never seen the original, watch this one first - since it is apparently the lesser movie. If you have seen the original, then watch this movie for its own merits and try not to do a comparison with the original film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the movies on Christmas Eve feeling a little blue. However,I was pleasantly surprised by Flight of the Phoenix. I really enjoyed the film. No need to over analyze and pick away at every detail and flaw of the film. Yes, there are some flaws. However, overall I really liked the special effects, the individualized characters and I also liked the fact that I was kept guessing about which characters were going to die and which were going to live. I haven't seen the original Flight of the Phoenix yet but this Flight is for a now generation. Bottom line is I left the movie highly entertained and feeling good. My friends also enjoyed the film. This film really deserves to be reviewed on its own and stop comparing it to the original. Everyone knows the original is always better. Give this Flight of the Phoenix a chance!</fullReview>

The story progresses rapidly - from the take off of the plane to the crash scene, to the rebuilding of the plane to the struggles between the men and harsh elements of the desert and the interplay between various characters to the successful take off of the Phenoix and those survived return to home safely. Dennis Quaid is one of the greatest actors ever, his constant high standard of performance makes this movie on track and on point.

Who was that guy wearing the eye patch and why was he wearing it? He's the one who should have gotten killed! Why was music and dancing imported? What happened to MEANING? Other than that, I saw some interesting new tricks. In addition, the slight actor with dyed blonde hair (Italian name) is such a wonderful actor. I've seen him before in The Gift.

		<shortDescription>Remake perfection!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the original Flight of The Phoenix yet but I will. Nonetheless I waited in great anticipation to see this one and I was not disappointed in any way whatsoever. The film is a great action, survival drama and I think it'll last the test of time as a great action flick.Flight of The Phoenix is a film about a group of oil drillers in Mongolia who are being shut down by their company due to the lack of oil. Frank Towns is "shut down Towns" who is hired to fly out to the oil field, shut them down and bring them all back. Upon their return Towns attempts to fly over a vicious sand storm over the Mongolian desert which instead grounds the plane, rips it apart and strands the survivors in the desert with little hope of rescue. One of the passengers, a drifter named Elliot announces that he can design and build a new plane from the wreck of the old plane. Despite resistance initially the team pulls together to fly themselves home.One of the most intriguing parts of this film is out of it's two hour length, literally 99% of it takes place in one setting...seemingly the most dullest setting you could have...a desert. There is nothing but sand, and the wreckage which means this film is carried purely on the talent of the cast and characters and they all pull it off perfectly. The crew of the oil well and the team sent to retrieve them don't get along, they aren't friends, they aren't an easy to pull together team. In fact they clash constantly but eventually realizing they must pull together in order to survive. Dennis Quaid in the lead role is the star power that drives the film. He's rugged, and tough, and outspoken and the man looks amazing for being over 50!! He's a great actor and holds together the cast. The supporting cast despite not having a lot of personal screen time do a great job of supporting each other's performances and driving the film forward. In essence this would be an incredibly difficult film to do with such little setting and story. It really relies on their survival. One of the greatest performances of the film is Giovanni Ribisi who I have never been a fan of despite his wide variety of roles. His role as the eccentric Elliot is definitely the highlight of this film. He's creepy, and not likable but necessary for the survival of the whole crew. He performance is just amazing. Together the cast and direction made this film heart stopping, and a great watch. The cast looked weathered and sick which you would be stranded in the desert. Any one who is a fan of good thriller should check this film out!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those typical movies that is predictable in many ways and everything that occurs doesn't come as a real surprise. You know how this movie is going to end (especially when you have already seen the original of course) before you even start watching the movie. All of this however doesn't really matter and it's no complaint, for "Flight of the Phoenix" is well made, fun entertainment.Of course the movie doesn't come close to the original from 1965 with James Stewart, Richard Attenborough, Hardy Krüger and George Kennedy. But then again, this movie doesn't try to surpass the original. Instead it simply uses the ingredients and concept of the original to make a fun and entertaining movie with, by modern 2004 standards. It's a movie made without much ambition or potential, it's just made for the simple reason to give us the viewers, a fun 113 minutes. The movie is pretty well made and it has a good action movie style all over it. The special effects are great and so is the sound. There are some spectacular and well made sequences in the movie, of which the plane crash itself is of course one of the highlights. It's like a long, never ending action sequence in which a lot is happening and everything looks quite impressive and spectacular. It's a well constructed action sequence that on its own is reason enough who this movie is a watchable one. The editing is a bit lacking at times and some of the techniques used are just plain weird. Luckily the musical score by the underrated action-score composer Marco Beltrami is quite good one, on the other hand.There are some well known names in the movie and they all do their job well. Nothing really spectacular going on acting-wise but the actors are good enough to give the shallow, underdeveloped characters still a humane face and a more overall realistic feeling. Giovanni Ribisi was perhaps the only actor that really truly surprised me. This is a sort of role we haven't really seen him in and he did an amazing job and he really deserves credit for his performance.Will people still remember this movie in 10 years from now? Probably not. Will people still enjoy watching this movie in 10 years? Most definitely!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>....see the original (1965). Jimmy Stewart or Dennis Quaid? No contest, Jimmy acts and Dennis...well...acts too much. I would have a harder time picking an "Elvis".This re-make does try to stay faithful to the original story. It has appropriate changes in story where needed because of their respective time frames. For example,instead of the Sahara, this time it's the Gobi desert.Bottom line.....if your demographic is young, go for this newer version for the ???special??? effects, but with cheaper acting. If your demo is such as mine, an older one, choose to view the Jimmy Stewart version. Oh, and by the way, a skinny Elvis. Peace out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flight of the Phoenix (2004)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night and thought that it was just so-so. Coincidently, the 1965 original version of this movie was running in marathon mode on TV all day long so, I had this impression fresh in my mind when viewing the 2004 "remake". However, calling this movie a remake of the 1965 film would be like calling Gilligan's Island a remake of "Robinson and Caruso".Although I'm an old-timer, I'm not the type of person who thinks that "Nobody makes movies the way they used to". However, in this case, that is exactly how I feel. Flight of the Phoenix (2004) is visually slick at times, but is critically flawed in how it handles the theme of the original movie, including the critical points of the 1965 movie that heightened the drama of the crew's plight of being marooned in the desert. As an example, when it was revealed that the "plane designer" built model planes instead of "the real thing", it passed through the movie like "beep" through a duck. In the 1965 film, John Gielgud (?) gave the performance of his life and his maniacal laughter stills creeps me out every time I hear it (bwaaahhaaa...bwaahhhhaaaaa..bwwwwwwaaaahhhahahahaa!!!!!) :) The other thing that ticked me off was the "Top Gun" sequence where the "marooned crew" is blasting the radio and boogieing down in the Gobi desert. I half expected to see a volley ball net come out and hear a Kenny Loggins tune in the background. Also, every so often, the plane would be covered in sand one scene and then standing on a runway completely clear of mounded sand the next. C'mon.The acting was okay,but no one can replace the quality of actors in the original movie. Earnest Borgnine losing his mind? Where was this portrayal? Jimmie Stewart? Hello? See the movie and appreciate the special effects and then go see the original movie for the acting and the drama the way it was meant to be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you need a lift after watching the excellent yet rip your heart out epic "Ladder 49", check this out! It's a better remake than even 2003's "The In-Laws", because not only is it more upbeat and hip, the new cast of characters in this remake avoids the pitfall of the annoying obnoxiousness that sinks some of the characters in the "In Laws" remake (chiefly the friends of the bride. Ack!) Yes, Dennis Quaid might not be Jimmy Stewart, but he is more than capable as an actor, and the way this remake is scripted makes him perfect for the role Jimmy played, Captain Frank Towns, since Towns is a tougher guy in this version than in the original. Ditto the rest of the cast, especially good IL' Giovanni Ribisi as the plane designer. It is more action/adventure oriented than the original, which was more a character study in a hostile environment, which is a good change, considering the current taste for action/adventure that propelled flicks like the last two "Matrix" movies to beau coup dollars-ville. At the same time, the characters are likable and sketched out enough that we like and root for them. Most memorable moment in this "Flight": the climax! Man, what a RUSH... All in all, if you rent "Ladder 49", be sure to pick this up too and watch it after "49" to perk yourself up. Heck, pick this flick up anyway. IT ROCKS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failed to Deliver to Such Great Possibilities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** Based solely on its own merits; meaning that I am discounting the fact that it is a remake and viewing it on its own plot, story, characters and direction; This movie was awful. The premise began well, alongside interesting film work involving great shutter and simple fast flash effects, the movie stood to be interesting. The characters were all introduced well and most showed promise for future plot. Sadly, it all ended there. The characters remained vacant with plenty of time for actual development. Also, a female lead was prodded into the realm of a Quaid love interest, but just as most things did in this movie, it died before the development phase began. While I am a fan of Giovanni Ribisi, his character was overwritten and overplayed as a stereotypical uber-geek which would have been acceptable if more history had been plugged into the role. He just wandered onto the oil site on vacation? It makes little sense as the place is in the middle of a massive dessert. This point also leads to the so called "Amazing Plot Twist." He doesn't design planes, he designs SCALE PLANES!!! Oh good god, all hope was lost. That was barely a twist, it wasn't even a waltz. Then the final insult to injury, this movie goes from a possible psychological thriller (pitting minds against one another in a struggle for survival) to a pitiful action film with the lack of character and conflict development and the addition of the conflict with the Mongolian Nomads. All this side of the story served was for added pressure to get the plane off the ground, as if there wasn't enough with the looming dehydration that was heavily played through the entire story. All in all, this movie fails to stand up to its potential. Weak acting for most of the cast. Poor character development. Unneeded villain additions. An unimpressive plot "twist." I give this movie a 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Remake, Watch The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flight of the Phoenix is a boring and predictable film and as a remake its far from the original in terms of quality. The crash of an airplane in the Mongolian desert forces the captain (Dennis Quaid) and his passengers?a crew of laid-off oil workers--to band together behind a mysterious stranger (Giovanni Ribisi) to rebuild a new plane out of the parts from the wreck while fighting off sandstorms and desert smugglers. The plot sounds okay and with a decent cast this could have been a decent movie. Unfortunately they take a classic film and ruin it. The original had a lot of suspense and entertaining moments, but the remake is very predictable and has little to no entertaining scenes. The dialog is lame and the action is okay but nothing special. If you have seen the trailer then you have seen the film as they spoil the ending for you and pretty much everything else. The acting isn't that good either as Dennis Quaids performance is pretty lifeless. The characters are all boring as they are no interesting people and I started not to care about them. The ending is ridiculous and it also leaves a few unanswered questions. The direction is okay but the film is still pretty bad. Rating 3/10, there's very little reason to see this film and I recommend you skip this and rent the original.</fullReview>

(Tyrese Gibson) are flying Kelly Johnson (Miranda Otto), her crew and the equipment back to Beijing. Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi) is a mysterious stranger who catches a ride. The plane crashes in a sand storm. Men die and supplies dwindle. There's no way to walk out. There is unlikely to be any search parties. Aircraft designer Elliot has an idea to build a new aircraft out of the wreckage but Towns opposes it.It's a remake of the 1965 movie. The premise has always been a bit ridiculous. The problem is that it's played for real. The unlikely scenario keeps diminishing the excitement. There are a few good actors and there is a bit of good tension among the group. I don't like Gibson and a little conflicted about Ribisi. The movie is generally forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Flight of the Phoenix" is a 1964 novel, based on an incredible true story of survivors of a plane crash in the middle of the desert. If there was any way to do the book justice when attempting to make a movie out of it, it was in 1965 and starred James Stewart and Richard Attenborough. The film was a flop, yet has gone on to receive a large cult following.I like the overall look of the new film, but sadly this remake doesn't deliver anything decent enough via. acting or the tension that made the original so well loved. Dennis Quaid and Giovanni Ribisi are decent choices, but both are just a stone throw away from descending into awfulness themselves .

By the time we see the remake we are not the same person any more. The crash was clearly more dramatic this time. On the other hand, you just didn't feel that they are really suffering. It looked too much like a stage. The shear magnitude of the job was also not fully communicated. How did they attach the side landing gears? How they did they attach the wing? How did they scoop up the whole plane out of the sand? I haven't seen the original in ages so I don't remember how it was done back then either. One question I have for future readers here is which parts of the movie were computer generated and which were real? Did a real plane actually roll, if not fly?</fullReview>

The characters are not believable. The drama was way to scripted. I understand that it is a movie, but good ones take you out of the "I know what's going to happen" mindset for at least a few brief moments. Everything that happened could have easily been predicted without knowing beforehand.The most unpredictable thing that happened was the fact that the plane flew. No, I knew it was going to fly, but how they were going to do it was the unpredictable part: laying down and holding onto bars? Yeah, OK... I'd like to see anyone try that on any airplane without losing their grip at SOME point.In all truth, I enjoyed it, but it was so mediocre that I will soon forget about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoenix rising from the hashes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the classic 1965 Robert Aldrich film of the same name, John Moore directs this FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX with a slick, severe spank, yet fails to conjure the tension and desperation of the original. We can pinpoint the exact moment it fails: OutKast - "Hey Ya!" Yes, *that* "Hey Ya!" - that song you can never get out of your head once you hear it. In the middle of the Gobi Desert, while their lives hang in the balance, the full crew of a downed airplane get jiggy with a radio broadcast of "Hey Ya!" It sounds ridiculous on paper - and reads twice as ridiculous on film.Not that there's anything wrong with the song, but it's the only piece of source music amongst the otherwise tension-soaked soundtrack; inserted at a point where the marooned passengers unite psychologically as - heh heh - outcasts (Ohhh, I get it! These filmmakers are so clever-clever!). And the marooned strangers from all walks of life collectively shake their moneymakers and laugh and joke and dance and hammer in unison like the Seven Dwarfs and I feel dirty even describing it.And this sequence takes us so far out of the movie that it makes this phoenix look like a dodo.Other than that singular out-of-body moment, Lukas Heller's original storyline is intact, of the clutch of motley characters crash-landing in a desert (Gobi instead of Sahara) and rebuilding their plane to escape, under the tyrannical auspice of one of the passengers who claims to be an aircraft designer. Also retained is the mighty climactic twist of exactly what type of aircraft designer he is... Which means that all the good aspects of the movie are someone else's ideas. This PHOENIX has exemplary production values, so all they had to do was Not Add Dumb Stuff. Or OutKast. Guess everyone didn't get that memo. Dennis Quaid is Captain Towns, the rugged all-American pilot; Tyrese Gibson, his first mate; their passengers are a group of oil-riggers and civilians from an oil rig shut down by corporate decree. Miranda Otto (RETURN OF THE KING) is a bit too slight of frame and feminine of nature to be believable as the chief rigger (obvious she is on this flight to pander to Equal Opportunity Casting); Jacob Vargas represents the Mexican contingent; there's the Irish guy (Scott Michael Campbell), the gangsta (Sticky Fingaz), the Middle Eastern guy (Kevork Malikyan, pandering to that new demographic that rose to prominence after 9/11) and even the Corporate peacock (Hugh Laurie) who understands Middle Eastern languages and golf.And Giovanni Ribisi creates the most memorable character in Elliott the ambiguously-Euro "aircraft designer," with his overbearing principles, pragmatic nerdism and ducky voice. It's the best performance of the film. Every time he says, "Captain Towns" in that adenoidal bleat I'm laughing. His alpha struggle with Quaid is the sole reason this movie has any legs.Isn't Mirando Otto just a little too slim and milky-white to be here without being gang-raped? I mean, what more excuse are you guys waiting for? In the 1965 PHOENIX, James Stewart's crew experienced psychological and physical hell to build their escape vehicle. Apparently that's not enough in 2004, where the unnecessary drama of crazy Mongols has to be added, with a silly ticking clock chase sequence to put a Hollywood cherry on top of the climactic takeoff. Pandering to the demographic that needs all that superfluous silliness, there are explosions and a gun fight (and I'm sure there would have been a polar bear battle if idiot execs had their way), and when Fingaz wants to attempt walking across the desert, the crew describe the terrible things that could happen to him and show us the fantasy visuals like some kind of '80's music video. Have they forgotten we viewers have an imagination? Ducky Ribisi maintains, in that adenoidal whine, "My plane will fly! My plane will fly!" This movie won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film; nothing special but well worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is definitely 'good' - there aren't really any major things wrong with it other than the usual; "that's not believable" or "that's not what normal people do in that situation".Having said that, there are a couple of satisfying moments where people do take the action you want them to take.The opening scene of the crash (no spoilers as that is given in every tag line for the film!) is simply superb. I have honestly never seen a more realistic plane crash on film and I have seen a shocking amount of films.Some reviews have commented on the lack of action... well... they crashed in a desert... it's not as though there are going to be car chases and helicopter shoot-outs! Despite the surroundings, the story moves along at a good pace and there are some nice surprises.It is pointless being annoyed at the script / ending as this is a remake and does exactly what the original did.Overall, a good film and worth watching.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second Rate Remake Of First Rate Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Flight of the Phoenix suffers from a common remake problem ? the writer, producer and director just don't understand what made the original so successful. First, the original had Jimmy Stewart, and there are few, if any, current actors up to this level. Second, the original played on the popular post-war stereotype of Germans, as brilliant, logical, but flawed by an complete absence of empathy and humanity. The audience knew everything there was to know about Hardy Kruger the moment he opened his mouth and out came the German accent. But that German stereotype is long gone in popular culture Third, movie screwed up the key scene. The entire story hangs on the moment when Dorfman makes the big revelation about his background. In the original, it is clear that Dorfman, the logical German with no sense of humanity, never attempted to hide anything and that he was surprised at the reaction. Big or small, it was all the same to him. In the remake, it is clear that Dorfman/Elliot was hiding and ashamed, or at least defensive, about his background. The revelation lacks all the power of the original because it doesn't have the German stereotype for support. They try to compensate by having Dorfman/Elliot usually appear in alone shots, but it misses the point. It's not that Dorfman/Elliot is different or an outside. It's that he's German. The people who made this movie just didn't get it. To make matters worse, Giovanni Ribisi was just terrible in the Hardy Kruger role. He should stick with "My Name Is Earl." The other problem is the annoyingly predictable and calculating political correcting of the original. Where we had the extraordinary supporting all-star cast of Hardy Krüger, Peter Finch, Ernest Borgnine, George Kennedy, Dan Duryea, Ronald Fraser, and Ian Bannen, the remake has second rate bodies whose main virtue is falling in the proper demographic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Stewart was and is my favorite male film star and back in 1966 I saw his version Of The Flight Of The Phoenix, done no doubt because of Jimmy's love for aviation. It had a wonderful cast, great special effects and an absolutely ridiculous story line. There ain't no way those guys could have built an aircraft out of the wreckage of downed cargo plane that could have flown out of the Sahara Desert no matter how good a designer Hardy Kruger was back in that film.Well I submit the same premise goes here in this version of Flight Of The Phoenix with Dennis Quaid as the veteran pilot and young Giovanni Ribisi as the aircraft designer. It's a little different dynamic here whereas Kruger was a hateful efficient German, it's more a generational conflict between Ribisi and not just Quaid, but the rest of the crew and passengers who are now stranded in the Gobi Desert. He's a kid raised on computers and video games and just thinks he knows it all.The situations are the same and if you have seen the first film you know what's going to happen here. As befits the changing times the passengers and crew have more minority representation here. There's even a woman on board in the person of Australian actress Miranda Otto. You know they're in trouble because she does not get anything even remotely resembling a pass as she and the rest work on Ribisi's project.Hugh Laurie, later television's Dr. House, may have auditioned for the part from this film playing a very full of himself oil company executive and efficiency expert. As is rudely pointed out to him, the company has done a cost/benefit analysis like he does and have probably calculated against the odds for their survival, so help is not forthcoming.If you liked the first Phoenix movie, you'll like this one. But I could never wrap my mind around the premise then or now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore's adventure film about a an oil field staff who get picked up by a plane because they are shutting down and losing their jobs and their encounter with the daring pilot of the aircraft (Quaid) is both entertaining and not as bad as some will tell you. I found the cast and overall atmosphere of this movie very good, i liked it more than adventure crap like Anaconda. Here the dialogues are funny, and characters are likable. The performances were pretty good, Ribisi was a bit over-the-top, but pulled it off nonetheless and Otto, Malikyan and Quaid were good as well. I'm not a big fan of Tyrese Gibson (2 fast 2 furious and Baby were bad performances from him), but he was tolerable here. I prefer this film to some Michael Bay Action or other senseless adventure flicks. IMDb rating: 6.0 my rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only disappointing thing about this film is that cast didn't crash and die in the first ten minutes. Actually, the first ten minutes of model &amp; CGI shots is the only bit of the film worth watching. The Editing has that irritating modern day passion for lots of inserted cut-aways of slo/fast bullet motion around characters and the direction is rather plodding. The script dialogue is dreadful - the lone scene with Quaid and the character that he has been sent to find looks like it was written by a Kindergarten child. "It's not about whether we get out her or not; it's about having a dream" - oh Please! The characters are never fully developed - or developed at all.. Hugh Laurie, at least doesn't disgrace himself, but the rest are just cardboard cutouts and you really don't care what happens to any of them. There's no tension or drama and to be honest, it's almost embarrassing. Why did they bother to murder the original 1965 film? OK, if you've rented it, then I'd have to say it's not a dreadful film, it is watchable, but its not something that will be remembered.Check out the original 1965 Jimmy Stewart version - it is far superior.</fullReview>

Certainly, the special effects are greater than the original and the script is about the same, but here comes again another question: why they have changed also the place where it happened ?

The party 60s music is inappropriate, the out of sync flashbacks confusing, and the character development has gaping holes. And when will all this computer animation cease? It doesn't look real. The ending is straight out of Indiana Jones, whereas the original is more exciting by playing up the real human drama of the situation. Even the Four Weddings and a Funeral pictures at the end seemed to lack sincerity and grit. I think the problem is mostly with the directing and producing.

It was very educational because they tell you how to survive in a desert and things that you shouldn't do. It was fascinating and excited like I didn't know what going to happened. It teaches you a lot about the characters. I didn't really get the part when the one of the guys woke up in the middle of the night. I didn't really get that part. But the rest of the movie was good. It had some fantastic photos but I saw the desert storm looked fake but it will be really hard to capture a real one. My opinion is that I recommend this movie to people who like adventure and action. I recommended this movie to people who like disasters like tornadoes, storms, hurricane and etc. And People who is interested into deserts. I give 7/10 and I think it is a tremendous and very good desert movie. It taught me a lot. I love the characters in the movie because most of them were serious and mostly good actors like Dennis Quiad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not one of those snobby reviewers who will automatically dismiss a remake as inferior to an original. In rare cases I actually like a remake over the original. I honestly preferred The Birdcage over La Cage aux Folles and consider the new True Grit a superior example of movie-making when evaluated alongside the John Wayne original. Sadly, this new version of Flight of the Phoenix is in pitiful territory. It is a shallow and all too typical Hollywood flick falling far short when compared to the Robert Aldrich Oscar nominated original. For the life of me I cannot figure out why it was even made. Was 20th Century Fox really that desperate for money? So.... My advice is, don't bother with this poser of a movie. It is chock full of Hollywood silliness and strained dialogue. Instead get the original 1965 version and watch great actors like Jimmy Stewart, Richard Attenborugh, Peter Finch, Ernest Borgnine and George Kennedy embark on a journey of great story telling.

		<fullReview>An unnecessary remake with an implausible plot, Flight of the Phoenix is, nevertheless, a reasonably effective adventure movie. With a likable cast, some incredible special effects, terrific cinematography and a great soundtrack, there is just about enough good stuff in this film to make it worth a viewing, so long as you don't worry too much about the lack of logic or compare it too much with the original.Dennis Quaid plays Frank Towns, the captain of an aircraft downed in the middle of the Gobi desert. With no radio and a limited supply of food and water, the survivors decide that their only chance of survival is to use the wreckage to build a new plane, and fly their way out.Without a doubt, the best part of the film is the incredible crash scene, which is visually stunning and alone makes the film worth giving a go. The pace of the film then slows quite a bit, but director John Moore just about holds things together until the inevitable uplifting climax.And when things do start to crawl, there is always enough beautiful imagery to keep one glued to the screen: with its shifting golden dunes, the desert looks absolutely stunning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie makers used artistic license</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several things must be said here, the most important being the artistic thought processes of telling a story on the screen. It has been said Flight of the Phoenix has reality flaws, engineering flaws, and (the most "interesting" one) characterization flaws.This movie is based on a novel - a work of fiction. The fun thing about writing, producing, directing, and acting out a film like this is that you can "bend the rules" a bit to tell your story - otherwise known as using artistic license. Many critics don't seem to understand what that means.A sandstorm of the magnitude that was depicted in the film would have definitely brought the plane down, smashing it into tiny pieces. That is a fact of reality. However, if you stuck with this then you'd have no movie. The film would be over, because all the characters would be dead. Therefore, the filmmakers chose to (very well) crash the plane dramtically and have most of the passengers survive. Speaking of the sandstorm, yes, it was huge, and yes, it was computer-generated, and no, I did not even think about that when I watched the movie. All I could do was get sucked into the action and story, watching this tiny plane get sucked down by this bigger-than-life force of nature.Building a new plane out of a wrecked one is certainly a far-fetched idea, and from an engineering standpoint is ridiculous. That's the hook that gets you into the story, you see. It's the whole "They can't do that, can they" thing that keeps suspense, along with their struggles with surviving with each other and with limited food and water. These are good things that make for a stress-filled (in a good way) film.The acting in this film isn't Oscar-winning, but it is real - real characters put together in an unbelievable situation. The struggle with the characters, as well as with a lot of the rest of the film, I think, comes when people who have seen the Jimmy Stewart version try to compare it, as if the new filmmakers were going to do a shot-by-shot, line-by-line recreation. No, this film is a re-interpretation of the story, and Dennis Quaid is NOT James Stewart. All of the characters have been reinterpreted, each actor giving a new, personal spin on the story. It's a different pilot, a different engineer, and a different passenger list. Some names might stay the same, but that's about it. The screenwriters chose, out of their rights as artists, to rework and update an old story, and they did quite well.I have not seen the 1965 Phoenix, as I'm sure most of the contemporary movie-going public has not, so there's nothing for me to "compare" the new film to. The movie makers succeeded in what they set out to do - bring the story of the Flight of the Phoenix to a new generation of film audiences. The problems only come if you try to compare it to the old one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not even Jimmy Stewart could have saved this one.In the original, I cheered when the phoenix took flight and all were saved. In this one, I cheered when it took flight, as I knew the movie would soon be over. It had an unbelievably cheesy script. What a waste of time and effort to make this poor remake and what a waste of time and effort to watch it. This film was unbelievably choppy in the flow and the development. Dennis Quaid flies into a sandstorm, which results in the crash. After they crash, one of the passengers thanks him for landing the plane in such dire conditions. Think about it. If he hadn't flown into the sandstorm. they wouldn't have crashed in the first place. In another scene, when they have finally finished rebuilding the plane, a sandstorm comes in and covers it. "How will we ever get it out" is the next line delivered. Yet in the next scene, all are pulling the plane to a takeoff point. Great editing. This silly logic and choppy flow abounds in this screenplay. Who wrote it? Ms. Smith's 4th grade class? No, I'm sorry. That comment wasn't fair to Ms. Smith. Her class would have written a more plausible script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The skeletal structure of the original screenplay is so sturdy that it survives even this expensive, and ultimately inferior remake. The movie occupies some gibbous position between the usual trashy action movies of today and the quality of the more thoughtful 1964 version.If you have seen ANY of the remakes of older movies you don't really need much detail about exactly how the original has been revamped. There is, first of all, more action. There is, second of all, quicker cutting so that the kids who have been weaned on MTV aren't bored by passages in which nothing but conversation takes place. There is, thirdly, more money and computer graphics on display. And, last, somewhere, somehow, some way -- there must be an exploding fireball and a slow-motion death.I will give one example of what I mean. In the original, a small group of Arabs have camped on the other side of a hill and there is a discussion about whether the nomads can be trusted enough to be contacted and asked for help. A British officer and another man volunteer. They walk over the hill. The next day, the nomads are gone and the two visitors are found with their throats cut.In this movie, on the other hand, three men go down to the Mongolian nomads (this is the Gobi desert), followed by the pilot (Dennis Quaid) who is armed. After a brief exchange one of the nomads whips out a pistol and shoots one of the visitors, who does a back flip in slow motion. Quaid rushes out from behind a rock and pops off two or three other Mongolians, one of whom is shot only after spraying a submachine gun towards Quaid and missing. Another Mongolian escapes on horseback, so that he can get the rest of his clan together and we can all sit back and anticipate another attack.Quaid is okay, as usual, but none of the other performers are more than competent, and the script does not differentiate them well enough. In the original, Hardy Kruger as the airplane designer was much more interesting -- quiet, slow, deliberate, sensitive. When his proposition to rebuild the wrecked airplane is ridiculed he trudges off sourly and broods alone in a snit, like Achilles among the women. The airplane designer in this movie is not a German technological wizard but a wimpy nerd. He reveals his expertise far too early. The covert conflict in the original is here revealed and shouted out -- who's in charge, the old pilot or the egghead? (The grizzled and older Jimmy Stewart incorporated the role better than the younger Quaid.) The two shout at one another like school kids. "I'm in charge!" "No, I'M in charge!" Of course this one is updated. Like the other remakes it must include one or two blacks, Mexicans, and/or women. I'm not complaining. In fact I'm on my knees thanking Thespia that this was not a passenger airplane so we are spared the sick kid who needs the operation on her kidneys or her eyeballs. And the singing nun.Not that the original was a masterpiece. Like so many of the director's works it was an effective story laid out in straightforward fashion. But, well, the ACTORS were better in the original. Nobody here is the equal of, say, Ian Bannon. And the music wasn't shoved down your throat as it is here. (In the middle of a desperate attempt to put the airplane together, somebody turns on a boom box, a loud rock tune blossoms, and everybody stops working and begins to laugh and bop as if they were at a drunken picnic. Why? I don't know. Maybe the kids were getting bored.) I guess the main difference is that the original was more believable. It seemed as if it could really have happened. This one looks exactly like what you'd expect an action movie to look like. If you haven't seen the original, this one is entertaining enough. But I don't see how this movie can be assessed on its own. It IS, after all, a remake and carries the same title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the original.................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My advice (before I start my review of this movie) to anyone wishing to watch an adaptation of 'Flight Of The Pheonix' is to avoid the 2005 remake. The main problem with reviewing this film is that it must be done as a comparison to the original. The original adaptation of the book was made in 1965, was directed by Robert Aldrich and contained powerhouse performances from James Stewart and Hardy Kruger who played Captain Towns and Dorfmann respectively. The remake is basically a 'fun', shallow movie, devoid of any character build-up, and will not tax your brain in any way, shape or form. The production values of the movie itself are admirable but the film suffers from a rushed storyline which is totally un-involving from the start. Some remakes and 're-imaginings' of classic movies actually work, with Oceans Eleven and Planet Of The Apes being two examples. But this particular remake was pointless and ill-advised. Dennis Quade has absolutely no chance of creating the complex character of Frank Towns when armed only with the schoolboy dialogue that is dished up in this film. His co-pilot, played by Tyrese is a complete waste of space and makes no impact on screen what-so-ever. Now how do I compare Quade and Tyrese to James Stewart and Richard Attenborough?, er...there is no comparison. James Stewart's Frank Towns was a complex person who carried the guilt of crashing the plane and putting everyone in danger. But he was still the Captain and therefore responsible for the safety of his co-pilot and passengers; Quade expressed no guilt for the crash and showed all the leadership qualities of a Butlins Redcoat. Richard Attenborough was truly phenomenal as co-pilot Lew Moran and had many pivitol scenes in the original version. Tyrese on the other hand playing co-pilot 'A.J.' in the remake, needn't have bothered showing up for filming as he was instantly forgettable and bland. Many of the scenes in the remake were 'rushed' versions of very powerful and memorable scenes in the original. A perfect example is where an explanation is offered as to why it would be madness to walk from the crash site to try and find help. In the original, Stewart and Attenborough combine their knowledge of navigation to try and convince Capt. Harris (Peter Finch) that it would mean certain death if he and Sgt. Watson were to march off to find help. This scene is memorable and is superbly crafted and acted. But in the remake the bare bones are 'hoovered' from the original script and delivered in an almost mumbled tone, in a scene that last around 30 seconds. A travesty. But my main problem with this remake was the toning down of the arrogant, self-immersed, single minded, aircraft designer. In 1965 this character was given an incredible screen presence by the superb acting talents of movie legend, Hardy Kruger. Kruger's character was called Heinrich Dorfmann and he became increasingly obsessed with seeing his plans become a finished plane. This obsession put him in direct conflict with Frank Towns and a riveting battle of wills ensued which made for gripping entertainment. In the updated version they decided not to have a German character for some strange reason so they cast Giovanni Ribisi as an American. This was a huge mistake. Instead of the arrogant but brilliant Heinrich Dorfmann in the original, we now have a little nerd called Elliot,....yes Elliot. This character doesn't even come close to filling the shoes of Heinrich Dorfmann. The friction with captain Towns which drove the original is non-existent here and when they do try to create an adversarial scene it just doesn't work. A huge flaw in the remade story as far as I'm concerned, is that after the plane has crashed we see Elliot almost instantly taking measurements to try and start plans to build a new plane. The story doesn't unfold as quickly as that!! Another huge pothole or plothole is why oh why aren't 'any' of the survivors showing signs of thirst or even slight water deprivation. In fact in one laughable scene everyone starts dancing to some music being played on a CD player; where did they get the energy from? Another mistake was not to have any reference to the number of days that had passed after an initial statement that they had water for 30 days. The director seemed torn between wanting to make a like-for-like copy of the original and wanting to deliberately change things just for the sake of it. For example, in the 1965 original Towns catches Dorfmann having a shave using an electric shaver which has caused interference on a pocket radio he is using to try and find out if a search has begun for the plane. Towns is furious and shouts at Dorfmann, "Do you think this is some kind of a picnic!". Now in the remake the Director has decided to show that he almost disrespects that scene by having 'Towns' quite happily shaving with his electric shaver, while chatting calmly with the token piece of totty (Miranda Otto). The film also suffers, as do so many these days, from having to be politically correct; and I'm talking of the casting here. Another pivitol and dramatic scene which was watered down criminally in the 2005 version was the Koffman starter scene. I mean this is a big scene and the moment the whole movie has been building towards, but rather than try to emulate the perfection of Robert Aldrich's classic moment which was tension filled and had explosive drama, John Moore decided to let the chance slip by. Instead he managed a feeble attempt at tension which failed miserably and fell flat. As this review draws to a close I would stress very strongly that the 2005 remake of Flight Of The Pheonix is a pale shadow of its 1965 counterpart and you should watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a badly flawed remake of the classic 1965 film.Perhaps the worst thing about this movie is the music. It uses music to try and give the movie style (as in Oceans 11), but in this case it just doesn't fit.The first question I found myself asking is why, if the film is set in the present, are the oil workers using a vintage aircraft as a operational transport aircraft? In 1965 it was still operational, but in 2004, it belongs in a museum.If you can deal with this anachronism, the next problems you will encounter are chaotic camera work and bad editing. For example, When the plane enters the sandstorm, we are bombarded with a series of fly-bys just about every angle and direction. There is no flow, and it's all hard work for the eye and the brain. We see the same kind of camera work at the end of the movie, when the Phoenix takes off. Before we can absorb or make sense of one shot, it ends and the next camera shot is thrown at us, and the result is that we just can't keep up with it - it does not allow the audience room for anticipation, or for any suspense to develop. This is generally the pattern throughout the entire movie. We never get the chance to get immersed in a scene or shot, before it jumps to the next. Yet another example of this is the sandstorm that buries the plane at the end of the movie. Everyone is dejected but Dennis Quaid says "We're gonna dig it out!" and then the scene jumps and suddenly the plane has been dug out and is on its way to the take-off position. It seems like a whole chunk of the movie was left on the editing room floor. The movie stumbles through the plot of the original movie, trying to move at a faster pace and completely bypassing the character study - which was what made the 1965 film so great.In this film the actors deliver their lines as they would voice-overs in a children's adventure cartoon. Miranda Otto crops up as the obligatory feminist update for the remake, while Giovanni Ribisi reduces Hardy Kruger's original character into a superficial caricature. The rest of the film seems to be just a lot of shouting. Thankfully the presence of Hugh Laurie adds a light-hearted touch to the movie and stops us taking it all too seriously.But don't waste your time or money with this - it's barely watchable. Go and watch the original 1965 classic with James Stewart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daring determination brings return to civilization.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This action adventure directed by John Moore pales compared to the original in 1965 directed by Robert Aldrich and starring James Stewart, Peter Finch and John Attenborough.This FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX is however worth your while. There is even beauty found in the middle of the desert. Predictablity is not a hindrance to watch-ability. An oil finding project goes sour in Mongolia; Kelly(Miranda Otto)and her crew are being flown home by Captain Frank Towns(Dennis Quaid)and his co-pilot A.J.(Tyrese Gibson). The plane is actually over loaded with possibly worthless materials; the plane is unable to outrun a huge storm and crash lands in the Mongolian desert. One of the survivors(Giovanni Ribisi) claims to be an airplane designer and convinces the remaining survivors to build a new plane out of the wreckage. The shortage of food and water causes Capt. Towns to be reluctant and doubtful. A joint determination aids Towns to get the new aircraft named Phoenix in the air. Others in the ensemble are: Jacob Vargas, Kirk Jones, Tony Curran, Hugh Laurie and Jared Padalecki. This movie of course will be more entertaining if you haven't seen the original. Otherwise this film is an excitingly photographed remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice remake. Kindda average.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the old movie a bit, even if I've seen it in my childhood, so I recognized this one as a remake, but I can't quite make a comparison. I found the movie too "mild" for my tastes, since it is my belief that in a situation such as the one portrayed in the movie people would react more radically. Also it was too full of clichés, it was like looking at 1000 Hollywood movies in the same time and none at all. I would have passed the "spiritual but not religious" Arab, the "pain in the ass chick that motivates everybody through her cleavage". I guess it was shere luck that there wasn't much of "panicked guy in hysterical crisis that puts everyone in danger". To summarize: watchable, a bit too long for its plot, predictable, unmoving, average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as bad as I thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat down to watch this movie expecting to be seriously disappointed. I am a big fan of the original, and I didn't like the look of the trailers for this remake. However, this movie stands fairly well on it's own. As long as you DON'T compare it to the original, it works as a decent, entertaining movie. It you view this as a comparison to the original, this version just doesn't work. But if you view it as a stand-alone, it isn't a bad, entertaining movie.Dennis Quaid is game, and does a fairly good job as Frank Towns, the 3rd-rate pilot of a 5th-rate outfit. The rest of the characters are decent. There is very little back-story about any of them, but you come to care about what happens to them. As pointed out in earlier reviews, there ARE some unbelievable aspects to this version of the story, but not so fatal that you can't enjoy this, for what it is.POSSIBLE SPOILERS It was a little hard not to compare some scenes that were glaringly bad, when compared to the original. I am so disgusted with filmmakers who have taken the attitude that the general public cannot understand nuance and subtlety. They have to make sure to put in obvious clues so we can easily follow along (Jerry Bruckheimer). As an example, there is a scene in the movie where the plane designer forces everyone to say "please" to him to continue constructing the plane. When it comes to Quaid's turn, the female character turns to him, and mouths words to indicate what he's supposed to do. I suppose this is so we don't lose our place. Quaid hesitates, then agrees that Elliott is in charge, and he says the obligatory "please".In the original, Hardy Krueger's character challenges only the pilot, Frank Towns (played by Jimmy Stewart) over who is in charge of the plane building project. There are no hand signals or obvious cues given to Stewart. However, the silent scene includes Jimmy Stewart's face as he struggles with his rage and contempt, and the obvious needs and desires of the passengers. The emotional and moral dilemma is silently played out on Stewart's face before he finally agrees that Krueger is indeed in charge of the plane building operation. This whole scene is played out brilliantly. There is no need to explain anything - the tension and emotion is played out right in Jimmy Stewart's eyes, and on his face. In this remake, the filmmakers feel the need to indicate obvious clues so we can understand the emotions that are supposed to be involved.This holds true also for the scene where Elliott's true profession is revealed. In the original, Jimmy Stewart and Richard Attenborough gently question Hardy Krueger until they reach a final realization that Krueger's character is really a model plane designer. Again, the scene is played out so well, and acted so brilliantly. Patient, nuanced and subtle, the amazement and rage are played out silently on the faces of Stewart and Attenborough. In this remake, this scene is almost thrown in as an after-thought. When Dennis Quaid's character understands Elliott's true profession, he goes into a stomping, hand-waving fit. Again, this is an obvious clue to make sure we don't misunderstand his rage.These are reasons why this movie should not be viewed so much as a remake. If you do, this will disappoint you. If viewed simply as a movie, on it's own merits, it's not too bad. It was not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't hold a candle to the original (SPOILERS INCLUDED)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching this movie because I am a great fan of the original version starring James Stewart, Richard Attenborough, etc. Sometimes remakes are OK, but this one doesn't even come close to the original. It sticks very close to the original script-wise, and it's got much better special effects, especially during the plane crash sequence. But this movie doesn't have any of the suspense of the original, by the end of this version of the movie I couldn't have cared less if they get the remade plane flying or not. There is no depth to any of the characters, they are like paper cut-outs just going through the motions of a movie. During the original, we were able to learn a lot more about the past-lives of the crew/passengers. What is also missing is the tension between the survivors, I mean we know that there are certain characters who don't get along with other survivors, but there is just no depth to the tension. Dennis Quaid doesn't hold a candle to James Stewart as the captain, and I know Dennis Quaid is a much better actor than this movie portrays.I'm giving this movie a 3 out of 10, the 3 being mainly for the crash sequence. You are better off seeing the original version, it is far, far better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Good Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Private Pilot and I'm very forgiving of flying movies, much more so than mainstream movies, so long as they offer something in return: great flying sequences, good acting, interesting airplanes, a meaningful message about life and people, or at the very least, provide a couple hours of amusement. The new "Flight of the Phoenix" offered none of these in adequate amounts.A movie can redeem itself by lingering after viewing - some films are so moving, so haunting, they affect me for days, or pop-up into my awareness years later. This movie is throw-away forgettable - I won't think of it again. The original 1965 James Stewart "Flight" was memorable, and if I crash land an aircraft or find myself in a survival situation I will remember it, while the new "Flight" is just another movie to watch on cable.Those who haven't seen the original might enjoy the couple hours runtime - the new "Flight" wasn't a complete waste. Indeed, the original had its flaws, such as the utterly stupid "bellydancer" sequence. But those hoping for a film equal or better than the 1965 version will be sorely disappointed. The new script added nothing original; the female character was wasted, failing to inject sexual tension; the dialog lacked wit and failed to provoke thought, in fact it weakened the hopelessness and desperation felt by the survivors, the torment within Captain Towns, and the dangerous, life-threatening power struggle between Towns and Elliot/Dorfmann*.It's a pity, one more rewrite of the screenplay, emphasizing the human elements could have produced a movie that entertained as well as enlightened.*Dorfmann was the original 1965 name of the model airplane designer. +</fullReview>

Ribisi is totally different in this role, but it is a shame his character was not explored more. Why was he on holiday for instance?? Actually, none of the characters were "fleshed out". The whole character thing was 2 dimensional. Why are they in the desert to begin with? One guy has a family and that is as personal as the whole film gets.

Half the time they're just there to just hand the leading man cool gadgets and then set him up for a joke that never seems to get old to American audiences.

		<fullReview>The Flight of the Phoenix has to be one of the disappointments of the 2004 holiday season. It's cast of characters is so 1950's stereotypical that it's positively stupid: an attractive Aussie oil wildcatter, a couple of American black guys, at least one guy from the Middle East, a couple of Brits, one bizarre pseudo-psychopath, and a few generic types, all led by our heroic U.S. aircraft captain, played by Dennis Quaid, a man who seems to be having such a serious mid-life crisis that he has arranged for his character to work in the desert sun and heat without a hat or shirt, presumably to display to the world that a 50-year old actor can still sport a good physique. For all I know, this film could really be meant to be camp, but with films this bad it's always difficult to tell. Anyway, the only redeeming feature of this movie is the beautiful scenery of the Namibian desert - not the Gobi - and some good aerial footage of a C-119 Flying Boxcar (and I'm not sure it really is a C-119.) The rest is a yawn.</fullReview>

They wreck their plane, build a new one, and fly away. The characters are cliché', the plot twists are non-existent, and the premise is unoriginal (to be fair, it is a remake.) The acting isn't necessarily bad. Dennis Quaid plays the same guy he's played in every movie . The real talent comes from Giovoni Ribisi(I know, it's probably misspelled.) He has mostly been limited to small roles in films like Cold Mountain, but he is a great actor. His character is the only one that ever does anything unexpected. Som. ads promise a "great twist", I can't imagine what it was. The story never strays from the summary shown in the trailers. Even the conclusion of the movie was shown in the ads. Don't pay money to see this - not when movies like Oceans 12 and The Life aquatic are still in theatres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite unimpressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an average movie at best. The acting was adequate, and the plane crash was pretty impressive. That's about it. Otherwise it is just cliché-ridden and unbelievable, and not in a self-referential way.The little tension-building tricks they try really don't work when we've all seen them several hundred times before. There is not a single swerve in this entire movie that you can't see coming a half hour before. The characters interactions offer no real insight into the situation except on the most surface of levels, so even in this most dire and tragic of situations there is no emotional connection between them and the audience.As to believability, well everybody seems to stay in pretty good shape considering their location, and the scarcity of food and water. There isn't a single case of dehydration even though they are working in the middle of the day, in the middle of the desert, during the hottest month of the year with rationed amounts of water. Add to that the total unbelievability of the final flight (anyone here ever try holding on to the outside of a car as it accelerates?), and you maybe see the problems.Really its a standard action film, but pretty much lacking in much if any real action.</fullReview>

Dennis Quaid is an exception. He really gives a lackluster performance in this one. Giovvani Ribisi and Hugh Laurie did the best in my opinion. Ribisi is some freaky airplane designer that gives an emotionless performance that perfectly suits his character. Laurie is a "important" business man that gives a performance that is funny and sarcastic but serious at the same time. Like he does in House.The special effects are so-so and I didn't feel like the plane crash was that exciting. Some of them are okay. Like the numerous electric sand storms.In short its a good movie to watch on a Saturday night and maybe watch a second time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not saying that I didn't get caught up in this a bit, but then I searched my memory for the original, which cam out when I was pretty young. It starred Jimmy Stewart, who was a good deal more balanced than Dennis Quaid. There is nothing new here, other than a Mongol hoard and Mongolia itself. The point, of course, is to build a plane from carcass of the older, larger one. I think what was missing was true characterization. While everyone seemed to wear their emotions on their sleeves, they were like worker ants with little visible personality. At the beginning, the captain would rather let everyone die than put forth some effort. The in-fighting seems really strained. The characters who wander off don't seem to have reason other than it's the right thing to do. There is an ugly scene with a nomadic tribe. As if the process of getting out of the desert wasn't bad enough. There is also a problem with wear and tear on the principles involved. They seem to stay pretty healthy despite their hard work and the hopeless nature of their predicament. I'm not saying it's a bad movie. It's just not different enough or well acted enough to make it any better than the first.</fullReview>

This one is no exception.The reason behind is obvious: serious movie-makers are history.This fact is brutally revealed when the Mongolians in the Gobi Desert spoke "Cantonese", a dialect used by Chinese in Hong Kong and a limited part of southern China. Despite the fact that the majority of viewers could not notice it, it reflects the degree of sincerity and devotion of the makers of this movie, let alone professionalism.As good plants cannot be grown from bad soil, everything else went down naturally-- the acting, the characters, and the atmosphere.

		<shortDescription>Decent Remake of But Not Nearly As Good As the 1965 Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As remakes go, "Flight of the Phoenix" (aka "The Flight of the Phoenix") is not bad but unfortunately pails in comparison to the original film of 1965. While most of the important elements from the earlier classic are present in this "updated" offering, the script and acting had major problems. Certainly Dennis Quaid makes a decent Towns, but what made the original character as played by Jimmie Stewart fascinating was his lack of leadership and decisiveness, a bit like the aviator equivalent of the captain of the Titanic. In the original, Stewart is an excellent pilot but indecisive when it comes to leadership. Quaid exhibits some of that in this version, at first rather indifferent to the reality of the plight and reluctant to be a leader.For those who have seen neither film, the relatively simple plot is about an air-wreck in the desert, this time in China rather than the Sarah in the original. The survivors of the crash resolve to build a smaller plane from the wreckage to save themselves from the unforgiving desert. In this film, aboard the plane is a young man name of Elliot who has aviation designing experience. Through his knowledge, he designs and the men create a working plane from the one working engine of the wrecked plane.One of the most glaring problems of the this new offering are the characters and their lines. In the film of 1965, we learn about the little eccentricities and shortcomings of the many character-survivors. In the new film, I had trouble getting a handle on the characters. They seemed more caricatures than characters. In the original, there are several members of the British army, one a by-the-book captain and the other a self-interested Sergeant. In the present film, they are all 21st-century "guys" but little about them was very distinguishable, even the one female character (not present in the original) seemed a bit too predictable.The weakest character in terms of both script and acting was Elliot played by Giovanni Ribisi, the equivalent of Heinrich Dorfman, a German aviation engineer-designer. Elliot's script had many problems, at first acting shy and irresolute while at other times exploding unnecessarily. While Elliot's character could have worked with a better script, and you can't blame actor Giovanni Ribisi for all the problems, it's hard to beat the absolutely stellar performance by Hardy Krüger in the earlier film. In one of the most crucial scenes of the story, when it's revealed the true experience of the designer-engineer in terms of aviation, the present film played out like a scene from a soap opera. In the original, the scene gradually evolves. Also in the original, the scenes were in two parts whereas in the new version, the scene is one long drawn-out confrontation.The main saving grace of the present offering is the visuals which are certainly stronger than the original. The wreckage and the subsequent plane built by the survivors is a bit clearer. However, the visuals can't quite make up for the poor script and mediocre directing. The director was certainly excellent in terms of the visuals, but not great in terms of making his characters shine. Again, a decent viewing but probably a one-watch at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always a risk with a remake of a successful film, but Phoenix succeeds with flying colors. Quaid as the Captain delivers just the right mix of toughness, compassion, and comedy, when needed. The cast of characters was well thought out, with a nice mix of thinkers, doers, and listeners. They even cast a woman in a lead role, which I think worked well. The plot takes you aboard this plane that has mechanical issues and crashes in the desert. OK, now what do we do, they ask. the question is interestingly played back and forth, with some results, until the inevitable hopelessness compels them to try the one impossible task to rebuild the plane. While the ending is somewhat predictable, the movie is quick moving, finely acted, has a good pace, with breathtaking cinematography. This kind of movie always inspires the question - what would you do if this were you? If you enjoy survival type movies against all odds, rent this movie. You will really like it. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Then again, I've never seen the original, so there's always going to be people out there who claim that the Dennis Quaid version doesn't compare. Maybe they're right, but, seeing as I never saw it, I can only say that this modern version is a pretty fun action/adventure romp.It's about a plane that crashes in the desert and there's no discernible help coming for them. Therefore they're left with the choices of just sitting there awaiting death, or rebuilding their stricken aircraft from scratch and flying out of there. Guess what? they choose the latter.However, it's not an easy task. Along with the natural lack of food and water, they have to contend with the elements, not to mention a tribe of gun-crazy nomads waiting to pick them off.There's a cast of about ten (including Dennis Quaid and Miranda Otto), so don't expect every one of them to be really fully-fleshed. A fair percentage are only there to find themselves lost in the desert or on the wrong end of a nomad's bullet. But, this isn't about character. Basically, the crew of 'stereotypes' are only there to fill a purpose, but so what ? it's still fun! It's slightly longer than your average film (about an hour and forty minutes), but it never seems to drag. They crash pretty quickly and one disaster after the next moves the story along at a good pace.Okay, so when the history books are written about great action/adventure films, the remake of 'Flight of the Phoenix' will probably never be mentioned. However, that doesn't mean it's not a fun little ride if you're in the mood. Give it a go. If you find it on telly, or streaming for free on an online site its value is even greater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure it has Dennis Quaid (The Big Easy), Giovanni Ribisi (Saving Private Ryan), Tyrese Gibson (Four Brothers), and Miranda Otto (The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King), but it also had Hugh Laurie from House. That's enough to get me to watch, no matter what. No, Quaid is not better that Jimmy Stewart was in the 1965 version, but he still sizzles. Ribisi, with his Nazi undertones, really adds to the pic.It is an inadequate remake, but it has Hugh Laurie. Two things that puzzle me: How come no one gets a sunburn working in the desert without a shirt, and how come Otto doesn't hook up with one of these shirtless hunks - especially Hugh Laurie.</fullReview>

This is one the worst movies i've ever seen, and i've seen a lot of bad movies...It doesn't have any story at all, the ending is plain and boring, no comical puns, no adventure, no action, no nothing. No characters, no character development, anything...It just isn't fun to watch because the story (story?) is just plain, told in a boring way, not innovative and just not interesting.I don't know what to comment else, this is just not fun or entertaining (and certainly not a learning experience), period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, although shot reasonably well, is quite a test of viewer patience. There are so many things that don't add up you want to just yell at the screen during just about every scene. The characters are constantly facing cliché and drawn out conflicts that really hold no value to the narrative and ultimately only prolong the predictable and anticlimactic ending. I mean, the movie is called "Flight of the Pheonix" for crying out loud!! Do you think it's going to fly? Lets not pretend for even a moment that there is any genuine suspense here. Sure, some ancillary characters will get knocked off but nothing you don't see coming a mile away.. Honestly, the most difficult part to sit through is Giovanni Ribisi's performance... UCH, TERRIBLE... He has this horrible Hannibal Lecter schtick he's trying to pass off as eccentric but it really just comes off pathetic.. I spent the entire movie praying for someone to kill him even though I already knew it wasn't going to happen..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I am almost lost for words - after the first one being one of my most favourite films, to see this version sensationalised and trivialised using cartoon like animation was certainly a disappointment.Someone needs to tell the director this is was not meant to be a children's film, although that is what it turned into. Twin engine cargo planes to not do loop the loops and travel at warp speed. Seeing this dreadful animation spoilt the whole film and it was impossible to take anything very seriously after that.The special effects should have been up to the task - but compared to the original film where the sandstorms in the desert were real, well certainly looked real, the special effects in this lame movie made the sandstorm look like something out of a caricatured version of the mummy.Lastly, if all that was not enough...the music was totally in appropriate for the film.Well this is a 3 out of 10, and this is with respect to the IQ of the director.</fullReview>

The scenery is boring since all it is is desert. And there isn't a lot for people to do in a desert except argue.The movie was very predictable. You knew one of the guys would be difficult and whiny. But, it was surprising in the end that that guy actually lived. And not only lived but actually was a hero by fixing the rudder on a moving plane.The ending was the worst because it was so Hollywood. I am surprised Disney didn't make it. Like why would all those nomads decide to attack exactly when the plane is taking off. Then we get a happy ending as they sail into the great beyond.FINAL VERDICT: Noting great, but if you really think Dennis Quaid is hot, you may want to watch it because he's shirtless a lot; otherwise, I didn't think it was worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big step down on this remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, where to start... The overall visuals are a plus, nice location and nice cinematography. Not better than the original, but equal in this matter. Story, well it's almost the same, but a few nice touches on the new one regarding the group of "nomads" who aren't really nomads. Now, here's where it fails: Hardly any acting worth anything, everyone except Quaid is a B grade actor, or just getting out of B grade stuff. Now in the original, every single character was an A grade actor, and even the lesser ones were as good as the best ones in the remake. So that's a big negative. Also, the characters are just always at each other, harping and nagging, unlike the original where they really come together eventually through the character development, and not from some lame, half-ass, hardly believable, speech by the pilot. Elliot here is a big disappointment compared to Hardy Kruger. But then there's crap to work with, we can hardly blame the actor. Could this be a sign of modern times, where everyone is hostile and insensitive to everyone else right off the bat, and constantly have to bicker and fuss? It's like whenever somebody has an idea, the first thing is to cut it apart, rather than, say, consider it in a thoughtful manner? But then we must remember that Hollywood only deals in simplistic patterns of behavior and clichés and stereotype, because how can they ever do something more complex in a two hour action film, right? Hey, how the hell did they ever make the first version so full of great characters and dialog in just two hours??!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, But rides itself into the ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie no doubt has a great cast, including Dennis Quaid, Miranda Otto and Hugh Laurie but lacks the most important key to making a movie...a great story.After a Mongolian oil team loses their jobs, Frank Towns and his crew member, A.J, (Tyrese) are brought to take the oil employees home. On their way they run into a massive sand storm, and crash land in the middle of the Gobi desert. The passengers on this plane are miraculously unscratched, and are forced to live with each other with a limited amount of water and food. And on top of all that, the passengers of the plane are invaded by a group of ninja looking men who apparently always have enough water to survive.While waiting around until the day they run out of water and die, one of the more annoying characters suggests, "Hey, lets build a new plane!" The nerdy guy, played by Gionvanni Ribsi, claims to work as a plane engineer, and becomes crazy about this plane, planning schedules for every minute of every day, while the more he talks about it, the less he seems to know about real airplane making. In the midst of all this madness, the trust of others is tested and questioned over and over again, causing your brain to go in circles while watching.Overall, the movie seems like a huge waste of money, and an even bigger waste of time, to actually sit down and watch it all the way through. You could probably just watch the first 10 minutes, and make up your own story from there, and be more entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Attempt For The High Road That Sputters A Bit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tries to take the high road to the traditional survival story, but ends up with several low points along the way. One of the saving components of this movie was the mostly outstanding performance of Giovanni Ribisi who plays a character that seems quite out of his past range of characters as well as stereotypical one, but one that Ribisi makes his own. There are number of intellectual and explanatory narrative scenes with a number of characters using a script that attempts to elevate the level of dialogue and plot. Yet the movie at the same time suffers from manipulative script devices, continuity problems, and actions by the characters that don't seem to make much sense. There is one scene where Ribisi climbs on top of their new plane during an electrical storm. There is another scene where it's night and then suddenly it's day. There are a number of scenes where time suddenly passes and, as if by magic, the survivors' problems are solved. Various equipment, food, water many vital components just appear mostly for the sake of the script. There are a number of superfluous script plots that are incorporated just for the sake of making the movie supposedly more interesting without really allowing the characters to develop and become much more personal. The characters are themselves somewhat stereotypical even though deliberate attempts are made not to be so. One of the great scenes is when Ribisi manages to take charge as well as the twist of his true nature of his employment (though the outcome of this scene is somewhat disappointment and quite predictable). There would have been more emotional intrigue if the survivors' discovered that not all of them could leave because of weight considerations. All in all, this mostly predictable movie thanks in part to the trailer is interesting with some nice cinematography shots, slow motion, and other special effects has its moments. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie might have made a better book. I usually enjoy Dennis Quaid especially his later work but this movie just doesn't flow right. I cant imagine him needing the work this badly.In typical Rocky fashion the bad guys come in too late to be menacing.And the drama seemed forced.Being a big fan of Hugh Laurie on HOUSE it was good to see him in a less commanding role and still have a presence. I think if he would have just shot the guy we all would have like the movie better...it would have ended sooner and they would have died as they should have in the desert. I mean unless they had that particular plane which very few are flown anymore the movie doesn't work. I'm at a disadvantage having been an aircraft mechanic I guess.I'm just wondering how they kept the plane from moving when the engines started and how they stopped it when they landed. Forget all the in between stuff like how they stayed on during the flight with the wind and all. I just love the way they explained how everyone wound up in the end I needed that closer after becoming so attached to the characters...My tongue is deep in my cheek here folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High concept, low execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty sad when you find yourself rooting for the movie and none of its characters. The premise, a plane-load of jig-saw puzzle characters forced to survive in a desert, was drained of its gritty potential by scribe tricks meant to keep the action going. It's hard to believe pros like Scott Frank and Edward Burns completely sacrificed character driven action to the other kind -- and didn't even succeed at that! The film begins well enough when cynical "shut it down Towns" (Quaid) unexpectedly arrives in his big plane to evacuate a fired crew from a failed test drill oil well site in Mongolia. Right off the bat the crew leader, Kelly (Miranda Otto) takes it out on Towns, establishing the "hate" part of their "love hate" relationship. Towns' more than just cynical, he's arrogant, and bad judgment has him flying into a treacherous storm that ends with the plane and all its motley characters stranded in the Gobi so far off course no one's gonna look, and no one's gonna care. Great CGI aerials and crash sequence. However, what should then have become a boiling cauldron of humans on the edge, instead turns into one dumb move after another. Not to mention that for no good reason people choose to lounge and crawl around in the blazing sun instead of sticking mostly to the shade. Can't recommend this movie, which is too bad, because Quaid is such a nice guy and not a bad actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cannot nearly match with the classic original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparing the original from 1965 to this re-release, two things to me become obvious: The actors are lousy compared to the all-stars of the 50s and 60s and the conflict surprisingly now is centered on an all-American crew and represents the conflicts that America has to deal with these days (cultural and racial salad bowl).The original dealt with international conflicts and made it interesting for foreigners as well, this is therefore now only a movie with some interest for American issues, but it tells us little about how Americans view the rest of the world except that they do not think it is worthwhile mentioning? I think you can understand that I prefer to deal with the original masterpiece instead of a copy, that is not nearly as exciting as the original, who did not dare to bring a woman in the movie in real (just as illusion of arabic dancer) for good reason: Could you believe that men can really behave so well as they all do? I think mens flesh is still too weak for this kind of situation....So for movie fanatics the real interest in this new version is to understand how the way of movie-making has changed in the last forty years, not only that stuntman are luckily replaced by CGI (unfortunately to the disadvantage of the audience interested in great, real pictures...but that is not worth the life of a man, is it!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>almost satisfactory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Moore's streamlined remake of Robert Aldrich's 1965 action-adventure trims 30 minutes from the running time, but the shortest route is seldom the most interesting. When their cargo plane crash-lands in the Gobi desert, the 11 survivors face a stark choice. Caught between flyboy Dennis Quaid's jaded fatalism and nerdy airplane designer Giovanni Ribisi's quirky optimism, they can either wait for help to arrive or use their energies and dwindling supplies to build a new plane from the wreckage of the old one.If scriptwriters Scott Frank and Ed Burns had explored these tense group dynamics more fully, the grounded desert scenes might have generated some suspense and psychological drama. Instead, the sketchy characters and flat dialogue just fill the space between the bracketing set-pieces: the brilliantly staged opening crash and the nail-biting attempted take-off. Even given more to do, Quaid is no James Stewart, and the rest of the group barely register. So only the blond-haired, bespectacled Ribisi matches the intensity of his predecessor, Hardy Kruger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They should have used the doubt better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't even realize there was an older version of this movie, but while I was not hugely impressed with this remake and had pretty low expectations to begin with, I definitely want to see it now. Then again, Jimmy Stewart is one of the most watchable actors I've ever seen, so all the more reason.Anyway, the movie starts out with a trivial story about an oil digging project being shut down for going over schedule and over budget. It's really only in the movie in order to establish a divide between the two groups of people. Take two groups of people and put them in a life threatening situation where they have a limited amount of time and supplies before they all die of starvation and thirst and all of them have different ideas of how to get out of it, and you have the ingredients for a pretty good action thriller. (spoilers) I liked the movie, but the problem with it is that just when you think it's going to get interesting, or just when it DOES get interesting, it is followed up by any one of a number of gigantic action movie clichés. To give the most glaring example, I have no idea how many times the old trick has been used where the plane drops out of sight into the giant gorge for an impossibly long time, only to pop up to a huge burst of dramatic music and cheers, but it is hardly lightning out of a clear sky for unexpectedness when the Phoenix makes it out of the gorge at the end of this movie. I liked the characterization in the movie, although you do find most of the typical movie caricatures, but there is some originality worth noting. Giovanni Ribisi, another of my favorite actors, plays a particularly interesting character, who has one of the better twists toward the end of the movie. It's something that you won't see coming and is remarkably effective without sacrificing and realism. That had all gone out the window long before. There is one scene that makes no sense whatsoever, when he expresses confusion about Towns' (Dennis Quaid) concern about an incoming electrical storm. You would think that an aircraft engineer would understand the danger inherent in standing on a giant piece of steel full of aviation fuel in the middle of the desert. My jaw dropped at this, but the reasoning is sufficiently justified as more details emerge about his background as an engineer. Oddly, Dennis Quaid takes on the part of Frank Towns, which was played by Jimmy Stewart in the original film, but is probably the shallowest and least interesting character in the movie. I'm curious as to how Stewart played the part, because I refuse to believe that his Frank Towns was shallow or uninteresting. It's almost like Quaid is pretending to be Nicholas Cage from Con Air, and that was a disastrous performance (and I am a huge fan of Nicholas Cage as well). The beginning of the movie is little more than an exercise in the new availability of special effects, but it's a good exercise. I couldn't help thinking of Lone Star and Barf crash landing the Winnebago in the desert in Spaceballs, but this is a very well done crash landing. It's even almost effective in trying to convince you that the plane wouldn't simply disintegrate crashing on uneven sand, which obviously any plane would. A more pressing concern, however, is how these men are able to dismantle it and build a new, smaller airplane out of its undamaged parts and then fly it away.Compounding this, at one point a sandstorm buries the new plane up to its tail, probably under 15 feet of solid sand, and the dehydrated and starving team decides to dig it out. Well, of course they would, these guys aren't giving up until they're dead. But here is how the script reads ? The men decide to dig the plane out of the sand. CUT TO the men pulling the plane up to the runway. Not only did they move countless tons of sand, but they cleaned the engine compartment, which must have been full of sand as well. This is, of course, probably a financial concern. I like to think that they realized the hole in the plot during pre-production, and maybe it's something that would have ended up as a deleted scene anyway. I sure would have liked to see how they pulled it off, though.The biggest problem with the movie is not even the ridiculous plot about the band of smugglers or bandits or sand people or Ewoks or Dinks or whatever they were, it's the fact that the movie ends before it finishes telling the story. Many people might only want to see if the plane will fly, but personally I was more interested in their flight back to civilization than I ever was about putting the plane together. I would have taken out the fighting over the container of water and invested in more scenes that took place during the flight, which could have easily generated more tension than anything else in the movie. Evidently director John Moore felt differently and was satisfied to show a takeoff and a series of Polaroids during the closing credits indicating that the cast survived and was prosperous. But you already knew that was going to happen. Wouldn't it have been great if the film had acknowledged the fact that this plane is literally held together by will power and tried to capitalize on that inherent suspense?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flight of the Phoenix (2004)Action/Adventure Released 12/17/04 Reviewed 12/20/04 Starring Dennis Quaid, Giovanni Ribisi, Tyrese Gibson, Miranda Otto, Hugh Laurie, Kirk Jones, Tony Curran, Jacob Vargas, Scott Michael Campbell, Kevork Malikyan, Jared Padalecki, Anthony Wong Written by Scott Frank and Edward Burns Directed by John Moore Rated PG-13/PG for Action/Violence, Some Language and Frightening ScenesThis is another remake. While I have rarely seen the original to any remakes I see, they still often suck. Cases in point include The Stepford Wives and Walking Tall. The only really good remakes I can think of are Dawn of the Dead and The Manchurian Candidate. Now, I haven't seen the original to this movie, but I did see it with someone who did, so some parts of the review are comparisons due to hearsay. The original, which starred Jimmy Stewart and Richard Attenborough, was apparently slow, but extremely well acted. So, how does this new one compare?Plot: 2.2/2.5: After an oil rig in Mongolia is shut down, a plane is sent down to retrieve the workers and the materials. Captain Frank Towns (Quaid) and his co-pilot AJ (Gibson) are sent to pick up them up. Though the leader Kelly (Otto) is peeved and taking out her anger on Towns, they pack up and head out. However, they hit a storm and crash, automatically losing three of their men, including their doctor. With enough water for 30 days and enough food to ration for a while, they decide to wait to be picked up. However, one passenger who was hitching with the crew, Elliot (Ribisi), is an airplane engineer and thinks he can rebuild the plane. While Towns disagrees at first, they decide to go ahead with it. From there, they get thrown some curve balls every now and then, meet some smugglers and tension builds between Elliot and the rest of the crew, but it pretty much stays a steady course after that idea. A couple side-plots emerge, the only one that takes more than three minutes being the smugglers/nomads, but for the most part, they just get poop thrown at them while they try to rebuild a new plane from the old one (hence the Phoenix). This may be one-tracked, but it is considerably better than having a bunch of bad side-stories, isn't it. For the record, from my sources, it is very faithful to the original with only one or two difference. The twist that you may have heard of is the same as the original. If you haven't seen the original, it may not seem like a great twist, but it is interesting. This plot may drag on a bit, but it is still quite good.Action: .7/2.5: This isn't an action movie, but since the trailers clearly label it an action movie, I will add this section. The action is minimal. The opening crash is pretty cool, but there have been better. Then again, there have been worse (Air Force One's crash in Air Force One was laughable). The scenes with the smugglers, while they may involve shooting, are more there as a plot device than to service action needs. There are many scenes, such as the one with the smugglers on motorcycles, that are not in the film at all. The trailer definitely lied here. This isn't an action film at all.Acting: 2.4/2.5: The original, according to my father who has seen both, was good mainly because of some excellent acting by Richard Attenborough (Jurassic Park). Giovanni Ribisi (Sky Captain) gets his role of the airplane designer. While I thought Ribisi did very well, he was apparently (this is hearsay) playing Richard Attenborough as opposed to making the character his own. From stills and posters I have seen of the original, he does manage very well to get the same look as Attenborough. Quaid (Frequency) is very good as Frank Towns, a much better role than he had in The Day After Tomorrow. According to my father (so, once again, hearsay), he did better than James Stewart, although that may be due to a better scripted character. The two rappers that appear here, Tyrese (2 Fast 2 Furious) and Kirk Jones, better known as Sticky Fingaz (LAX), do fairly good, though Tyrese is overshadowed by the rest of the cast. Otto (The Lord of the Rings) looks too suburbanized to be an oil worker, but she works with it. Laurie (Stuart Little) is good as the only white-collar (aside from Ribisi). The acting is very good in this movie, which makes the characters interesting enough to fill the action void.Entertainment: 2.3/2.5: Flight of the Phoenix is not the must-see movie of the year. It is a movie I highly recommend for a rental, however. It is the type of movie you can have fun with no matter what your age, gender or taste.Bonus-.1 for this: So, these people are supposed to hang on to the wings of the plane for 300 miles? Sounds kinda tough. You'd think a couple people at least would fall off. Just don't do a barrel roll.Total: 75%: According to my father, this one is better than the original. Ribisi may not be quite as good as Attenborough, but it is much more enjoyable. While I won't know if I agree with him unless I see the original, that's good enough for me to recommend this movie for at least a rental. It is entertaining, and that's all I ever hoped for. This exceeded my expectations and then some.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of air crash survivors are stranded in the Mongolian desert with no chance of rescue. Facing a brutal environment, dwindling resources, and an attack by desert smugglers, they realize their only hope is doing the impossible... building a new plane from the wreckage of the old one.I don't get why people hated this movie. Sure its a remake and the first one was a lot better but in a stand alone view of the film, its actually pretty amazing. You watch this film and you compare it to the first one, that's not the point of this film. This is supposed to be a fresh take on the 1965 film because back then there were no special effects like we have it today. This one wasn't supposed to go against the original, this was like a tribute or a homage to the first one because it was really good back then. The cinematography was above excellent, an amazing shot of the desert smuggler shooting the guy in the brown jumpsuit in slow motion was amazingly well done, it gets me every time I watch it.The storyline was decent. Its not just a story about survival, its a story about hope, unity, faith and redemption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, that I haven't seen the original yet ... and I'm a bit ashamed of this fact. I always try to watch the original movie, before I go into a remake. But maybe, because I don't know the original, that made me unaware of more flaws this movie might have in comparison to the original.Having said that, the movie is pretty straight (forward). The characters and most of the story lines are cliché and if you've seen similar movies, you will be expecting most of it's turns and twists. Still the movie is enjoyable enough and holds your attention, if you let it. This of course is thanks to the cast on display here! :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action movie...demonstrates teamwork &amp; ingenuity among diverse characters under extremely hostile conditions!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand this movie is actually a remake of an earlier movie starring James Stewart in the sixties. I did not watch the earlier movie, even though James Stewart was a favorite actor of mine, but I certainly enjoy watching this one.The storyline is very simple: A ragtag bunch of characters on a cargo plane crash-landed somewhere in the Gobi Desert. They worked together, led (or misled?) by an eccentric character, Elliot (played menacingly by Giovanni Ribisi), who had only some experience with model air plane design, to rebuild the plane from the wreckage &amp; then to fly back to civilization.In a nut shell, it is essentially a movie about the triumph of the indomitable human spirit. What I like about this movie is watching the ragtag bunch of diverse characters eventually working together &amp; using their sheer ingenuity &amp; imagination to rebuild the plane, in spite of extremely hostile conditions - no contact with the outside world, brutal environment (scorching sun &amp; scathing sandstorms), dwindling resources &amp; attack by desert marauders. The dialog is very witty...sometimes funny...coupled by a spectacular crash sequence, which has been seemingly extended for viewers' enjoyment.This movie also brought back some sweet memories of my trip across the southern end of the Gobi Desert about a decade ago. At that time, I was trying to retrace the journey of Marco Polo along the Silk Road. I rode on a camel as well as on four-wheels across some short stretches. The view of the sand dunes was magnificent &amp; enchanting, but I could sense the harsh reality of the environment. (This movie was actually filmed on location in Namibia, Africa.) Only one aspect of the movie really puzzles me. As a Chinese, I noted that the desert marauders apparently spoke Cantonese. The crash scene happened in the Mongolian part of the Gobi Desert - people there don't speak Cantonese.Lastly but not the least, I have also enjoyed watching Dennis Quaid, one of my favorite actors, playing the lead role of Frank Towns, the crack pilot.Overall, the movie has been great to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had originally given this film a 4, but the more I thought about it for these comments, the lower my opinion became.First, the soundtrack, both scored and tracked is awful. With the exception of the Johny Cash song during the opening title sequence, the rock music is so distracting that we had to mute the film several times.The MTV-style editing was just as distracting as the music.Additionally, there is a very strange portion in the middle of the movie where the film has an inexplicable color change. After throwaway character Kelly spots the smugglers, the film suddenly changes to a deep blue from then until Rodney is carried back to the crash site. It's obvious that this was originally shot as a day scene to match the wrapping scenes. But it's color timed as though someone thought it should have been a day-for-night shoot. Even Ian's hair is blue.Most of the film is forgettable. As irritating as I normally find Giovanni Ribisi, he's actually the only "good" part of this film.My last comment is that studios need to learn that rappers are not actors. I suppose they cast them assuming they'll at least get a few people into the auditorium, but they definitely cheapen the product.My recommendation is that you skip this and watch the immeasurably better original 1965 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crew That Toils Together Boils Together...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film opens with a Johnny Cash song more appropriate to a late-70s Burt Reynolds road race movie than an air crash flick, and straight away you start to wonder about the judgement of the makers. And, while the movie that follows isn't as bad as that ominous opening would suggest, it's still pretty dull stuff. It's one of those films during which you inevitably start to question just why ? why? ? did they decided to make it? But then, perhaps their decision to remake a no-better-than-average 60s flick is in keeping with the air of misjudgement and mediocrity that hangs over the entire production.Dennis Quaid plays Harrison Ford playing Frank Towns, one of those touchy rugged pilots whose life, as far as the film is concerned, begins when he lands at an unsuccessful oil rig deep in the Mongolian desert to ferry the newly-unemployed workforce back to civilisation. Prior to this moment he has no life history. All we know is he has a co-pilot buddy with initials for a name (Tyrese Gibson) and a don't-mess-with-me attitude designed to create tensions with the oil workers. In fact everyone goes out of their way to be antagonistic to everyone else so that we can later marvel at how they come together as a unit when the going gets tough and at what a nicer bunch of people the survivors are when they emerge from their ordeal.The inevitable crash sequence is technically sound, although it doesn't come close to achieving the visceral impact of the crash in Alive! which currently sets the benchmark against which all subsequent movie air crashes should be measured, but someone got carried away with the CGI sandstorm that sends the plane crashing into the desert. Once all body parts are checked, our hardy survivors set about the task of getting on each other's nerves while they sit around eating peaches and waiting to be rescued. The men are all a pretty disagreeable bunch ? annoyed no doubt at being cardboard stereotypes as well as stranded in the desert ? while the token female (Miranda Otto) has virtually nothing to do. For all the bristling male egos on display, however, the friction arises between Quaid's air captain and a nerdish little man (well played by Giovanni Ribisi) who just happens to be an airplane designer. It's not exactly the most dramatic of duels. They shout at each other then Quaid punches Ribisi who runs off to have a good cry and refuse to continue helping the rest of the crew build the plane that will (hilariously) fly them to freedom until they all say please.While the plight of the survivors struggles to fill the film's running time, the story seems to be played out in a kind of temporal vacuum. There is almost no sense of time running out as they rebuild their plane, and few visible signs (apart from a few chapped lips) of the ravages toiling in the desert heat would have on everyone. You get the impression that they could ? and in fact have ? spent months out there building the damn thing and will carry on building it for as long as it takes.While Flight of the Phoenix might be a technically accomplished piece of work, it has no heart whatsoever and fails entirely to bestow any kind of individuality upon the majority of its characters. Give this one a miss and watch the original instead or, better yet, give them both a miss and catch the unsurpassable Sands of the Kalahari.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I guess it was never going to be was it.I thoroughly enjoyed the original version and was looking forwards to how the film was going to be remade. Instead of doing a straight remake they decided to do an update/remake - which for me didn't really work.Obviously the special effects were fantastic - and the original film can't compare but the level of acting was a pale shadow of the original. But how could Dennis Quaid and Hugh Grant compare to Jimmy Steward, Richard Attenborough, Peter Finch and Hardy Kruger etc.I watched the original and was drawn in. I watched the remake and found it totally unbelievable. I guess when you couldn't rely on CGI you had to really ACT back then...Not a bad film - but if you have the choice - hire/buy the original...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And that would be John Moore - he simply cannot cut his mustard. Not to repeat all the comments about the flaws of this movie, but to ask a question - 'what were you thinking?'. Moore decided to get beautifully streamlined Aldrich' 1965 movie and reshape it in his monster garage into the 300 hp dust blower, thinking this would cater to whom? Today's younger generation? They didn't buy it. Then who else? I guess no one, or at least I cannot see that there was a specific group that particularly liked the movie. We see again and again how Moore tries to exploit today's common places, this without much style, and the result is just a bad movie. The idea of so-called equal representation backfires - a couple of 'good whites', a couple of 'bad whites' (one to turn out to be good), one Hispano-American, one woman, one or two blacks, one from each ethnic, denomination and interest group...At the end, the great equaliser is that, because of the stereotypes, everyone gets offended. From the technical and special effects point, the movie does not shine either. It was a shabby work at best. Why did I then bother to give 4 stars...First, I like adventure movies (at the same time, it was disappointing to see it done like this), some of the sets, images and flickers of dialogue and acting reminded me that there were some good actors and solid original story involved. Everybody seem to agree that these good actors were, to say the least, uninspired. Some liked Ribisi in his role, I did not...Ribisi is a great actor, but once you see Hardy Kruger in the original movie, you cannot help but think that Ribisi's interpretation did not work quite as well. At the end, I think I'll try to forget that this movie was ever made. ...Now, thinking of adventure movies, I would really like to see a remake of that famous 1965 Aldrich' movie 'The Flight of the Phoenix' done by an apt director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must confess, I haven't seen the Robert Aldrich original, yet something tells me it has just a little more bite than this. The plot concerns a motley group of plane crash survivors, stranded in the Mongolian desert with 'no way out but up'. Of course several of the expendable ones have to die and, like with all disaster movies, the fun is guessing who gets knocked off next.The film opens, introducing (quite amiably, I thought) the main characters. Miranda Otto, flame haired beauty, Tyrese Gibson, funny man with a killer Bill Cosby impression, Dennis Quaid, hero for hire and Givanni Ribisi, mysterious Aryan weirdo. The latter being the most captivating performance of the lot, keeping you guessing all the way about what he's really up to. The rest are a mixed bunch, but you will surely be able to find them in films like The Towering Inferno, Airport and more recently, Speed, Hugh Laurie being the highlight of this lot as "the suit". The funny thing is, Dennis Quaid's character is so full of himself that it turns out everything that goes wrong IS his fault and if he would just listen to Giovanni Ribisi's weirdo all would be hunky dory. Maybe they were trying to give his character an edge or something...So, there are the characters and if you can guess how each of feature in the plot or what their fates will be, you'd probably be right. You could have a drinking game with this movie, I'm sure. Add in some slick (sometimes too slick) direction and some hammy acting from practically all involved, plus some big special effects and what you have is an entertaining (albeit unoriginal) disaster movie.</fullReview>

Going from quiet submissive, to controlling and creepy, I've only seen Mr. Lithgow carry this off well.Well, maybe Kevin Bacon or Ray Liotta too. Check out John Lithgow in "Ricochet," with Denzel Washington.Giovanni plays this part well, taking a disquieting turn towards abusive once he's established the fact that only two people are necessary, Dennis Quaid, and himself. everyone else then falls into line, becoming submissive to his sudden control.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is yet another survival one, all about what a group of people do when stuck in the middle of nowhere and everything they take for granted is out of reach. The plane crash that sets the movie up is raw and real. Its a movie that keeps you watching and thinking all the time and making you ask yourself, how are they going to get out of this one? Apart from being stuck in the middle of the desert, dealing with sand and electrical storms, they also have to deal with the hostile locals who could ruin their chances of returning home in the plane they plan to build out of the remains of the one they crashed in.Its a movie where no one character is bigger than they other, but a lot of your focus will remain on the one character who's seemingly impossible plan to rebuild a new plane out of the old one becomes the groups only chance of survival. Nearing the end, your emotional involvement builds as the anxiety builds, and all your hopes are for the survival of the characters like in no other survival movie I have seen before.This movie is very watchable and well worth seeing. It may be predictable in many ways, but it still has its own little unexpected surprises and a much bigger feeling of 'middle of nowhere' to it. Enough entertainment for anybody! 7 out of 10!</fullReview>

What's new with this film anyway? The plot is much like Alive, except that they didn't have to devour one another. There are very rare comedy scenes. Almost the entire movie was such a drag, no action or climax until the part where they already flew the rebuilt plane while being chased by the Mongol nomads, whatever you call them. Going back to Quaid, as far as I know, he's into making a comeback, right? Well, I don't think his recent films will make that quite possible. C'mon Dennis, please accept films with much better story lines and overall quality. We already like your acting, but the movies must be good in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some spoilers.First Off I loved the 1965 version. I thought at first it was a mistake to remake this movie. That said, I enjoyed this movie. Why? It is fun, escapist, non-threatening, entertainment like national Treasure that I really would have no problem bringing my 7 year old son to. Sure there are a couple of moments, but no worse that TV shows. If I wanted an epic I would have searched harder, I just wanted to go into a movie and have fun for a couple of hours and this fit the bill. Some Things: I personally loved the Outkast song interlude. Stress relief needed at a critical point by the survivors. (Nice timing w/ratchet Dennis)I hated that they made the actual work on the plane look easy; rebuilding, clearing the sand, etc...( In 1965 version you saw the effort and strain)For a desert too much skin, no head covers, NO SUNBURNS, (It seemed no worse than a day at the beach. I know the GOBI isn't the Sahara but one character did say it got pretty nasty in the time-frame of the movie).Frank Towns well done. Elliott-Giovanni Ribisi good but I still like Hardy Krueger as Dorfmann better. Have to say most of cast/characters pretty undeveloped.Missed the actual ending of the first movie where they ran down to the pond and everyone trying to figure out whats going with these guys.Rent It.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story was good, not surprising since this IS a remake. Personally I only found one character likable and that was the cook. All in all no one was so endearing they would have been missed if they were killed off. The pilot, Dennis Quaid, was too defeatist. The engineer could be someone who had been beaten for his lunch money as a kid and wanted to rule over the macho men he was with. The female geologist/driller complained too much and wanted someone else to take charge. The other characters were just as deplorable and forgettable. It's hard to like a movie when no one deserves to survive.Oh well, at least the camera work was well done, even though you can't take many views of sand before it gets boring.

		<fullReview>Overall, too predictable. I love how drama is so often established by having a lot of people screaming in each others' faces and waving guns around. This then becomes "good writing" with "memorable lines and characters, revealing the truth of humanity." So cliché.This dilemma is part of the reason why I also hated such blockbusters as Fight Club, The Boondock Saints, and Magnolia.Keep: *Miranda Otto and Giovanni Ribisi. Ribisi's voice and style are unrecognizable, in a good way. I've seen him on Friends and in earlier films such as Sky Captain and The Other Sister - and was completely blown away. He isn't bumbling, but cold and calculating. A real jerk in "Say PLEASE" scene - something I've heard too often from my father, who can also be totalitarian. (Very glad to find I'm not an abnormally screwed up 20-something - these people *are* perceived by the general public as having mental issues.) *Cute irony of "Gimme Some Lovin'".*Scene of crew pulling plane out of the sand, with harnesses strapped to their bodies.*Breathtaking shots of a tiny plane against computerized inclement weather.Lose: *Poorly incorporated nomads. Unless they clearly represent "The Other" and the sum of all fears when stranded in a desert, they seem to have been thrown in gratuitously at the last moment. This irony worked well for Shyamalan in The Sixth Sense, but has failed gloriously in his other flicks - making it seem like a fluke. Problem is, too many writers are now stealing the non sequitur twist.*Screaming queen "drama." Namely, Dennis Quaid.Overall rating: 3/10 A great rental or in-flight movie, few other prospects.</fullReview>

A plane full of people crashes in the Gobi desert, and it is only when the survivors pull together to rebuild the plane that the story momentarily comes to life, if not always believably. Quaid is no Stewart, and the rest of the crowd is generic at best. We might as well be watching one of those endless and badly made airplane disaster movies of the 1970s. Remember the one with Dean Martin as a pilot? But I digress. PHOENIX 2004 is an absolutely unnecessary remake of a great original that holds up much better than this trifle. They shot this in Africa?

		<fullReview>Flight of the Phoenix (2004) is remake of Robert Aldrich's gutsy 1965 original and is inferior in every respect. The use of music is particularly poor: where the original was blessed with a strong orchestral score by the vastly underrated Frank DeVol, here we are saddled with irrelevant excerpts from the back catalogues of Johnny Cash and The Black-Eyed Peas. We also get lot of pumped-up noise, courtesy of Marco Beltrami. One particular scene, where our heroes are creeping up on a bunch of killer tribesmen, could probably have done without music at all. At the very least Mr Beltrami could have come up with something appropriately suspenseful. Instead, what do we get ? Massive Attack. Now, there's a time and a place for Massive Attack, but this surely isn't it. By contrast the original used Connie Francis' rendition of 'Senza Fine' in one scene to great effect.The sound mixing is terrible: dialogue is frequently rendered inaudible by sound effects, but that's forgivable seeing as most of it's so hackneyed anyway.There is no-one to root for in this movie ? none of the actors, Dennis Quaid excepted, seem capable of adding the nuances to their characters that would make us care whether they lived or died. In the original for example the Hardy Kruger character starts off as a typical Teutonic automaton, but by the end we have a grudging admiration for him. In this version the equivalent character, Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi, looking like a grown-up 'Village of the Damned' kid), is a thoroughly nasty little martinet who grows more ruthless and unpleasant as the film progresses. At one point I expected him to start yelling 'Who run Bartertown?' at the top of his voice.****SPOILERS AHEAD**** The gaffes and inconsistencies in the screenplay are too numerous to list fully ?a couple will suffice. Firstly, for a bunch of oil workers supposedly used to functioning in hostile environments their knowledge of health and safety is non-existent. Witness the use of cutting equipment near drums of aviation fuel. Witness also the way characters just wander off into the desert without adequate head covering or are able to perform hard physical labour under the harsh Gobi desert sun without breaking sweat.The final climactic 'take-off' sequence is the most ludicrous of all: we watch our heroes desperately attempt to start the plane's engine whilst hoardes of evil-looking horsemen watch malevolently from the crest of the hill, poised to attack. And when do they decide to mount their attack? At the very moment when the plane is actually taking off. Ridiculous! Dennis Quaid is a fine actor and is always worth watching. Other than that, this one crashes and burns ? 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to not only be inspiring, but to also give us a good perspective of how people will do anything with hope, and when that hope disappears they will totally lose any hope, and that shines out, both when they agree they will build it, and you really see how they have a new energy, and when they find out he is a model airplane builder, when they lose hope, and you see them actually lose all there energy. I found most of the acting excellent but some effects were little unbelievable. for instance the wing smashing the chef and him living through that, I still don't get what was supposed to happen there. Over all i think this was a great movie, but since i did not watch the original, I don't know if they met the standards of the original or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Remake that Trumps the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original was one of my favorite popcorn films when I was a kid. I was surprised at how superior this film was to the original. I rented the original and watched it at the same time with my family of a 9, 11 , 13 year old and my wife and me. I suspect many critics here did not actually re-watch the original. This movie is far superior because of a bigger budget and modern special effects, two key elements in an action movie like this. The entire family enjoyed it more than the original. Plus we were comfortable watching it as a family, with just a few PG curse words uttered.Both movies use a similar plane, a world war II era cargo carrier- a C82 in the original and a later more powerful version of the C82, a C119 in the remake. The new filmmakers found the only remaining airworthy C119 and restored it to gleaming aluminum perfection and flew it 75 hours overseas to the Gobi desert.The opening five minutes of the new film showing the glistening rare C119 flying over the Gobi desert to the sound of Johnny Cash is breathtaking.In contrast, the original had a 1960s era low budget and used an Arizona outlot. There are very few shots of the C82 in the air. And in 1965 the C82 was just some run of the mill nondescript cargo plane. Today the restored C119 is a one of a kind lost treasure from our past and the producers of the new film make the restored C119 a centerpiece of the early action.The plot of both films is nearly identical. It is true that the new film goes overboard in stuffing in too much contrived action. But film making in the 21st century seems to demand extra action and effects and this movie does not go overboard in that context.The two lead actors in both movies--Quaid and Ribisi and Stewart and Kruger are both excellent in their roles. Unfortunately some of the other actors in the original comically overacted. Watching Richard Attenborough feign madness as he laughs uncontrollably was painful. And Ernest Borgnine, dying early in the desert, makes you wince.At least the supporting cast in the new film remain nondescript and perform their roles in a workmanlike manner.The special effects makes the crash scene much more exciting in the new film. The original used the convention of that era of having actors shake, toss and turn in a studio mockup with filmed landscape in the background to simulate air travel. Yes the new film too could have done better with some of the computer graphics--the sandstorm was overdone and some of the crash effects are not realistic, but hey Hollywood tends to go overboard for drama right? And the original had some inexplicable scenes as well--notice how Jimmy Stewart and Richard Attenborough wear their heavy leather flight jackets in the desert sun.Someone here commented here that the original at least shows the real "Phoenix" flying--well yes sort of. The plane was crashed in filming by a drunk stunt pilot--Paul Mantz, doing a touch and go. As a result, the film uses a substitute Phoenix in two later shots, showing an obviously different plane. Those sort of oversights are overlooked by memories of an old film clouded by time....The old movie does trump the new movie in the climatic engine cartridge scene.Both flicks are great popcorn action movies. But the new one, thanks to special effects and filing in the Gobi desert with a restored C119 is the more enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam's club had this on sale with the original as a double feature, so I was able to see both, back-to-back. This is a fairly faithful remake (isn't that a refreshing change!), and so comparisons were easy. I hadn't seen the original in many years, so it was like seeing both of them fresh. I'm going to assume that everyone already knows the basics of the plot, so I'll stick to execution in this review.The pacing in the new version is faster, and this both helps and hurts. At times, the original seemed so deliberate, I felt like I was stuck with them in the desert for weeks on end. This time, it moves right along. This compresses some plot elements and slights others.Dennis Quaid's portrayal of the pilot is a much more sympathetic character than Jimmy Stuart's. There's no one in the remake who exactly corresponds to the Richard Attenborough character from the original and he is missed. Giovanni Ribisi plays the engineer originated by Hardy Kruger in the original and does well enough with the part. None of the secondary characters are as distinct and well developed as in the original and that is missed. There was variety in the secondary characters of the original, but this group is more blandly homogeneous. Miranda Otto is a welcome addition, but I like to think she could have done better for her first major post-LOTR film.Also missing is the play-by-play of the actual engineering and physical effort required to cannibalize the old plane into a new one. Aside from giving short shrift to the technoids in the audience, it diminishes the accomplishments of the characters.What's added is a more significant role for the marauding bandits who represent the human threat. Whether this is good or bad is a matter of taste. I considered it simply a choice and have no strong preference one way or the other. It did, however, set up the film's most jarring plot element involving the engineer's character. Regardless of the role played by the bandits, this one scene was, IMHO, a mistake.So what's the verdict? It's not a bad film nor a bad remake. What is bad, however, is the really loud and intrusive background music. Marco Beltrami has scored some other movies where his music detracted much more than it added, but this is a new low even for him. Overall, the original is a safer bet. OTOH, if this were re-edited with a different (or at least more subdued) sound track, it could be a toss-up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mentioned before that I like Dennis Quaid's movies. Well, with the exception of this one. For a film to be realistic, the researchers have to get certain basic facts right. I believe somebody has already mentioned about a glaring mistake - in that tribesmen in Mongolia or the fringes of Mongolia do NOT speak Cantonese. Apart from that, there were many factual errors - geographical and otherwise. That aside, let's get back to the film itself. If you are looking for a good 'disaster movie' where courage and perseverance triumph. where selfishness emerge, where love suffices, then this is not the movie for you. The storyline is pathetically non-existent. The characters have no depths whatsoever and at the end of the movie, you still are unable to even pinpoint to any particular characteristics of any of the characters. The movie gives the impression that the whole film was made in haste - and perhaps so. The actors and actress seemed totally disinterested and this was manifested in their body gestures and expressions in the film. There is no attempt whatsoever to develop a theme nor is there an attempt to develop any of the characters. And one parting shot - the sandstorm seems looks reminds me of when I was little, I would fly a 50 cents toy airplane over some sand and grass which I constructed in a box and made belief that I was flying over a desert. A totally disappointing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give it 5 stars out of 10.While I give this 5 stars, it is a strong five stars. This is a action plus adventure type of movie. It entertains without being overly cerebral. The problem is that it is nothing great and you probably will like it when you see it but will forget anything about it a few days later.The story takes place in Mongolia where an oil exploration is going but when no oil is found, Dennis Quaid is a pilot who is sent to pick up the group and send them back home. After they were picked up, they run into a sandstorm and the plane goes down but they were unable to send a distress call before this is done. They have limited provisions and is in a middle of a desert. Tempers fly among the group on what to do and this is coupled with dangerous encounter with a nomadic group that wants to kill them.The problem I had with this movie is that it had too much cliché and not enough substance. For example, there was a scene where it seems everyone is taking off their shirts to flex their bodies for the camera. This would be OK if it was a Governor Schwarzenneger movie but it was not. While Dennis Quaid and others were in good shape but they are not going to win a bodybuilding championship.Again, it's not a bad movie. It's actually a great video movie. Therefore, wait for it on video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flight of the Phoenix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marc my reviewFlight of PhoenixBy: Marc SiubaJanuary 1, 2005 I saw Flight of Phoenix at the Rancho Santa Fe theatres. Flight of the Phoenix is an intense movie about a group of plane crash survivors who have to battle the elements of the fierce Mongolian desert in order to stay alive, but the intense desert heat is not the only obstacle that they have to overcome. The group must survive rapidly decreasing supplies and to make things worse a group of desert bandits who show no mercy.Flight of the Phoenix was a great, white-knuckle movie. It stared Dennis Quaid as Frank Towns the strict pilot and Tyrese Gibson as A.J. the Co-pilot. Dennis Quaid was a very strong choice for this roll, he presents his character with a cockiness but very humorous personality and as you progress throughout the movie he sees how hopes and dreams are just enough to keep a man alive. Giovanni Ribisi plays a very outstanding roll as the quiet but brilliant man who after standing in the background for most of the movie, suggest that they rebuild the plane.The movie was a must see for all who enjoy stories of overcoming the elements and out door thrills. I left the theatre laughing. Overall I would give this movie a strong 7 or 8. Thank you for reading Marc My Review B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good adventure survival film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Flight of the Phoenix Saturday night and thoroughly enjoyed it. The special effects were wonderful and the acting was great. I am a big fan of Dennis Quaid, and he did a great job in the role of Frank Townes. Taking a role that the icon Jimmy Stewart had is not easy but Dennis did it admirably, and Stewart would have been proud the way it turned out. Giovanni Ribisi was in top form as Elliot, and the rest of the cast played their roles well. A lot of people have compared it to the original, but it is really unfair to do so. The original came out in 1965 when we were still in the Cold War, and WWII was a recent memory. There were also more character actors, and there was the German in Ribisi's role. This cast is multi ethnic and there is a woman, reflecting the advances made in society since then. It certainly doesn't detract from the movie and you don't think about it while watching. There is more action in this version, but that is not a bad thing. The desert scenes were fantastic. I actually came out of the movie thirsty! LOL! I just wish they had left the movie in October, as there are so many films out now, it will get lost in the shuffle. If you are a fan of survivor movies, go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer left me stoked about this film, but I felt compelled to leave about an hour into it. "The Flight" is nothing short of a bad episode of "The Junkyard Wars." Quaid seems convincing as the cynical countermeasure to Ribisi's daring enthusiasm, but the dire lack of story development and one too many Hollywood clichés make this film an absolute bore. But then again, how much action can be expected from a 'stuck-in-the-middle-of-nowhere' film? Just when it seemed like "Cast Away" had drained this genre dry, they dug up a scheme cool enough to get people to see "The Flight" -- an ingenious idea of building one plain out of another. Although visually convincing, this film does not deliver the bang for the buck I expected after seeing the trailer, which ultimately left me feeling cheated. I'd much rather see the cast eat their way out a cheesecake, than watch them getting out of a desert.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of building a flyable aircraft out of a plane wreck is a fine plot for a movie. Obviously so, I suppose, since this "Flight of The Phoenix" is a contemporary-setting remake of the classic 1960's film.The film, however is effectively ruined by the actors, their lines, and the unbelievable characters they portray.When we first meet Captain Towns (played, ineptly--as is his wont--by Dennis Quaid), he has no apparent redeeming qualities. He is sexist, heartless, overbearing, willful and utterly without judgment.When faced with a severe sandstorm, he refuses to turn back to base because he would have to refuel?"and who knows how long that will take." He and his obnoxious co-pilot berate the hapless oil crew they are pulling off their jobs, then proceed to make several more stupid decisions, at least one of them in the face of good advice. Then they crash the plane.Towns refuses to allow the survivors to follow the advice of Elliot?one of the passengers who clearly knows what he is talking about. Then, despite Towns's knowledge that there are dangerous marauders in the area, he decides later to try to parley with them.When Elliot turns out to have credentials as an aircraft designer and suggests rebuilding the plane, Towns vetoes the plan?as if he has the authority to do so.The copilot also threatens to kill Elliot if he mentions that it was Towns's poor judgment that caused the crash in the first place.In short, the pair of aviators is irredeemably despicable. And yet, clearly we are supposed to see Towns as the macho hero, with the woman he disses falling all over herself complimenting him.Meanwhile, Elliot--who at first seems sensible and deferential--begins acting like a spoiled brat--for no reason that is made clear--and is obviously supposed to be a loose cannon. His character, like that of most of the others, flip flops in unpredictable ways that have no discernible motivation. Indeed, the whole multi-ethnic, multi-class, multi-generation crew of characters is the same witless group that Hollywood has been using in war flicks since the thirties?with a woman thrown in as a sop to modern feminist sensibilities.The only things that save this picture are the desert scenery, the scenes of the ingenious construction of the Phoenix, and the aerial footage. The rest is pure B movie.</fullReview>

Well, in my humble opinion, Dennis Quaid and crew do an every-bit-as-good-if-not-even-better version with this dynamite action movie!! The special-effects are also a big star here; the sequence of the plane flying into the storm, losing it's propeller and eventually crashing are thrilling and exciting to watch! As they start to rebuild the plane into a flyable unit, I liked to see the emotions and conflicts among the survivors and how they come together to overcome the desert and the forces of Nature. The directing and camera movement added a more realistic touch, making the movie more realistic and "gritty". Also an excellent soundtrack kept the pace tight and hard-edged!

		<fullReview>From a big budget Hollywood film, there are a couple things that you can expect: Half-decent actors and good basic CGI. Despite being a big-budget Hollywood film, this had neither. The view from the cockpit looked about as realistic as the driving in old sit-coms does. Dennis Quaid usually gives an OK performance, but mostly due to the awful script he is pretty bad in this one. Really, I think the script was the biggest downfall of the whole movie. The characters had no depth whatsoever, most of the lines were awful, and it even made actors that are typically very good look very, very bad, EX- David Quaid and Hugh Laurie. The only somewhat well written character was one of the least likable characters I've seen in a very long while. The action moves way to fast, there is no time what-so-ever for anything to develop. Plot items are introduced, then forgot about entirely. This movie doesn't even work as a mindless time-killer, I don't recommend it in the least. After seeing this, I'm more worried than ever about The Omen remake. They are directed by the same person...all I can say is be afraid. Be very afraid...3.5/10</fullReview>

The version with Jimmy Stewart and Hardy Krüger is an excellent adventure movie. And you can't make an fabulous actor like Krüger out of 'a Ribisi' - even if you color his few hairs blonde... It is a boring trend, that the authors have no new ideas and use the same theme again and again. This version tries to copy and at the same time make it politically correct for the present time. That does not work. Spare your money = don't't watch the new version in cinema, buy the old one on DVD. To compare wait, until the new one is in TV.</fullReview>

Even after Germany decided no to support us in the war. I am even half German. The list goes on, and on and on.....The worst thing about this movie was that there were "No Characters" in this movie! No one was distinct in having a certain type of personality that stood out. Everything now has a Hollywood agenda....And I am sick to death of it! The best thing I can say about this movie is that the crash scenes and flying scenes were well done! This movie also laked an interesting turn in the story, at several times in the movie. What happened to this movie? It needs to be completely re-done. At least the creators and directors of the film can feel good about not offending anyone...I thought I was watching a Disney Movie at some points.

The supporting actors more than carried their weight, especially the role of the airplane designer. He was weaselly and annoying, but it worked for the plot. The target shoot for which the dead oilman was used seemed to accurately portray how the average non-American in a foreign land sees us these days.

		<fullReview>One of Britain's most popular post-war novelists, Elleston Trevor's work was hallmarked throughout by superb writing, great plotting, and strong characterisation. Little wonder, then, that 'Flight of The Phoenix' was snapped up for the movies nigh on half a century back.Now the book and the original screenplay derived from it are reborn again in this new version, which for value-for-money possibly exceeds the novel's published price by offering not merely an aviation disaster but a cinematic disaster as well.A failed "entertainment" from beginning to end, this is a Phoenix which ought to be mandatory viewing for every student enrolled in every film school, a dismal stringing together of visual and narrative clichés lit by a directorial illumination that goes from dim to extinguished within the first 15 minutes of screen time.The characters are invested with nothing at all to excite an audience's sympathies and the performers do nothing at all to make amends -- including Quaid, who evidently took his role too literally and thus stays on auto-pilot throughout.One of the great performances of the original movie was Hardy Kruger's: sly, confident, abrasive, yet vulnerable. One of the worst performances of this movie is by the actor recruited to Kruger's role: even the most cursory glance at Trevor's original text shows that he neither wrote nor intended the 'saviour' of the stranded group to be a demented Hobbit.Not for the first time where remakes are concerned do you get to wonder how such projects are ever green-lit.Score: zero out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Flight of the Phoenix is a remake of the 1965 film of the same name starring James Stewart. Captain Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid) pilots a C-119 cargo plane full of oil workers who are returning home after shutting down an oil field in Mongolia's Gobi Desert. The plane is overloaded on take off, and soon they hit a violent sandstorm that causes them to crash. They are now stranded over 200 miles off-course and in the harsh desert terrain. Frank must maintain order and ration the little food and water among the survivors and wait for someone to rescue them. As time goes by, they realize their chance of being rescued is zero. An odd man named Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi) who caught a ride with them suggested that they build a new plane out of parts from the undamaged cargo plane. He just happens to be a plane design engineer. They think he is crazy, but what else can they do. Under Elliott's command, the survivors begin to construct the plane, which they name the Phoenix. This is a good action-adventure that shows what people can do to survive. It will make you feel happy that we live in America with plenty of water and food. The sandstorm crash scene was great action. The ending, which reveals Elliott's true identity, is very funny. (20th Century Fox, Run time 1:53, Rated PG-13) (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's really sad that many of the twenty &amp; thirty-somethings don't take the time to watch some truly great classic movies made before they were born. And that doesn't mean only todays young crowd. Every generation has the "There was only darkness before I was born." bunch. Todays movie crowd seems to crave (and Hollywood pushes) the technogeek special effects that permeate todays movies. This really takes away the imagination the viewer had in the past before all the graphic imagery was force fed to the optic nerve. Sheesh! Flight of the Phoenix (1965) was so much better than this cheap ripoff made today. Save your money and don't even buy this DVD. If you really want to see the difference between a good movie and a bad copy, watch the '65 version (where they used a real airplane and the stunt pilot REALLY died) and follow with this sad excuse of a movie. I bet you don't watch more than forty five minutes. No amount of great acting could have possibly saved this movie from what has become the technological special effects gutter we seem to have today. I've said once and I'll say it again, computer GeeWiz imagery alone don't make a great movie. The movie has to able to carry itself with great acting, character development, writing and directing without the added effects.Happy movie watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps this will play better on TV but for now, on the big screen this film sort of misses.You ever watch a movie thats really good or should be, but just misses the mark by inches? Its so close that it straddles the line between watchable and something you don't need to bother with?The remake of the Jimmy Stewart film walks that line and never quite gets off it. Its neither fish nor fowl, neither bad nor good. Its indecision keeps you distant. Had it been a fair movie or a good movie it would have been watchable instead it just sort of is there, never connecting with anyone outside of itself.A final decision will have to wait to be made upon a second viewing but for now I simply feel put off by it. Wondering who these people are and why should I care.I should note that I really don't like the original version of this movie. That film is a not very good stock Hollywood star epic thats wildly over rated by most people. This is for me, an improvement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(I would like to preface this by saying that, due to a Netflix induced conundrum, I watched this remake before seeing the original 1966 film. That being said...) I thought this was an outstanding movie. It was extremely intense and even more dramatic than I suspected, but in the end it was an amazing movie. Giovanni Ribisi stands out as a weird little egomaniac who dominated the movie. He was unbelievable in his role! Ribisi does an amazing job of breaking all stereotypes we've placed on him to play this quiet, awkward, mousy little man. The writers and directors did an amazing job of shining light on the darkest parts of the human heart that we all try to keep hidden. They force us to look in on ourselves and recognize our hearts in one of these characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing could save the screenplay...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a bigger budget and some good actors, what could go wrong...? Well, foremost the screenplay. Especially in comparison to the original, its characterizations is weak. The actors do their best to lift this bird off the ground, yet with sometimes awful lines, this is a rather fruitless effort. The drama doesn't feature the emotional impact it's predecessor delivered, which is sad considering that all the good lines come from there...Also annoying were some rather stupid plot holes and cheesy stereotypes introduced by new ideas. At a raid, the US boys shoot better with pistols than foreign mercenaries with Kalashnikovs? Sure. The mercenaries carry barely any water in a desert, still they have several horses, which are prone to drink a lot? Why not. Oh, and about horses: After living on palm hearts and canned peaches for several days, nobody thinks of the idea of having some horse steak? I would for sure, damn-it...Finally i was surprised that the special effects weren't up to par. The sandstorm at the start of the movie, the reason of the crash, looked rather poorly composed.Anyways: If you don't know the original, it's watchable. Just don't expect anything special. And if you do know the original, expect a weak remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's really only thing about this movie that's absolutely excellent: Giovanni Ribisi's performance. It's brilliant how his character keeps walking tightrope between misunderstood genius and cold-blooded villain, he's pretty much the only character that seems worth caring about. As for the rest of them well, they're just there too. Randy Quaid's tough guy is about as bland as tough guys get, Hugh Laurie's talents are wasted, and the female main character is so useless that her whole character just feels like an afterthought. As for the plot, it isn't really as much focused on internal conflicts as it is on confrontations with local gangsters, which is somewhat sad. It's a bit cheap, and it eventually leads to a big facepalm of an ending. The movie's never boring, but it's never that good either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of the 1965 film 'Flight of the Phoenix' messes up its execution. The opening crash sequence is impressively edited and the climactic sequence works well too. It's the mid-section that's flawed. We don't really care for these characters and that means we aren't too invested in the outcome. Its still decent and the Special Effects remain watchable. Yet the dialog is clichéd and the pace sags. Giovanni Ribisi and Miranda Otto rise above the material and are interesting to watch. Dennis Quaid is dull. No one else leaves much of an impression.

		<fullReview>Remake of Robert Aldrich's 1965 film about plane crash survivors in the desert, menaced by Nomad tribe while attempting to rebuild the fuselage of their aircraft. Here, Dennis Quaid plays the ornery pilot picking up a wily group of oil-tanker workers in Mongolia, including a female (not a product of the original, but a nice touch here). They run into a hellacious storm just over the border into China and fly too high, breaking up their C-119 and leaving them without much food or water. The whiplash crash-landing is an amazing bit of film, sudden and ferocious, but what happens after that is pure formula. If you're attuned to the survival techniques inherent in the plot, or to the testy camaraderie between the mates, you're apt to enjoy the film. The performances are certainly solid, however they don't lend much believability to the final scenes, which play like a Disney feature. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dunno if anyone really got 'the point' of the original, but it seems to have been about the flightcrews descent into insanity. I found it pretty boring to be honest (as nearly all films about the slow and painful process of delving into insanity are), despite the realism.This new version didn't really convey any of this well, (I've never seen a properly setup 4 stroke engine fire more than 10 or so strokes and then suddenly die for example, and that didn't happen in the original). And now there's a girl? My god! how much more trouble they would have gotten into in the old one if they also had one! Can anyone say 'gangrape', or probably more realisticaly, 'water whore'?!Recent reviewers are very accurate, and its just a really nice (visually) version of the older one with actors you might be more familiar with. I was impressed that they'd kept much of the old dialogue nonetheless - one of the few times Hollywood hasn't insulted their roots by turning it into some misguided Christian/Disney moral. I can't decide if this was better or worse than the original. Perhaps just wait 'till a good film crew gets their hands on the concept, because it truly is a brilliant story; reminds me of something Roald Dahl would have written. That's pretty much the only reason either version is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So we have yet another inferior remake of a fine original.This time Dennis 'wooden-face' Quaid attempts to fill the shoes of James Stewart. And he doesn't come close. He can't; he's not in the same league. Following him is about as lacklustre a bunch of nonentities as ever fouled-up a movie. Compared to the original fine character ensemble, we have performances that are as striking, individual and memorable as the sand-dunes themselves. Hugh Laurie potters about with his simpering smirk, demonstrating once again that as a straight actor he's useless. The rest just came to nothing.Who on earth could possibly hope to supplant, Richard Attenborough, Peter Finch, Ernest Borgnine, George Kennedy, Ian Bannen, and Ronald Fraser - not to mention Hardy Kruger? Oh-yes, we got some excellent special-effects. The sandstorm was very impressive. And the crash was far more dramatic than that of the 1965 version, which - being the only drama on offer - was milked for all it was worth. Whereas in the original, Aldrich simply slotted it in with the credits and got on with the story. Narrative events were reprised with such fidelity that there were no surprises to come. It was formulaic in the extreme. Politically-correct adjustments included a broader racial mix, and a young female offered some token sex-interest (though she didn't do anything for me). The desert was filmed to better effect, with its full austere beauty displayed in glorious pans and rich colour. Otherwise the editing was rather hurried, the script absolutely wretched, the cast as mentioned. Character portrayal was extremely shallow, especially as this was supposed to be a character-driven drama. I knew no more about these schmucks as people at the end of the movie than at the beginning. And frankly; I didn't care to. There was almost nothing likable about any.The phoenix eventually flew, and the survivors got away, with a whole tribe of bandits chasing them along the sand like Indians pursuing a stagecoach. Oddly; despite not being sure where they were, and having no compass to guide them, they still managed to find their way back to the oil installation. Good ol' special-effects again, I guess.Don't waste your time with this one. Some 40 years ago Robert Aldrich directed the movie about as well as ever it could be done. He had a first-rate script, and a group of players - any one of whom could have acted the socks off the entire cast from this twaddle.And yet, in one way, it is half-believable. The shallow, selfish, superficial stupidity manifest by these players might truly be a sign of our times. Well, I know which generation of survivors I'd sooner be marooned with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't watched the original, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's superior. The fare for me amounted to nothing more than the two hours of sparse attention, and leaving it on the TV as it aired rather than putting something else on. If yours looks to be much more, seriously consider if it's worth it. Let's examine this... we've got a fine cast who certainly have proved their ability to turn in marvelous performances, yet this managed to avoid evoking much emotion from me at all(if any, really). We've got a character so indescribably irritating that one might think that it was played by Jack Black and/or Jenna Elfman(possibly them both simultaneously). I found MST3King this infinitely more entertaining and engaging than viewing it. The plot is fine, but I didn't find it particularly interesting. Pacing, likewise. Acting isn't bad. I can't claim to find an awful lot of memorable moments in this. The effects vary. They're mostly good. Production values? Can't really complain. The concept isn't bad, and this isn't entirely without reasonable qualities. If you simply must, then by all means, go for it. Surely there are worse out there. I recommend this to fans of the people who made it, and from what I can gather... anyone else who find themselves thinking about it should look to the original first. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched a bit of the old movie on TV sometime ago. It was good. I decided to watch this BECAUSE Miranda Otto was in it. I liked her in Lord of The Rings and wanted to see more of her.I got pretty rogered in that fact! She had nothing much to do except act all prissy because her company was closing down her oil rig and then she starts screaming all the way in the end or whenever something bad happens. What a WASTE of such a good actress! Not to mention beautiful too! I mean, come on! If they wanted a female (when there was no female in the original) just to drive some sexual tension, they could have at least given her some tighter clothes to emphasize her curves! And to hell with PC. If they wanted her to act like a man and all bossy, just give the bloody part to a man! Why make a woman do what she cannot? (Some people may not agree with me on this!) The character of Elliot was bad, they shouldn't have made him American if they wanted him to look like Hardy Kruger in the original! Same blond hair,blue eyes but too psychotic a walk! It looked like he had epilepsy or something! I suppose I could go on and on about how bad this movie is but I won't. I'll sum up my feelings in a few sentences.They should have taken out the black actors or replaced them with someone who was at least credible. They shouldn't have made it look like the Britons in the group are coming apart and the Yanks are holding them together. In the original, both nationalities worked hand in hand and sorted out their differences to build a plane and escape. Hell, they even made friends with a German who looked like a pin-up boy for the Nazis. If they wanted a woman, they should have put her in better clothes to emphasize her curves. Every woman would want that. They should have had an equal number of Brits and Americans on set. They should have stuck with the original premise of killing off the Mexican and not the Scotsman (Hey! The Scots hated the British too! Weren't they like you then?). They should have been more clear with the chronology of events and how many days they survived. They should have used less drama and more acting skills (They had a terrific cast like Miranda, Hugh and Tony) to show character development. They should have ABANDONED BLOODY POLITICAL BULLS**T! Don't watch this movie. Find the original and watch that.Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly, Flight of the Phoenix is just another duff remake. Despite massive advances in special effects and a moderately exciting last two minutes, this feels even longer than Robert Aldrich's much longer original, and the reason is pretty elementary: lack of characterisation and drama. Where Aldrich typically set his flawed protagonists at each others throats in a hostile environment that was driving them mad and dealt with the way the pilot who crashes off-course in the desert turns his guilt into anger at his passengers, this is mostly feel-good stuff, full of life lessons, spiritual slogans and far too much high fiving for any self respecting survival drama - at one point they even get down and boogie. A modicum of drama is thrown in at the last minute in the wake of the key revelation about the new plane's designer, but it's so little and so late that it totters on the edge of laughable. As a result, some good actors and Giovanni Ribisi (horribly overacting the old Hardy Kruger part minus the Nazi undertones) are stranded by committee film-making rather than the elements and poor piloting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad ... problem is, there's not enough good in there either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, the premise was simple but had a fair amount of promise: after a plane crash in the Mongolian desert, the survivors under the leadership of the pilot, Frank Towns, and an eccentric aircraft designer named Elliot band together to build a new plane from the wreckage and fly to safety. Naturally, the potential for character development here is considerable: just imagine the friendships that will be forged, the fights that will break out and the tensions between the small band who know it is a case of do or die. Add the harsh and unpredictable setting and you have the makings of a very absorbing picture.So why isn't it? &gt;Sigh&lt; Well, the film appears to suffer from what I term "Super Supporting Actor Syndrome" where the lead character is effortlessly upstaged by the supporting actors. Dennis Quaid's action credentials are impeccable, and he's no acting slouch but in this film as Frank, the leader of the survivors, he's so much a card-board cutout it isn't even funny. Flint eyed glare? Check. Inspirational speech when things are at their bleakest? Check. Macho restraint? Check. Square-jawed... you get the idea. Plus having witnessed Miranda Otto's dazzling turns in Lord of the Rings, I was left cursing a script that gave her virtually nothing to do as the token woman except stare adoringly at Frank for much of the film.Okay, now I've got all that negative stuff off my chest, on to the film's redeeming factors: the supporting cast are far more interesting and acted with far more depth, though most characters remain underwritten (Hugh Laurie, currently conquering the small screen in "House" is criminally underused, though as good as ever). I thought the fiery Rodney and the rather creepy Elliot were the standouts, though they all do decently. Plus there are some genuinely jumpy moments: the lightning storm, oil explosion and a deadly encounter with some native tribesman being the notable ones. And Elliot grows ever more ruthless as the film progresses - the moment where he shoots a wounded tribesman in the head in cold blood is perhaps the most shocking moment in the film. Plus it seems he might have lied about being an aircraft designer ...But I'm afraid that in the end a few good characters and a few good moments do not necessarily make a good film. Diverting enough to be worth a watch if you catch it on TV, but don't spend your hard-earned cash on it.</fullReview>

When you 're expecting some more intense conflict, you will get a quite soft answer...... For example, in the end of the movie, they spent some days fixing the plane. But when it was stuck in the sand and made everybody so desperate, they pulled the plane out in 1 minute. in the climax of taking off the cliff, those native people just appeared.

I never saw the original Flight of the Phoenix and I didn't know much about the story, so I was surprised to hear that their solution was to build a plane out of the scraps of the wrecked plane. I was pleasantly surprised that there were no bitter rivalries amongst the survivors just to make more drama. I was also glad that they didn't contrive a romantic relationship between the only woman and the captain. And though there was a nerd amongst them to have the know-how to make a plane out of the wreckage his character was very interesting.As for the dramatics to actually make it a movie since everything can't be a utopia, there was the fuel loss, water shortage, electrical storm, sand storm, and desert bandits. I think the desert bandits at the end was a bit too predictable thereby detracting from the movie some. But overall it is was worth watching twice.</fullReview>

But the director is ultimately responsible, who has the 'characters' on a plane and crashing so quickly that the audience doesn't have time to give a damn whether they live or die."I liked him better when he was just humming," says Quaid's Captain Towns about Giovanni Ribisi's quiet, uptight character at one point. Interesting about this is that at no point in the movie does Ribisi hum anything. Maybe he did once and I missed it, but that's not significant enough for another character to comment on. It's sloppy film-making, and shows the director didn't care about the movie any more than I did.Stuff blows up, guns go off, planes crash. Usually this happens for no reason, but if you like that sort of thing, go for it. Though I really liked the music, the movie was really just a paycheck for everyone involved, and could have been much better in the hands of someone who gave a damn. Maybe that was Jimmy Stewart, I don't know, I'll have to check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rent the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the 1965 classic, starring James Stewart and Richard Attenborough. In this updated version, Dennis Quaid plays Frank Towns, a cargo plane pilot hired to re-locate a group of oil riggers after their drilling site was closed due to lack of oil production. During the flight back home, the plane encounters a sever sandstorm over the Mongolian desert, which forces the plane to crash land.Towns and his motley crew of misfits must formulate a feasible plan of survival to accommodate their limited supplies that they have on hand. Crude calculations determine that walking to civilization is not a possibility, and waiting for rescue would only allow for 30 days of rationed supplies. However, a peculiar passenger named Elliot played by Giovanni Ribisi devises a plan to rebuild a new plane from the wreckage of their old cargo plane. Thank God that that the cargo plane used by Towns was a Fairchild C-119 with twin propeller engines, or the movie would have ended at the 32-minute mark of this 113-minute escapade. A-n-y-w-a-y-s?..To make matters worse, a nomad clan of Mongolian marauders stumbles upon wreckage of the plane. In an attempt to reason with these diabolical desperadoes , Towns and his crew gather the nerve to head over to their encampment; a shootout erupts in which all but one of the miscreants are killed. Guess who returns with friends later in the film? Hmmmmmmmm, ?... I wonder?????? In the end, the film becomes a race against time, the elements, and the Machiavellian horde as to who will prevail. But you can probably figure out the ending for yourself. All in all, this is not a bad film, though it's not a good one either. My suggestion is to rent the original, because you will enjoy it so much more. http://farisreel.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being back at University again I find that my writing has lost its feel and I need the practice. Let me know if I still have the feel? This movie is interesting, and captivates the viewer! The acting is strong, and the story is believable. I do not know if the physics is correct? The director keeps the pace fast enough to keep the story from being bogged down. This story could has gone easily astray. The viewer needs to know very little about the character than what is given. When watching one finds out what they need to know when it is important. I remember seeing this film when I was 5 and only remember the ending. Flight of the Phoneix is a neat film; yeah that is the only word that can describe this film. 7 out of 10. If you like you could go to the show. Flight of Phoenix is a definite rental in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Presumably a film made for people with low intellect. This has to be one of the worst, most formulaic films made in a very long time. Nothing happened that was not obvious. The facial expressions, the hand gestures - something out of a junior school play.At first I thought it was a spoof on the original or the work of amateurs but no amateur would make such a bad film. I only carried on watching it because I was fascinated by its awfulness. I feel sorry for the cast and technicians involved and hope the money made up for their shame. I feel for the camera operator who broke his leg - presumably adding to the pain he felt at what he was seeing through his lens.But then, hey ho, American films can often the worst in the world and this is just another example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seems to have been a veritable plague of unreasoned remakes of classic films over the past several years. Doubtless "Spartacus" was the worst, but "Flight" fares little better. Repositioning the tale from the Sahara to the Gobi doesn't give an excuse for this cobbled up disaster of a flick. (Do they have monster sand storms in the Gobi?) Replacing a class act (Stewart, Attenborough, Finch, Borgnine, Kruger, Duryea, Kennedy) with this bunch of B-movie wannabes augmented with some really, really poor CGI ("The Mummy" had much better sandstorms) should have at least made them think about changing the name of this horror of a film. No, I really didn't like it.</fullReview>

I thought this movie was alright, it didn't blow me away, but it did keep me wanting to watch more even though the ending was slightly predictable. I mean we all knew that they would get out of there alive and everything but what made the movie so interesting was that the movie was kinda fun to see what I would do in the given situation. Denis Quaid did a very good job of portraying his role as the "I know everything about planes and everyone else is wrong" genre but over all the movie was fun but nothing to ooooh and ahh about. Overall i'd give it 5/10 stars because it was predictable but it did keep me wanting more.</fullReview>

In the new version we have a woman, and a few more black actors.As was said by other reviewers that the beginning of the film was great, but when the action started on the ground it sank. I agree, one of the beautiful aspects of the original was the fact that at least you saw how they can make an airplane out of the old one. But here we are left clueless.Once again when the Americans make a film, and there are also British actors in it, you know that no Americans will die in that film, everyone else yes, but no Americans ( see The Great Escape ). So a good story once again ripped apart by the studio thinking they know what we want to see. Pity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are times when you start watching a film, and only continue in the hope that it is going to get better, simply on the basis that it could not continue as badly as it started.This is such a film.Dennis Quaid sleep walks through his performance.Hugh Lawrie is hopelessly miscast, his squeaky contributions teetering on the comic - when in fact they are laughable. I have no problem with remakes.Stories retold for a different generation can be powerful and resonate with their time - "Titanic" and "Cape Fear" are good examples.Yet this is not a poor remake.It is just a poor film. The premise for the film - that the survivors of a desert plane crash can create a new flying machine from the wreckage, requires suspension of disbelief.This can be achieved if the acting and the direction is strong enough, The film fails on both counts.The special effects aren't, the set pieces are predictable, the "action" is lumpen. Don't waste an hour and 49 minutes of your life on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow!Where to begin with this poor excuse of a movie?The Dennis Quaid character is a jerk,and has no sight of the real issues at hand.Several people who were just discharged from their jobs at an oil drilling site are flying home.Before take-off,it is made abundantly clear that their weight capacity is met when they allow the eccentric Elliot(Giovanni Ribisi)on-board.Elliot supposedly overloads weight capacity of this twenty year old plane that looks already damaged,and while the plane is crossing the Gobi desert,they hit a rock formation,and unable to recover,go down.This movie is a human story,so for the action buffs,there's few exciting moments,and for sympathizers,there's no character to feel sorry for.Everyone is so egotistical and the clashing of egos when near death is upon them,was absurd.Quaid was the most annoying because he basically takes credit for the saving of the people,and when blame is issued,he virtually receives none for his wrong doing.The smartest character is Elliot,and when the smartest character is the most hated by the very people he's trying to save,no one can save this dismal film.I suggest that those who see this film be ready not to take it so seriously,and enjoy my personal favorite scene when they show the body of the guy who wanders out during a sand storm.Apparently in the desert,you compose to near skeleton after about an hour or two after death.Good for laughs that aren't supposed to be there,but bad for a meaningful story.</fullReview>

Directed by John Moore.A remake of the 1954 Flight of the Phoenix.A cargo plane hits sudden turbulence causing them to uncontrollably crash in the abandoned Gobi dessert. Now miles off course the crew must fight to stay alive and keep their wits about them. The plane or what is left of it after the sandstorm is missing a wing and the back is split in half in lament's terms a broken down piece of crap. Elliot (Bibisi) gives the crew the idea to re build the plane and leave before all the water is gone. Dennis Quaid again gives an emotionless performance like the one Bill Paxton gave in Jan DeBont's Twister. His acting fails to set off that he gives a damn. Flight of the Phoenix is some what of an audience pleaser and keeps you in your seat waiting for more action. Sadly you won't get that much action because they waste more than half the movie building the damn plane. My final rating 6/10. maybe next time Dennis will learn how to act.</fullReview>

This was by far one of Dennis Quaid's best acting jobs and also one of the best movies we have seen him in recently. To be completely honest, this was one of the best movies we have seen in quite some time, every other movie that has been released over the last few years have been so predictable that they have bored quite a few people out of their minds. Its nice to know that someone finally wrote a movie that the ending was wasn't going to be figured out 1/2 way through the movie.

		<fullReview>I was a bit stoked after seeing the remake, I went home and put on my DVD of the original 1965 Flight of the Phoenix. Many of you will laugh, but I've seen the remake twice now. And, not because I thought it was a terrific movie although I did think it was entertaining and overlooked many of it's shortcomings. I went back because I was curious about some of the music soundtrack. At first, I was annoyed by the opening song called "I've Been Somewhere" by Johnny Cash...guess it's country, but then it grew on me and worked the second time around...the words make sense and is perfect for the opening sequence of the C-119 flying over the desert...I really enjoyed this footage/photography of the C- 119. The pilot had to be pretty good as he banked the plane at about 45 degrees in one scene, seemingly to land. Another background oldie at takeoff early in the movie was "Gimmie Some Lovin" by The Spencer Group...the Blues Brothers also did this one and I thought it was perfect for this part. I'm told these two songs aren't on the movie CD soundtrack! Why is that...copyright stuff? Anyway, having seen the original FOTP probably 10 times, I was truly looking forward to the remake. The original is a classic and it's difficult to better this one, but my thinking was that with new special effects we may see some good stuff and I wasn't mistaken, the special effects of the C-119 caught in the sandstorm and crash scene, although a stretch, was fantastic! The remake with Dennis Quaid won't win any Oscars, but I was still entertained and thought some of the new twists were fine. The chase scene at the end of the movie was a rip-off from the chase scene in John Huston's "Stagecoach" with John Wayne where the Indians were chasing the stagecoach in the desert! But that's okay, just another twist from the original. Ribisi's character demanding everyone to say "please" was overkill. When Quaid finally gets the engine started, the reaction by the others watching was not very good acting...they should have taken lessons from the original...there's some great acting when James Stewart gets the engine going...at least one person dropped to the sand on his knees in disbelief...several actors should have received Oscars just for their reaction. I don't think one actor fell to their knees in the remake, not that it's important. When I walked out of the remake the first time, I questioned Quaid's role as Frank Towns, but have since come to grips with it as I like the guy. I also questioned the fact that this C-119 looked like it just came off the assembly line...shiny new metal and such, but then I'm okay with that now. Evidently, someone must take that C-119 to numerous air shows for display. In the original, the C-119 looked like it had been around the block a few times, more used and weather-beaten, so-to-speak. The sandstorms covering up the aircraft was a little overdone...I mean, when the new plane gets almost totally covered near the end, the very next scene shows them pulling the plane down the runway!!! That much sand would have taken days? weeks?...The director should have at least had them on their hands and knees starting to remove the sand from around the plane and then segway to the next scene...oh well. Another post here mentioned the original 1965 film that John Guielgud gave the performance of this life when it was revealed in the movie that the engineer was just a toy plane designer...I don't think John Guielgud was in the original FOTP, he was in the plane crash in Lost Horizon...unless I misunderstood the writers comment! A little trivia...Bill Aldrich was one of the producers of the new Flight of the Phoenix remake...he is the son of Robert Aldrich the director of the original FOTP. Bill Aldrich also had a bit part in the original...his dad cast him as a passenger reading a Playboy magazine, but had a very short part. He did have a couple of lines before his demise. Also, the first FOTP was loaded with great actors, several who eventually got an Oscar for best actor, I believe. Probably one of the best lines from the new Flight of the Phoenix is ..."Well, that settles that!" by Giovanni Ribisi. Overall, an entertaining movie for me. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again I am left wondering - why do they bother with remakes? This was a complete disappointment. Then that ghastly soundtrack of irritating "music?" to forcefeed us with! YUCK! You will have guessed that I've seen the original, they actors back then could make themselves understood without subtitles, there was a coherent character build up and their faces actually showed signs of deterioration after all those days in the sun! The woman in this version hardly showed any signs of wear and tear at all! If all this version had to offer was a clever/clever opening crash sequence then I would have to say that imagination is one area which has NOT shown any advance in forty years. A good remake is a rarity and this one was not. I would be interested in hearing the comments of a younger person who saw this first and THEN saw the 1965 Jimmy Stewart version and hear how they compared the two. I almost feel that if a producer and director get it into their heads to do a "REMAKE" they should change the title of the film. I do feel that they are trading on the good name of the original by blatantly using the name of the first or earlier version. In this modern version I would say that the byline should more accurately be, "never mind the quality, feel the CGI."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What utter disappointment ---- especially in case you know the original movie!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Aldrich's 1965 "The Flight of the Phoenix" is a classic --- in every respect. If you compare the plot lines John Moore's remake is nothing but a flimsy attempt at being fashionable. If you compare Quaid's irritating acting to James Stewart's dignified performance forty years ago, you wonder how Quaid could ever have hoped to do something of any significance at all. What is more, the character of engineer Dorfmann (Hardy Kruger) in the original movie is simply unforgettable. What the 2004 version does with this character is, quite simply, ridiculous to say the least. And, of course, these days in a movie such as this one would expect that stupid bit of a love story --- for Hollywood taste's sake -- or for the sake of Political Correctness, as there is a woman character in what used to be a all-guys film in 1965. But fashionable changes of the wonderful script by Lukas Heller are simply not enough to make a good movie ---- The rest is silence. Just forget about the movie. But see the original one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My fiancé and I were on a road trip in the Southwestern United States and stopped in El Paso, Texas for two nights. Karl (my man) was futzing with the hotel television, trying to get it to work when FOTP started playing. He accidentally bought the pay-per-view, got mad, and told me I had better enjoy this since he ended up paying eight bucks for it. Well... I REALLY enjoyed FOTP! It had the feel of an older action movie... just my type! I dunno... maybe I am getting sick of all the newer action movies that have become so "Matrix"-like, with their highly stylized special effects and over-the-top action sequences. I also have grown weary of the "man versus man" conflict after dealing with a deployment and marrying myself to the NBC Nightly News for a year of my life. I have always found the premise of man versus nature (like this movie) and man versus himself (like Frank Towns's conflict) far more interesting than any other conflict. This movie is about the endurance of the human spirit and John Moore pulled it off nicely. If you like stories about survival in a remote area with limited resources, you might like to read "Wreck of the Medusa" by Alexander McKee. PS: Okay, call me a nerd, a geek or a pip, but, according to my atlas and the clues given to their location; all the people had to do was walk 20 MILES southwest or southeast and they would have run into civilization! Call me on this if I am wrong, though. I'd appreciate it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointment is just one of the emotions felt after viewing this cinematic failure. Frustration, aggravation, and anger could also be used, but mainly it was disappointment. One of the most important rules of making a film is to incorporate believable characters into an unbelievable situation. Flight of the Phoenix proves that you can place unbelievable characters in an unbelievable situation, and the end result will be ? well ? unbelievable (not in a good way). From the very blurry beginning, until the incredibly cheesy ending, this film gives us a taste of Hollywood proving that sometimes creativity, originality, and strong storytelling falls to the wayside to allow for more of Hollywood's leading men the ability to prance around shirtless. From the non-existent acting, to the scattered story, and finally followed by a very predictable and unrealistic ending, The Flight of the Phoenix never really took off to begin with. This was one of those films that tried to stuff as much in as possible without any thought to the five basic questions (who, what, where, when, and why) and thinking of the female drive in replace of a decent story.To tell a good story, you must have a strong leader to guide you through the rough spots. Since Flight of the Phoenix was nothing but rough spots, I was looking forward to having the best leader who would draw my attention away from these distractions. Sadly, there was no leader, thus it forced me to focus on the gaping plot holes and meaningless dribble that happened throughout this film. Dennis Quaid was not the best choice for this picture. To make this film work, you needed to have someone strong, brainy, and a bit egotistical. You needed a leader, not one that would just sit around waiting for a rescue team to arrive. His nonchalant acting (bordering apathetic) never quite meshed well with the other actors. This didn't make him the central focus of the film, but instead turned our focus on Giovanni Ribisi's character. Sadly, nothing was given to us about Ribisi's character throughout the film, so we were forced to see an unknown character acting a bit eccentric. To me it didn't make much sense and lead to the very uneventful climax. With Quaid doing his least and Ribisi going a bit overboard, I would normally look towards the other characters to provide at least one line of enjoyment ? again ? normally ? but not in this case. Instead, what you found was the most diverse cast that I have ever seen, all of which are vying for more screen time. So, each push forward, nothing gets accomplish, the audience looses faith in the characters. Then, you have Miranda Otto. I only section her out because I had no honest clue what her role was in this film other than to provide a female interpretation on what was happening. You can't have all these men in the desert without some woman ? someone is going to be angry, and it will be up to Hollywood to show the diversity. It was pathetic and it felt forced to me.I will give some credit that there was some creativity involved, but it was the overall development and final direction which lost all of the creativity that Flight of the Phoenix may have had going for it. Plane goes down in the desert and a group of people must rebuild before they die of dehydration. Interesting concept, but just not done well. There was too much sitting around and waiting for the first half of the film, where there could have been some decent character development or studies, instead we have these huge long-shots of the desert which is to show the vast nature of their surroundings. This was a great technique to use, but sadly director John Moore created the opposite effect than what he was going for. I understand that he was trying to show the vast landscape and how there was really no way for our ? is heroes to easy of a word? ? to escape the desert. He wanted the feel of the film to be this huge desert, but instead I felt trapped. I felt trapped in a characterless world where the scenery seemed like it should all have "Made in Hollywood" stamped on the back. I just could not grasp the horror that this team was feeling, and while some of that may be the actor's fault, I do feel that Moore had something to do with it as well. His ethics behind the camera, I do believe, hurt the final product of this film.Finally, I cannot complain about this enough, but for me to fall in step with characters, I need to know their names, their weaknesses, and something about their lives. My biggest issue with the film Black Hawk Down and Tears of the Sun was that I didn't know any of the soldiers really well, so when they started dying I didn't know who they were, nor did I care. This is similar to what I felt when I watched this film. I knew only two-three of the characters really well, while the others were extremely expendable. When this happens, and something tragic happens to them, it will not evoke any emotion from you. Most of the time you shrug it off and wait for the next nameless victim. It is sad, but I can add Flight of the Phoenix to the ever-growing list of films that decided to use this technique.Working around films so much I have seen so many patrons rent this film and come back with such glowing remarks. While most loved this film, I cannot agree with them because without decent characters, a stronger story, and a defined reason as to why Miranda Otto was involved with this project, then I cannot say this was a valued film in my book.Grade: * out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Protest randomly execution on locals!! Racist behavior. Disgusting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When they first encounter locals, the nomads do not shoot at them but talk. It is the stupid engineer cry of "my watch" triggers the bloodshed. Remember the nomads NEVER kill an American before this conflict; they looted a dead body and -- let's assume it is nomads though nobody evidence it -- shot at the dead. This is an unethical way of practicing hunting skills, but it doesn't mean nomads should be sentenced death penalty.The worst scene came when the geek shot the wounded nomad given the reason "he just gonna waste two days of water and food and die". Just five minutes ago in the movie the same group of people is willing to spend twice as much as water on their injured comrade. And needless to mention they grabbed some water from the nomad's camp. How do you justify that? Are Mongolian or Chinese sub-human than mighty Americans? Let me twist the script. Now the geek shot the wounded American for the same reason. Do you still think he is a "good guy" and deserve a NASA scientist seat? I am a Chinese and I am shocked by the fact that this obvious shame was totally neglected from American audience. If you begin to understand the question I just raised, you now learn one of the fundamental problems the mighty US bears -- why the rest of world, from Italy to Arab to Oriental, HATE American arrogance. The blatant selfish Uncle Sam with self-explanatory excuses, profit on global resource and market at the expense of the poor foreigners.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Have to Keep Re-Suspending Belief for the Movie to Fly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not see the original "Flight of the Phoenix" so I easily got caught up in the plot twists.I was perfectly willing to suspend belief for the magic of the movies as much as I would with a sci fi/fantasy movie. But I kept being brought up short by discontinuities that just didn't make sense so that I had to keep letting those problems go in order to get caught up again.The visual look of the movie is key to getting involved, both the cinematography and the many special effects, which according to the credits include mattes, models and time lapse photography, among many other techniques, for beautiful shots of desert and wind.It is annoying how very little we learn about the lives of the characters, as we only learn why three of them even have a reason to go home from working in Mongolia for an oil exploration company.It is nice that the actors who are mostly from the British Commonwealth get to use their native accents, such as Australian Miranda Otto, Brit Hugh Laurie (only somewhat less misanthropic than in the TV series "House"), Jacob Vargas as a Chicano, though I don't know why Dennis Quaid doesn't use his native Texas drawl. Giovanni Ribisi is almost unrecognizable in one of his best roles. It's nice to see the appealing Jared Padalecki of "Gilmore Girls" make it to the movies.Though there's a reference to e-mail and PDAs, the soundtrack did little to remind us that the re-make has been re-set in today, with a predominant use of a bombastic score, classic country and rock riffs and only one hip hop song (OutKast's "Hey Yeah"), though it's used effectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dennis Quaid phones it in from China, Giovanni Ribisi from mars....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie suffers deeply in comparison to the original. Where Jimmy Stewart, Richard Attenborough and Peter Finch were willing to commit themselves to the part, to the point of looking like hell -which is what would happen after spending days in blazing heat with rationed water- Dennis Quaid et al, here can't be bothered. At the end of the movie, as they are about to rescue themselves, our intrepid band of Hollywood actors are all seen flashing brilliant white smiles: freshly cleaned teeth, not to mention gleaming well-lotioned skin and tanned and water-fat bodies are in abundance. In 1965, and even today, when watching the original 'flight of the phoenix' one is suffused with a sense of utter dryness... of compounded misery and an ever present tension light dusted with... well, dust. The characters physically and emotionally degraded before our eyes and one could see around the edges of their hope the very real possibility of failure. Because their pain is real and visible, their relief and rescue has impact and emotional heft.In the 'remake' the opposite - the fear of ugly- takes hold: in this movie stunning vistas and beefcake and the completely Hollywood notion that Dennis Quaid and Miranda Otto would look more beautiful at the end of their ordeal than at the beginning rules the plot and steals any conviction or sense of reality. As a movie by itself it is reliable B grade adventure, with a truly weird, but oddly gripping, performance from Giovanni Ribisi. But as a 'remake' or 'homage' it suffers from an abiding shallowness. And if they didn't want to remake the movie they should have called it something else...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Mongolia, the test well of an oil field is shut-down by the company headquarter in Atlanta, and a plane piloted by Captain Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid) is sent to bring the workers back home. While flying over a storm, the plane crashes in the Mongolian desert. When they realize that they will not be rescued, they decide to build a new plane from the wreckage of the old one.I found "Flight of the Phoenix" a great action movie. It is not a documentary, therefore flaws are very acceptable for entertainment purpose, but some IMDb users want to find technical accuracy in a fictional movie. I have not had the chance to see the original movie, and I did not know that this is a remake. Anyway, it is a suspenseful story, with good messages of hope, power of union, fight for survival and triumph of the human spirit. Although I respect, I also totally disagree with the underrated review of this good film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Vôo da F?nix" ("The Flight of the Phoenix")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't heard much about this film prior to watching it, but it had Giovanni Ribisi in (a very talented actor), and a story of deserted survivors looking to....well survive and become un-deserted. So I was obviously quite looking forward to this cinematic treat. How wrong I was, it is the most cliché ridden, undeveloped character driven, cover you eyes embarrassed for the actor's/directed/gaffer/tea boy waste of film I've had the misfortune to watch (and I've seen The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen). Poor Giovanni Ribisi he looked so embarrassed and anxiety ridden trying to figure out what was expected of him, and I really don't think that the director new either, but I think the nail in the coffin for me was when they play Outcasts' Hey Ya, and all start trying to "move" to the tune, F*ck me its bad, soooooooooooo bad.</fullReview>

The musical score is outstanding. And it adds a lot to the movie. The movie is an equal mix of action, adventure, human drama and humor. And it keeps your attention from start to finish. I love the ending in particular it is very exciting.Giovanni Ribisi as Elliott is a stand out in his role as the outsider. And one of the best sequences in the whole movie is in the desert when they confront the marauders. It is a genuinely moving and memorable scene.A magnificent, fun, exciting movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flight of the Phoenix Revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. I have nothing against remakes and personally haven't watched the original in order to make a comparison. I have an issue with two main things, and I think it's what everyone has commented. First, the technical inaccuracies. Some of the action elements: the plane crash, the explosion of the fuel, the electrical storm? then the plot circumstances, the nomads/robbers, the fact they have a chick in the cast? all of these are considered unnecessary by most. I on the contrary, think that remakes are supposed to have a little somethin somethin to add. The elements are GOOD, except that they don't make the most out of them, or they use them in a non-logical way. I would have liked to see more of the internal-external conflict between the characters, and more hopelessness and despair, and that includes leaving the Hey Ya scene out. I would have wanted to see them physically strained too, or some more dying. I would have also loved to see the Phoenix's actual construction from scratch. I know, maybe building a plane out on the desert isn't that realistic but nevertheless, it's the main movie plot, so I guess we should have seen more of this. Having said that, Giovanni Ribisi totally aced this movie. Not only with changing his physical looks (showing commitment to the part), but also on his portrayal of a weird guy, who no one knows nothing about, who might as well turn out to be a serial killer, but who ultimately, ends up being the hero. Other than his looks and the fact that he's a model airplane designer, he's not German, and someone commented that it seems as if he's ashamed of his profession, unlike Krüger's character in the original, and seeing this as a bad thing. I beg to differ. You know that Ribisi's character is up to something, you just don't know what it is. This only adds an element of suspense. Plus, it makes sense. Had he told everyone he was a model plane designer sooner on, they would have never built the plane in the first place, probably. Of course, like the rest of the characters, a more substantial dialogue could've given more room for Ribisi to work on, but even with so little, Ribisi does a lot, and let's not forget? they could've invented something a little bit more revealing or fantastic about how he got to the oil rig in the first place. We see him a little arrogant, yet non-threatening in the beginning. Aloof and quiet while everyone else berates after the plane crash, and as a power hungry little nerd as they build the Phoenix. Then we see him lose it when it becomes apparent, he's the only person in the whole crew with common sense, and yes maybe, is a tad jealous that everyone prefers (to some degree) Towns, as their leader. The "Say Please" scene, is just genius. Beginning with a teary-eyed, snotty-faced Elliot, and ending with a "You-know-you-need-me" kind of glare, this is another moment in which he reassures himself not just as the gang's true leader, but the highlight of the movie. As if the crew are not hating Ribisi's character enough (and for no reason at all if you look at the cold hard facts), the bomb is dropped when they find out he's a model airplane designer. Elliot pleading for his life and shedding a tear when he sees the plane lifting off in the sandstorm is a great moment as well. Then, when Capt. Towns gives ALL OF THEM a "hopes and dreams speech", it seems as if Elliot himself has lost all hope. It is only during this moment I would daresay, we get to see the desolation that should've reigned all over. After barely making when pulling the plane, it is on this scene that we see Capt. Towns and Elliot reconcile and I love it. I don't know if that happens in the original, but I think it's just one of those "great movie moments" in which there's some sort of release. After the Phoenix miraculously takes off, we see him patting arms with Captain Towns, smiling, amazed, and excited. After all, it's his design; it's his creation flying. I always love it when they show the: "Where Are They Know" sequence in the movie, and I love the fact that Elliot at least gets the credit he deserves.I think both with the cast and special effects, this movie is a really good way to introduce new people to a classic. But had the producers wanted this to be a great movie, a BETTER SCRIPT could've even led them to an Oscar? I give it a 7/10 for the special effects and Giovanni Ribisi</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'd do anything to avoid another 'hopes and dreams' speech" ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... so don't see this, because it's got at least three of them. This is the kind of movie that thinks Spencer Davis and Outkast will save a lame script and a weak director. Worse, it thinks a remake of a tepid potboiler is a good idea. It's so very very bad, it's not even enjoyable as drunken amusement. Occasionally self referential in the shallowest post-SCREAM manner, it invariably ignores its own advice and continues to lumber along as the dinosaur disaster epic nobody wanted to see, ever, not even the first time around.I can imagine the director getting excited, conceiving a series of great montage sequences. See, there's this one part - oooh, or maybe several - where everybody just mopes, but they're all moping in their own different ways. Like, some mope with their hands over their faces; some stare glumly at the sand; some freak out and kick chairs. This, instead of actual action, or real scenes that further plot or character - the original didn't have them, so why should the remake? Then there's another part - yeah, a couple of these - with inspirational music, when everybody welds and hammers and hauls, I don't know, stuff. Or maybe they dance and play cards and practice chip shots. It's like a beach party, right, except they're all in the middle of the Gobi desert and there's a big time crunch b/c they're running out of water and food and hope. So cool. Wait, bad guys, we need bad guys. Um, ninjas? Yeah, the Gobi's in Asia, right? So we've got our built-in conflicts: stuck in the desert, no water, and bad guys over the hill. Except nobody'll get thirsty, the bad guys won't come over the hill, and nobody'll have a good reason to go home b/c they're all established as idiot losers (or simply assholes) in the first five minutes. But basically they'll just do what they have to do, impeded only by the circular story (we're all gonna die; no we won't; yes we will; no we won't), and they'll survive so we can play "Gimme Some Lovin'" again. All together now.It must be said that the original was pretty much a standard Robert Aldrich clunker, with only Hardy Kruger's weird little Aryan to keep us entertained. Giovanni Ribisi, usually dependable to play weird little Aryans, here is stunted by Ewe Boll's kindred spirit John Moore, helmer of the OMEN remake and the military travesty BEHIND ENEMY LINES. Moore plays his favorite game of disallowing anybody from making more than the most cardboard gesture toward character. It's as if he's afraid that if anyone acts, it'll distract from his obsessions with editing and pop music.I can't fault Moore exclusively, though the temptation is strong. For backup he's got a third-string acting squad and two writers most charitably labeled as uneven: Scott Frank, who's fine as long as Elmore Leonard writes his dialog, but whose INTERPRETER defied interpretation and whose LOOKOUT had plot holes blind people could see; and Ed Burns writing dialog as bad as any he's ever written, which is very bad indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flying Eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This movie was great fun and all the fun was in the eye.If you know the original, it justified itself as a character development project: people thrust into an isolated, life and death situation - various challenges to overcome, various group dynamics to confront. It was about what used to called drama.This film has almost exactly the same plot; the deviations are minor. But it justifies itself in a wholly different way. The situation is merely an excuse, the characters merely tokens for the greater focus: and that focus is all about the real star here: the camera. Yes, it has cliffhangers and threats, but they are merely the rhythm section.Everything about this is conceived as a visual, usually a new visual, a new take on a hackneyed visual (the plane over the sun, the dancing shadow on the dunes), or a more energetic editing of events (like the rushing of the wounded bandit back to camp).No film can overcome a bad opening shot, and this understands that we need to immediately map story to image. So we have an abstract narrative in a Johnny Cash song over the flight of our ugly plane. This shows masterful planning because from that moment we know what we see is what matters, not what we hear - and certainly not the sense of the story.That's followed by the best editing I know of a terminal event, the plane crash. It is not lyrical like Weir's crash in 'Fearless,' and it is not as frantic as a real crash. It is in between: confused and frantic enough to grab us because it we really have to work to know where we are. So already before the story begins, the storyteller has transformed us twice into watchers registered into the visual grammar only. You need to see this film just to appreciate how effective this is as a storytelling device.Then we demand some story and are given some: plight, rebellion, bandits, hope. But watch. Each chapter has two layers: the layer of the story (what you would get in the 65 version) and the layer of the camera (and editing) artist. The latter is what makes this worth seeing, just as the banal content of 'Van Helsing' had little to do with the experience.But the casting is apt, at least with the two main characters (I discount Quaid's character, because he's just a prop). Ribisi is one of our most talented young actors. He's not quite at the level of Seymour Hoffman in terms of subliminal folding (where you do your character and also give us a message directly from the actor), but he has been terrific in ensemble folded acting. For instance, in the otherwise dreadful 'The Gift' or best folded actress, Cate Blanchett and he did some fairly remarkable combined work.Here, he plays a similar role and has a similar partner. Miranda isn't quite in the same league as Cate, but she does know the game, is Australian and redheaded. Now I've got to go back and see her other work.You must see this on a big screen. It will be just an ordinary story on a DVD, reduced to a mere Dreamworks plot.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regarding Johnny Cash singing during the opening credits of this film: After being to Hell and back a time or two and traveling to every earthly geographical location (Most places, twice or more) in his lifetime... and now in Heaven, he truly can sing... "I've been everywhere, man". I love him as a brother, and miss him dearly.I will never forget the night during a brief intermission back stage at a college venue in central Pennsylvania, when he invited me to minister to those in attendance. That was the beginning of a seemingly endless array of Johnny Cash Show dates that streamed by for years. Concert bookings that took us all over the world, into Canada, back and forth across the United States . . . through Australia, New Zealand, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and on, and on, in a variety of venues that ranged from the darkest, purple spiked-hair dens of Europe . . . to New York's Carnegie Hall.There is so very much I could say regarding the treasured relationship and fellowship that God allowed John and I to share and just how very much I loved and respected him ... and dearly miss him. But please allow me to allude to an excerpt from some of the notes that I've been compiling since John's home going, regarding the many miles and years we traveled together as well as a very special letter...While waiting out a flight delay at LaGuardia's USAIR Club the day after the "All Star Tribute To Johnny Cash" television taping in New York City, I composed a letter to John. I faxed it to his New York hotel. The next day, he and June flew back home and I called the house for him. June answered and told me that they were both a bit road weary and lying on their bed resting... "Could you call back just a little later?" she asked. I said, "Sure June, but before I go, could you ask John if he got the letter I faxed to him at the hotel?" She asked him and I heard that familiar voice tell her, "Why yes, I did... and I think that's the nicest letter I ever got." Whether it was the nicest letter is not important to me. He said it that evening in his own gracious way! Please allow me to share the letter that I wrote to John.Dear John: My flight was postponed this morning so I thought I'd drop you a note and thank you for a very wonderful and memorable evening. The tribute was beautiful, very much deserved and certainly well earned.Oliver Wendell Holmes once said; "The average man goes to his grave with his music still in him." Thank God this has not been the case with you. You've given greatly of the gift God has given you. All who have been privileged to know you can testify to that John, as our lives have been immeasurably enriched through the touch of your life. No doubt this can also be echoed by the many countless, nameless ones who have so richly received from you without ever having the great privilege of knowing you in a personal way.John, I know first hand that your road has not been an easy one. There's been challenge after challenge... some giving way to victory, and others... something less. But then this is often the path of destiny for those who carry God's treasured gifts in earthen vessels (II Cor 4:7-8). It just could be though that this is the necessary stuff that talents are nurtured in and creativity is born of. Strange as it does seem, Scripture says... the very tests, trials and tribulations we suffer result in working life (!) in those around us (II Cor 4:12).Thank you John; for giving of your gift and your life to so many. (Thank you also June; for holding up "Moses' hands" (Ez 17:12). I know this hasn't been an easy task... especially when your "Moses" has been Johnny Cash. But I also know Johnny will be the first to recognize he could not have come to this place in his journey without God having sent you.) Thank you especially John that you have not been one of the average persons Oliver Wendell Holmes spoke of. Thank you that the gift God put within you will NEVER be buried... for you have continually poured it out to others ... in spite of, maybe even because of, the many obstacles.Thank you not only for the fruits of the road traveled thus far, but also for the promise of what's ahead. As I've told you many times before, I believe the best is yet to come. God does save the best wine for last you know.God richly bless you John, and all your loved ones and the road ahead. I'm very proud of you... and very thankful to be your friend. "Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God upon every remembrance of you."

		<shortDescription>Flight of the Phoenix: 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake season is usually from May-August, yet for some reason Flight of the Phoenix is coming out in December, right before Oscar season. From what I saw tonight, there were maybe 15 people in the theater for a 7:50 Friday evening showing (opening night). What could Fox have been thinking? A big budget blockbuster while we're waiting for The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou or The Aviator to come out? Does that make any sense? Well, anyway, Phoenix certainly doesn't deserve a December release (April, maybe?), but it's still pure, simple escapist entertainment. Thankfully, it didn't try to be anything more (in fact, Dennis Quaid's character made fun of the inspirational talks in the movie), allowing it to be something to see on a boring Friday night.When an unsuccessful oil drill is abandoned in a remote place in Asia, Frank Towns (Quaid) and others are sent to fly them back to civilization. However, there's one extra person on board, Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi), causing the plane to be overweight and crashing in the midst of a gigantic random storm. Things get hairier when they realize that help probably won't come. However, Elliot mentions that he designs airplanes (of course), and now they're hell-bent on rebuilding their plane (dubbed "The Phoenix"), while going through tough weather, low supplies, bandits, and interpersonal relationship hardships.One almost expects Jerry Bruckheimer's name on this-it's mindless fun, with any plot being stupid, any special effect being fake, and any characters being underdeveloped. The fate of this movie, in my opinion, was in the hands of director John Moore, who last made Behind Enemy Lines a hit for Fox. During the so-called "action" scenes, Moore switches over to hand-held camera (as if he tries to get the audience to get into the movie-makes us think that a situation like this could happen in real life?) and really makes the movie disjointed at those few points. However, some of the shots are pretty fantastic looking, but at other times, it's completely false CGI. I mean, it's terribly fake-and some critics have been saying that the special effects are great? It's most obviously some backlot with fake sanddunes everywhere. And yet, somehow, Moore manages to keep interest for the two hours, and, more importantly, makes it fun to watch. When you have characters just randomly be introduced (like that person of unknown Middle Eastern descent and the black guy with an eyepatch), you realize that the plot is not important, and you focus on having fun.I've seen a few ads that talk about the "HUGE" plot twist, and although the twist at the end was pretty good, it's not really noteworthy. However, there was something about Ribisi's character-and the way he played it-that made me really like him. He's like the bad guy in movies where you want the bad guy to win (although he's not really a bad guy here). Quaid does a pretty good job here, about what's required. His character, and all the others, fulfill the stock characters. We have the All-American pilot, the hot, smart woman (who's also sassy-add an extra point), the black guy, a black guy with an eyepatch (a disability AND an extra minority-five extra points), a person from a place that we currently hate (Middle East (actually two-Britain-wow, Flight of the Phoenix is raking up the point)), the computer nerd. And that's just the character clichés. There's boatloads more, but you'll be able to guess them as they come along.Flight of the Phoenix will probably bomb at the box office. I suppose I can see why-you don't have enough advertising, you bomb. But Flight of the Phoenix is a true popcorn movie if there ever was one. Once you've gotten everything in the Netflix catalogue, try this one on for size.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for some language, action and violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1964, Robert Aldrich stranded James Stewart, Richard Attenborough and Peter Finch in the desert after their plane crashed in the film Flight of the Phoenix. The movie was about a group of unluckies that band together to rebuild a new plane from the working parts of the wreckage. The film was fairly well done for its time and even grabbed two Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Ian Bannen) and Best Film Editing.But were we really lobbying for a remake? Was there a demand or a group of picket sign wielding stampeders outside the studio office demanding that an update be greenlit? Who knows? What we do know is that some 40 years later, fairly untested director John Moore was given a hefty budget to remake the film appropriately named, Flight of the Phoenix. Surprisingly however is that the film was a remake in almost every sense. With the exception of the plane crash (to which I give credit as being one of the best ever filmed) the movie updates the language, but everything else is relatively the same. Where in the original, there was such laughable dialogue as 'Mr. Towns, you behave as if stupidity were a virtue.', in the remake we get equally giggle generating script excerpts as, 'I think a bee stung going in your big dumb ass.' Hmmmm. Updated indeed. If a remake is suppose to be bigger, badder and louder, I suppose Flight of the Phoenix 2004 fits the bill. But you can also add stupider to the mix since the writers decided not to spend any time in developing characters outside of the 40 year old script (that is unless you consider the crew dancing in the face of death to Outkasts' Hey Ya in a ridiculous MTV moment). And that is very irritating.We had four decades to fix the kinks and iron out the wrinkles to make a superior film of what is an interesting concept. Instead we get cliché after cliché and improbable situations that are laughable to today's audiences. What do I mean as laughable, you say? Well, how about an electrical storm that ends as soon as it hits the only thing that is important to the survivors. Or how about a group of nomads that can attack at any time, but wait until the exact second that the newly built plane decides to take off.. I can go on, but what's the point.Flight of the Phoenix was a major disappointment to the holiday theatre going experience. Change that. Flight of the Phoenix was a major annoyance during the holiday theatre going experience. Where psychologists agree that hostages and their captors develop a bond over a period of time, it is evident in this circumstance that people in need of each other for survival will begin to fight over petty trivialities if not dancing to the latest pop hit on the radio. All this did was leave me to care nothing about any of the characters and I couldn't give a rats ass whether they survived or not.Flight of the Phoenix therefore falls in the same category as Get Carter, Sabrina, The Jackal., as films that were just mediocre when released decades ago and are amazingly given more of a disservice in the remakes for the new MTV generation. We didn't ask for a Phoenix remake and frankly, my life is worse off because of it. And for that. I give it one and half stars, not even enough juice to get it off the tarmac.www.gregsrants.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never seen the original 1965 movie of the same name, which allowed me to indulge this remake on its own merits. This is a surprisingly good action flick, considering the lack of megastar power here, although Dennis Quaid's star, which arguably had gone supernova, appears to be experiencing sort of a recalescence of late. What works here, is the story itself, which is based upon a novel by English/French Novelist Trevor Alleston. It's a compelling story of human interaction, with diverging personalities, in a survival setting. This flick has action, suspense, and wit. Can't decide on a movie to watch out there ? You can hardly be disappointed with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't have seen a better disaster flick that involves airplanes ever before. Never the mention of not a boasting cast, this movie easily gets my vote over silly "disaster" movies that involve a plane crash such as "Airplane" and that TV series "Lost".How do people view movies nowadays? By action? No. By dialogue? Maybe. Or is it by the looks of the actors? Yes. But this movie doesn't contain that. The dialogue may not be the cleanest, and the actors will look a bit scrubby, but this movie was absolutely great, no bones about it.The crash scene was probably one of the greatest crash scenes I've seen in any other film. The action was more breath taking than I've ever seen, and the chemistry between the actors in the film is absolutely magnificent. A bit shaky at times, but this movie sure has the potential to be just as good as the 1965 classic.This movie is not one to forget. Go see it and you'll see why it's so good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quaid flies high with Phoenix as he finishes a great year. If you truly believe, the plane will fly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while, one of those movies comes along that is underrated and looked at the wrong way. However if you look hard, this film gives you action, gives you jokes and farces, but more importantly reminds us of human life and abilities. It reminds us that if you work together during depression and emotional peril, life will pull you through and God will give you a favor.Flight of the Phoenix is directed by John Moore and stars Dennis Quaid who I must say has had a very good 2004. It also stars Tyrese Gibson, Giovanni Ribisi, Miranda Otto, and others like Tony Curran and Sticky Fingaz known as Kirk Jones. Dennis Quaid has had a perfect year with The Alamo, The Day After Tomorrow, Flight of the Phoenix, and possibly In Good Company when it comes out. Dennis gives a perfect landing with Phoenix.Flight of the Phoenix starts with Frank Towns (Quaid) and A.J (Gibson). They are called to the crap-hole of the desert in between Mongolia and China. There they must pick up a team of oil workers and bring them to Beijing. The team consists of people from all over, Brits, Aussies, a black man, a Spanish man, an Arab, and Americans. As they fly through the Mongolian, Frank and A.J piloting, they get into a horrible sand storm. It's so horrible; they can't fly under it, over it, or around it so they go straight through it. This cause major turbulence and leads the plane to crash in the middle of the Mongolian desert. The death counts goes higher and higher as the movie progresses. The team must pull themselves together and with the lead of Elliot (Ribisi), a plane designer, they rebuild the plane to fly out.Miranda Otto plays Kelly who is the sole woman of the team. As the days go by, more and more food and water is consumed and the team becomes frustrated while Elliot goes mad with power. The team must fight their emotional peril and work together to survive. It works but more problems arise like Chinese nomads. Frank and everyone must do their best in surviving and to eventually escape the desert. The climax is excellent and very satisfying and when Elliot is blown out of his disguise, it gets dirty.Overall, Flight of the Phoenix is one hell of an adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's got action, comedy, thrills, and shows important life lessons. It is slow at times, may cut from time to time, and may seem out of place a lot but makes up for it by getting you into the movie as it makes you feel the pain and the heat. About every 15 minutes, disaster occurs so the visual effects are spectacular but sometimes get out of hand. No matter how bad it gets, if you believe, God will pull in a favor.My Rating: 8/10Eliason A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>maybe its just me but for a 30 year old, Giovanni Ribis is looking fine.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK its becoming a little much with all of these old movies being remade but in a way its nice because honestly who would watch the old versions by choice. If they re-make them good enough like I thought they did in this one then heck ya ill watch it. Besides most people have never seen the old versions anyways so I say the newer the better!But is it just me or does Giovanni Ribisi(the crazy plane builder) look super sexy for a 30 year old OMG!I dunno what it is but that bleach blonde hair works for him!!!! As far as the movie goes, I was entertained the entire time. So if your looking for a good action flick with some fine looking fellas in it then I highly recommend it.This movie is good for guys and girls, its got the action and the beautiful Miranda Otto(from Lord of the rings)for the guys and hot sweaty men fighting for life for the girls. Its a win win movie, now who can disagree with that. Good for dates wink wink!</fullReview>
