		<shortDescription>Ozu's most accessible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Good Morning," is one of my favorite's films.It means a lot to me personally, because -like all of Ozu's work- it demonstrates a brilliant understanding of the complexities of being human. It contains simple wisdom, humour, and kindness; and sadly the whole of cinema history has provided us with very few films which can make such a claim. Ozu celebrates the beauty of middle-class existence, all the while delivering a profound criticism of our tendency to permit "small talk" to dominate conversations. Ultimately though, it is the humour which makes "Good Morning" my favorite's Ozu picture, for it is a very funny movie. Very funny and very satisfying! I can hardly imagine an open-minded person not enjoying it.Because many North American viewers have a reluctance to watch films more than a few years old, or in languages other than English, Ozu's exposure here is still extremely limited. That is unfortunate because Ozu's films are quite universal.I feel confident that anyone could appreciate Ozu's genius in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Funny and Extremely Serious Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For viewers who have seen only one or two of Ozu's statelier films -- say, "Tokyo Story" or "Equinox Flower" -- "Good Morning" will be a surprise. Two children take a vow of silence to coerce their parents into buying a television set: that's pretty much the whole plot. But what happens as a result affects almost every aspect of life in the nondescript, gossipy, elbow-to-elbow suburb in which the boys' family lives.This is a comedy, and like all good comedies it's very serious. The boys' act of rebellion is very un-Japanese, and it threatens many of the politely ritualistic social behaviors that mask and deflect the tensions in Japanese society. Whole alliances among the village's women teeter and threaten to topple. The family's authority structure is upended, with the all-powerful father crumbling against the stubborn silence of two little boys.What wins in the end is love -- or rather (Ozu must have found this particularly funny) love and television. The resolution will probably tear you up (it has brought moisture to the eyes of everyone I've seen it with) but it represents enormous changes in Japanese society -- the collapse of patriarchal authority, the invasion of foreign culture, and especially English-language culture, and the inexorable rise of that great leveler of aesthetics, television. Ozu saw the future, and he wasn't in it.So naturally, he presents all this in a gentle, even sweet-natured comedy. There may be greater Ozu films, but it's hard to think of one I actually like more than "Good Morning."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful and Critical View of the Behavior of the Japanese Working Class Under the American Influence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a small community of workers in Japan, two brothers decide to not speak because they want to force their parents to buy a television.With this single storyline, Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu exposes a delightful and critical view of the behavior of the Japanese working class under the American influence in the post-WWII. Once again the major concern of Ozu is with the family and human relationship. The situation of the retired people is magnificently pictured through the desperate men looking for a job; the domination of the USA in Japan is represented through the need of private English classes for the two brothers, and the translation of documents to English; superfluous consume of the American society is represented through the importance of the useless television for the younger generation, while their parents are concerned with have some savings for their retirement. The destructive little gossips, the difficulties of communication, and many other problems of relationship are also shown in this little gem. For movie lovers like me, I regret to inform that this is the first DVD of the great director released in Brazil. Only in festivals, and occasionally in cable television, Brazilians have the chance to see the work of this great director. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Bom Dia" ("Good Morning")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sharp, funny and wise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is sometimes called a remake of Ozu's silent I Was Born, But..., however, for an artist that would repeat and retread various themes and story-elements throughout his work, ?remake' is a big word. Both I Was Born and Ohayo contain a strike by two boys against their parents, but that's about the only thing they have in common. It's much more interesting to look at the differences: In I Was Born, But... the kids go on a hunger-strike after seeing their father humiliate himself in front of his boss. The strike is therefore one for such old-school values as honor and dignity. No such lofty goals in Ohayo, here the object of the strike is that ultimate symbol of western consumerism, the television. One could conclude that in this change lies Ozu's criticism, that he is bemoaning how traditional Japanese values are being exchanged for materialism. That, however, would be far too simple. In I Was Born But,... the kids had to compromise, in Ohayo it's the parents who compromise. The kids in Ohayo get their television, the kids in I Was Born But,... had to learn that for their father, supporting his family is more important than upholding samurai-ideals. Neither movie is a criticism on, but a clear-eyed portrait of a changing society.The main theme in Ohayo is communication. The kids want a television, the parents don't and in an argument one of the boys remarks how adults talk a lot but never say anything important. Consequently, the kids refuse to talk until they get their tv. Chaos and comedy ensues and meanwhile Ozu and Noda incorporate some sharp observations in their script on our inability to communicate meaningfully with each other. The scene in which two people who have an inexpressed love for each other talk about the weather is as funny as it is tragic. And I almost forgot to mention: Ohayo contains some of the funniest fart-jokes in any movie. ***1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light &amp; Entertaining, Yet Rather Perceptive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While somewhat lighter than most of Ozu's features, this is still a rather perceptive film that is also entertaining to watch. The situation and the characters are all straightforward, yet Ozu's expert eye sees plenty of things worth considering, and each simple story development has a purpose. If the material remains generally lightweight when compared to some of his other movies, it still has the same thoughtful, low-key touch and genuinely human characters.The young boys drive much of the story in this one, and they are very believable, whether in their petulant responses to parental authority or in their schoolboy fads. Some of the latter can be slightly off-putting at times, but then such things do rather ring true with the nature of boys at that stage of their lives.The cast is quite large, so that none of the characters gets a lot more screen time than any of the others, yet somehow all of them not only come alive, but get some defining moments. Most of the adult characters are simple, yet easy to care about, and there are several good performances. The grandmother character and the aunt of the two brothers are probably the most interesting of the characters, yet all of them have a purpose.As is usually the case with Ozu's movies, you can watch it a second time and see additional detail in the characters' relationships and dialogue. This time, the issues involved are not as significant as usual, yet the simple plot provides some insights into the ways that families and neighbors communicate with one another and understand one another. It's probably more entertaining than enlightening, but yet there is some substance as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Good Morning" (Japanese, 1959): Directed by Ozu. As in all of his films, Tokyo is the stage, and he populates them with his usual team of actors. Think of the professional stability of Ingmar Bergman, Woody Allen, or John Waters, but Japanese. Ozu concentrates on small moments made meaningful. Unlike the quiet, black and white drama "Tokyo Story", this later film (in color) is a gentle comedy about how people build the character of each and every day with the smallest of gestures ? which is this case is brought to our attention by two small brothers who decide to go "on strike" insisting that their Father get a television for the household. It's a loving, funny, and forgiving look at how silly we all can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Ozu film. Kill your TV! (for Terrance &amp; Phillip's sake.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I appreciate Ozu's film style &amp; quality, I've never been a big fan due to the generally melodramatic themes of his movies. OHAYO is quite different. The multiple comic themes range from fart jokes &amp; clueless gossiping neighbors to fears of obsolescence in a rapidly changing society.Particularly prescient is the early awareness of the Baka (idiot) power of television. In Japan it has been common for decades to have TV sets mounted in temples &amp; shrines so that the Kami (spirits) can watch.We in the U.S. have long been "a nation of 100 million idiots" (and then some) from our obsession with constant entertainment especially in the form of TV. Our children whine &amp; act petulant unless they have their own TV &amp; DVDs in their rooms &amp; even when riding in the car. In many homes the TV is constantly on, regardless of what might be happening either on the boob-tube or outside (such as visitors calling).Ozu saw it coming almost half a century ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last year NHK (national broadcaster in Japan) were playing 2 Ozu movies a night and I tuned into this by accident.Maybe because I have lived in Japan for 10 years and was watching it in it's native language and could understand the subtle nuances in the day-to-day conversation, or maybe simply because I related to the children, having grown up in a household where getting things that you actually want was very rare - quite simply, this movie moved me tremendously, the final scene brought tears to my eyes just *remembering* it a week later.This movie is probably most effective for anybody who grew up in a poor household with parents who tried their best against all odds to keep their children happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ironic Film About Language</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may have the skimpiest of plots--two young brothers take a vow of silence until their parents buy them a television--but Yasujiro Ozu's 1959 picture is anything but slight, taking on the subject of language (ironic, considering the story) with attentiveness and intelligence. In his deliberate, contemplative manner, Ozu presents a wry commentary on the ways even the most innocuous words can harm (gossip) or become the building blocks of a relationship (a budding romance is confirmed by a conversation about the weather); he also notes Japan's growing fascination with the English language (the older boy studies it) and the increasing obsession, now with fourteen years of distance from the war, with American technology--the suburban landscape is peppered with aerial antennas as television begins to permeate the culture. It's subtly beautiful: each shot is perfectly framed (the camera never moves) with an excellent use of depth that highlights exactly what the director wants you to see and giving you plenty of space to focus; it's easy to see how a master of today's Asian cinema such as Wong Kar-Wai would be profoundly influenced by Ozu's languid yet carefully observed filmmaking. A delight; it's also a fine introduction for younger viewers to the magnificence of international cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Morning (1959)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ozu said he wanted to make a film about people's inability to express the important things, but natter on about unimportant gossip. This all comes out thanks to two boys that really want a TV. They enter into a vow of silence until their TV comes. This silence is misconstrued by the neighbours, who think their mother is angry at them. They begin to gossip amongst themselves and rumors soon start. Meanwhile, the young boys' aunt and teacher are attracted, but fail to act on their emotions. This is a lovely little film, filled with some great humor. Though, I must admit, there was a bit too much focus on the poo/farts jokes. The two boys, especially the youngest, are very cute and make their efforts to get a TV seem less brattish. It's really sweet to see how dedicated the parents are, and even though the kids are kind of mean, they do appreciate the gift in the end. There's no escaping Ozu's look at the clashes between old and new, with the TV looming over all procedures as something that will change life. A little gem, if not one of Ozu's classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ozu's comic classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After directing his most characteristic and famous later films (Early Morning, Late Afternoon, Tokyo Story) - which addressed the same theme with remarkable differences in tone - GOOD MORNING is a pleasing palate freshener. This family drama is also a witty comedy dealing with the miscommunications that complicate modern life.This was Ozu's second color film (after Equinox Flower), but the cheerful music and bright colors make for different effects. GOOD MORNING'S "gas" jokes are gentle and clever (the young boys fart on command, a minor character works for the gas company, while a husband farts in one room, and a wife answers, etc.) The film's famous static shots center around a gleaming refinery. One of the film's delights comes from watching the visual and thematic elements weave together, and so effortlessly that it's thrilling to see it develop. This is my personal favorite Ozu film, if only because it perfectly balances drama and comedy, metaphor and visuals. GOOD MORNING is the kind of movie you can see repeatedly, as there are always new things to discover. It certainly doesn't hurt that it's also a technically refined work, up to Ozu's highest standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light as a.... fart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ozu's films always balance humour, heartbreak and social comment - in this film the balance is decidedly in favour of humour. Its hard to imagine a slighter story to build a full movie - two little boys who decide not to speak for a few days in a huff over being denied a TV. But Ozu builds a whole world out of this dull little suburb in a Japan just getting on its feet after the war and embracing consumerism as an alternative to..... well, whatever went before.I think only Ozu could make boring mass produced housing look so utterly gorgeous in full colour, and the minor bickering of the household ladies seem so important. He's helped by a fantastic cast, especially the child actors playing the little boys (oddly enough, there doesn't seem to be any little girls in this suburb). The story has layer up layer of irony (aided by numerous fart jokes) built up upon its slight foundations making an utterly fascinating film. As usual with Ozu, he doesn't lecture, although as always his sympathy is slightly tilted to the somewhat bemused father figures. Even the simple ending, a shot of laundry fluttering on a line, seems somehow laden with meaning. The whole film is a pure delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amused and humane portrait of life in a Tokyo suburb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Especially in the absence of many lively or engrossing movies from Chekhov's works -- "An Unfinished Piece for Mechanical Piano" and "Country Life" are exceptions -- Yasujiro Ozu strikes me as an excellent representative of many of Chekhov's sensibilities.Dramas are on human scales: about love, relationships, work, day to day travail and pleasure, and desires to accomplish something in life. Concerned for and affectionate towards his characters, Ozu is mercilessly illusionless. People are creatures of their social and economic and educational backgrounds, but not mechanically or simplisticly so. Emotions are pitch-perfect and lucid -- to the audience, if not always to the characters. Conflicts and passions are tempered by characters' realistic self-perceptions and their practicality, with consequently no implausible hysterics.Ozu's dramatic best, such as "Floating Weeds" or "Late Spring," compares quite well with the best of Chekhov's plays and stories. In moralizing mode, "Tokyo Story," Ozu descends to melodrama, with good characters being very, very sensitive and altruistic, and bad characters crudely selfish (cf. Chekhov's "The Darling," which is even worse, Tolstoy's idiosyncratic enthusiasm notwithstanding). Although this would be uninteresting in isolation, such types do exist in life, and in the context of Ozu's other movies, it is a worthwhile sample of human variety.Which brings us to "Ohayo." Reasonably categorized as a comedy, it also resembles Chekhov's comedies, with similar strengths and weaknesses. The movie meanders around a couple plots -- children's conniving to get their parents to buy a television, and a suspected case of embezzling. Though the latter is potentially extremely serious, Ozu follows these conflicts and misunderstandings, and detours into his characters' other doings, with a light, unforced, sometimes quizzical amusement and compassion. This is the great value of the movie, and may, in fact, be its intended point. "Ohayo" is at bottom a comedy and not a deeply serious drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best Japanese color films of the '50s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like some other films by Yasujirô Ozu, Good Morning also features the recurring theme of very subtle criticism of the industrialization/commercialization/whatever other -ation of Japan. In this one, we see what a traditional Japanese family went through when (not) wanting to buy a TV (one of the common symbols of commercialism, of course). Fortunately, Ozu's message is again rather subtle and avoids treating it by shoving the message in your face.The color in this film is fantastic, and once again the composition of set elements is fantastically done. The plot is again very minimal but more interesting than in most Ozu films, and overall it's a light- hearted movie that leaves you with a positive feeling after you've seen it. Yes, the flatulence jokes were overdone, and the characters are sort of confusing to pick up in the very start, but despite that it's flawless. A very cute family film, after all...9,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy by Ozu - perhaps not up to his best masterpieces , but still very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu's latter movies (and among his few color films). In a Japanese suburb in the late 1950s, two Japanese tykes (one about 10 years old, the other about 6) decide not to talk to anybody any more until their parents buy them a television set (this film was made in an era where many people in Japan were buying their first TVs).Shot in his traditional transcendental style, this charming comedy shows a more modern Japan than in other Ozu films of that era (at the same time, the cultural attitudes the movie reflects make it very much a film of the fifties). This was probably one of the first movies made anywhere to deal with life in the suburbs - even if it is set in a very Japanese suburbia (all the houses are very close to each other and its residents constantly interact with each other. There is also constant gossiping around among the housewives). In many ways, Good Morning is a movie about the many changes brought by the modernization and Americanization of Japanese society after World War II, Surprisingly for an Ozu film, this has even a number of gags involving human flatulence.A triumph for Ozu, even if it is probably not as moving as Tokyo Story, Late Spring or Early Summer. The ensemble of actors certainly helps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice little film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film Ozu revisits again themes involving kids, but this time in a way more notorious modern Japan and the changes it has brought in society.It all starts as a usual day; the members of a family prepare themselves to confront their problems, dreams and realities. The father, with his ups and downs at work, and having to attend to his children's demands and give them proper education, prepares himself for a new day. His wife, worried about complications that domestic life brings, and about how to save and handle money properly, is as well one of the family members attempting to live quietly and happily in an otherwise rather boring community. The main characters (the kids), which are obsessed with having a television (back then it was an innovative device), agree to remain silent until their parents indulge their caprice.One aspect that I liked in this film was the misinterpretation of the kids' silence by one of the neighbors; the woman, who lives in the community, thought their gesture meant their mother was angry at her and other neighbors for having had the idea of her keeping the rent payments for herself. This leads everybody to think of her as a resentful woman, and they decide to return the favors she had once done for them, so that they wouldn't be owing her anymore favors. This is relevant even to today's standards; people often misjudge you by the slightest gesture, even though you didn't intend to be interpreted that way.Other amusing aspect to point out would be the constant farting; there appears to be an ability to produce farts by swallowing some powder whose name I don't remember as of now. The kids keep on doing it throughout the whole film.This is one of the easiest films to digest in Ozu's filmography, which means that this is an excellent option for people unfamiliar with this magnificent director. I for one consider this film one of his best efforts and it obviously ranks up there in the top of my personal favorite Japanese films.My score: 9.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the Vaults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an ode to snotty, spoiled kids everywhere. Kids who make life so uncomfortable for their parents with all their pouting and tantruming that parents will give them just about anything just to get them to behave for half a second. This is an old movie? from 1959?but it just proves that kids have always been little brats. The film is set in small- town Japan. It's one of those little, isolated places that's known for its stereotypically catty, gossipy women, and uninterested, emotionally distant husbands. With all the adults paying attention to their own, petty problems, children are left to run wild. And this story stars a pair of particularly stubborn, yet adorable, little school-aged brothers. These little hellions are used to getting what they want, and this time, their campaign of terror is directed toward forcing their parents to buy one of those new-fangled TV sets. You know, like the one the bachelor next-door, and that loose woman he's shacking up with let them watch after school (gotta love those 1950s morals, don't you?). Well, these boys have learned a thing or two from past experience, so they know that if they hold out long enough, they'll be able to wear down their parents' resolve. It's a war of attrition, and these kids have nothing but time and energy. Plus, they don't have those pesky consciences to make them feel bad about any of this. They're willing to make their parents' lives holy hell until they get that TV set.The film is done in Technicolor so it's got that awesome, retro look. Somehow, that limited color palette breeds nostalgia, making the past seem a little better than it probably really was. Even these little stinkers seem a little bit cute with their self-indulgent antics (for a little while, anyway). But, it's also kinda fun to see what Japan was like in the late 50s. I already had an idea what the United States was like, but I hadn't really seen or learned that much about contemporary culture in other countries. It seems like a lot of the clothing fashions were the same as here in the US. But each country is going to have its own, distinct social structures at play. I'm glad I watched this one. It's not the most amusing movie ever made, and it does stretch pretty long. It claims to run only ninety-three minutes, but it's actually an hour longer, at one-hundred fifty. That's kind of a big problem. But, I think it's still worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ozu at his most hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Japanese master Yasijuro Ozu repeated many themes in his movies. One of the key things running throughout his films is the idea of communication, or the lack of it. Good Morning, or Ohayo (to give the film its native title) centres around two young brothers, Minoru (Koji Shitara) and Isamu (Masahiko Shimazu), who long to own a television set. Their parents refuse, citing the fact that it will kill the art of conversation as the reason why. The boys rebel after accusing grown ups of talking a lot but never saying anything worthwhile, and go on a vow of silence, much to their parents gratitude. In a key sub-plot, the town gossips accuse the neighbourhood treasurer Mrs. Haraguchi (Haruko Sugimura) of embezzling their funds in order to buy herself a new washing machine, when in fact one of the gossips' mothers had forgot to pass the money on.Ozu's reputation as one of cinema's all-time greats and a director of elegance and sophistication is given a bit of a kick up the arse in this film. This is Ozu at his most hilarious. The mischievous brothers' increasingly desperate antics unwittingly causes mayhem amongst the townsfolk and inevitably has them bickering amongst themselves. It also contains lots of fart jokes. Yes, fart jokes, from Ozu. The brothers and their friends have a strange obsession with forcing out little farts as they push each others foreheads, which causes one unfortunate to repeatedly soil himself as he tries to take part.The kids' accusations that grown-ups have nothing useful to say is as amusing as it is poignant. The communities breakdown in communication leads to all sorts of rumours flying around about where the treasuries money is, when a simple forgetful act is all that has taken place. Even when this is discovered and the matter appears to be cleared up, they still find ways to stir up trouble. And the scene where two singletons who are obviously attracted to each other talk about the weather to fill the awkward silences, is as heartbreaking as it is oddly magical. Only a true master such as Ozu can conjure two conflicting emotions from one scene. But beneath all the bittersweet comedy and social observations is a sobering message about the decline of community and the looming death of cinema. Stunning filmmaking from a true great.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another gem from the master filmmaker. Though it is somewhat different from other Ozu films that it is centered around kids rather than the parents and it is a light comedy film rather than a dramatic one, it is still as marvelous as Ozu's Tokyo Story.Though I have seen movies by other great directors that handle kids really well, Vittoria Di Sica and Satyajit Ray come to mind, they did in a more dramatic fashion. This is much more close to life. It is an ordinary story but told in an extraordinary manner.It is full of amazing characters, whether it is the knife wielding, muttering grandma, the two kids around which the story revolves, the two salesmen or the English teacher. Rarely have I seen a film in which so many minor characters leave such impressions.When I think about it I can't find any fault with the movie, so this movies get a 10 from me. Must See for all cinephiles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ohayo To All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is kind of a re-make of the excellent Ozu film from 1932 "I Was Born, But", but its centered around different values. That essential silent film from Ozu is about two brothers who are bullied and wonder about their status in life. This film is about the two boys wanting a television and their parents refusing. So, after screaming about it and the parents telling them they talk too much, they take on a vow of silence that extends to the neighbors in this suburban town in Japan and even in school. They can only watch TV at a young couple's house with the other neighborhood kids. They just want a television. This Ozu film is a slice of mostly a by gone era, when kids were able to just run around, the neighbors freely visit each other without calling first and values were much simpler. The acting is great, but what do you expect, it has Chisyu Ryu and Haruko Sugimura in it, two of Ozu's best actors. I would have liked to have seen Setsuko Hara as one of the housewives, but I guess she was not available. The acting by the kids, especially the brothers played by Koji Shidara and Masahiko Shimazu, is spot on. I wanted some things growing up and nagged my parents, who hasn't? Its a fun film about wanting something you don't have. Enjoy it, its another highly watchable Ozu film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewed on DVD. Restoration = nine (9) stars; subtitles = eight (8) stars. Director Yasujiro Ozu proves he can bore the viewer equally well when using color film to present mostly recycled trivia. (But at least there are some new sound-stage sets.) The plot revolves around: rebellious children and poor parenting skills; the ebb and flow of local gossip; and TV. The latter is ironic, since films such as this one helped to thin the ranks of theater goers and sell TV sets in Japan (the cannibalizing of theater audiences by TV, of course, had already occurred about 10 years earlier in the West). Juvenile actors are bearable, at least initially. But their unbridled mugging and incessant Japanese-cuteness antics are repetitive and soon become boring. (The appeal of this film for contemporary audiences may have been that viewers--especially mothers--were or had been unprepared for raising new-era children who now wanted--really demanded-- to be treated as active not passive individuals.) Worthy of note (especially for students of Japanese language and culture) is the Director's demonstrations of the traditional use of polite, standardized salutations, greetings, and weather-related small talk as a powerful glue that helps to retain the cohesiveness of Japanese society in the midst of rapid change. As usual, Ozu fills the movie with his trademarks/obsessions: motionless cameras; same actors playing the same roles as in the last film; back acting; clothes lines (superfluous except for the closing scene); ugly overhead power lines; Italianized movie music; commuter trains; train stations; train crossings; background train sounds on the sound track; etc. Restoration missed a few wear-related artifacts and poor splices. Subtitles can be read in a glance and are close enough to the line readings in Japanese. Cinematography (static, narrow screen, color), lighting, and sound are fine. This is a film probably best enjoyed by members of the Director's fan club. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light and absorbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ohayo carries an unshowy, wry humour close to the surface throughout, and entertains just by offering privileged access to 1959 Japanese suburban society, and its houses, streets and bars. The little boys driving the drama are comic to watch and act wonderfully. Their hunger strike and fart games are presented matter-of-factly, almost obliquely, and the humour is not so much understated as unstated altogether.The film also is apparently filmed at knee height. While most great cinematic breakthroughs pass me by without leaving a mark (so what if that was all one take?), this gives rise to a pleasingly Alice in Wonderland feel. More importantly, it puts you in with the boys in their scenes, and includes you in the dialogues between gossiping neighbours, and informal meals, which all take place seated on the floor.The result is quirky and accessible, and easy to like even for those who are not lovers of abstruse cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute departure from the usual Ozu film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is typical of the films of the Japanese director, Ozu, because it has to do with the conflict between traditions and modern life in this country. It also features his old fashioned use of the camera--with the typical placement of the camera just below the actors as well as it remaining stationary during the shots. However, unlike most of his films, this is more of a lite comedy and makes fun of social conventions and neighbors.The film begins with two simultaneous themes. First, a group of neighbor women are in a women's club and the dues they gave their leader seem to have vanished. While the lady is sure she turned the money in, the other women begin wondering what might have happened with the funds. Second, two boys are very upset because their parents won't buy them a television. And, when the parents are sick of hearing the kids ask, they tell the boys to be quiet. Then, in a form of social protest, the boys refuse to talk any more to anyone--even at school. The only time they talk at all is when they are alone together.Later, it turns out that the club leader's mother had misplaced the money and everything was okay. BUT, because the boys stopped talking to everyone, the leader of the club thinks their not acknowledging or talking with her is because the family is still mad about the money. So, the rest of the film consists of come misunderstandings that all come about due to the spunky kids.Overall, this is not a laugh out loud sort of film, but a droll little film that gives insight into life in late 1950s Japan. It's slow and gentle--just like all of Ozu's films but with a sense of satire that makes some points about the hazards of post-war life. Well directed and acted from start to finish.By the way, note the comment the one lady makes to her mother about Mt. Norayama--it's amazingly brutal and harsh, but also makes a point about alienation and the disintegration of respect of the elderly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbearably cute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not a classic, but it is one of my favorites. It is so wonderfully shot and played out, the commentary on life in modern suburbia is quiet and yet still very clear. The acting is fantastic, jumping cultural boundaries and stirring up countless memories of my own childhood growing up in suburbia. Everyone can relate to this film, and it is because of that and the wonderful sense of humor that Ozu carries throughout the film that make this a must see, and a story I can see countless times without it becoming monotonous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japanese Television</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two boys begin a silence strike to press their parents into buying them a television set.Despite Ozu's reputation in the West as an austere and refined director, "Good Morning" does not shy away from depicting many of the neighborhood boys' flatulence jokes! Television broadcasting in Japan started in 1950, making the country one of the first in the world with an experimental television service. Cable television was introduced to Japan in 1955, in Shibukawa, Gunma Prefecture. This makes the story very timely. While considered a loose remake of Ozu's own earlier work, introducing TV as a part of the plot was very much a part of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clever social satire...with flatulence!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past several months, I've evolved into a full-blown devotee of the Japanese film director Yasujiro Ozu. Just when I was tiring of the phoniness, violence and excess of contemporary American movies, I discovered Ozu's quiet (but by no means boring) films and was deeply impressed by his insights into human emotion, family relationships and society.But while Ozu films like Late Spring and Tokyo Story are clearly masterpieces, Good Morning is not his usual fare. Unlike Ozu's weightier dramas, this film focuses a lot on seemingly trivial matters like suburban gossip and, believe it or not, schoolboy farting competitions. At first, I wasn't sure exactly what to think of Good Morning - the lack of a strong central plot and apparent silliness of the themes initially put me off somewhat.However, by the time I was done watching Good Morning, I realized that Ozu was even cleverer and more subtle than I had previously thought. You see, while Good Morning appears to be a light comedy on the surface, it actually has a lot of perceptive things to say about materialism, envy and the unfortunate superficiality of most human communication. (A major theme of the film is that people are good at saying trivial things to each other - such as the title phrase - but not good at saying emotional things that really matter.) So, this movie is definitely deeper than it appears to be at first glance. As a viewer, I could both chuckle immaturely at the fart jokes and appreciate the film's deeper social commentary at the same time. It's rare indeed to find a film that offers up both crass humor and spiritual insight, but Good Morning somehow pulls off that remarkable trick. Although there are better Ozu films than this one, Good Morning is another solid entry in his amazing body of work - and its unusual subject matter helps to disprove the somewhat silly stereotype that every Ozu film was about a distinguished father trying to marry off his daughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw Ozu's funny side!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that "Ohayô" has been the Ozu's film I have enjoyed most, more than his quite acclaimed "Tôkyô monogatari". I often find Ozu's movies so quiet and boring, full of not very interesting lives of middle-class Japanese, whose social life is merely reduced to their homes, where they just find a not very exciting life and where there is no place for rebel souls. The plots are usually so weak and neutral, not funny because they are not comedies, but not so sad to be considered dramas, and . That is not the case of "Ohayô": this is a real comedy, in the way it is Ozu's "Umarete wa mita keredo" ("I was born but...", a soundless movie made in 1932): in fact, I believe that Ozu used and developed the script of this film to write the story is told in "Ohayô". It is so funny to discover the rebel strategies of the couple of brothers who are the main characters of the film to reach their main goal: to convince their father to buy a TV (if the film were made in nowadays, they would want him to buy a new cellular). And funny to see how their attitude can have consequences over other characters. I must say that the film keep the usual Ozu's vision about Japanese family, which seems to be the warmest, safest, happiest social environment, a place where never happens anything wrong. Anyway, this time did it in a way that can make you believe in that and spend a good time too. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT Quite What I Was Expecting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with a former submitter here, it is the, "skimpiest of plots" with "two young brothers taking a vow of silence until their parents buy them a television." Yet - it is mainly the subject of language, attentiveness, and intelligence. It is subtly beautiful with each shot is perfectly framed with an excellent use of depth that highlights exactly what the director wants you to see and giving you plenty of space to focus and it is truly a fine introduction for younger viewers to the magnificence of international cinema. BUT - that being said .... it has the most horrible, blatant, ridiculous message screaming at the viewer: "HEY! Let's be rude, impolite, spoiled and bully our parents until we get what we want!" No thanks. I was nearly 10 years old when this movie came out in 1960 and even then I KNEW acting like this was so wrong. Then, as now, if children acted like the two brothers in this movie - HELLO MILITARY SCHOOL!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the Big Three Japanese film directors from last century, who were known in the West, Kenji Mizoguchi, Akira Kurosawa, and Yasujiro Ozu, Ozu is by far the least well known, and this is because he was probably the least technically innovative of the troika. But, that is not the same as saying he was the least accomplished. In fact, his 1959 social comedy of manners, Good Morning (Ohayo), set in a modern Tokyo suburban subdivision, is in many ways far more relevant than the more famed period pieces the other directors made, for it has a definite Western sensibility. Ozu seemed to be obsessed with documenting history, but history as it was lived, not re-imagined. He was acutely aware of his role as a social documentarian, if in a fictive sense. It was also his third color film, and on the surface it would seem to narratively square very easily with the 1950s era American television comedies, as the central story of the film revolves around two brothers' silent protest over their clan's refusal to modernize and buy a TV like their friend's family has. It all seems very Beaver Cleaver, but appearances are not everything, especially when the patina is crafted by a Master from another culture.Most of the film is shot in Ozu's famed and unjustly derided low camera angle, with a static lens, lending the charge of 'minimalism' to his style. Yet, while that may be true in certain technical aspects, the truth is that the film, written by Ozu and Kogo Noda, is very multi-layered, deftly weaving low comedy- such as excessive farting, and all the modernism that entails, as the boys play a game where one boy presses another's forehead and he farts in response, with deeper social commentary on alcoholism, the 'generation gap'- that old saw of the era, unemployment, and the bile of social gossip. The seemingly carefree farting of the children is thus deftly contrasted with the often ineffective social mechanisms of the adults. The title of the film, in fact, has an ironic meaning, for Ozu casts it as being said mostly in a negative and perfunctory way?. Compared with American suburban films from later years, like Ordinary People, or even films made in the last decade, like The Ice Storm or American Beauty, this film does not seem dated, especially compared to American film comedies of the era. Compare it even to a typical Billy Wilder comedy of the era and Ozu's superiority is manifest, almost as much as a fart is to some meaningless bon mot. Ain't art wonderful?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yasujiro Ozu's "Good Morning" is very lightweight, but is much more intelligent than most comedies of its type.It contains a fair amount of commentary on problems involving human communication in more ways than one. It also manages to throw in a couple of well-placed barbs at society's descent into consumer culture. But at its core, it is light, bubbly, and very enjoyable. Even if the constant string of flatulence humor grows old very quickly, there's a lot to like here. The cruel gossip and misunderstandings among the housewives leads to many laugh-out-loud moments. The two brothers' petty vow of silence (in reaction to their parents not buying them a TV set) does just that as well.In the end, it's not a classic, it's not all that original (Ozu presented many of these same themes in his previous films), but it certainly is worth watching.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's really cool to see how Americanized Japan got after the reconstruction. Maybe I'm wrong, but I doubt there were subdivisions and pencil salesmen pre 1945. The movie isn't just about two kids giving the world the silent treatment. They talk about gossip and character. And late 50s Japanese humor translates very well for some reason. Anyway, I really enjoyed watching it. It was a very nice surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull and Depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone else seems to be delighted with this "lightweight" comedy. I found it dull and depressing. It only made sense to me as an ironic commentary on the void of postwar Japanese suburban culture. There's nothing cute in the film at all, fart and poop jokes notwithstanding. The feeling of petty horror reminded me of Fassbinder and Ozon. I understand that some reviewers get nostalgic for past they see here, but let me suggest that much of what we see here is deliberately imagined, and that Ozu may well have meant this film as a cry of despair. Since everyone's dirty laundry is paraded for inspection, the final scene can only be a wry joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Growing up in 1950s Working-Class Japan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Working Class Japanese families ca. 1960 dealing with idle gossip, the difficulties of parenthood, and "competing with the Jones'" when it comes to modern gadgets like washing machines and TV set. The main focus is on a misunderstanding involving misplaced Union dues and the mean-spirited gossip resulting from an honest mistake. A side-plot has two little boys enter a pact of silence in protest that their parents are "too cheap" to buy a TV set, so they need not watch Wrestling and Baseball at their neighbors house. Will their "strike" pay off?This is a simple film about simple situations in working people's homes. Given the times, the daily struggle for survival and a few modern comforts are the center of each day's discussions. To think about one's retirement is discussed among people in their prime. The much used greetings (thus the title) and constant small talk are explained as a necessary means to achieve greater things. To sell a product, or to initiate friendliness with a prospective marriage partner.A visibly low budget, absolutely no cinematic frills and a minimal number of actors, none-the-less give the viewer a pleasant excursion into the life of hard working people in a given place and time. The film makes you smile, laugh out loud, and it also includes moments that may tuck at your heart strings. No classic or epic, yet a very pleasant little film to bring you joy.</fullReview>
