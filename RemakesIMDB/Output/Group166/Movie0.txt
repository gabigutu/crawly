		<shortDescription>Funny, charming and lots more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that I Was Born, But?is funny and charming is like saying The Godfather is a crime drama. It is that but much more. Featuring outstanding child performances, this silent film by the great Yasijiro Ozu is both a satire on the rigid structure of Japanese society and a coming-of-age story about children learning to live in a less than perfect world. It is an enduring masterpiece that has maintained its universal appeal over the years.In the film, eight-year old Keichi (Tomio Aoki) and his ten-year old brother Ryoichi (Hideo Sugawara) come to live in a small town in the suburbs of Tokyo after their father, Mr. Yoshii (Tatsuo Saito), an office clerk, receives a promotion. The transition to the suburbs, however, is not smooth. Neighborhood bullies taunt the boys, but they soon gain the upper hand with the help of a delivery boy (Shoichi Kojufita) who sends the main bully home crying. One of the neighborhood boys is Taro (Kato), the son of their father's employer Mr. Iwasaki (Takeshi Sakamoto) who seems to always be dressed in a black suit, befitting his station in life. The boys' behavior mirrors the adults with their games and power strategies including the very funny "resurrection" ritual. The two boys' are in awe of their father and consider him great; however, their loyalty is tested when they see him clowning and acting like a buffoon in front of his employer while watching home movies at Iwasaki's home. Mr. Yoshii explains later that as Iwasaki owns the company where he works, he has to treat him with respect. In disgust the boys ask if they will have to bow to their friend Taro, the boss's son, when he grows up. Resentful after a spanking and dissatisfied with the answers they have received to their questions, they go on a hunger strike but it is short lived. After the father talks with them about the meaning of being an employee, everyone learns something about the realities of life. Ozu seems to endorse acceptance of the status quo but, on reflection, it seems he is merely making observations rather than judgments. He is critical of the father for kowtowing to his employer, yet also sympathetic with the realities the family must face. The children have lost their innocence and must accept the fact that life isn't fair, but they also see that happiness can be achieved by rising above their prescribed status. Sadly, many of the boys shown in the movie had to fight and die in a bloody war only ten years later, in part a consequence of the rigid social structure Ozu satirized in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the very few silent films where you can hear the magic. Ozu directs I WAS BORN....BUT, the story of 2 brothers growing up in a small town Japan. Beautifully filmed with a wonderful, down to earth story of childhood joys and sorrows. Keep in mind, although sad, this was filmed in 1932. Just about every child in this film would grow up and fight (and most likely die) in World War 2. With this in mind, the film with hope and innocence. Still, knowing the possible future, you can't help but see the ending as somewhat sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Whole New Ozu: The Old Ozu!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Yasujiro Ozu's work, but, even after seeing some of those works that are generally considered best, I was still skeptical of his minimalist style. But then I saw the New Yorker VHS of the silent I Was Born, But...Let me just say that it is absolutely amazing. It's a nearly perfect film, with great direction, great writing, great jokes, and great acting. This is easily one of the best film about children ever made. The story revolves around two young boys whose dad has just moved to the suburbs near his boss. The kids have some trouble fitting in, and a gang of bullies accost them at first. But soon they conquer the leader of the gang and supplant him.Later in the film, the kids are challenged with their perception of their father. They think he's everything, of course, but they soon find out that he is only a salaryman. They watch his boss' movies, which include shots of the father fooling around for the entertainment of his employer. The children are flabberghasted, and rebel against their father. I have said it is a great film about childhood; it is also a great film about parenting, as the father and mother have to deal with their sons' disappointment.Please, please watch this film, especially if you have been disappointed with other works such as Tokyo Story. In my opinion, I Was Born, But... is a much better film. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and Heartbreaking Familiar Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 30s, a low middle-class family composed of the father (Tatsuo Saito), the mother (Mitsuko Yoshikawa) and two little sons (Hideo Sugawara and Tomio Aoki) has just moved to a suburb of Tokyo. The two brothers have some sort of adaptation problem with the kids in their neighborhood, but they feel protected with their beloved father, and they become leaders of the gang of boys. Their father is a clerk in an office, and his director lives in the same neighborhood, and he tries to be promoted in his job being a servile flatterer of his boss. One night, the boys find that his father has a silly behavior in his job to please his boss, and they lose the respect for their father, questioning him why he can not be the director of the company.This is the first movie of Yasujito Ozu that I have watched, since none of his films has been released on video or DVD in Brazil. This month, a Brazilian cable television is presenting four movies of this great director. I was really impressed with such powerful and heartbreaking fight of classes' familiar drama. I was expecting a movie like François Truffault's "Les Quatre Cents Coups", or Luis Bu?uel's "Los Olvidados", or Hector Babenco's "Pixote: A Lei do Mais Fraco". However, the story is not focused in juvenile delinquents, but only low-middle class children and the specific drama of a worker's family, when the little boys do not understand the social hierarchy and why their father is not better than the father of one boy of their gang. The performance of the cast is very natural, and the direction is amazing, having an adequate pace and transmitting the sensations and feelings of the characters without sound to the viewers. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Meninos de Tóquio" ("Boys From Tokyo")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>early masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An early family drama by Ozu that starts as a coming of age-`Japanese 400 blows'- and develops into a deep essay about identity, acceptation, self-respect, honor and exemplary. Ozu has a unique style for filming rituals, and these rituals are the dynamos of Tradition. In portraying a fractured relationship between a father and his sons, Ozu reflects on the transition between an old dying order and the arrival of a new one (both kids dream of being officials in the army, some ten years before Hiroshima). This works also as a metaphor of Japan on its way to technocracy, westernization and materialism, with its small bourgeois suburbia, the ever-passing trains and even home movies and child games where kids cross themselves in the Christian fashion. There's an unforgettable traveling shot with a choreography of yawns, some recognizable `Tatami' angles, and other technical achievements that prove that Ozu mastered his craft very early on (in fact, though silent, the film looks years ahead that many contemporary Hollywood productions). A rare film and indeed a very accessible one to the complexities of the cinema of Ozu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sparrow's eggs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is remarkably gentle stuff, I felt completely exhilarated whilst watching, an intimate openness like being welcomed into someone's home on an afternoon. It helps that it's a silent, they were still making them in Japan by that time albeit usually with what was called a benshi narrating the whole, it abets the languid flow of childhood spring that permeates the whole thing. It is cleverly structured, again a gentle touch but carefully applied; two brothers new on the block have to carve their own space while fending off a gang of bullies, this is mirrored in the adult world by having their father similarly have to struggle for advancement in the working place.The extra layer is our insight into the beginnings of the Showa period; capitalist industrialization is intensified, Western styles increasingly applied over traditional mores. The adults are smartly dressed in suits, wear hats, smoke cigars. The family's house is situated on the side of railroad tracks, now and then trains come shooting off in the back of the frame, constant reminders of a modern life lunging forwards.Again this is cleverly mirrored in the weave of the film itself, the specific image of the house by the tracks recalling La Roue, a French film that had spoken very clearly to the Japanese with its transient world of circular suffering. The whole carries hues of Chaplin's bittersweet whimsy, with a mobile camera derived from Sternberg, another favorite of early Japanese filmmakers. There is no benshi narrating this, just the intertitles, another Western norm.Having just asserted power in their microcosm, the kids eventually discover that their father is a servile buffoon, a kind of court jester at the office; this revelation tearing down the facade of respectability the kids were looking up to, implicitly posits the whole working structure to be feudal, with the capitalist boss as just another kind of daimyo surrounded by fawning servants. This happens in a superb scene where everyone is gathered at the house of the boss to watch this newfangled thing called the movies. So it is the cinematic reflection that reveals truth, it was exciting to discover this moment of self-reference in a Japanese film of the time.So even though Ozu's name usually brings to mind connotations of a purity distilled from tradition, this is breezy stuff, attuned with an emerging film culture abroad, explicitly modern in view and subject matter.And knowing what we do now, there is biting commentary in the parting notion; asked what they want to do when they grow up, the two brothers very seriously assert that they want to be generals. The Japanese army had just invaded Manchuria the previous year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at a special screening at the Museum Of Modern Art in New York City with live piano accompaniment. I'm not sure we needed the piano, this is a really great comedy about two young brothers trying to fit in in a new place. They are faced with two things: Bullies and that they feel their father is a nobody since he works for one of the other neighborhood boy's father. The two brothers are great. The audience, which was a refreshingly large one, laughed freely through the film, as I did.This is my first Ozu film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It depicts a child's world, what matters to them. It is a great silent film, the pace is good, it never drags. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost Innocence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I reckon this film to be Ozu's best work, although he is well-known for his "Tokyo Story" (which is also magnificent). This is a satirical comedy about human relations. Ozu brilliantly contrasts children's world with adult one. The child actors make splendid performance, entirely different from the players who show wooden faces in the works of Ozu's later years. The children in this movie are innocent and casual. Ozu is often thought to be a serious artist but he is a gag man by nature. He scatters various gags over the film, tactfully handling the child actors. I really admire his comic sense. Yet the trenchant irony underlies the story. Two brothers are outraged by their father for his clownish and subservient actions in his office. However, they finally understand and accept the hierarchy in the adult world. In a way this is a story of their growth but at the same time it is very sad that they lose their innocence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so glad that I ran into this movie. It left such an impression on me. The way it ended was so suprising. The boy's father was such a nice guy, and how that boy could be ashamed of him like that was really something else. It just left me in tears in the end of the movie. It makes me realize what our parents had to do to make a good living, even if it takes having to sell out your pride. His father did it because he loved his family. There is a lesson to be learned in this, and I would recommend this film in a heartbeat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Several days ago I saw a perfect print provided to the PFA by the Japan Foundation, with benshi Midori Sawato accompanying. The performance, of course, was exquisite, if sedate in keeping with the film and Ozu's reputation. Whether by chance or ingenuity the PFA placed Sawato on a raised platform, so you couldn't look at her face without also seeing the film, or the film without seeing her. Her male intonations, though with at least no obvious satire, rival those of Laurie Anderson or Lily Tomlin. But I've been wondering what on earth to say about Ozu. He hadn't discovered yet his low camera angle, and the pacing's not quite as slow as it would become. I'm afraid all that's stayed with me that anyone else might not say, is that, perhaps oddly for a film about a typical family of four, Ozu's camera again and again frames groups of three. I can't remember whether he does this later. Maybe Ozu just liked an image size that makes three optimum. Already, without the formality to come, his frame was beginning to solidify. Don't know. Something to think about is all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A memorable Japanese silent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many who see this film might be caught off guard when they see that despite being made in 1932, the film is still silent. Well, although the US had effectively made the switch in all their films by 1929, much of the world was way behind. In Japan, silents would continue well into the 1930s, so don't be put off by this--the Japanese film industry simply didn't have the equipment.I WAS BORN, BUT... is a film by the famed director Ozu. He is much more known for his sound films (such as TOKYO STORY) as well as his trademark camera-work (such as a stationary camera placed relatively low towards the ground in scenes inside Japanese homes). While some of the same camera-work is present (the camera does not pan or turn), there were also a few scenes using a dolly to move the camera to keep up with people as they move in outdoor scenes--a relatively modern idea. Also, like most Ozu films I have seen, the story involves ordinary folk and the action is relatively muted.The story is about two young boys who move to a new neighborhood. They have a lot of trouble because of bullies but despite a tough transition to school, the kids adore and respect their father. They think that he's a big man at work whereas in reality he's not. To make it worse, when the boys realize their father is a bit of a "brown noser", they lose faith in him. There's far more to the story than that and I really marveled at how the director managed to portray kids well. All too often, kids are over-idealized or act like miniature adults. Here, they're kids. And, in some of the scenes with the kids in the neighborhood, the film actually resembles a Little Rascals flick in many ways--with a bit of comedy thrown into the drama.Interesting and worth seeing--especially if you compare it to Ozu's later work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ozu's Boyhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely brilliant. Probably this is Ozu's first real masterpiece. Sure, I love his early comedies, like Days of Youth (1929), but this movie has got things to say, a real existential idea. Two kids are struggling through their boyhood, they think that their father must be the most influential man in the village, but soon everything changes. Father demands from children to have good grades in Calligraphy and Maths, if they want to become influential people, they have to do it. Soon kids manage to overcome obstacles and now they are the leaders of the gang. But father doesn't seems to be influential among his circle of friends and employees. At very early age, kids found out that if someone is rich, he can have more influence. Yes, life is unfair. Movie itself, is filmed very naturally, acting is good, of course nobody has doubt in Yasujiro's directing. Also, dialog is full with great one- liners and quotes. My favorite is: ,,What do you want to be in future? - Captain! - Why not General? - Because Ryoki wants to be a General and he's my older brother." Although ending is bright and hopeful, with smile on everybody's face, still this generation will face a great tragedy - World War II, but as the ending of the movie says: Life continues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming and Nostalgic Silent Comedy Masterpiece by Ozu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Backgorund score plays a very important role in most movies. It dictates the pace of the movie. It tells us when to laugh an when to cry, when to cower in fear and when to jump with joy. There are many movies which I can't even imagine without their score. Most notable of which perhaps is "The Passion of Joan of Arc". Of course it is also an artificial construct. I have also seen many silent films but all of them have a score added to them."I Was Born, But..." doesn't have any sound whatsoever. So this was a first for me. A kind of experiment really to gauge whether I would be able to appreciate the movie. It is one of early movies of Yasujiro Ozu. I am a big fan and I have decided to go all of his movies I can get my hand on. Still I was not sure about this one, as most critics only regard his later films as masterpieces. I shouldn't have worried. This movie still carries the magic of all his movies. And even though there is no score, it is only a minor setback. After sometime you hardly notice the lack of sound. It is very different from other silent comedies of the era. Most of the other silent movies use exaggerated expressions. In contrast acting and expressions here are of sound films except that there is no sound."I Was Born, But..." is charming, funny, poignant and nostalgic comedy centered around kids and how they see the adult world. It will surely strike a cord with everybody. I was bowled over by it. Ozu just keeps rising in my estimation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Put in simple terms, this is one of the greatest silent movies ever made. Though the film was intended to be screened with live voice-over by a benshi narrator, this masterpiece works stunningly well without sound, because Ozu'sunparalleled sense of visual rhythm, choreographed movement, and humorkeep one's eyes dancing in delight. The story concerns two boys who fight their way to gain status and respect among the local bullies, only to realize that their father is a bottom-feeder among the adults. As such it's loaded with acuteobservations of Japanese society, and not without Ozu's penchant for subtle but potent criticism. For people who are used to the "slow" Ozu of the 50s, this film will be a revelation, inspiring speculation as to how and why he changed a style that already was exceptional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Adult's Picture Book View - I Was Born, But? (1932) Friday July 15,4.15pm, The Castro, San Francisco Two brothers move to a new town and learn that the ways of the schoolyard and the ways of adulthood are not so different. Keiji and Ryoichi play hooky to avoid a bully, are shamed by their father's subservience to his boss, and challenge authority while relying on each other.An idyllic portrait of suburban life and emerging adolescence in pre-war Japan, I Was Born, But? (1932) is a well-suited introduction to the great director of social commentary, Yasujiro Ozu. Never was so much value placed on a sparrow's egg, so much pragmatism on a pair of unsharpened pencils or so much love conveyed in the eyes of a parent. I Was Born But? survives with a handful Ozu's silent films as the work of an emerging master. Unassumingly hilarious, modestly sentimental and uniquely Ozu, I was Born, But? ultimately transcends its cultural boundaries as a universal celebration of childhood.</fullReview>

It's a interesting character study of two young brothers and the trials and tribulations they experience after moving to new area. The area they are now in is populated by a gang of young wanna be thugs. Their dad is a businessman who always wears a suit to work. When the boys discover something completely unexpected about their dad they are devastated. The movie provides an endlessly fascinating look at suburban Japanese life complete with a loving mom, dad and two brothers from long, long ago.

It mostly focuses on lifestyle and school-life of two small kids. They get rivaled by local kids in the beginning. But soon they become the leaders of the gang. The film is filled with sweet moments, gives a good taste of innocent childhood. They find it hard to accept that an outwitted boy's father is the boss of their father. The parents are beautifully portrayed in the film. How they influence their children and lead them to a better social position in future.

		<fullReview>I Was Born, But... is a wonderfully titled and crafted movie of pure simplicity by the master Ozu. As the title suggests, it's about someone facing the fact that they exist, but they aren't going to achieve anything. Two brothers move with their family so their father can be closer to his boss. The boys get into trouble with the local gang of boys, but soon manage to take control. Just as they are enjoying their triumph, they discover that their father plays the clown for his boss. They see this as a betrayal, and lose respect for their father. During the Ozu Retrospective I've seen Ozu handle dialog, sound, color, and everything else. Here was a nice chance to see him use only his sparse black and white visuals. The story was hilarious and moving. The boys really respect their father, and he encourages them to make something of themselves. Once they find out about his antics, they are not amused. We see the importance of honor and respect, even amongst such young children. The family dynamic is well structured, and even without sound I was completely entranced. Seeing the two boys struggle with the local gang was simply charming. It shows them upsetting the order of the group as the new outsiders. It shows that the need to be accepted never truly leaves us, and the barriers between adults and children aren't so thick and impenetrable. The climax is the young boys giving their father permission to suck up to their boss, and realising he does it for them. So gentle, so sweet, and a little bit sad. Pure Ozu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Japanese Silent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that at the beginning, at the first half of the movie, this movie just seemed average to me. However, the second half is way more interesting, with a strong and nice message in the end.In the plot, I think there were only a few unnecessary things, but for the most part, everything fits quite well. The acting was great as well, nothing really outstanding, just good. Acting in Ozu's films is basically always good, actors just look like normal people and they just fit pretty well in what they represent.If you like silent films, this is a nice piece you can't miss.Although I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone. To enjoy this film you have to be fond of silent films or at least black and white ones; I don't really see people used to modern movies enjoying this, it might get boring to them. Unless they want to explore or start watching this kind of films, or Ozu's filmmaking style, I think they should stay away from this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewed on DVD. Restoration = seven (7) stars. There's an old saying in acting circles: Never do a scene with a baby (or a dog) unless you want that scene stolen. In this film it's kids (and a dog). And the adult actors suffer big time both in the slice-of-life story line and by being constantly upstaged on screen. (And their characters don't look especially happy about matters.) This is a deliciously outrageous film about precocious preteens, but meant for entertaining grown ups (who may also be dealing with unruly kids in the midst of a major cultural upheaval). Just under a dozen child actors are on display with at least two in virtually every scene. Not only do they carry the film, they are the film! Many juveniles you have seen before (and will see again) in the director's movies. The film, though, is too long by at least a third and continuously grows in tediousness and repetition. Several of the director's trademarked shots of white under garments drying on clotheslines are on display plus electric train engines that constantly flash by (they seem to be blown-up models in rear-screen projection) for no apparent reasons (other than to, well, add flash). The restoration is OK, but wear and deterioration artifacts are visible here and there. Piano score is fine. Bottom line: Fun to watch for about an hour, but ... . WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rate this movie as being only a step above an Our Gang comedy. It's a 1932 silent with scene after scene of kids going to school, kids coming home from school, kids eating lunch, kids eating at home, kids fighting or poking each other, kids staring at each other ready to fight. These scenes alternate with scenes of the father going to work, coming home from work, changing clothes, going into his boss's office, and all characters putting on their shoes as they come out of their house.The movie has a serious plot, with plenty of heart, but it is just too boring to have to watch all these non-scenes to get at the plot.
