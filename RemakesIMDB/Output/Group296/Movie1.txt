		<shortDescription>Decent but quite fanciful adaptation of the Hale novella</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This short, nominated for an Oscar, is reasonably good, but quite loose and more than a bit fanciful in its treatment of the source material. Ironically, the changes make the short weaker and LESS memorable than the original novella by Edward Everett Hale. By all means, catch the short if possible, but the orignal is far more interesting and satisfying. Turner Classic Movies runs this as filler between films on ocasion and has done so in March the last several years in its 31 Days of Oscar feature. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Headstrong Philip Nolan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward Everett Hale's classic short story, The Man Without A Country has been done as a feature film on the big and small screen a few times. There was even a classic radio play that was narrated by Bing Crosby where Frank Lovejoy played Nolan that sold a few platters back in the day. But this 1937 adaption covers all the salient points in the story.I've always found it ironic that the guy who was putting this whole western conspiracy together in the first decade of the 19th century, Aaron Burr, was never convicted of anything, but that this fictional small fry Philip Nolan got such a sentence. It wasn't however for any vague plot against the USA because Aaron Burr's very vagueness of purpose kept him from conviction. Nolan was arrested for desertion and his guilt was pretty clear about that.John Litel as Nolan dreams of glory, riches, and adventure in winning his bride Gloria Holden. When he's reminded of his duty at the court martial, he utters the words that seal his fate about, 'damn the United States, I wish I may never hear of her again. As Hale says in the story the men who convicted and determined this sentence of exile for Nolan were those who had fought in the Revolution and such talk was an abomination to them.Nolan is sentenced to be placed aboard a Navy vessel where he's to live for the rest of his natural life without hearing a mention of the United States of America again. He lives under that burden up until the Civil War. Holden is showed begging for clemency from two presidents. James Monroe who was a Revolutionary veteran and survivor of Valley Forge and Andrew Jackson, a significant military figure in his own right from the next generation. Finally she wins a hearing from a president known for pardoning people, Abraham Lincoln.The ending is changed and quite frankly ripped off from Maytime. Still Litel and Holden make a fine pair of lovers eternal and The Man Without A Country is a stirring story, brought to us in a stirring adaption as a Warner Brothers short subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Warner Bros, better 2 reel short subjects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 9 or 10 years old when I first saw this in 1937, It was part of a double feature including a cartoon, newsreel, coming attractions, this 21 minute short &amp; 2 movies.A perfect afternoon for childrenHistorically this true story is wanting, the short novel by Edward Everett Hale, was more interesting.John Litel a character actor for many years after: was the lead &amp; he was very good. Later on he excelled at play9ng Fathers &amp; School Principals, He was a skilled actor &amp; a first rate gentlemen.Warner Bros. &amp; other studios made many short subjects, this was one of the better ones.They still make shorts, but they only play at special festivals in major cities, This is really a shame.Can you imagine, telling a whole story in 21 minutes including some action, War of 1812 battle scene. They did it then. As I said I was only 9 yrs old. This is primarily for children &amp; that was the intention of the frere's WarnerI do not rate short short subjects,. Let my IMDb 7 be your guide. TCM does show this in on Occasion, Have your inquisitive children hunt for it. It was filmed in gorgeous 3-strip Technicolour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good short subject from Warner Brothers!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True story of a man who harbors traitorous feelings towards his country, this one being the USA, and suffering mightily for it down the road. Great pacing makes this go by really fast and by the time it is over, you wish that it was longer. Good acting from the entire cast--and also a treat to see a short subject in color!! Also a thrill to figure out who all the uncredited actors and actresses are--as they have been in countless films as supporting characters to the main actors. Very enjoyable through and through!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing for Gloria Holden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I turned on the TCM (Turner Classic Movies) channel this morning and saw an interesting 15 minute short. Being a movie fan, these unusual curiosity pieces are one of the reasons I enjoy TCM so much. It starred Gloria Holden of 'Dracula's Daughter' fame. The short was called 'The Man Without a Country' made in 1937, about a year after 'DD'. I know she was in many films during her career yet I have only seen her in 'DD'. This short was in Technicolor and that was a surprise. She really is an unusual looking woman, strangely attractive in her own way. That's one reason she was so effective in 'DD'. It was strange seeing her playing a fashionable lady from the late 1700s here. We see her age about 50 years as she tries to get a pardon for the man she loves, a disgraced army officer. It was a pretty sappy and dated patriotic story. Still it was worth 15 minutes to see Gloria Holden doing something different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why NOT devote an entire branch of the U.S. military . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . for 56 YEARS to carry out the spiteful whimsy of some backwoods fort commander? At least Lt. Philip Nolan's court martial judges were not busy frittering away taxpayer money on solid gold toilet seats like their present day counterparts (most likely because toilets were yet to be invented in 1805, when this tale begins). So well into 1861, U.S. president after president maneuvers the American fleet so that Lt. Nolan can be kept in foreign or international waters. Lt. Nolan's crime was not being born a "Real American," otherwise known as a One Per Center. When a member of the Upper Crust fills his head with dreams of escaping the Iron Caste System of the U.S. into a new meritocracy based upon the Principles of True Democracy, Lt. Nolan tries to Carpe Diem. He's so crushed when his pipe dream turns out to be a cruel hoax that he fails to grovel sufficiently for his station, given his status as a tiny cog in the gears to which the 99% are relegated. Poor Phil's "betters" decide to spare no effort or taxpayer expense to prove such old American adages as "The nail sticking up gets hammered down the hardest" and "Ask not if the country is yours, but ask who are you to deserve the country?" Lt. Nolan's punishment lasted just 56 years, but the 21 minutes of THE MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY have been pounded into U.S. school kids for 78 years and counting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not based on fact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was about nine years old the last time I saw this film. I am in my late 50's now. It was shown in elementary schools to foster patriotism during the 1950's. I cannot comment on the film itself or its qualities as too many years have passed.I can say, however, that it is not factual. Wikipedia.org says this about the story that the film was based on: "The Man Without a Country was a short story published anonymously by Edward Everett Hale, in the Atlantic Monthly in 1863. Although the events of the novel were set in the early 1800s, the story was an allegory and implicitly referred to the upheaval of the American Civil War..." We were also shown films such as "Reefer Madness" about the same time. I would put this film in somewhat the same category. Its purpose is to present an agenda rather than to entertain. Certainly not a fault in itself, but see this as an editorial on celluloid.</fullReview>
