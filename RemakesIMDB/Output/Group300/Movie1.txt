		<shortDescription>The one, TRUE mummy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having recently seen the 1999 remake, I realized just how powerful Karloff's portrayal of Imhotep/Ardath Bey truly is. Without fancy effects or CGI, without an $80,000,000 budget, with little more than dry-looking make-up, a doleful stare, and that wonderful, lisping voice, Karloff created a monster that will endure long after the rental copies of the remake have shed their metal oxide coatings. Karl Freund, the director, was one of Germany's finest cameramen and this was his first film as a director. Employing the "less is more" theory of film-making, he keeps the mummy a very mysterious and deadly creature. Never does the mummy stroll up to someone, working them into a corner to strangle them. No, he just reaches out with his mind, killing people from miles away. Finally, the flashback scene is one of the best, done in "silent film" style with music and Karloff supplying a morbid voiceover. Sadly, Universal cut the flashback short before the mummy had a chance to tell about chasing the re-incarnated princess throughout time. Some stills survive and Henry Victor still gets credit as "The Saxon Warrior".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moody, understated and succinct</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boris Karloff plays Imhotep, a cursed Egyptian buried alive 3700-years-ago, returns to life to claim the reincarnation of his lost-love in this Universal classic. Moody, understated and succinct, The Mummy is one of the best films from Universal's classic horror period. Although much of the success can be credited to first time director Karl Freund, who normally worked as a top cinematographer, and the brilliant make-up artist Jack P. Pierce, it is Boris Karloff who gives the film its resonance. As he previously did with the Frankenstein monster, Karloff imbues this character with an aching sense of humanity which was completely absent later incarnations of the Mummy character. Credit must also be given to the able supporting cast including Zita Johann and the always reliable Edward Van Sloan. Now here's a question. Is the film scary by today's standards? I guess I'd have to say not really. However, I just watched this film again after seeing the American version of 'The Grudge.' 'The Grudge' certainly had me jumping more, but which film did I enjoy more? It'd have to be 'The Mummy.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well-Crafted Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With one of Boris Karloff's numerous acting successes and a production done the way that a horror feature should be made, this is a well-crafted classic of the genre. From the first scene, the right atmosphere is established, and the story is told at an implacable pace that slowly builds up the tension and possibilities.As he does with his characters in so many of his horror features, Karloff makes "The Mummy" a menacing monster, yet one with enough human motivations to keep him from becoming cartoonish. Karloff's approach, as does the movie as a whole, stimulates the imagination rather than the senses, giving this classic version a depth and permanence that cannot be matched by those more recent adaptations that rely on boring "special" effects and contrived "action" sequences instead of a well-told story with solid characters.Edward Van Sloan, David Manners, and the rest of the supporting cast also help out. The atmosphere and settings are kept relatively simple, but effective. Naturally, the story is far-fetched, but it has a consistency that makes it relatively easy to suspend disbelief. The picture fits together well, and it remains a solid entry in the list of classic horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the Atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love these Universal horror movies. This one is all atmosphere. The lighting, the focus on Karloff's eyes and his threatening persona carry the film. When I was in elementary school (my kids would say not long after this film was made), I had another kid scare the daylights out of me by describing the internment of the Egyptian rulers. The taking of the body, perfuming it, placing it in a room full of gold, then killing the slaves so that only the priests would know the actual resting place of the body. There was also the bit about being wrapped alive for burial. I'll tell you.The effect of that story, which is portrayed in the movie, put a bigger scare into me than any movie I've ever seen. Since this one was really the only one we would ever see on television, I watched it every time I could. Isn't it interesting that both the Lugosi "Dracula" use a quotation from "Swan Lake" as a theme song. I've always wondered why that is. It is certainly eerie and as the credits roll, it builds in intensity. I was told once that Tchaikovsky would probably do movie soundtracks if he were alive today. Pardon my digressions. It is interesting that the mummy (as a fully wrapped personage) really doesn't appear after the beginning sequence--we just know that old Boris is in the process of decay and will eventually be sent to his eternal reward. As usual, the scientists and those who should know, carelessly leave the young woman unattended and he makes his move. The threatening suavity of Karloff is the high point of the movie. I feel the world received such a gift when these films were made. It is a delight, full of frightening images and classic moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Subtle of the Universal Horror Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although frequently reinterpreted, the original 1932 THE MUMMY remains the most intriguing film version of a story inspired by both 1920s archaeological finds and the 1931 Bela Lugosi Dracula: when an over-eager archaeologist reads an incantation from an ancient scroll, he unexpectedly reanimates a mysterious mummy--who then seeks reunion with the princess for whom he died thousands of years earlier and ultimately finds his ancient love reincarnated in modern-day Egypt.Less a typical horror film than a Gothic romance with an Egyptian setting, THE MUMMY has few special effects of any kind and relies primarily upon atmosphere for impact--and this it has in abundance: although leisurely told, the film possesses a darkly romantic, dreamlike quality that lingers in mind long after the film is over. With one or two exceptions, the cast plays with remarkable restraint, with Boris Karloff as the resurrected mummy and Zita Johann (a uniquely beautifully actress) standouts in the film. The sets are quite remarkable, and the scenes in which Karloff permits his reincarnated lover to relive the ancient past are particularly effective.Kids raised on wham-bam action and special effects films will probably find the original THE MUMMY slow and uninteresting, but the film's high quality and disquieting atmosphere will command the respect of both fans of 1930s horror film and the more discerning viewer. Of all the 1930s Universal Studio horror films, THE MUMMY is the most subtle--and the one to which I personally return most often.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest Mummy movie ever made. Full of atmosphere and suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the classic horror movies of the 1930s. They were made when the talkies were still novel and film makers were experimenting with storytelling approaches, often taking inspirations from German Expressionism (indeed 'The Mummy's director Karl Freund, who later directed another 1930s classic 'Mad Love', originally worked as a cinematographer on Fritz Lang's science fiction classic 'Metropolis' and several movies by F.W. Murnau). And it was before the Hayes Code kicked in and took a lot of the fun and thrills out of horror movies (just look at how safe and uninteresting horror became in the 1940s with a few notable exceptions e.g. the movies produced by Val Lewton). The film obviously owes a lot to 'Dracula' and Edward Van Sloan and David Manners from that film reappear here in similar roles. Karloff is brilliant as Imhotep a.k.a The Mummy, and stage actress Zita Johann is wonderful too, very striking with exotic good looks. Too bad she became very quickly disillusioned with Hollywood as she should have been a major screen star. Karloff and Johann are fantastic on screen together, and make 'The Mummy' impossible to forget. I was quite surprised to discover that this movie wasn't enormously successful when originally released, but it has obviously captured the imagination of thousands of film fans since. It is easily the best Mummy movie ever made (though I also have a fondness for Hammer's "Blood From The Mummy's Tomb' made almost forty years later), and much more entertaining and intelligent than the awful remake starring Brendan Fraser et al. 'The Mummy' stands alongside 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein', 'Island Of Lost Souls', 'Freaks', 'The Invisible Man' and 'The Black Cat' as one of the best horror movies of the 1930s, an era that has had an enormous impact on horror ever since. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An oddly poetic episode of terror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Karl Freund, who photographed some of the most memorable silent films made both in this country and Germany, turned director only twice in his career. He directed Peter Lorre in MAD LOVE (1935) and Boris Karloff in this film I am about to discuss. Following FRANKENSTEIN and THE OLD DARK HOUSE the public knew it liked Boris Karloff but he had been silent in his two biggest roles. When this movie was released they flocked to the cinema to hear him speak (evidently they had missed THE MIRACLE MAN, NIGHT WORLD, BUSINESS AND PLEASURE and the other minor roles he appeared in while FRANKENSTEIN was becoming a hit). His voice was no disappointment and neither was his performance in this picture. Director Freund handles many important scenes as if he were directing a silent film . . .and it WORKS! The scene of Im-Ho-Tep returning to life is masterful, as is the flashback sequence where he shows his reincarnated princess just what became of him. David Manners is a far more practical hero in this film than he was in DRACULA (and he is not hampered by having to wear those ridiculous knickerbockers) and Edward van Sloan is fabulous yet again. Watch for Noble Johnson showing off his muscular frame as the Nubian servant. Jack Pierce's makeup is nothing short of fantastic; what he did with gum cotton and collodion was truly masterful. The photography is very well done also. One scene where the camera flashpans away from Im-Ho-Tep and over the rooftops of Cairo coming to rest on Helen Grosvenor is truly Germanic. A similar scene appears in FAUST (1926), and also in SVENGALI (1931). Red Rock Canyon substitutes for ancient Egypt but we always believe we are seeing just what we are supposed to be seeing. This is a very subtle film, and all the more scary because if its subtlety. Now shall we discuss MAD LOVE?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff Walks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MUMMY awakened in Egypt by English archeologists goes on a rampage searching for its reincarnated lover.Boris Karloff dominates this little fright fest, bringing new nightmares to the screen and proving that his Frankenstein's Monster was no mere quirk, but actually the beginning of a distinguished career in shocker films. Helped immensely by makeup master Jack Pierce, who gave the Mummy face &amp; hands like weathered parchment, Karloff uses his own saturnine features and tall thin body to full effect, creating a horror portrait that has stood the test of time.A sturdy supporting cast gives Karloff good support: exotic Zita Johann is lovely &amp; slightly mysterious as the woman of Imhotep's deathless desires; valiant David Manners as the young hero gives another typically fine performance; Arthur Byron &amp; Edward Van Sloan are enjoyable as the requisite old gentlemen (every horror film must have at least one) who study &amp; stalk the Mummy. African-American silent film star Noble Johnson appears as a sinister Nubian.The film's best scene, the resuscitation of the Mummy, demonstrates the potential of the medium. The only indication the viewer has that something horrible is about to happen is a flicker of Karloff's eye and a slight movement of his hand as he stands in his casket, bound in bandages. The rest of the scene unfolds in the hysterical reaction of young Bramwell Fletcher (excellent performance) as he watches the undead leave the scientists' tent. All the audience sees is Karloff's hand and the trailing bandages from his feet as they drag across the floor. It is enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True originals don't need remakes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given enough time and interest, I'm sure that I would have gotten around to the original Universal version of "The Mummy", but the hideous (in every respect) 1999 remake is the straw that broke the camel's back. The second I happened to see the original (complete with poster art) on the shelves of my local Wal-Mart, there were no second thoughts. It HAD to be better than that low-grade (though high budget)"Raiders of the Lost Ark" ripoff I spent two hours suffering through. Thankfully, my impulse proved to be on the money.I really look at this film as Karloff's first piece of proof that there was more to his talent than Frankenstein's monster. Imhotep (aka Ardeth Bay) couldn't be more different than that sweet-natured brute. Though both are pathetic in their own way and lonely, Imhotep is more intelligent and a great deal more malicious by far. He's willing to do anything, kill anyone, and break any taboo to be reunited with his lost love. Karloff never has to raise his voice to convey menace; just a hardening of the eyes or a steely tone in that oh-so-distinct voice of his is enough to make you a little uneasy.An overlooked aspect of this film is that, in a way, it's something of a tragedy. Imhotep has literally sacrificed everything he ever had just to be by the side of his beloved princess. So focused on this goal is he that he doesn't realize the great harm he is doing to all those around him, including to his beloved (who, in a thankful break with movie tradition at the time, proves to be the undoing of the immortal monster). I feel more of a sense of relief at film's end than triumph. Maybe now Imhotep can rest in peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better classic horror flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another film that puts the basic storyline of Dracula to better use. This time, it's the undead Egyptian priest, I'm-ho-tep (Boris Karloff), who puts the beautiful Helen under his spell. David Manners and Edward Van Sloan both reprise their Dracula roles as the young hero, and the wise old mentor respectively. Van Sloan, who is the only actor to appear in Frankenstein, Dracula and The Mummy, gives his best performance here. Karloff is also quite good as the evil villain, I'm-ho-tep. This remains the only mummy movie that can really be called a suspense film or thriller rather than a monster movie. It's not quite as good as Frankenstein, but it's still one of the better classic horror flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imhotep takes his first steps...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great story of the mummy Imhotep who comes to life again after scientists discover the grave of his beloved female Egyptian Priest will be told many times again after this original from 1932. But never again will it be so magical. Never again will it be so scary with the use of so less effects. Boris Karloff BECOMES Imhotep, just like he became Frankenstein in the earlier monster classic. His achievement makes this film immortal. Even in another 75 years he will still be the one and only Mummy to me. This classic monster production from Universal delivers. It's grabs your attention from the very first minute and it doesn't let you go. Most of the credit for that go to Karloff himself of course. His voice and especially those eyes !!! All the modern computer generated skills can never give the same horrific effect as Boris Karloff's creepy look. The mummification at the end, the few close ups when the camera stares right in his eyes...those are images who can never ever die !! I have to give some credit to the rest of the cast as well of course. Zita Johann is absolutely gorgeous as the Princess Anckesen-Amon. Imhotep sees in Helen Grosvenor the reincarnation of his long lost Egyptian priest. Only her love for archaeologist Frank Whemple can save her. Edward Van Sloan, also a great legend in early horror ( he played in Frankenstein and was the very first Dr. Van Helsing in Dracula with Bela Lugosi ) plays a very memorable part in this film as well. His character, Dr Muller, is an expert in the field of the Egyptian culture. Overall, like the credits in they end say " A good cast is worth repeating" I think that's great. I'm a great fan of the Egyptian Myths and recommend this film to everyone who likes this great culture as well. I also advise you to see the Hammer version starring Peter Cushing and Christoper Lee and The mummy lives starring Tony Curtis. I do not like the modern version of the mummy actually. Brendan Fraser is good the CGI effects spoiled the magic for me. It's loyal to the story, I gotta give it that. Finally, I would have loved to be there when this film came out back in 1932. Only a few years after the amazing discovery of the tomb of Tut. this must have been gigantic. I heard the audience was frightened to death when Karloff opened his eyes for the first time. The hype back then, I would love to be a part of that. My humble opinion on The Mummy...what do you think ... 10/10 !!! This title comes with my highest recommendations</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He went for a little walk!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Throughout the great length of his career, Boris Karloff played a number of horror cinema's most memorable characters. But I've always been of the opinion that his work in Universal's The Mummy is his best.- The story in The Mummy is, in many respects, almost identical to Universal's earlier Dracula movie. Exchange a mummy for a vampire and Cairo for Transylvania and the rest is quite comparable. Both movies are basically love stories - regardless of how twisted the "love" may seem. Ardath Bay's sole purpose in life (or should that be afterlife) is to resurrect the spirit of his long dead love, Princess Anckesen-Amon. His 3,000 year obsession and devotion is demonstrated in the line, "Anckesen-Amon, my love has lasted longer than the temple of our gods. No man ever suffered as I did for you." The response he receives a few scenes later, "No. No, I'm alive. I'm young. I won't die. I loved you once, but now you belong with the dead. I am Anckesen-Amon, but I'm somebody else too. I want to live, even in this strange new world", is heartbreaking.- Other obvious and less obvious examples of how the two movies are similar include: the use of religious symbols to repel the monsters, the use of hypnosis, the close-up shots of the eyes, and cast members who play basically the same roles (Edward Van Sloan and David Manners appear in both films in almost identical roles). Finally, a similarity that I've always noticed that I've not read anywhere else concerns the Renfield character from Dracula and poor Ralph Norton in The Mummy. Both become stark-raving, hysterical-laughing, mad lunatics. And whether intentional or not, both assist their respective monsters with their plans ? Renfield by actively helping Dracula and Norton by accidentally bringing the mummy back to life.- Karloff is perfect as Imhotep/Ardath Bay. I've said a number of times that Karloff was born to play this role. His slim, long body looks like what I imagine a mummy might look like after 3,000 years in the hot, drying desert. Karloff's face, with the help of Jack Pierce's make-up, looks like it would turn to dust at the slightest touch. And, as most would agree, Karloff's voice has an otherworldly quality that sounds as if it were coming from the grave. Karloff's acting abilities also add to the illusion that he is the mummy. Whether his decision or that of director Karl Freund I don't know, but Karloff gives a very understated performance that is necessary if he is to be believed. The understated performance without wild, exaggerated movements is perfect for a 3,000 year old mummy. His carriage suggests a very fragile being that fears crumbling with any strenuous action. To me, Karloff simply is The Mummy.- Every time I watch The Mummy, I'm amazed at how little screen time Karloff has as Imhotep. To think that he spent 8 hours a day getting the full-body mummy treatment only to appear for a few minutes in the final film (and never a full body shot) shows an amazing amount of restraint on the part of Freund. If you're a believer in the "what's not shown is more frightening that what is" theory of horror, you'll appreciate Freund's decision. But the few shots where Imhotep does appear are, for me, the definition of movie magic. I'll never forget the first time I saw The Mummy. The scene where Imhotep slowly opens his eye to reveal for the first time that he is alive immediately became (and remains) for me one of the most memorable moments in horror history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest of the Universal horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What director Karl Freund achieves in this movie is nothing short of staggering, even at a remove of nearly 70 years. If this same story, with this same basic approach, were released today, it would still be great. And especially now, when the box office successes of such movies as The Sixth Sense, What Lies Beneath and The Blair Witch Project demonstrate that audiences are hungry for a return to the classic horror virtues of style, mood and suspense (as opposed to the tired formula of gore, in your face shocks, special effects, and more gore) The Mummy would seem ripe for some kind of revival (too bad the lame Brendan Fraser vehicle has stolen its title - though nothing of its wit, skill, or conviction).What makes this movie so good is. . . gosh, there are so many things! Start with the creepy and unsettling tone, which the movie establishes right away. The very first scene - where the Mummy is awakened - is one of the greatest ever for pure atmosphere and chills. Look at the way Freund *under* plays it, every step of the way. Instead of piling on a crescendo of "scary" music and using odd or distorted camera angles to dramatize the situation, he has the action play out in total silence and with a resolutely still camera, the tasteful cut-aways (from the mummy in the tomb to the archaeologist sitting not five feet away) being the only frill. The tension which results is unsettlingly powerful - and is made moreso by the fact that the scene refuses to resolve itself in the way which we expect it to. I'll give no more details, but when you watch the film, ask yourself: isn't *this* resolution ten times more creepy and effective than the one we thought we saw coming. Already, five minutes in, it's clear that The Mummy has a far more wicked, sophisticated sense of horror than any of the other big "monsters" of the day (Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolf Man, etc.) - and a good deal more than many that have come after, too.But of course, all the style in the world ultimately cannot save a weak or hackneyed script. And so it's a great pleasure to report that all of Freund's technical finesse is at the service of a really super cool story. Not content to be merely a spooker, the film is also - nay, one might even say primarily - a tragic love story: one that deals intelligently with such provocative notions as forbidden love, reincarnation, religious desecration, inhuman torture, and a strong sub-theme of the desire to respect the past vs. the need to live for the moment. All of these elements swirl so ingeniously and non-didactically in The Mummy's streamlined storyline, that I'm tempted to proclaim this at once both the most compact, as well as the most ambitious, horror movie script I have ever come across.Of course, such superlatives can get you in trouble too, so let me add that yes, there are flaws - mainly the ones endemic to all horror movies of the time. The so-called "hero" is once again a young man of no charm or interest whatsoever. Meanwhile, the venerable old "expert" who must explain the ways of the monster to everyone else is already a tired convention at this point - and since the role here is played by Edward Van Sloan (who was Van Helsing in the original "Dracula" and its sequel "Dracula's Daughter", as well as Dr. Waldman in "Frankenstein") there is an even greater than usual sense of perfunctoriness to the undertaking. However, even here the movie displays its strength and uniqueness by toying with our expectations of what these stock characters will be able to do and achieve. Whereas in most other horror films, the romantic lead and the crusty old doctor end up being the white knights who vanquish the monster and save the girl, here they operate on a much less exalted plane - and are thereby made more human in the process.As for faults, that's pretty much it. The pace is masterful; some have called it slow, but I strongly disagree. The film flows naturally and inevitably, with every scene building upon the one before it. There's nothing extraneous in the way it unfolds - achievement enough when compared to the countless other horror movies of its day. As an added treat, there is a flashback sequence in the middle of the movie that is a mini-masterpiece all by itself: it has all the fury and grandeur of a D.W. Griffith silent, honed and encapsulated down to its bare essence. It tells the tale of the title character's previous life with an economy and precision that could still serve as a model for filmmakers today. And, well, most of all, the movie has. . . Boris Karloff.I've restricted my discussion of him until the end because his towering greatness is so routinely accepted and understood that it's almost redundant to comment upon it. Also, I wanted to make clear that, though he is the film's chief asset, he is far from its only one. But there's no question that it is his stately, brooding, menacing performance that ultimately pushes this film over into the realm of greatness. The key thing here is this: while the concept of a centuries-old being raised from the dead and out for vengeance is a great *idea*, Karloff's portrayal is what gives it tangible, terrifying REALITY. Observing this man - with his stiff ramrod posture, his measured and stately movements, and his absolutely hypnotic voice - we are truly convinced, on a visceral level, that yes here indeed is the walking dead. That kind of verisimilitude is rare enough in horror movies of any era, and its presence here stands as an absolute revelation. Just as does the entirety of this wonderful, exquisitely made film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris Karloff At His Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor David Manners, there was an actor who truly never had a break. Imagine being an actor whose fate was seemingly always to be consigned to playing straight-man to Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. In one film, "The Black Cat", he actually would up playing straight-man to both of them!In "The Mummy" it was poor Manners' misfortune to be cast opposite Boris Karloff. How can any actor hope to get noticed while sharing the screen with one of the greatest horror icons of all time, especially in what many consider to be one of Karloff's roles? Granted that, after 80 years, some aspects of the movie may creak a bit. However, there's no getting around the fact that time has detracted absolutely nothing from Karloff's performance.It is interesting to compare the 1932 version of "The Mummy" with the 1999 version, because the differences in style and production emphasis are so striking. The modern version is all about CGI special effects and roller-coaster paced action. The 1932 version is all about setting an eerie mood and, of course, the sheer charismatic presence of Boris Karloff.In Frankenstein Karloff played The Monster as a heavy, hulking, stumbling mute. Yet how different he seems in The Mummy. Yes, there are scenes in which the actor was wrapped up and heavily made up to simulate a 3,700-year-old mummy. By all accounts that was a very unpleasant experience for the actor, too. However, in most of the movie Karloff was dressed in a sort of full-length gown, emphasizing the actor's tall and spare frame, further implying the notion that he is a 3,700-year-old re-animated mummy. Nevertheless, the actor's performance was not limited to makeup and costume. Further accentuating the idea of a walking corpse is the subtle manner in which Karloff moved, or should one more precisely say, didn't move. Karloff's mummy moved very slowly, almost gliding; and when he stood he stood very still, moving his body as little as possible. The overall effect of that stillness was to make Karloff's mummy seem even more powerful and menacing. Another notable difference was that, unlike in Frankenstein, in "The Mummy" Karloff got a chance to make use of that wonderfully sibilant, purring voice of his; that unique voice that has put chills up generations of spines, and still continues to do so.It is also worth noting that Karl Freund's direction was a textbook example to aspiring modern horror film directors of how less can be so much more. The initial scene in which Karloff's mummy becomes alive, opening his eyes slightly and slowly moving one hand just a little bit, still has the power to chill. So does that the subsequent scene, in which all that is visible to the viewer are a couple of bandages moving slowly along the floor and trailing out of the door. Nothing is more frightening than the imagination and, in that classic scene, Freund demonstrated exactly how far a little bit of suggestion can go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about crushing out big time on a woman. Boris Karloff's been buried for 3700 years just thinking about Princess Ank-sa-namen and no cold showers where he's been.Maybe I shouldn't be so flip because I do in fact consider The Mummy to be one of the best horror films ever done. Amazingly so because it relies so little on special effects or make-up. You see Boris Karloff in the beginning while he's still in his coffin in his Mummy wrap. Then at the end there are special effects ever so briefly in the final battle with Karloff.Other than that this film relies entirely on the mood and suspense created by director Karl Freund and the performance of Boris Karloff as the tortured soul Im-ho-tep.In 1922 I'm-ho-tep's secret unmarked tomb is found and when young assistant Bramwell Fletcher utters an ancient Egyptian spell, the Mummy gets up and walks out, leaving a stark, raving mad Fletcher.Fast forward ten years, a mysterious man named Ardath Bey tells another expedition where to find the tomb of Princess Ank-sa-namen. Her mummy is raised and put in the Cairo Museum. But that's only the beginning of Ardath Bey/Im-ho-tep's plan. It also involves Zita Johann the daughter of the Governor of the Sudan who is Egyptian on mom's side. She's a collateral descendant of the princess and feels drawn to Karloff. She's also drawn to young David Manners and that could put a crimp in Karloff's plans.Boris Karloff probably had his most challenging role here. It's a terribly complex part. We are repulsed by Karloff's scheme, but at the same time the audience feels terribly sorry for what he's been through. While Johann is in a trance, Karloff narrates a flashback sequence to her telling how he was buried alive after she died because he tried to use Egyptian black arts to raise the princess from the dead. What a terrible hurt the man must have felt, and the audience feels it too.The mood is helped in large part by the great orchestrations of James Dietrich of Tschaikovsky themes. Also interpolated in the film background score is the popular ballad Beautiful Love. It creates an aura of unredeemed sadness throughout the film.There is a lot of similarity between The Mummy and that other Universal horror classic Dracula. But Bela Lugosi's Dracula is hardly as sympathetic a figure as Im-ho-tep as played by Boris Karloff. Also Edward Van Sloan as Professor Muller plays the same kind of role in The Mummy as he did as Van Helsing in Dracula.The remakes of The Mummy used a lot of gimmicky special effects to achieve what Boris Karloff did with sheer talent. Personally I still think this version has the power to frighten and entertain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pay attention, and see how a horror film is really done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It saddens me to read reviews of The Mummy that accuse it of being boring and slow. I can only attribute these to MTV-era viewers with very short ADHD-like attention spans. Now class, if you can only sit down quietly, watch carefully and pay attention ...You'll find an exquisitely-told tale, dripping with languorous atmosphere and Gothic chill, that unfolds in its own good time. No blood, gore, dismemberment or grotesque violence, no overbearing rock-n-roll soundtrack, but nonetheless a horror gem complete with the living dead, human sacrifice, psychic slavery, ancient powerful magic, and more. In fact, some of the most chilling scenes in the film are silent -- not even music. It's about storytelling, boys and girls, not special effects. Study the performance of Boris Karloff, one of the most mesmerizing performers of his (or any) generation -- even under all that dessicating makeup, he can convey more with one single intense glance than most other actors can in an entire scene. Listen to his voice -- sepulchral yet seductive, despite his unsettling physical presence, with enough quiet power to entice a modern-day (well, 1930's-era) woman to the brink of a violent yet willing death. The character has the power to kill from afar by telepathy -- and when you see Karloff's eyes, you easily believe it. This version of The Mummy is THE one. All the others that came after are garish, inferior imitations. Look well, my darlings, and learn why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best film I have ever seen about The Mummy! It might be from 1932 but it is the greatest movie about The Mummy/Imhotep ever made - a true horror film.Boris Karloff is great as usual - he seems to be a natural at playing monsters. The film gets good once Karloff has taken off his traditional mummy wraps and he reveals himself as the terrifying Imhotep.I did enjoy The Mummy (1999) but I wish it did not have the comedy in it (although it was very funny) - the only thing that ruined an otherwise good film. My point being: If you want to watch a pure horror film on The Mummy then you will need to turn to The Mummy (1932) starring none other than our very on Boris Karloff as The Mummy/Imhotep.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Egyptian expedition uncovers the mummy of Imhotep (Boris Karloff) and inadvertently brings him back to life after thousands of years. A decade later, now going by the name Ardeth Bey, the mummy seeks the reincarnation of his lost love (Zita Johann). This is one of the great horror classics from the Golden Age of Hollywood. The Mummy is very different from the cliché image people have of it today. The bandage-wrapped mummy slowly shuffling through the dark towards his victim would come largely from the later Universal series. There is one short but unforgettable scene at the beginning of this film that features the iconic mummy. The image of the mummy gradually opening his eyes is a classic. This scene is the highlight of the film for many, showcasing makeup artist Jack Pierce's genius. The makeup holds up even by today's standards and outshines anything we have been able to do with computer imagery.The script is heavily influenced by Dracula, which was released the previous year. The screenwriter, John L. Balderston, had written the stage play that Universal's Dracula film was based upon. It also has the cinematographer of Dracula, Karl Freund, as the director. It even features a couple of notable cast members from Dracula: Edward Van Sloan and David Manners. I actually find it to be a superior film to Dracula in many ways. Freund's direction is better than Tod Browning's for starters. The stagey elements are gone. The story is very good. Unlike many future Mummy movies, both at Universal and later Hammer, the focus is not on a "monster" that kills people. Instead the focus is on slowly building a sinister mood. It's an atmospheric picture, as all the truly great horror films are. The Egyptian visuals and mythology add something extra to the ambiance of the film. It must have been especially intriguing to audiences in 1932.Boris Karloff, with his trademark voice and manner, gives a subtle, ominous performance as Imhotep/Ardeth Bey. It's a legendary performance by one of the icons of horror. The scenes of Imhotep's evil eyes glowing in closeups or the eerie scene where he chants over a scroll by candlelight are the stuff of legend. Zita Johann does quite well, as do the aforementioned Van Sloan and Manners. Plus Arthur Byron and a memorable turn by Bramwell Fletcher as the man who actually revives the mummy ("He went for a little walk!").I love this movie. I love Universal horror films in general but this is one of the jewels in the crown. The acting, directing, writing, and makeup are all excellent for the period. I would encourage everybody to try these classic films out. I realize not everyone can enjoy older films and I think that's a shame. But please if you are able to see past the age of this film and lose yourself in it, I think you will enjoy it very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More slowburn drama, but earns an honorable mention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mummy's place with classic monster movies is down several notches from the likes of Dracula, Frankenstein, and The Wolf Man seeing as the film features very little jolts, a surprisingly slow narrative, and some rather hokey acting by everyone involved. But the film deserves praise for Boris Karloff's unsurprisingly strong performance along with the makeup and set design which make the film an immediate, if minor, success.The story concerns Imhotep (Boris Karloff), an ancient Egyptian priest who is revived on an archaeological expedition conducted by Joseph Whemple (Arthur Byron), who discovers Imhotep's mummy. Imhotep attempted to resurrect his lover Princess Ankh-es-en-amon, and was mummified alive as a result. Joseph, much to the dismay of his friend Dr. Muller (Edward Van Sloan), reads an ancient Egyptian script that brings Imhotep back to life, which leads to the mummy roaming the area of Cairo to find his long-lost love.Karl Freund's direction here is extremely meticulous - a trait many of these older monster films possessed. Freund's direction is very focused on providing efficient light and specific character placement, which at least shows a distinct level of alertness on part of the filmmaker.If only director Freund and writer John L. Balderston had realized The Mummy was also a monster film instead of solely a slowburn drama. This is the kind of thriller that remembers it is part of the horror genre almost fifteen minutes before it's over, leading to an identifiable panic to try and include some scares before the entire opportunity is missed. Because of this, The Mummy is redundant and not very frightening or even remotely eerie.As a drama and a parable about revisiting and tampering with history, I'll say The Mummy succeeds on that level. Universal monster movies seemed to always include some sort of realization or moral and this one in particular kind of keeps the film together and makes its existence as a drama more justifiable. However, marketed and released like a monster film, this poises an odd issue. When we have a film with its title character occupying roughly two minutes in the film, than this is a problem.However, when we do see the mummy, the film becomes a bit more satisfying. Karloff's makeup job is extraordinary, and his acting, throughout the whole film, is the glue of the film. I don't critique acting much because I feel a good story is made by much more than such a thing, and to waste time by saying "this guy was good, this guy was bad" makes for a lame, overly-subjective, general review. But Karloff works in the regard that he is a natural screen presence. His modesty (such as saying that anyone could've done his job in Frankenstein) only makes him shine more.The Mummy is an interesting piece of history, well-directed, mostly well-acted, but falls short of monster movie standards due to its lame expository and reliance on drama rather than on tone and exemplified eeriness.Starring: Boris Karloff, Arthur Byron, and Edward Van Sloan. Directed by: Karl Freund.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror masterpiece which transcends time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the success of "Dracula" and "Frankenstein", Universal produced one of the most elaborate horror films ever made, and cemented their place in history as the masters of the genre. A departure from the usual literary source material, "The Mummy" offers a unique characterization by Boris Karloff which rivals his performance in Frankenstein. The revived mummy Imhotep, is one of the most frightening creatures created by Universal's make-up wizard Jack Pierce. The opening scenes, in which an over-zealous archaeologist accidentally brings the mummy to life by reading a powerful incantation, are a cinematic masterpiece of understated horror. After spending a lot of time on Karloff's make-up, terrific restraint is used not to show too much. There is no need to see the mummy walking, as Bramwell Fletcher's reaction to seeing the horror is enough for the audience. The feeling you get is that time is meaningless in death. You can imagine Imhotep closing his eyes for the last time in ancient Egypt, then reopening them in what must have felt like a wink to him, and yet it is 3,700 years later! The film flashes forward ten years as Imhotep assumes the identity of Ardeth Bey, still searching for his lost love, princess Ankesenamon. Karloff's intense performance is wisely underplayed, creating an air of menace and uneasiness even when he's not on screen. The pure evil he is able to project with a simple stare is astounding. The exotic Zita Johann fills the role of Helen Grosvenor, the reincarnation of the princess, and the talented actress gives passion and credibility to a role that could have been reduced to a stock heroine in less capable hands. Edward Van Sloan lends his talents once again playing the monster's adversary, Dr. Muller. David Manners supplies the leading man more effectively than in Dracula. Making his directorial debut is Karl Freund, whose cinematography truly captures an otherworldly feeling of dread throughout the film. A fantastic script, great actors, and fine direction all come together to make "The Mummy" a horror masterpiece which transcends time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film suitable for pre-teen children.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film features the story of a man (Imhotep, high priest) who loved a woman beyond his social station. Imhotep was punished for this crime by a suffering a living death. A few millenia as an undead corpse have made Imhotep a psychopathic killer, willing to do away with anyone who obstructs his obsession with reviving the lost woman as an undead creature like himself.An unwitting young archeologist without respect for the culture he studies animates Imhotep by reading the Scroll of Thoth and thus starting the action with his own mental collapse. (He was warned by a more mature academic, but hubris proceeds the fall.)Unlike more recent psychopathic killers, Imhotep exhibits cunning, intelligence, and restraint. He restrains his murderous impulses whenever such restraint advances his own plans. He even uses non-violent means to have his deceased lover exhumed by an archeological team. In this same scene, he employs an ironic comment regarding the special privileges of foreign archeologists. Without glitz and special effects, the plot progresses when moved by the passions of each character. Even the old professor attempts to destroy the Mummy's scroll for love of his son. Acting generates essentially all the action. No doubt there was no budget to blow up vehicles and structures. Dialogue explains the action, atmosphere creates the mood, and lighting and a few props stand in for the foreign locale.Several people are murdered, albeit with limited or no graphic content. The story does incorporate social discrimination between classes and between Europeans and Egyptians, but only as a fact and without celebration. Actually, the film's limited commentary tends to discredit arbitrary prejudices based on class and nationality. Imhotep himself seemingly condemns the double standard applied foreigners and native Egyptians by insinuation.The Mummy does not offer color, computer graphic special effects, or a catchy score. However it also lacks political bias, revisionist history, profanity, sexual innuendo, or deliberate overt commercial, ethnic, racial, social, political, academic or scientific distortion or bias. Psychosexual pathology is also not glorified as in certain more recent horror films. Although the film does rely on the magic power of an ancient religion, neither the ancient religion, nor any modern religion is "attacked" by any type of lopsided, unwarranted aspersion.The villain is portrayed sympathetically, but without exoneration or sympathy for his crimes. The heros do not prevail, but actually see the ancient God intervene. No lawyer sues the heros for desicating a Mummy without a license. This entertaining film was created for people who were themselves destitute and desperate during the Depression. It is still an entertaining film for families. My own children love the film, and have seen it 5 or 6 times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris 'Imhotep' Karloff - The One and Only True Mummy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Egyptian Mummies doubtlessly range among the most fascinating Horror creatures, and yet their overall representation in cinema seems a bit weak, compared to that of other ghoulish fiends. This is not due to the lack of mummy films, but to due to the small number of truly imaginative ones. Of all mummy films I've seen, there is only one that is truly fantastic - "The Mummy" of 1932. And what a masterpiece it is! Karl Feund's brilliant milestone is not merely the greatest Mummy picture of all-time, and one of the greatest of the Universal Horror classics; it is doubtlessly one of the greatest Horror films ever made. Horror-deity Boris Karloff gives one of the most astonishing performances of his outstanding career, in one of the Horror genre's most immortal roles - Imhotep. As Karloff's most famous role, Frankenstein's Monster, Imhotep is a tragic character, though incomparably more evil than the predominantly woeful Monster. Though an incredibly haunting fiend, Imhotep is driven by immortal love to a woman. In 1922 an archaeologist awakens the mummy of the Egyptian priest Imhotep by reading out a spell on an ancient scroll. The mummy disappears, but returns ten years later, disguised as Ardath Bey in search of his love - an immortal love which lasted thousands of years. Imhotep was mummified alive for committing the sacrilege of trying to awake his beloved, a priestess of Isis and daughter of the Pharaoh, from the dead. In the 20th century, beautiful young Helen (Zita Johann) is the spitting image of the Egyptian priestess...Imhotep is doubtlessly one of the most haunting and memorable villains the Horror genre has ever seen, and Karloff, doubtlessly one of the greatest actors who ever lived, is brilliant in the role. No one could possibly doubt that Karloff was one of the greatest icons ever in cinema, and this role is arguably his greatest besides that of Frankenstein's Monnster in James Whale's "Frankenstein" (1932) and the even greater sequel "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935). Karloff looks incredibly creepy, both as the mummy in the beginning and as Imhotep. The sequence when the mummified Imhotep opens his eyes in the beginning alone is incredibly haunting and unforgettable. Beautiful Zita Johnson is also great in her (double) role. Actually, the whole cast is very good, it most memorably includes Edward van Sloan, the legendary classic Horror actor who also played Van Helsing in Tod Browning's "Dracula" (1931). Director Karl Freund was mainly active as a fantastic cinematographer. However, the two Horror films he directed, "Mad Love" of 1935 and this masterpiece (to be precise, he also served as an uncredited co-director of Browning's "Dracula"), both rank among the greatest classics of the genre. "The Mummy" is brilliantly photographed, and the makeup department did the job of a century - Karloff just looks uniquely creepy. "The Mummy" spawned many sequels and rip-offs none of which got anywhere near the brilliance of the original. In 1959, the British Hammer Studios made a remake starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, which is easily the second-best Mummy film I've ever seen. The crappy new Mummy films with should be avoided at all costs. Incredibly haunting, creepy and beautiful Karl Freund's 1932 classic is, and always will be, the one and only true Mummy-masterpiece that buries all the rest. "The Mummy" is one of the greatest Horror films ever made, and no cinema lover could possibly consider missing it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remarkably Affective Atmospheric Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1922 most of the events of the day were fairly dull. Example: Lloyd George lost his majority in Parliament and was replaced as Prime Minister by Andrew Bonar-Law. Only one event of that year has remained in our collective memories. The year 1922 was the year Howard Carter found the tomb of the Pharoah Tutankhamon in the Valley of the Kings at Luxor in Egypt. The only perfectly preserved treasure of an Egyptian ruler was uncovered, and it's artistic glories stunned a fascinated world. And soon the brilliance of the discovery was complicated by a series of random, sudden, and frequently violent deaths supposedly connected to Carter's expedition. Among those who died was the Earl of Carnaevon who financed the expedition. Supposedly he died a few days after visiting the opened tomb. So did the American millionaire George Gould, and a long list of others, frequently by suicide, one (Prince Fahmy Bay) by being shot by his wife at the Savoy Hotel in London in 1923. Supposedly the Egyptians who buried King Tut had put a written curse on the doorway. It was similar, ironically, to the one near Shakespeare's grave cursing he who moved the Bard's bones. Few noticed that the person who should have died from such a curse, Howard Carter, lived to spend the rest of his life cataloging, studying and writing about his finds and dying, finally, in 1939 (peacefully in bed)! Finding a treasure of any sort is always fascinating. Finding one that causes disaster in it's wake is even more so. The Tut - curse story has never been dropped, despite every attempt to do so. It was used in many films about Egyptology that cropped up. It was also borrowed in non-Egyptian expedition films. Witness THE GREEN RAY, where a curse seems to be killing off members of an African expedition financed by a wealthy English nobleman seeking a treasure (a rare element from a meteorite) buried in Africa centuries ago (sound familiar?).The 1932 film THE MUMMY properly kept the "curse" urban legend in it's proper section of Africa - Egypt. An expedition in 1923 led by Arthur Byron and Edward Van Sloan finds an unmarked grave. Van Sloan cautions his friend Byron not to violate the sanctity of the grave, and Byron hedges. He has opened it, and revealed a mummy (which the viewers of course recognize as the star, Mr. Boris Karloff), but he has not decided if he wishes to examine the precious papyrus document that is in a jeweled case beneath the mummy's case. He leaves, and only his jocular young assistant (Bramwell Fletcher) is alone with the case and the mummy. Fletcher decides to read the manuscript. He is so intent he does not see the eyes of the dead creature reopen, and him start moving, until the Mummy is just over Fletcher and snatches the manuscript. When Byron returns he finds the mummy gone, the manuscript gone, and Fletcher in hysterical laughter (we later learn he laughed himself to death).It is now a decade later and we are now in Cairo. An Egyptian approaches Byron at the Cairo Museum about some antiquities concerning the grave of a daughter of a Pharoah and it leads to a new expedition and opening of the grave. The Egyptian, named I'm-ho-tep, is the missing Mummy (Karloff) and he is involved in planning to resurrect the princess, his lost beloved. He takes over the soul of one of the museum guards (Noble Johnson), and starts planning to use a manuscript at the Museum discovered with the Princess's grave.He discovers that a young woman named Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann) is visiting Byron. She is attracted to one of Byron's son, David Manners, but she is the spitting image of his lost love Princess Ankesen - Amon. He schemes to bring her to the alter in the Museum so that he can reunite with his lost love.With it's use of the curse, two more deaths at the museum, and the idea of long lost ancient knowledge from the Egyptians the film manages to carry the audience very well. The photography, in particular the rapid sequence of scenes detailing I'm-ho-tep's loss of the Princess, his act of ancient sacrilege, and the hideous punishment he goes through and it's aftermath, it looks almost like what we would imagine Ancient Egypt would have been like. The finale, when the powers of the Mummy wear off is done with a still photo carefully reprinted and carefully cracked slowly to show decay. It was a perfect ending to a wonderfully shot horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less a horror and more a supernatural drama about love throughout the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the huge success of 'Frankenstein' and 'Dracula' the previous year, Universal Studios expanded their repertoire of movie monsters by capitalizing on the aura of Egyptian mystery still fresh in the popular consciousness from the discovery of Tutankhamen (along with all the attendant curses) only ten years before. What's more, fresh from his iconic role as the Monster in 'Frankenstein' Boris Karloff is perfectly cast as the resurrected mummy of the title, Imhotep, who (like the Monster) looms large and stares menacingly as the ostensible villain but also conveys an essential humanity which, by the end, invokes more sympathy than fear and strikes a surprisingly poignant note by the time the credits roll.The story begins in 1921 when an ancient scroll, "The Scroll of Thoth", is unearthed and read by an over-enthusiastic archaeologist which inadvertently resurrects the mummy Imhotep who promptly disappears, sending the archaeologist mad. He reappears a decade later going under the name Ardath Bay, a looming, enigmatic figure who walks among the living and aides in another archaeological so that he may pursue the reincarnated soul of the woman he loved over 3000 years before and employing magic to destroy anyone who hinders his obsessive aim.As is common with films from this era, the film is slow-paced and is low on explicit scares by modern standards, but first-time director Karl Freund (previously a cinematographer on a number of German Expressionist films such as Fritz Lang's 1927 classic 'Metropolis' as well as Universal's own 'Dracula') effortlessly crafts a suspenseful atmosphere which remains gripping throughout as Imhotep's motivations and fatal flaws are revealed. The cast are uniformly excellent: obviously Karloff (with the help of a make-up job from Jack Pierce, who also transformed Karloff into Frankenstein's Monster) owns the feature despite relatively little screen-time but the rest of the cast flesh out the drama brilliantly.All in all, 'The Mummy' is a remarkable film which will probably confound many expectations of what it will be like from the slew of pop-culture references most people will have accumulated regarding the theme. I know I was. However, even though it may be a different film to what most would expect, there is no denying the great movie that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Creaky Spookiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the established classics, "The Mummy" tends to be overlooked. Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolfman get mentioned all the time but the Mummy? His Egyptian setting causes him to stick out among the classic European horrors. This is odd because "The Mummy" is very much a Gothic story, one that wouldn't have been out of place during the genre's literary heyday.There's a world of difference between '31 and '32. A good third of "The Mummy" is scored, with trembling but effective pieces of music. Karl Freund, the man responsible for the look of "Dracula" and "Frankenstein," directs with a creative, steady hand. The early scenes of Imhotep in his tomb never reveal too much. The camera roams the museum, eying the artifacts in one scene while slowly revealing a praying Ardith Bay in another. My favorite shot involves a cutaway from Ankh-es-en-Amon's death-mask to the face of Zita Johann, her modern descendant. It's a beautifully shot film. The desert dunes and dusty streets of Cairo don't afford much opportunity for foggy atmosphere. The film makes up with its mythic, mystical tone. Similarly, the set design is more subtle then "Frankenstein" or "Dracula," but its attention to detail lends some verisimilitude to the proceedings.Really, it's all about Karloff. Imhotep is one of the more intriguing figures in the Universal canon. He's undeniably sinister. He makes no attempt to hide his hideous nature and openly threatens the cast. His imposing stature and cruelly deployed powers make it clear he can back up any claims up. However, Imhotep is also a romantic figure. His actions, no matter how monstrous, are motivated by love. His desires are obsessive, dangerous, but all too human. This dynamic is best displayed in the scene when Helen and Ardith Bay first meet. He towers over her, standing uncomfortably close, his hypnotic eyes staring down. She's seems similarly frightened and enchanted. The love between them is real and, at least a part of her, shares Bay's obsession. Helen is given a human love interest in Frank Whemple but their love-at-first-sight relationship is unconvincing compared to Imhotep's century-spanning passion. Karloff's performance is fantastic, proving he had range beyond "Frankenstein," while Zita Johann's intriguing good looks, her round face and big eyes, perfectly embodied the time swept princess.Ancient Egyptian magic is completely alive in this setting, a surprising move. A modern Nubian immediately submits to Imhotep's slavery. The mummy's powers are unstoppable, with a charm of Isis being the only protection. In the film's primarily narrative gaff, a climatic call for help from the gods proves successful. There's a creaky spookiness to the film, especially its sacrificial ending. The film is well edited, avoids most pacing issues, the performances are assured, the direction solid, and the story rife with complex themes. The modest goals are wildly exceeded. In some ways, it's a better film then "Dracula," which it's frequently compared too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, I'm kinda baffled about horror movies from the 1930s. And, yes, I'm fully-aware that the "Hayes Code" was very much in effect at the time (which restricted plenty) - But, all the same, I found that (when compared to the homicidal gangster films from that particular era) the violence and element of terror in this genre of film was surprisingly toned down and ridiculously tame.And, yes, of course, this was the case here with 1932's "The Mummy". There was really no violence, at all, to speak of. I mean, I certainly wasn't expecting any over-the-top gore, but, hey, a bit of honest-to-goodness Mummy-type violence would've surely been a real asset to this fright flick's overall horror-factor.Anyway - Strictly from a nostalgic point of view - (As far as "The Mummy" being something of a curiosity piece) - This 83-year-old relic was most certainly worth a view. But, with that said, when a 73-minute horror movie actually drags its sorry ass in between the action (and requires a romance thrown into the mix, for good measure), then, it's definitely a picture meant only to fully-satisfy an audience of die-hard film buffs of vintage movie-making, and not much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>real love is forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>07/27/10Thank you to all the people who made "the Mummy," as I started me in my love for Egyptology;a love which has lasted for over 50 years.I saw this film when I was about five years old and felt so sorry for Imhotep; to suffer an eternal torture for the woman he loved. He dared to commit sacrilege to restore her brief life, even though he knew that by religious custom he could never really possess her as a wife.Then when discovered, Imhotep suffers a cursed nameless death where he is eternally damned in the nether world, not to die in peace but to be held in a sort of limbo for the damned. His world being the confines of his sarcophagus!1923 his tomb is opened and the Thoth scroll is read by a bored greedy PhD candidate . This of course reanimates Imhotep who takes the precious scroll to resume his restoration of his lost love some 3700 years ago. Check out the glint in his eye and how his bandaged hand drops!I do not see how this film can be compared to "Dracula" in plot or in any other way to "Frankenstein". Just take the story for what it is. It does not hit one over the head with special effects, but relies on mood, and subtlety, darkness and light.The ancient gods never really died in Egypt (KMT), and Imhotep's misplaced love was eternal.His character is quite tragic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Karloff...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Far and away the best mummy movie is this one. That the "curse" around which this movie revolves is genuine is just one of its many noteworthy aspects. Another is the way Imhotep promptly doffs his burial bindings and assumes a (more or less) human aspect. (Nor can one fault him: the scene where he is bound from head to toe has to be one of the most horrific scenes in the annals of horror; his head is wrapped last, allowing him to "see it coming," as it were- but knowing, all the while, that there's absolutely nothing he can do about it.) Karloff in his human guise is as brilliant a performer as ever: he moves with the deliberate slowness of a man 4,000 years old, unhurried and patient, but nonetheless very, very dangerous. Edward van Sloane, the bane of all monsters Universal, is on hand to give THE MUMMY a run for his money and, under director Freund's artistic aegis, he, too, shines. All around, an often overlooked masterpiece that deserves better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was just a fuzzlet when my mum rented this one rainy Saturday. She told me it was the best monster movie she had ever seen as a child. She had seen it in a real old-time theater built in the 20's in California, and described sitting there in dusty splendor as the audience cowered in fear. Seeing it myself, I too, trembled at the might of Imhotep. The image of those bandages slowly trailing out the door, with the empty laughter of a crazed idiot, it haunted me for many years. This is, without a doubt, one of the very best horror/romances ever filmed, right next to Eyes without a Face, or Detour. I have recommended this jewel to all my friends and workmates,and we all agree...Karloff Lives!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't give the plot away but if you are reading this then you are probably aware of it anyway. The first scene of this film is worth buying the DVD for; Karloff as Imhotep bound as the mummy gradually becoming aware and starting to move is the rarest of things, a really creepy moment in a horror film - Compare this with the crash bang wallop of the Brendon Frazer version and you will see which of them is a real horror film. Less is more.Admittedly the Karloff version does go downhill a bit after the first scene but it is always interesting and Karloff is always good even if the plot looks like there are some scenes missing. Watch it late at night, on your own or in a small group - be the man opening the box after being warned of the consequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff's Mummy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greedy archaeologists in Egypt unearth both a mummified corpse and an ancient scroll which foretells disaster; soon, the mummy has come back to life and wreaks havoc. Deliberately-paced mood piece from Universal hopes to attain the dreamy, surreal qualities attributed to "Dracula" and "Frankenstein", but the script doesn't have much weight to it. The narrative is thin and the pacing is drowsy for a thriller, though Boris Karloff's presence as the monster certainly gives the picture a boost. Directing debut for Karl Freund who, the year before, was the cinematographer on "Dracula"; he knows a great deal about atmosphere, but a livelier touch within the scenario--an offer of suspense for the audience--might have been even more successful. Followed by a slew of unofficial sequels; remade in 1959 and 1999. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boris Karloff stars in the title role of this well regarded Universal horror favourite. He plays Imhotep, who is resurrected in modern day Egypt and who goes about seeking the reincarnation of his long ago love. That woman is Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann), a half- English / half-Egyptian woman who is also romantically pursued by Frank Whemple (David Manners), son of archaeologist Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Byron).Stylishly directed by cameraman Karl Freund, "The Mummy" is a master work in under statement. You won't see a bandage clad Karloff slooowly shamble after his intended victims, a cliché originated in subsequent mummy movies. The film is mostly noteworthy for the actors' subtle, chilling villainy, and his excellent makeup by the talented Jack P. Pierce (who goes uncredited). Johanns' exotic beauty is utilized well, and overall the cast is very fine indeed. It's always a treat to see Edward Van Sloan in these Universal horrors; here he plays Sir Josephs' associate Dr. Muller. Young Bramwell Fletcher has the memorable role, and performance, as the foolish, headstrong man who puts into motion the means of resurrecting Imhotep; he also has the films' most memorable line of dialogue. Noble Johnson, as a servant referred to only as The Nubian, has a powerful screen presence.Solid atmosphere is a heavy asset, as well as some believable sets created by Willy Pogany. And Imhotep is one of those villains whom you can't entirely hate, because everything he's doing, he's doing in the name of love.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

It's not as fast-paced as Dracula and Frankenstein, but the movie does get to the point of the missing mummy and the curse he has placed on several people. Boris Karloff gave a creepy and foreboding portrayal of the creature - his magical powers and his freaky eyes were enough to creep anybody out.Zita Johann played the female lead and the Mummy's lover Helen Grosvenor very nicely. David Manners gave a little awkward and emotionless performance Frank Whemple, as I thought he tried to force himself to do be more romantic or dramatic in scenes where appropriate.There is little overall character development and the film would wouldn't be too scary by today's standards; however, it's still a classic horror movie of its own.Grade B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Mummy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very GOOD horror movie. Not great-but quite good! The main reason why it isn't as well known as some of the other Universal horror classics is that it really isn't as good and the plot isn't necessarily as memorable. It is no "Frankenstein" or "Dracula", but it certainly has its share of greatness.The creepy atmosphere due to lack of music in some scenes really enhances the frightening quality of the film. Plus, Boris Karloff is great as always! This is also the first movie where he actually got to talk, rather than just make noises and grunt the whole movie like he did in the "Frankenstein" movies and "The Old Dark House", and he does genuinely well in a talking role.The film also is just full of great images. Karloff's growing eyes, the opening scene in which we first see the mummy come to life, and even watching Karloff's character getting wrapped wrapped in bandages alive! That is pretty hardcore for the 30's! Although this was the pre code era, before the censors felt like cutting up and destroying movies because certain content might've been a bit extreme for the time.Although there's a lot of dialogue and the movie isn't as memorable as other horror films from the 30's, it is still a must see for fans of classic horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ONCE AGAIN, WE find ourselves flabbergasted! How can we have been a member-at-large of the IMDb.com Legion of Reviewers for so many years (dating back from 2015 to 2001), without having written a review for THE MUMMY (Universal, 1932)! IN OUR OWN case, we're old enough to remember having seen the film on our own local ABC affiliate, Channel 7, WBKB TV (now WLS). The late night show titled "SHOCK THEATRE" was shown on Saturday evenings, starting at 11:00 PM, as we recall. This thriller was released by Universal Pictures to television as part of their "SHOCK THEATRE" Package. (Now Schultz, do you see where Channel 7 got the name?) BEING THAT THIS was in the Year of Our Lord 1957, the roster of titles were about only a mere 25 years or less in age. Among the titles now available for our viewing pleasure were: FRANKENSTEIN, Dracula, THE WEREWOLF OF London, BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, THE BLACK CAT, THE RAVEN, SON OF FRANKENSTEIN and today's front &amp; center subject, THE MUMMY.WITH OUT ANY doubt, the story owes its origin to the World famous discoveries of King TUTANKHAMUN (ruled circa 1332-1323 B.C.) in Ancient Egypt. The discovery, like so many other great incidents, spawned many theories and false rumors. In this case, there persists stories about "The Curse of King Tut's Tomb." AS TO THE particulars of the film, it has many elements in common with the vampire stories, such as NOSFERATU and Dracula. Much like the great horror movies of that era it is the elements of understatement, subtlety and the implied that combine to give the viewer scares that we all craved. Excessive blood &amp; gore, gratuitous killings and sexual titillation.HORROR WAS RENDERED then in a manner somewhat similar to how drama and comedy was presented in Radio, Subtlety was employed in what has often been called, "the Theatre of Imagination"; which, of course, is far superior to all of the special FX, computer generated images and rotoscoping that Hollywood can conjure up.THE PLOT REVOLVES around the Mummy Imhotep (Boris Karloff) being revived quite accidentally by the one archeologist's reading the sacred incantation aloud. We are shown only a snippet of movement by the reviving sarcophagus denizen. His fingers move slightly and his eyes begin to open. The mummy then walks off into the Egyptian night, with only the dragging strips of gauze being visible.THE TAUT DIRECTION by Karl Freund keeps the scenario in balance between action and chilling use of Karloff's maniacal threats. Accompanying all of this is a somewhat underplayed facial makeup of the revived mummy. It quietly screams that the character is extremely dehydrated, desiccated and otherwise moisture free.AND PLEASE DO not confuse this original mummy picture with all of those series mummy movies that starred Tom Tyler, Ln Chaney, Jr., George Zucco an Turhan Bey. They my well all be fun, but they are really "B" Movie Schlock.AND THSERE'S NOT a trace of neither 'Kharis' nor 'Tanna Leaves' in this one. It is indeed an original, one of a kind and one of Universal's best fright-fests.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most unsung of all 1930s Universal horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you come into The Mummy (1932) expecting either a cheesy horror flick about a slow-moving, bandaged killer or an Indiana Jones-esque adventure, then you'll be sorely disappointed. If you come in without an appreciation for atmosphere and subtle storytelling, then yes, you will not get why this is such a highly regarded film.The Mummy stands apart from most of the other Universal horrors with its slow, dreamlike quality. Some complain that nothing happens in this film, but that is only because they are looking at the surface. Really, what's happening inside of the characters' heads is more fascinating than any generic horror movie killing spree could be. The reincarnation love story is interesting and the conflict between the ancient and modern world within the heroine Helen makes for good drama.Karloff's performance as the menacing but sympathetic Imhotep is one of his finest characterizations. Though the character and the movie overall are often compared to Dracula (1931), I think Imhotep has more in common with the 1925 Phantom of the Opera in that he is a grotesque figure out to claim the romantic love of a woman he feels he deserves.I believe Zita Johann as Imhotep's beloved Helen deserves special mention too, for unlike most Universal damsels, she gets a role with depth and plays it off beautifully. Unlike say, Mary Philbin's Christine in POTO, Helen is conflicted as to her feelings for Imhotep, whose presence awakens a love from another lifetime within her. And yet, she also loves her life in the modern world and struggles as to whether or not to give it up to resume a relationship cut short centuries ago. Johann underplays it, coming off as more soulful than your garden variety horror movie heroine.Paired with a fine story and fantastic direction from the great Karl Freund, classic horror fans should not go through life without at least two viewings of this wonderful movie. It takes multiple viewings to really grasp the genius at hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ancient Egyptian mummy of priest Imhotep, killed for trying to revive his dead lover, is brought back to life in modern (1920s) times. Years later, masquerading as a common Egyptian, he finds the reincarnation of his old love and is determined to make her his again...One of many Universal monster films from classic Hollywood, 'The Mummy' is surprisingly ahead of its time. Unlike 'Dracula' or 'Frankenstein', which while equally great depended too much on theatricality (which hasn't aged so well), 'The Mummy' actually bets on a intense, eerie atmosphere greatly accentuated by an excellent cinematography (the director Karl Freund was, after all, cinematographer in 'Dracula' and 'Metropolis' among others) and soundtrack.The plot's darker aspects are played with very well, like Imhotep's rituals, and his tragic story makes him a somewhat sympathetic villain. Boris Karloff plays the role marvelously, managing to be creepy yet sympathetic and never overdoes his performance. There is genuine tension, good development of the characters, and the plot flows nicely.'The Mummy' manages to be one of the few old horrors to still work today in that genre; in truth, it still puts a lot of modern horrors to shame. The eerie atmosphere and suspense, coupled with great directing, great acting and one of Karloff's best performances, makes this one great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Karl Freund directed Boris Karloff as the title character, who goes by the name Imhotep, an ancient Egyptian who was buried alive as a mummy for profaning the tomb of his beloved princess. Centuries later, a field expedition in Egypt uncovers his tomb and the Scroll of Thoth, which is later read aloud by a foolish young man(played by Bramwell Fletcher, quite memorable for his insane laugh) who was driven insane when the mummy comes back to live, taking the scroll with him. A decade later, another expedition led by Frank Whemple(played by David Manners) gets the attention of Imhotep, now unwrapped and looking for the reincarnation of his long lost love, whom he believes to be Helen Grovsenor(played by Zita Johan) placing her life in grave danger... Edward Van Sloan costars as Dr. Muller, expert on such matters. Though slow by today's standards, Karloff is excellent and eerie, especially the chilling close-up of his dead eyes. Direction is superb, and quite atmospheric, making this a most effective thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic...a bit slow, but definitely worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose that modern audiences might find this film a tad bit slow, but taken in the context of 1932, it's a true gem, and one of a handful of early horror films that influenced the horror-film genre for decades to come.As opposed to some of Karloff's Frankenstein films, here we at least get to see Karloff as a man, as well as a monster. He plays not only the mummy, but also the human-like Imhotep revived, who interacts with the various British Egyptologists as a man. When I was around 12 years of age, my grandmother (with whom I lived) went off one dark and stormy night (yes, really) to babysit, and I stayed home and watched this film on television. It was the only time that a horror film every truly scared me.I am adding a paragraph here from my original review to comment on the recent Blu Ray edition. Is it worth the upgrade? Yes, I think it is. It's an excellent print. There is some footage taken in Egypt -- probably old documentary stuff -- that is not so clear, but all the footage of the film itself is in remarkably good condition considering it dates to 1932. The story involves the son of an ancient Egyptian king named Imhotep (Karloff), who is resurrected during an archaeological expedition led by a Brit -- actor Arthur Byron. Naturally, there's a curse on opening things found in the mummy's tomb, but one of the expedition's assistants gives into temptation and is immediately driven mad. Once "alive" again (after having been mummified while alive as punishment), Imhotep escapes after taking the Scroll of Thoth, with the intent of reincarnating his ancient lover. A decade later, the "human" Imhotep assists another expedition in finding his lover's tomb, but Imhotep becomes enthralled with the half white/half-Egyptian wife of a Western official, who strongly resembles his old lover. She, indeed, is drawn to him. He decides to kill her and then bring his old lover back to life through the woman's corpse. Of course, he is thwarted, but not before unleashing a reign of terror.Karloff is good here...in an early-1930s sort of way. The rest of the actors "do their jobs", but certainly don't stand out. The one exception I would make was Arthur Byron, who was quite good as the older Egyptologist. The sets are believable. I have 3 criticisms. The lead actress -- Zita Johann -- is...well...very early 1930ish. She was active only for about 3 years...and I think it's obvious why. Oh, she doesn't ruin the film. I just don't think she's very interesting. The special effects at the very end are disappointing. In fact, my third criticism is the climax, which is a bit of a let down. Nevertheless, I recommend this film. Having not seen it in years, I had forgotten how good it was. It's nice to see such a good print that allows one to really enjoy the film, rather than the old beat-up prints we used to see on late night television back in the 1950s-1960s. Its shortcomings are outpaced by its strong points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great Universal Horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like your horror the old-fashioned way with atmosphere, implication, and imagination versus explicit special effects, this is your kind of movie. Everyone already knows the tale, and everyone has already seen the movie. It is worth repeat viewings though for the visuals alone. It was made in the precode era when horror movies could still have a dash of the shocking. Plus movies were still learning to talk, so much experimentation could go on. The director of "The Mummy", Karl Freund, had worked with Fritz Lang and so hints of German expressionism can be seen in this film as well. The year before, "Frankenstein" had made Boris Karloff a star at age 44. It is here Karloff gets to use the power of speech to add to his presence in horror films, and he does so to great effect.This is one of Zita Johann's rare appearances in an A-List film, and with her exotic looks I can't imagine anybody else in the role of Helen, whose body is shared by the spirit of a dead Egyptian princess. If you've never seen Ms. Johann, the the only person who was a contemporary of hers that I can name with a comparable appearance is Kay Francis. Then There is Edward Van Sloan as Dr. Muller. As in the other Universal horrors in which he appeared, he is the unruffled man of letters who knows exactly how to deal with whatever supernatural force is at hand.This one is almost required viewing every Halloween for the fun of soaking up that Universal Horror atmosphere of the 1930's that has never been repeated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember an argument I once had with a friend over the merits of Samuel Clemens. I was praising the remarkable and original humour in his writing, but my friend remained unswayed. This was old stuff, he said. He'd heard these jokes before, seen the sight gags described in the books, been exposed to the same slow build-up to the same comedic pay-off. But when I asked him where he'd come across this material, it quickly turned out that he'd encountered the style and the content in the humour of comedians working in the 1920s,1930s and 1940s,years after Mark Twain had written his last line. For him, Mark Twain was old news because his style had become the style of his inheritors."The Mummy" is like this. We've seen it before. But of course we have - we've seen it in films from the 1950s and onwards. Yes, it does borrow from Browning's "Dracula", made just a year before, but it also boldly carves out its own space ? it's in "The Mummy", not in "Dracula", that we find human motives for fiendish behaviour. The Mummy does not want to turn humans into the undead ? it's exactly the opposite, in fact. What's more, this film serves as the template for a slew of followers, including the trilogy of Brendan Fraser films that have as their other surrogate parent the Indiana Jones series.But influence is not the only reason to watch this film. There's also Boris Karloff. Zita Johann, the Romanian-born fan of the occult who plays the film's heroine, said when speaking of her co-star that she had never seen such sad eyes. In this role, perhaps beyond all his other work, Karloff embodies sorrow and loss. Of course, the scenes that Zita shares with Boris are, by today's standards, a little hammy. But again, remember that they were here first. It is not surprising that they adhered to acting standards of the day ? what is surprising is all those little moments when they surpass them. Look in particular for Zita's acknowledgement of the dilemma she faces in deciding just who she is.There's something persistently chilling in the atmosphere of this film. It may not make you jump in the modern sense, or have you wincing, but it will get under your skin and, if you are very lucky, into your dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Universal classic is more creepy than scary. There's really little blood or mayhem for a horror film, but there is a lot of atmosphere, plus spooky close-ups of Karloff's craggy mug. Then too, the make-up for Karloff's mummy is the best of any in the series. I guess make-up artist Pierce really worked overtime getting the very best results. Also, the desert location shots are well done, lending real-life flavor to the fantastic tale of ancient Egypt. And catch Bramwell Fletcher's delicious mad scene that really gets the movie off to a fast start for fans of these Universal classics.Now, I've never been able to follow all the reincarnation mumbo-jumbo in these mummy movies, settling instead for the story's general drift. And a good thing the details aren't necessary since it's really the visual effects that carry films like this. For example, I'm not sure the explanation behind that final scene of the stone goddess raising her arm. Nonetheless, it's not only an inspired concept, but an excellent effect as well. And how about the big-eyed Zita Johann. No wonder the mummy dumps his bandages to win her back after a few thousand years. Now if he could just dump that spooky Ardath Bey close-up, he might just succeed.Anyhow, this is the original that triggered the durable series that's still going strong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karl Freund was one of the best things that happened to the American horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Karl Freund was one of the best things that ever happened to the American horror film. His experience in the German cinema, his talent for atmosphere, are what makes THE MUMMY work. Which is not to say that Jack Pierce's famous makeup, or Boris Karloff's performance don't help THE MUMMY. But on closer examination, the storyline that guides THE MUMMY isn't much more than 1931's Dracula with an Egyptian setting.A team of scientists from the British Museum led by Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Byron) unearth the temple guardian of the Princess Anckesen-Amon in the early 1920s. In doing so, they arouse the vengeful purpose of a priest named I'm Ho Tep (Boris Karloff), who violated the princesses'burial chambers three millenia before and was buried alive with a terrible curse as a result. The scene in which the priest is awakened by a hotshot young archaeologist Ralph Norton (Bramwell Fletcher) with the Scroll of Thoth is one of the most memorable scenes in classic horror cinema, and it is Karl Freund's eye for detail and feeling that made it possible. Karloff's own offering is not without strength, but the timing of the work in that moment is impeccable. And nothing can be taken away from the maniacal laughter of Fletcher when confronted with the resurrection of the ancient corpse.The Mummy takes off, unwraps himself, and resurfaces ten years later with the identity of an Egyptian local called Ardeth Bey. Bey takes another British Museum expedition, this one led by Sir Joseph's son Frank (David Manners) to the burial site of Princess Anckesen-Amon. Bey then takes his revenge on the expedition's family through the magic of the ancient Egyptian Gods, and attempts to reclaim Anckesen-Amon, who has been reincarnated through Helen Grosvener (Zita Johann), a young friend of Egyptologist Dr. Muller (Edward Van Sloan). Dr. Muller figures out who Ardeth Bey is, and confronts him in a scene very similar to the one in which Dr. Van Helsing confronts Dracula in the Todd Browning version of that film. There is a convoluted exchange, in which Sir Joseph is murdered by magic, Helen is seduced by the mysticism of Ardeth Bey, and Frank is nearly killed by the ancient priest. In the end, there is a confrontation in the Cairo Museum of Antiquities, and the Mummy is returned to dust. Ashes to ashes.Keep an eye out for the African American stock actor Noble Johnson, who plays Bey's Nubian servant. It's the standard crap for black actors of the period, but it's ridiculous to expect that Hollywood could be any more enlightened then the rest of the country was on race in those days.All in all, the work is entertaining, and, as the commercial package that comes with the film notes, one of the most unusual Gothic epics of its day. The plot is clunky, but that's not the reason to see this work. Watch for Karl Freund's camera and direction, which, even in a hacked-out Hollywood environment, contains beautiful echoes of German expressionist horrors. Karloff is good, but he's been better in a good many films, both before and after THE MUMMY. This work is remembered because of Karl Freund.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Aliiiiiiive!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost an afterthought among instant classics, Karl Freund's The Mummy has its die-hard fans to equal the respectful critical adulation enjoyed by more highly esteemed companion films Frankenstein and Dracula. With good reason.On paper this hardly stands out: tomb is desecrated, mummy found, ancient scroll read out loud, mummy comes back to life, kills a few people falls in love, and dies trying to do something about that love. The dialogue, among other things, is so clichéd Ed Wood could have made fun of it. Yet as Gloria Swanson so memorably said in Sunset Blvd: in those days "we didn't need words, we had faces". By that logic, all rookie director - yet veteran cinematographer (Metropolis!) - Karl Freund had to do was frame Boris Karloff's face to make an impression. And so he did.What a face! We too easily conjure up Frankenstein's design, but the face under all that groundbreaking makeup was just as iconic, and given freer reign here than at almost any other point in Karloff's career. His Imhotep will petrify you every time he stares into the lens, and Freund wisely holds keeps things professionally conservative through most of the running time, in order for the weird unsettling touches to have even greater impact.Once more, the monster Universal unleash is tragic and sympathetic, but he is not some childlike beast or creature, he is a man like you and me, turned into a monster by madness and pain, every iota of which radiates from Karloff's unnerving gaze. That makes him scarier than any of his more iconic contemporaries ever were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prince Imhotep loves Princess Anck-es-en-Amon from the grave for 3,700 years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For 45 years, I have been watching The Mummy (1932) whenever it came on television. Tonight, I realized that it was essentially a rework of the script for Dracula (1931). Writer John L. Balderston was one of a team of writers who had a hand in scripting both Dracula and The Mummy.Prince Imhotep (Boris Karloff) violates the laws of Ancient Egypt and tries to bring back the dead vestal virgin Princess Anck-es-en-Amon (Zita Johann) when he is discovered by his father the Pharaoh (James Crane) and buried alive in mummy wrappings. Simple story: In 1921, while working for the British Field Museum, Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Byron) discovers the tomb and mummy of Prince Imhotep. With the help of Doctor Muller (Edward Van Sloan) and assistant Ralph Norton (Bramwell Fletcher) they find the golden casket of Imhotep. However, the spell of Isis in upon the cover of the sealed casket. "Who opens this casket will invoke the curse of Amon-Ra and die!" While Sir Joseph (notice how these characters are always "Knighted with title") and Dr. Muller conveniently step outside the tomb to discuss the warning not to open the casket, disobedient assistant Ralph Norton lets his curiosity get the best of him and opens up the casket, and finding a scroll, he reads the words that cause The Mummy to open his eyes and restore to life. One of the best scenes of the movie is the "shock" Ralph Norton experiences when he turns and sees the Mummy reach for the scroll only inches away from the seated Norton. Norton goes hysterically crazy on the spot and breaks out into a maniacal laughter. When Sir Joseph and Dr. Mueller run back into the tomb they find Norton going crazy. After Sir Joseph sees the empty coffin with the missing Mummy, Norton, while going out of his mind, says: "He went for a little walk!" Norton dies 10 years later while in a crazy house and straight-jacket. Eleven years later (1932) another Field Museum Expedition occurs. This time Sir Joseph's son, Frank Whemple, (David Manners) is in charge of the diggings. A mysterious Ardath Bey (Boris Karloff) shows up and gives the clues so that Frank finds the mummy and tomb of the Princess Anck-es-en-Amon. Well, the pretty and exotic Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann) is half-Egyptian and the reincarnation of the Vestal Princess. Ardath Bey is the Mummy now speaking perfect gentlemanly British English when 3,700 years ago English was not even a language. Dress in a frock and Fez he appears on the scene to put his plan in action. This is where I realized that this is Dracula reworked. Balderston was also on the team that wrote Dracula. David Manners played Jonathan Harker and Edward Van Sloan played Professor Van Helsing in Dracula. Sloan's character in both movies is one of a "scientific doctor" who "knows" that Count Dracula is the vampire and that Ardath Bey is the Mummy. In face to face dialogue between Sloan and Karloff, Dr. Mueller acts exactly as he did playing Van Helsing. His looks and mannerisms are almost identical. It is like watching the scene when Bela Lugosi tells Van Helsing, "Your will is strong, Van Helsing!"The rest of The Mummy is obvious. Man cannot kill the Mummy. Helen becomes Princess Anck-es-en-Amon and begins to speak perfect Ancient Egyptian. She invokes the spirit of Anubis, the Guardian of the Dead, who comes to life, and, by the power of the Scroll of Thoth, disposes of Ardath Bey as his decaying flesh crumbles into dust! And, while the eerie violin stings play "Swan Lake", Helen and Frank end the movie, in love.Zita Johann's exotic dark gypsy looks made her perfect to portray the ancient Egyptian Princess. She was born in Austria-Hungary in what is now Romania. She came to the movies from the New York stage. After only making seven films she returned to the stage because she didn't like Hollywood. She died in 1993 at the age of 89 years old. David Manners (real name: Rauff de Ryther Duan Acklon) was a leading Canadian heartthrob from Nova Scotia who make 39 movies from 1930 - 1936. He died in 1998 at the age of 97 years old. San Franciscan-born Edward Van Sloun (real name) died in his hometown in 1964 at the age of 83 years. He was in 84 movies from 1916 - 1966, many uncredited. This is a fine film. Boris Karloff makes a believable Mummy and Ardath Bey. Great makeup work! Watch this film to hear Karloff chant: "Anck-es-en-Amon, Anck-es-en-Amon, Imhotep" to bring the Princess to him like Bela Lugosi summoned the pretty Mina by willing her to "Come Here!" Hear Helen/The Princess use campy lines on Frank: "Do you have to open graves to find girls to fall in love with?...Don't you think I've had enough excitement for one evening, without the additional thrill of a strange man making love to me?" Boris Karloff was born in England and died there at the age of 82 years in 1969. He said: "When I was nine I played the demon king in Cinderella and it launched me on a long and happy life of being a monster." And we loved him ever since."Death... eternal punishment... for... anyone... who... opens... this... casket. In the name... of Amon-Ra... the king of the gods." Good heavens, what a terrible curse! (Sir Joseph) </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today we are weened on the slam-bang pace of MTV and the UPN! Not everything has to be "in yer face"! Such is the case with Universal's classic 1932 THE MUMMY. You can't call it a horror film. It's a supernatural romance, and it moves at an elegant pace. When the tomb of an Egyptian Princess is found, Director Karl Freund's camera goes through the museum housing the pieces like some ghostly tour-guide. The flashback where revived mummy, Imhotep (a topnotch Boris Karloff) reveals his past to the audience and the leading lady, plays like a silent film. It's wonderful! Zita Johann, who looks like a hieroglyphic come to life, is perfectly cast as the reincarnated Egyptian princess. (Wacky bits of trivia- Katherine Hepburn was slated for the role!) The cast is filled out by Universal horror regulars- Edward Von Sloan and David Manners. One of my favorites. It doesn't startle you with BOO!, but just whispers ".....come along.... I'll show you something creepy..... and exotic......"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mummy is a very chilling film. It has a dark, claustrophobic atmosphere and setting: and at its core an unspeakably unpleasant death which from which all these feelings of extreme confinement emanate. The burial alive, and subsequent entombment under the lonely Saharan landscape are echoed in the silences, and dark, cold interiors of this seemingly barely populated world, where a desperate creature seeks a mate to share his eternity of loneliness. Both sinister and pathetic The Mummy continues to resonate with its silences and mumbled curses long after the credits bring the creepy action to an abrupt halt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering the potential for the mummy genre, it is surprising that this 67-year-old film still has no rivals, to my knowledge. It is a deliciously morbid study in frustrated love. Beautiful Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann), a British half-caste wintering in modern Cairo, has two suitors, one of whom is 3700 years old. The elder gentlemen (Karloff), who calls himself Ardath Bey, is none other than Imhotep, a resurrected mummy and powerful black magician. Convinced that Helen is the reincarnation of the princess Ankhsenamon, Imhotep plots to mummify and resurrect Helen, so that they may at last be reunited.German expressionist director Karl Freund gets us to believe in this fantastic premise through tight control of lighting, makeup and editing. We feel trapped in some sort of mausoleum, where anything we do not know about ancient Egyptian magic may be used against us. The accidental resurrection of Imhotep is one of Hollywood's great movie moments. Boris Karloff is a wonderful cross between smitten lover and nasty occult pervert. Zita Johann holds her own against Karloff as a woman with two identities, passing fluently from one to the other throughout the film. Besides drawing on the invincible allure of Egyptian culture, the script sounds mythic notes of true love, death and resurrection, and broken taboos.Unless superseded by a much better film, which is difficult to imagine, "The Mummy" probably will be popular 100 or more years from now, when its age will work in its favor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revisiting the old classic The Mummy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this old classic. I watched this again for the first time since I was a small boy. Back in the days before cable, one of the three networks would air old monster movies on the weekend near midnight. I still remember The Mummy, and curiosity caused me to revisit this title from 1932. I very much enjoyed Boris Karloff's performance on the Mummy. The majority of his performance was as the embodiment of the Mummy's spirit Im-Ho-Tep in contemporary 1932 Egypt. Ho-Tep had been buried alive for 3700 years before being reanimated by a bumbling archaeologist. It was pretty cool to hear Karloff utilize his voice and a leering stare to intimidate those who stood in his way. I enjoyed the image of his staring directly into the cameras lens, and then a shift in lighting to highlight his hypnotic eyes. The special effect work was pretty clever and I thought an extremely well done job was executed in creating The Mummy's aged face. I enjoyed seeing Karloff's wrinkled visage as the Mummy, but was surprised that the Mummy was only on screen for a very short period. Loved it when he open his eye after the archaeologist read the ancient curse. I had assumed that to be the progenitor of such a classic movie villain, the Mummy would have more menace, more of a important part as a fully realized embodiment of evil and thought that the monster would have much more time on screen. The disappointment that the monster wasn't more central to the story doesn't really detract from looking back at an early pioneer in scary movies. By my current disposition, this wasn't really scary or creepy, and didn't really create much of a mood or tension, but watching this old title wasn't a bad experience or wasteful of my time. The Mummy was very similar to the original Dracula's storyline. The DVD's extras revealed that they both shared the same screenwriters. The formula seemed to have more effect in the Gothic vampire tale. The extras also discussed the leading lady and her prominence on Broadway, and fights with the director.I would not recommend that most people would enjoy this. For those with an affinity for early cinema, or those curious about the beginning of an icon like the Mummy, then this will hold an interest. Karloff is an iconic giant in this genre, and this is an interesting opportunity to see him at the height of his abilities as one of films great scary actors. This movie spawned several later versions of what developed into an iconic movie monster. This is what gave life to the monster the Mummy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Atmospheric Tone Poem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the sequels, remakes, rip-offs and re-imaginings, the 1932 version of The Mummy is by far the best of the numerous mummy-themed flicks; relying on mood and atmosphere rather than the stark, visceral bleakness of Frankenstein.Like the monster there is some vast, sad quality in Imhotep, a cursed Egyptian High Priest condemned to death "Not only in this world, but the next." Universal took almost a year to find a proper vehicle for Boris Karloff, who was propelled to world stardom with his portrayal of the Frankenstein Monster. Giving an entertaining turn as the mute, violent butler of The Old Dark House - an ensemble movie relying on a whole bunch of talented actors - was simply a stepping stone to the first true Karloff project.In 1922 a British Museum field expedition has dug up the tomb of Imhotep, and with it, a golden box of potent mystery, carved with warnings and curses that whoever opens it will swiftly find death. Of course a young Archaeologist cannot resist, and opening it finds the scroll of Thoth, said to have raised Osiris from the dead. While he mumbles a translation of the incantations written on the scroll the ancient mummy, visible for much of the scene in the background, begins to stir to life...This opening is one of the great scenes of horror; we never actually see the mummy walk. Director Karl Freund, a burly German who had photographed Metropolis and Dracula, produces a scene wrought with tension and atmosphere. The archaeologist goes mad at the sight of the risen mummy, and Bramwell Fletcher gets the famous line "He went for a little walk - you should have seen his face." The bulk of the movie is set 10 years later, with Imhotep now posing as Ardath Bey, helping a new expedition find the tomb of Ank-es-en-amon, a sacred priestess of Isis. What follows becomes a tragic love story, with the theme of re-incarnation sensitively handled. The film retains its mood and stately pace throughout, and Karloff gives Imhotep a quiet dignity that is unforgettable. The exotic Zita Zohan proves one the best heroines in horror films and horror veterans Edward Van Sloan and David Manners are on hand, playing virtually the same roles they did in Dracula. Indeed, The Mummy can be viewed as disguised re-make of Dracula, as the plot and some situations are quite similar. John L. Balderstone, who worked on the scripts for both movies, was actually present at the opening of Tutankamun's tomb, and we need look no further than this for the story's genesis.Jack Pierce's remarkable Mummy make-up both in bandaged state and that of an aged Mystic is an astonishing achievement. One of the greatest ever put on screen. Karloff's bandaged appearance is surely the most convincing Mummy ever achieved; miles better than a thousand CGI imitators. It's hard to believe there's an actor under all that gauze. But yep, Karloff endured a 24-hour period in the make-up!Future Universal semi-sequels substituted serial-style thrills of a rampaging, bandaged mummy for the atmosphere and mordant tone, but The Mummy is easily the best of them. Slow and stately but never boring; it holds up remarkable well today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know I never understood why when it's Halloween time, mummy's are a part of the decoration, sure it's part of death, but mummy's never really scared me. Now I loved the 1999 remake of The Mummy with Brandon Fraiser, but when this movie came up in the Universal Picture monster movies, I wasn't so sure I was going to enjoy this movie. But Boris Karloff was the star, so I decided to give the movie a fair chance and it did pay off. Boris really made this film into a very creepy story. While the movie doesn't stand out as well as other monster movies, but The Mummy still gives me chills. I'm a wuss, lol, but I love these old black and white movies and if you watch them in the dark, it adds to the creep factor. If you just think about the story and really how horrifying it is, I'm sure you'll have the same effect too.An Ancient Egyptian priest called Imhotep is revived when an archaeological expedition finds Imhotep's mummy and one of the archaeologists accidentally reads an ancient life-giving spell. Imhotep escapes from the archaeologists, taking the Scroll of Thoth, and prowls Cairo seeking the reincarnation of the soul of his ancient lover, Princess Ankh-es-en-amon. Imhotep finds two archaeologists, claims that his name is Ardath Bey, a modern Egyptian, and shows them where to dig to find Ankh-es-en-amon's tomb. The archaeologists find the tomb and give the mummy and the treasures to the Cairo Museum. The archaeologists thank Imhotep for giving them the information of where to find the tomb. Imhotep was once mummified alive for attempting to resurrect her, and, upon finding a woman bearing a striking resemblance to the Princess, attempts to mummify her and make her his bride.I really did enjoy this movie, I think it was the cast that made it work. Zita Johann as Helen was so beautiful and was a perfect choice, she had the beauty, smarts and strength to pull in not just a typical damsel in distress. Her performance at the end when she's praying for her God to give her strength was so powerful and very moving. Boris, what can I say about this guy? He is the man and the ultimate horror actor, everything about him in this movie gave the perfect vibe for chills. His presence on screen is so powerful and magnetic, he was a perfect choice to carry this film with his lovely princess, Helen. I highly recommend this movie if you're looking for a classic horror film to watch. The Mummy has now given me the answer on why mummies can be so creepy and are a great Halloween treat.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boris Karloff follows up his exceptional 1931 performance as the Frankenstein Monster the following year in another Universal horror hit, "The Mummy". In the film, Karloff portrays not only the title character Imhotep, but also his modern day counterpart Ardath Bey, whose mission is to reunite with his long lost love Princess Anck-Es-En-Amon.It was the 1921 British Museum Field Expedition that discovered the Mummy's remains along with the Scroll of Thoth, whose mystic message contains a spell that can raise the dead. When expedition member Norton (Bramwell Fletcher) unseals the scroll, the Mummy slowly comes to life in a sequence designed to create nightmares in young children and shivers in the timid. Fletcher's descent into madness is conveyed by a maniacal rant as his mind fails to accept what his eyes are showing him. His response to expedition leader Sir Joseph Whemple - "He went for a little walk, you should have seen his face".Fast forward to 1932, Sir Joseph and son Frank return to Egypt, and aided by Ardath Bey, discover the tomb of Imhotep's lost love of 3700 years prior. In ritual prayer, Bey summons the spirit of Anck-Es-En-Amon to seek life in the body of Helen Grosvenor. As Helen slowly succumbs to her new identity, Imhotep uses his mystical powers to remove his opposition, willing Sir Joseph's demise and nearly doing the same to Frank. In an illuminating sequence, it's revealed how Imhotep came to be buried alive for his sacrilege of stealing the sacred Scroll of Thoth, and memorizing it's prohibited secrets. For fans of classic horror and Universal monsters in particular, the names of Frankenstein, Dracula and Wolf Man will always remain the big three, but that in no way can lessen the importance of "The Mummy" when it comes to one's must see list. Boris Karloff would have been considered legendary for either one of his signature characters, to have portrayed both Frankenstein and The Mummy so effectively is significant testimony to his "monstrous" talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One forgets with the many subsequent versions and remakes how good a film this original is.The acting is goofy of course, but that it a matter of the period rather than the caliber of the project. The camera-work and editing is perfect within the scope of the craft at that point. The lighting and composition in particular.What I like about this is the very clever writing. It is in the tradition of 'The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari' where some element of the narrative is not to be trusted. There it was the ravings of a madman. Here it is the scroll which creates one of the characters and drives the action through a 'curse,' actually a spell.I am a student of stories-within-the-story. Here is one of the earlier ones, already mature. The reanimated mummy 'shows' in a film the history behind the story. This film follows what I consider a important rule in screen writing: the 'distance' of the film from reality (the abstract dialog and posturing for instance) must match the distance from the film to the film within. So it is here. This same film-within footage was reused in several successive Mummy films if I recall.Amazing how many early Hollywood personalities were Hungarian.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How times have changed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lesser Universal horror film than the other well-known classics from this by-gone era but one that is still entertaining in a lot of ways. It is Karloff who makes the film as the prince brought back to life, and the make up work on him this time is no less impressive than that in FRANKENSTEIN, although not as famous. Karloff's face is a mass of wrinkles and he really does look thousands of years old.Surprisingly, Karloff is only swathed in bandages for a few minutes at the beginning of the film; the image of the bandaged mummy on the rampage is from the film's numerous sequels and Hammer's 1959 remake, among others. Dwight Frye also stars as his usual gibbering maniac, this time repeating "He went for a little walk!" after he has brought Karloff back to (un)life. The film also has some great costumes and a nice Egyptian set, complete with hieroglyphs, which is to be expected really. Karloff gets to deliver a lot of sinister lines and shows us that he is capable of acting as well as wearing make up. Unfortunately most of the film consists of minor characters talking, drawing room talk as it were, and in this area the film is rather dated, much like it's other counterparts of the time, although not quite as dated as the earlier Dracula.Altogether this is an interesting film, enlivened by Karloff's central performance and worth seeing as the film which kicked off a whole sub-genre. Looking back on it, the film may be dated but really it's from a cinematic era which we'll never see again. Look at this and other classics such as THE HAUNTING, and then look at what happened to the horror genre after the mid '70s. No more will we see atmospheric films such as these, instead all we get is blood and gore, which is not necessarily bad but still saddening to see how things have changed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Discovering an ancient Egyptian queen's long-lost tomb, a group of archaeologists find that a local's special interest in their find is due to his belief that a local woman is the reincarnated soul of his long-lost love and race to stop him from carrying out his nefarious plans.This is one of the few classic films that is not as great as it's reputation. The reason for it's classic fate is solely based on the resurrection sequence, with the setting, the lighting, the dread emerged from it and the whole way it proceeds to play out is the large part of it's success. From the warning against reading to the actual reading of the tomes, to the single eye that subtly opens and stares out, it really just sends a chill that resonates incredible strongly. The slowly flickering arm beneath the bandages adds a whole second dimension and creepiness to it, and the conclusion is still utterly powerful and full of suspense. It's effective in it's simplicity, and that is one of the best features of the film. The Egyptian sequence is also quite fun, and the way it works through the historical connections throughout the ages makes for some incredibly fun times here showing the manner in which he gets caught and then mummified for his troubles that has a lot to like here makes it all that much better. However, these two factors, along with being one of Karloff's most memorable and well-played roles at the time, is about all for this one as it's really an overrated film. The fact that the film plays more like a romance film and not a horror film is a big part of that. There's really a small amount of scenes that can possibly be classified as being suspenseful, and those are so rare in the film that it's mostly played quite bland. The sequences in the museum should've been, but there's really nothing there to really call it suspenseful when it's all mostly off-screen. The fact that most of the film is a series of sequences following the romantic exploits of the leads is another helping factor, and they don't really belong in the film. It keeps the focus away from the title villain, who really should've had more of a say in the way the events unfold which manages to really focus in on a few areas which show this. Even the fact that the mummy appears on- screen for no more than five minutes, and none of them involve actually fulfilling it's destiny. That also puts one more nail in the coffin: this is mistakenly made out as the starter of the mummy genre. There was two small factors that hurt that. The basic premise for this was taken from another film, and that there are hardly any signs at all of the standard trademarks of the mummy genre. This really wasn't all that great of a film.Today's Rating/PG: Violence.</fullReview>

The next film to release was The Mummy, bringing back Boris Karloff, David Manners and Edward Van Sloan to star yet again. Edward Van Sloan's character was very similar to that of Van Helsing and Karloff didn't seem to full develop the spirit of The Mummy. Perhaps more scenes should have involved Karloff in his actual lumbering Mummy state than the true version of himself. Other aspects of the film didn't really jump out either. The story was a bit on the weaker side, with the backstory hard to follow and the movie's climax wasn't up to par. Karl Freund made a nice attempt being the filmmaker of The Mummy but it certainly isn't a stand-out classic such as other Universal monster movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mummy is directed by Karl Freund and written by Nina Wilcox Putnam, Richard Schayer and John L. Balderston. It stars Boris Karloff, Zita Johann, David Manners, Arthur Byron, Edward Van Sloan, and Bramwell Fletcher. Music is by James Dietrich and cinematography by Charles J. Stumar.The first of Universal's Mummy films follows the story of Imhotep (Karloff), who after being awaken from his tomb by expedition workers, believes his lover has been reincarnated in the body of a modern woman.It's undeniably slow moving, it's stagy, and away from Karloff the acting and dialogue is just about reaching average qualities. Yet there's a haunting quality to the pic, with a number of genuinely eerie sequences. The shadowed photography helps greatly for funereal atmospherics, while it's somewhat refreshing to find a film of this type not resorting to shock tactics to get your attention.An important film in a lot of ways and well worth a look for those interested in the history of Horror Film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mummy (1932): Dir: Karl Freund / Cast: Boris Karloff, Zita Johann, David Manners, Arthur Byron, Edward Van Sloan: Classic horror film about those ancient things that are best left buried. Boris Karloff, fresh after his classic performance as the Frankenstein monster, is back as the mummy come to life after a curse is broken. He aims to resurrect a princess whom he was mummified for attempting to resurrect before. Now he encounters a woman who bears resemblance to her and decides to communicate to her through a mind trance. Directed by Karl Freund with splendid makeup effects on Karloff. The Egypt digging site is well presented within a screenplay that plays on the hokey. Perhaps this film might have been creepier had the mummy been unable to talk. This renders him too approachable thus tarnishing any potential suspense. Karloff still remains a haunting image whether he is the Frankenstein monster or this ancient figure who can draw power just by staring into one's eyes. Zita Johann plays the female whom resembles the ancient princess and falls under the mummy's trance. David Manners plays the son of one of the reseachers, and he becomes smitten with her. Arthur Byron and Edward Van Sloan play two of the researchers who know just how dangerous their discovery is, and the scroll they must conceal and destroy. Corny yet entertaining creature feature about sins best left unearthed. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

It also has great special effects. The remake from 1999 is a little better. The Mummy returns is also better The Mummy tomb of the dragon emperor is also better. But still this is a great movie. This is one of the scariest movies from the 30's. It is one of the scariest movies made before 1999. Boris Kaloff was a great actor. This movie is a must see. It is a horror movie classic. Zita Johann was a great actress. All The Mummy movies are must sees. See this movie. It is a great horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally known as 'Cagliostro', the subsequent tweaking of the script and title (and scant minutes that actually feature a traditionally bandage enwrapped mummy) ensured that this would quickly join 'Dracula' and 'Frankenstein' (both 1931) as one of the most iconic (that over-used word) horror films of all time.Reviewers have noted this could be seen as a re-write of 'Dracula', and stars two of that film's players (Edward Van Sloan and David Manners). The former film's use of 'Swan Lake' as opening music is also re-used here. The inclusion of 'Frankenstein' Boris Karloff further compounds Universal Films' impressive growing repertoire company of the time. Bramwell Fletcher plays Ralph Norton, the hapless explorer who foolishly resurrects the mummy from his long slumber, and his crazed hysterical laughter as he (but not the audience) witnesses Imhotep talking 'a little walk.' Another classic horror moment.As far as the mummy is concerned, that is all we see ? a flickering eyelid, twitching fingers and a reaching hand, and finally two long bandage trails signifying the departing wizened creature. These frightening moments are accompanied by no musical score whatsoever, which heightens the isolated nightmare.Karloff is seen from that moment onwards ? ten years after his reawakening - as Ardath Bay (an anagram of Death by Ra, I recently discovered, 84 years after the film's release), literally a living mummy. Face and hands leathered and broken (an arduous make-up by resident genius Jack Pierce), Karloff does indeed look and move like a reanimated cadaver. It is a wonderful, restrained performance. Even his eyes lack any lustre until the very end, just before the character meets his doom.For such a slow moving, unspectacular film, things could become a little dull. Luckily the heroine Helen Grosvener is played by Zita Johann who is lively and headstrong (and apparently had a less than joyful time filming, feeling she was a 'scapegoat' for Director Karl Freund). Certainly she gives more of a performance - even when Grosvenor is possessed by Bey - than David Manners who, like his turn in 'Dracula', is charming but stodgy - (indeed, between her two would-be suitors, Grosvenor might find Bey has more life in him!).'The Mummy' stands shoulder-to-shoulder within its mighty triumvirate and has gone onto inspire generations of horror films. Fans might be disappointed that it wasn't until the first sequel ('The Mummy's Hand' 1940) that we become more familiar with the traditional looking pharaoh, and this is a very slow film, very of its time. And yet it contains a creeping sense of dread, an overwhelming atmosphere of reincarnated, ancient horror that any sequels or remakes could never quite emulate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone is familiar with the story of the Mummy. He wants to revive his long lost love. Not nearly as graphic as the modern version, we can enjoy the story with the always interesting Boris Karloff.The mummy appears only briefly, and Karloff assumes the character Ardath Bey. But , we know he is Imhotep. His goal is to get Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann), who he believes is the reincarnation of Anck-es-en-Amon.Now, one may yearn for the beauty of Rachel Weisz in skimpy Egyptian outfits, but this classic is superior overall because of the skill of the actors.This is probably not the last version we shall see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1730 B.C. the Princess Anckesenamon (played by Zita Johann) passes away. Madly in love with her, the High Priest of Karnak, "Imhotep" (Boris Karloff) decides to commit sacrilege by reading from the Scroll of Thoth to bring her back to life. Caught in the act by the Pharaoh (James Crane), Imhotep is buried alive along with the Scroll of Thoth. In 1921 an archaeologist named "Sir Joseph Whemple" (Arthur Byron) and his assistant discover the mummy of Imhotep. They also find a box which carries a warning that whoever opens it will die. Recognizing that there is a curse placed upon it, a professor of the occult named "Dr. Muller" (Edward Van Sloan) warns Sir Joseph Whemple and his assistant not to open the box. However, the assistant does and upon reading the Scroll of Thoth brings the mummy back to life. The assistant then goes insane and the mummy walks out with the Scroll of Thoth. Ten years later, the mummy (who now calls himself Ardath Bay) reveals to the archeologist's son, "Frank Whemple" (David Manners) where the tomb of Princess Anckesenamon can be found. Although he is also an archaeologist, Frank sends a message to his father to come to Cairo and assist him with this new find. At the same time, Dr. Muller has also arrived in Cairo with a young lady he and his wife are taking care of named "Helen Grosvenor" (also played by Zita Johann). While reciting incantations, Ardath Bay draws her to him in order to bring Princess Anckesenamon back to life. Anyway, having given the first part of the story I will stop right here so as not to spoil the film for anyone who hasn't seen it. I will say, however, that this is one of the best classic horror films ever made. The plot is outstanding, the script is excellent, the characters were well developed and the actors all performed in an exceptional manner, with the best performance being done by Boris Karloff. Like two earlier classics made the year prior (Dracula and Frankenstein) this film is a true gem and definitely worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1921, a field expedition in Egypt unearths the mummy of a condemned Egyptian Prince, Im-Ho-Tep. One of the members of the expedition accidentally brings the prince back to life, but the mummy vanishes. Ten years later, the mummy does everything in his power to reunite with his deceased love, who has been reincarnated into a young woman. The classic story of eternally cursed love is one of my favorite classic monster movies. Karloff plays the mesmerizing mummy with some great looking make up. Edward Van Sloan marks his third appearance in a Universal Monsters movie (previously Dracula and Frankenstein), very talented. The story is definitely similar to Dracula, but completely different as well. There were a few parts that lagged due to explaining too much, but that is one of the parts of those old classics. I think the makeup and set design was very creative and helps the movie. The performances from Karloff and Johann are also very memorable. Eighty years later and it's still a great old movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Universal Classic -- With Good Reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1921, a field expedition in Egypt discovers the mummy of ancient Egyptian prince Im-Ho-Tep (Boris Karloff), who was condemned and buried alive for sacrilege...This was the (official) directorial debut of the legendary Karl Freund, probably the greatest cinematographer in history. While I tend to promote him a bit more than probably anyone else (having written the only known biography), I feel he deserves the recognition. Judging this film by its direction may be hard to do... there is limited inventiveness. But it is more than adequately handled, and there is at least one interesting use of the camera, allowing the audience to look into the pool.This film is probably considered the lowest ranking or least known of the original Universal horror films (Wolf Man, Dracula, Frankenstein). I am torn between calling it fair and unfair. Certainly I think the film should be seen by more people, but I have to admit there is just no way to make a mummy as interesting as a vampire or werewolf.And there is the historical nature. Frankenstein goes back to 1818 and had previously been made into a movie by Thomas Edison. Dracula goes to 1897, with vampire tales going back much further. The werewolf dates to at least the Middle Ages. Mummies in a horror context trace to 1827, but were not really interesting to the general public until the Egyptology boom and the discovery of King Tut in 1922. Regarding the acting, Karloff, of course, steals the show. David Manners is disposable and could have been played by anyone. Zita Johann? I am mixed. She has a distinctive look, but could she have been replaced? Probably. Something about her voice seems out of place with the rest of the film, even if she delivers the film's most memorable line (about "opening graves").</fullReview>

This is one my favorites since i saw it some 3 years ago, so warning spoilers ahead 1921 Cairo Karloff awakes or rather the mummy steals the scroll, walks away, 10 years later takes the shape of a person named Ardeth bey (death by Ra) to save his beloved one. Therefore he needs Zita Johann to cast her soul into a lifeless mummy. That's pretty much the story, so overall great film, especially the ending (you'll see) by famous cameraman Karl Freund. He did not photograph this film, but this should not ruin it. But the atmosphere is still great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two middle-aged men, one an archaeologist and the other an expert in the occult, decide that the smart thing to do with the box that warns of a curse aimed at whoever opens it is to leave it alone with the impertinent young guy who is dying to see inside... literally. The obvious happens, and the titular mummy, Imhotep, the high priestess, is brought back to life and disappears. This picks up ten years later, with the creature inevitably returning(and he's well-spoken if eccentric... surprising(I don't know, I was expecting more of a Frankenstein type; at least he is inspired and tragic), and the movie doesn't make a secret out of this, rather, it ensures that you realize it right away). Karloff does a fantastic job, being immensely creepy and with a compelling screen presence. The acting in general is quite good. There is a romance between the two leads of both genders, and it's definitely... present(to be fair, it is nicely contrasted, I won't reveal how). The male is pretty bland, but the female, played by Zita Johann, is so much fun. I guess it's early for any kind of feminism, still, some of her lines(particularly towards her counterpart) are very provocative(the best one being her response to him calling the princess they dug up attractive) and memorable. This is plot over action or build-up(you see Boris actively doing more than he's "almost doing something", it isn't Hitchcock, and not trying to be), with one or two threads not paying off, and it kind of lives down to some of the stereotypes about the genre from the period. It also goes against the whole "show, don't tell" thing(and exposition is dumped shamelessly here and there) of the medium(to be fair, maybe that hadn't been thought of at the time). It does have some visually intriguing sequences(they also did not think a scene could have too much fog), with really nice sets, lighting, filming, editing, costumes, and for the time, FX. And it is never boring. There is a bit disturbing content and violence(no blood or gore) in this. The DVD comes with an interesting and informational commentary by film historian Paul M. Jensen(and I do believe it's in his job description to do the reading with the amount of enthusiasm befitting the obituaries; I know that you may not be used to being listened to, especially by a captive audience, but still), 10 minutes of posters and stills, an 8 minute featurette called Unraveling The Legacy of The Mummy(it devotes about half its running time to this installment and the rest to the two first of the ones involving Stephen Sommers... ugh), the original trailer(gotta love how they made 'em back then) and the documentaries Universal Horror, Mummy Dearest and He Who Made Monsters: The Life and Art of Jack Pierce, all three of which I will review on their individual pages here on the site. I recommend this to fans of classic, Gothic monster flick horror. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AncientEgyptian magic vs. science and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually a rather good movie, with Boris Karloff as Imhotep / Ardath Bey, the mummy come to life. Karloff manages to give off a creepy sepulchral aura just by standing still and staring. A minimum of special effects?mainly the make-up, slightly crackly and powdery, and a small reflecting pool of the sort good for visions and all swathed in mist. The plot employs a healthy dose of period Egyptology, mixed in with romance, a lovely female potential victim, Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann) who is also connected to a long-dead Egyptian princess, and a handsome fellow to connect her back to real life. Johann, with very large and dark and wide-set eyes (and a touch of strabismus, or wandering eye) has a smooth, oval face and looks just fine as a young woman of the 1930s, though a little soft in Egyptian regalia. The plot, which involves a powerful and inexplicable evil making its way into the present while forces of good?love and rationality?resist, resembles several other horror plots. And, like the others, there lies underneath the main plot a curious momentary questioning of science. The Egyptologists from the British Museum subscribe to the principles of science and scoff at the occult power of Egypt as so much superstition, while the German specialist respects this power?one might almost expect Dr. Muller to tell them there are things under the heavens that are not dreamt of in their philosophy. When the mummy comes to life again, science alone cannot resist its power. Only love can do that?the truth of emotion overcomes ancient curses and calls Helen back from the past, and yet the ancient powers are very strong. In the end, Helen is saved by a dea ex machina, when Isis blasts Imhotep to save her servant the princess and to release the harmless girl in the present. This strikes me as the best of the flood of "horror" movies of this era I've seen yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Mummy' was one of a cycle of horror films produced by Universal in the 1930's which included 'Dracula,' 'Frankenstein,' 'The Wolfman,' and later 'The Invisible Man.' All have in common that the first film is superior to the numerous sequels which followed (the very excellent 'Bride of Frankenstein' being a possible exception) and while they all have their strengths and failings, 'The Mummy' may be the most under-rated of them all. I also think that, like I'm-ho-tep, 'The Mummy' may have aged the best.Gloriously photographed by the brilliant Karl Freund, 'The Mummy' is high-class black and white cinematography of the highest level. There are brilliant set pieces. Consider the young apprentice who is clearly torn between opening the chest and transcribing what he's supposed to be translating. Or I'm-ho-tep as he re-awakens, his eyes slowly opening and his hand lowering down to his side. Tension is wonderful in the film through the tease of never really showing a fully mobile I'm-ho-tep (his size and spectre are only hinted at) from high camera angles to make the apprentice cower. And of course the two pieces of of cloth being dragged behind the re-animated I'm-ho-tep are extremely effective.Boris Karloff. He is tremendous here and if you are not already a fan of his work before you watch it, you most certainly should be after. He is so dynamic on the screen that he is a serious threat to steal every scene he is in. He and Peter Cushing are similar actors in that they both often appeared in low-calibre movies, but elevated them to greater heights because they took the material with an absolute seriousness and professionalism. Karloff could make a bad film good in spite of itself. 'The Mummy' is a film where his magic wasn't needed, but certainly it was welcomed. His slight voice is as hypnotic as his magical ring, his penetrating eyes look right through the camera and into your core, and he manages to be the only actor who stoops over like a hunchback, and yet towers over everyone and everything in his presence.Today with a horror savvy audience used to too much gore, blood and sex, 'The Mummy' isn't likely to scare anyone. It is a film that has a deep affective power though, and it is guaranteed to linger with you long after you've finished watching it. It is slowly paced -- not a problem -- but not sleep inducing. It doesn't suffer from the lulls that wound the second half of Tod Browning's 'Dracula,' for example. Many of today's films are forgotten before the credits have a chance to roll. 'The Mummy' is vital and engaging from beginning to end. Even better than that? It is pretty entertaining too! And hey, how can I not like a film that features a guy from my home town (David Manners) as the protagonist? This is a movie that matters and definitely belongs in the cannon of essential viewing for serious horror film fans.</fullReview>

For some strange reason the ancient Egyptian settings, and the fact that the musical bursts are few and far-between, there seems to be an almost hypnotizing quality. The story is not rushed, nor is it boring. The jump at the beginning that we all get when the mummy begins to walk is quickly turned into a combination of strange contentment and excitement. Basically, your so enthralled by the movie, that you feel relaxed.

		<fullReview>This classic horror movie is cleverly written and is carried by Karloff's frightening but yet humane performance of Imhotep/Ardath Bey.Of course by todays standards, there is absolutely nothing scary about this movie. Still this movie has an haunting dark atmosphere that should be well appreciate by the fans of the genre.The story is nicely written and the movie is build up very well. The directing by Karl Freund, who perhaps is better known as an Oscar winning cinematographer who worked on '30's movies such as "Dracula" and "All Quiet on the Western Front", is top-class. You can tell by looking at this movie that it was directed by a person who knew a great deal about lightning and clever camera-work. The use of silent-movie techniques and acting in the flashback scene's was a nice and original touch that also works effective.But main reason why this movie has grown into a real true horror classic is Boris Karloff. Karloff has an amazing screen presence in this movie and he plays his character extremely well and in a creepy way. A true horror icon. Also the always excellent Edward Van Sloan is present in the movie. Once again he plays a sort of Van Helsing role, just like he previously did in the movies "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". He acts sort of like in the same way as Bela Lugosi did, using lot of hand gestures and putting lots of passion in the role.A true horror classic that deserves to be seen by everyone.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Not only does it, but it also feels tempted to search for its long lost love.If nothing else, people these days should have learned NOT to disturb mummies' tombs, especially not when they were buried alive for serious crimes back in ancient Egypt.

		<shortDescription>The Mummy (1932) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being my fifth viewing of this film, I couldn't help but be impressed all over again. Many tend to find it dull after Karloff's all-too-brief appearance at the beginning dressed in the traditional bandages (done to death in subsequent films), but I personally find the film compelling all the way through.It evokes a dreamlike and romantic atmosphere like no other in the Universal canon - though some of the plot strands, admittedly, were lifted from various classic horror tales, there being no antecedent to the Mummy folklore in popular fiction; in fact, John L. Balderston's script is quite literate and generally avoids the stagey quality of Dracula (1931). Again, director Karl Freund was criticized for the film's excessively slow pace but, clearly, this was done deliberately - one might say, inevitably, since Freund (as a cinematographer) had been one of the most prominent figures of the German Expressionist movement - and there's no doubt in my mind that this actually enhances the particular mood he was striving for: camera-work, editing, sets and costumes are alike excellent. The film also bears a pretty strong cast: Karloff is somewhere near his best here - enough said; unlike most female leads in horror films of this period, Zita Johann - with her striking looks and 'modern' approach to acting - commands almost as much attention as the nominal star; David Manners and Edward Van Sloan's roles are virtual reprises of their respective turns in Dracula - but it's always a pleasure to watch the latter as he always gave it his all; and Bramwell Fletcher, who goes mad in unforgettable fashion early on, as the hapless archaeologist who unwittingly brings the Mummy to life.I also watched the extras which accompanied the film and I must put in a good word for Paul M. Jensen's Audio Commentary: this too has been put down in reviews as being "soporific" and resorting mostly to descriptions of the on-screen action: I totally disagree and find his comments both compelling and insightful, as he clearly knows his stuff; maybe it isn't the exhilarating slam-bang commentary track that Tom Weaver or Greg Mank are noted for but, personally, I have no complaints! In fact, so impressed was I by the film that instead of diving straight on to the next Legacy set, I decided to rewatch SVENGALI (1931) and SHE (1935) - both of which were mentioned by Jensen as having partly inspired Balderston's cinematic concept of THE MUMMY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Dr. Muller (Edward Van Sloan), noted Egyptologist and master of the occult sciences, rebuffs his colleague Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Byron) for not believing in the power of the ancient gods who still dwell in the hills of Egypt, ample time has passed for Sir Joseph's assistant Norton (Bramwell Fletcher) to be eaten alive with curiosity, prompting Norton to examine the contents of an ancient box bearing the kind of dread warnings about ancient curses that Westerners in these types of movies always love to scoff at &amp; eventually pay the price for their sneering.Boris Karloff, in keeping with the general mood of the picture, delivers a powerfully understated performance as the centuries old Imhotep/Ardath Bey, moving and speaking as if his body and tongue were indeed restricted by 3700 years of entombment. Imhotep (unlike his mummified kin, Kharis) certainly benefits from being able to shed his bandages post-resurrection--though I have to imagine Karloff saw the irony in enduring all those hours in Jack Pierce's make-up chair &amp; having so minimal on-screen time in the mummy wrappings.</fullReview>

A decade later the mummy disguised as a modern Egyptian tries to reunite with his old love, an ancient princess who has been reincarnated into a young woman.What a grand piece of entertainment from Universal that's amusing and rather memorable on many different levels. I just find Egyptian history and their thoughts on the after world rather fascinating, even though the story moves pretty much like a snails pace. So don't be expecting action galore and a fully bandaged mummy on the loose. This talkie you have to be patient and enjoy a poetic tussle that is dialogue driven and has a strong if silly narration on the mythology. In my mumble opinion it's far better than "The Mummy" that starred Brendan Frazer that went for special effects over basic plot and character development. It's not bad by any means as there are some exciting moments, but it doesn't compare to this piece.The dreamlike atmosphere is well compensated by the simple set up and backdrop that's very sublime in appearance. Harsh landscape of the desert and Cairo is captured effectively and there are well-staged moments, especially in a museum. Stark and dim lighting add to moody atmosphere too. Its atmospheric awe is surrounded with a soothing and effective score and moments of dead silence that played a key factor in the uneasy feel. Just like the very eerie scene when the mummy awakes. The film has a very gloomy undertone to it. The plot might be silly, but it was intriguing enough and very mystical in detail. It's really a tragic love story that has Egyptian mythology. The mostly unpredictable screenplay holds a clever touch to it. Characters are well thought out, abundantly rich conversations and some gripping scenes of tension. An excellent if too sudden climax that ends rather downbeat. The dialogue was rather thick and there was some added wit.Borris Karloff gives a strikingly spooky performance and definitely comes across as the show card here. The make-up is superb as his face comes across as pale and pasty. It's like his been sucked of life and those zooms into his glowing eyes are impressively hypnotic. There is such an absorbing and powerful presence that Karloff provides when on screen. The other performances are fairly deadpan in delivery, but that didn't take away from the film.Overall, it's a highly recommendable horror classic of the 1930's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is remarkable in several aspects,notably: 1)The use of sophisticated back lighting and superior make-up/special effects performed by Pierce, prove that top quality films could be produced with-out million dollar animation. 2)The hidden sexual connotations are conveyed in such a way as to be present with-out insulting or offending anyone. Remember, this is 1932. 3)Karloff is, again, superbly cast in the role as both the Mummy and Bey. And he actually has speaking parts! 4)If you could show this film to an audiance, today, that is unpoll- uted by modern special effects, I think the reaction would be the same as it was in 1932. After all, entertainment is still entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow.. Better than I thought!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the first time, 10-23-03. It was much better than I had thought it would be. It actually has a story, and a decent one to boot. If you saw the 1999 remake and its sequel, which I did, and I truly loved, then you can really have some appreciation for this original. It follows a different, but similar story, in that Imhotep's grave is dug up, and due to circumstances, comes to life to "reincarnate" his long, lost love, Anak-sa-mun. True, there are not really any special effects, but Boris Karloff is so haunting and so huge of a man, special effects are almost not needed. And the girl, as others have said, without any big "skin" scenes, was very sexy and beautiful. Again, I was very impressed with this original, even after loving the new version(s). This is not the Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark type of adventure, but more of a mystery/suspense thriller, and yes, even a horror movie (1932 style, to be sure). My kids ages 8,5 and 3 also all loved it!...

		<shortDescription>Boris Karloff's timeless performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a crazy little horror classic, try "The Mummy". It's filmed in the early 1930's and it introduces the godfather of vintage horror, Boris Karloff in one of his most memorable roles (right beside his terrific performance in "Frankenstein", naturally). Of course "The Mummy" isn't that frightening nowadays (on the contrary pretty damn comical if you ask me) but the wicked atmosphere is so successful and wonderfully odd you can feel it and almost...eh, touch it. Karloff makes you speechless. Not the best of universal's monster classics but worth a look if you like this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective short feature.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this early Universal horror; I did not think it was a staggering achievement I grant you, but it is very effective at what it does.A quiet, modestly atmospheric mood is built up by Freund, with the use of slightly unconventional music, at times (but not entirely) mellifluous, lovely photography... Karloff's performance; transcending the rest. He seems on some other purpose to the rest of the cast; to really create an indelible, serene performance. It is all quite well worked; the plot obviously bearing comparison with Browning's "Dracula" in its use of events taking place resolutely off-screen. This all works in view of that sure-fire old tactic, ambiguity, thanks to Karloff's performance, which has requisite dignity and otherworldly menace that makes it all credible. Zita Johann is a pretty sprightly dame, just about conveying her thinly-scripted character; a fairly normal young lady of flapper bearing who has a rather unusual ancestry. She is drawn into the whole business fairly convincingly, and has a certain conflicting, contrary attitude to her that I like. Yet it's not a well-nourished role really; Johann does well with imbuing it a little, but really her appearance is the factor the film seems to be banking on: a slinky, culpable figure, imploring, enchanting, prominent dark eyes. Too many of the cast just fade into the genteel background; Van Sloan very much a familiar, emblem of other Universal horrors, the rest very largely lacking in enterprise and depths.The early section is maybe the most cinematically memorable; the stirring of Karloff's few moments in the actual Mummy's guise, is an astonishing achievement. Universal's "Mummy" largely works as it knows how to handle such horror, from a fairly thinly spred, if at times evocative script. It is quiet, subtle and sombre, well given to sedate chills. There is no hail of tedious noise, telegraphing music or superfluous use of special effects... this is a genuine film; it has touches that confound and intrigue, yet it is not a great whole. It is not a work as consistent, beguiling or irreverant as "The Invisible Man", or the absolute revelation that is Mamoulian's breathtaking "Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"... it is a very solid, short feature film that plies its tricks nicely, yet does not seem as a whole a work of great significance. Karloff is a laudable banker in this role.Rating:- ****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful jazz-age (though made in '32) thriller, cleverly exploiting the public interest in Egyptology inspired by the Tutankhamen discoveries a decade earlier.The plot's general outline must be known to everyone by now: when an archaeological expedition discovers a mysterious mummy, a wise occultist/archaeologist advises caution. But when an impatient scholar reads an ancient text, the mummy is brought back to life to seek his reincarnated love.Note, however, that this is not the rag-dragging mummy who wanders around strangling people for a sip of tana-leaf tea (that's "The Mummy's Hand" and its sequels). This is a far more interesting (and sympathetic) Boris Karloff performance that the 1999 "Mummy" is loosely based on.Not to be missed for horror fans!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm-Ho-Tep Walks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Karl Freund-directed The Mummy is a unique film in being an early thirties' horror classic from Universal that was not directed by Tod Browning or James Whale. Freund was a cinematographer whose few forays into directing were not sufficiently successful for a career, so he returned to photography. The Mummy is far and above his best known movie, though his later Mad Love has its partisans and is, like this film, a tale of obsessive love. It has no equivalents in film history; and for all the sequels and remakes it remains sui generis.More than most horrors, this film is a mood piece, and a sophisticated one at that in that Freund seemed determined to get the 'shocking' stuff out of the way early so as to concentrate on mood. The plot, for the most part, is a reworking of Dracula, but in this case the 'undead' party has his eye on one woman, not many. Prince I'm-Ho-Tep was raised from the dead by the impetuous and ill-timed mutterings of a young archaeologist from the Scroll Of Thoth, a sacred document of ancient Egypt. The mummy's object of desire is a young Anglo-Egyptian woman he believes to be the reincarnation of his beloved, for whose love he was mummified alive more than three millenia earlier. I'm-Ho-Tep, disguised as a wizened modern Egyptian, Ardeth Bey, lures the woman to the Cairo Museum, where he plans to kill her in order to have her join him in his eternal death-life. If one can accept this unlikely premise The Mummy is a good, eerie and creatively made piece of work. It is profound primarily at the unconscious level; in its abrupt camera movement, languorous pacing, somber mood and air of foreboding. The Mummy is not perhaps the most fun horror picture to watch. It lacks the throwaway camp of the Frankenstein movies; and its mood of remoteness and the single-minded obsession of its monster it is well beyond the Middle European charm and occasional warmth (in the village scenes) of Dracula and his various vampire successors. There is no safe place in The Mummy. As I'm-Ho-Tep comes from a vastly different time, and really has only one thing on his mind, his menace has about it the urgency of a stalker. Unlike the Frankenstein creature, Dracula and the Wolf Man (when a wolf), I'm-Ho-Tep has a genuine personality aside from the mayhem he creates, and in a way seeks our sympathy. He gives his beloved a lengthy autobiography in a pool, which we have no reason to doubt; and he clearly wants her not only give herself to him but to understand him, to appreciate the suffering he has gone through on account of his love for her. And he makes a good case.This would be a quite good movie with a mediocre mummy, but with Boris Karloff in the part it approaches greatness. Karloff had an empathy for monsters and monstrous-seeming creatures, and his performance here is one of his best. He captures perfectly the ancient dignity of this lost prince, who has beneath his dusty surface a scholarly, at times didactic side. One doesn't sense cruelty in the character so much as determination; and though he prays to ancient gods one sees him always as a cast-off human with very real needs, adrift in time. Is this a horror movie or a character study, you ask? Well, I see no reason why a film can't be both. In making I'm-Ho-Tep seem so human the film draws us into his mind and character, making him as much a figure of pathos as terror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Any similarity between I'm-Ho-Tep and Count Dracula is purely coincidental.) THE MUMMY (Universal, 1932), directed by Karl Freund, continues the pattern of the horror cycle that began with 1931's "Dracula." A new monster is born, or re-born, in the persona of I'm-Ho-Tep, played by Boris Karloff, the Monster in "Frankenstein." But in spite of its originality, the plot to "The Mummy" somewhat borrows from "Dracula" in more ways than one. Besides the opening credits starting with the title inscribed on a giant pyramid with the underscoring to "Swan Lake," David Manners and Edward Van Sloan, late from "Dracula," return. Karloff's Mummy, like Bela Lugosi's Dracula, has mystic powers, and with the glaze of his eyes, can place his victims under his spell. The amulet, representing the Goddess Isis, protects its victim who wears it from the mummy as does the crucifix offers protection from the vampire. Even I'm-Ho-Tep has a servant assisting him with his evil deeds, not Renfield, who became Dracula's slave, but a Nubian (Noble Johnson), who is given orders but no lines to speak. As in "Dracula," Van Sloan plays the authority of the mummy's history and assists in helping the young couple in question. Otherwise, "The Mummy" has its moments of chills and thrills, and is helped along with underscoring that is lacking in both "Dracula" and "Frankenstein." By 1932, the horror movies, as well as other Hollywood movies itself, was coming of age, improving in quality as well as quantity, breaking away from the slow pacing and silent movie techniques.The story begins in Egypt in 1921 where an archaeological expedition unearth the tomb of a buried alive mummy named I'm-Ho-Tep. Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Byron) discovers a curse inscribed on the lid of a small box. Doctor Muller (Edward Van Sloan), the adviser, tries to convince Whemble to obey the warning and not open the box. But curiosity seeks in for Ralph Norton (Bramwell Fletcher) who opens the box, reads the Scroll of Thoth, which brings the mummy (Boris Karloff) to life. After the mummy takes the scroll and walks away, Ralph laughs himself to insanity. Ten years later, I'm-Ho-Tep, now Ardath Bey, appears, minus his mummy wrappings now gowned with Egyptian clothing, directs another expedition in finding the whereabouts of the tomb of Princess Anekesenanom. After that tomb is found and displayed at a museum in Cairo, I'm-Ho-Tep tries to resurrect it from the dead, only to learn that the Egyptian girl he once loved thousands of years ago is now the reincarnated Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann). After meeting her, he tries to use her as a sacrifice, but things get complicated when Frank Whemble (David Manners), Sir Joseph's son and Helen's romantic interest, tries to interfere.Unlike his Frankenstein monster, Karloff never re-prised his role as I'm-Ho-Tep. "The Mummy" had gone through several non-related sequels in the 1940s, with Universal resurrecting the character as Kharis in four quickies, one with Tom Tyler, and the latter three with Lon Chaney Jr. Two remakes, one in 1959 and another in 1998 borrow from the 1932 original, but lack the suspense and differ in continuity. The most memorable sequence in "The Mummy" occurs when I'm-Ho-Tep takes the hypnotized Helen to look into the pond, taking her back in time to ancient Egypt where they were once lovers, leading to I'm-Ho-Tep's sacrifice for her that has him caught, facing his sentence of punishment by being buried alive with his soul denied eternal rest. Outside of Karloff's fine performance, with make-up compliments of Jack Pierce, Zita Johann, a Hungarian actress from the Broadway stage who looks more Egyptian than of her true heritage, is perfectly cast as Helen. Her movie career may have been short-lived (1931-1934), but with this film alone, Johann has become immortal along with this original carnation of "The Mummy," which may be destined to, like I'm-Ho-Tep, live on in centuries to come."The Mummy," presented on video cassette in the 1980s, later became part of the Universal Horror Film Package on DVD after 2000. Formerly shown on both the Sci-Fi Channel and American Movie Classics, it can be found on Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: October 10, 1998), best shown during the after midnight hours. So beware! (**)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff was so cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In light of the release of the 1999 Mummy movie I was drawn to see the original to see if it was really that much better that the new one. Since the new one sucked tremendously, not much could go wrong in that department. This movie is a much more heartfelt movie that the new one wanted to be. The story of the Mummy coming back to life when it is excavated in Egypt by some English treasure hunters/scientists is the beginning of a much more humane story than I expected.Imhotep the Mummy (Karloff) has been buried alive 2700 years ago in punishment for trying to bring his dead love back from the dead. His plans are thwarted and he is sentenced to eternal punishment. When he is dug up early in the 20th century he is awakened from his curse and starts to look for a way to again try to bring back his love from the dead. Ten years later he resurfaces in the Cairo museum and manages to direct the English toward the tomb of his long lost love. They dig her up and put her on display in the museum. He finds a likeness for his love in the lovely figure of Zita Johann. Her life is now very much in danger...As I said before the story of the long lost love and the will to sacrifice a lot for this love is the central theme for this movie. It is not the scares or the action that make this the classic it is, it is the story that makes it. That is what the new 1999 version was severely lacking.The acting was good alround. Karloff is as cool as ever and sort of reprises his Frankenstein which would go on to make him a movie legend. But never the less seeing the mummy come to life is still a great sight to see. Johann is good as the "love" interest of Karloff and Frank Whemple, one of the English.The production values are tremendous. The sets are very elaborate and big. The outdoor sets are very well dressed. The lighting on all the scenes is fantastic, in particular the haunting close-up of Karloff when he tries to hypnotize a victim, fantastic. Black and white still rules.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mummy possesses all the inherent flaws of any Universal horror, be it the uncomplex, singular narrative, or the contrived, clunky expositionary dialogue. Yet somehow it transcends such limitations to rank with the best of them.Opening with the sonorous strains of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake as opposed to the usual not-at-all-ripped-off-by-John-Williams-for-Superman Universal theme, it's a more assured production than usual. The noirish use of shadow and frequent long passages of silence adds to the tension, while the film makes regular use of the "fade to black" to distinguish between scenes. This is appropriate as most of what takes place goes unseen ? be it the Mummy's full appearance when awakened, or the slaying of the museum guard. Rather than force the horror, the picture allows it to go imagined, the lynchpin of all truly good films within the genre.Every character has a theory on the Mummy's origins, and all give it with enthusiasm. Some think he was a sacrilegious slaying. "Maybe he got too gay," offers Bramwell Fletcher with retrospective amusement. The pace is much tighter when compared to duller studio efforts such as The Wolf Man (Ironically coming nearly a decade later). The Mummy itself is awakened within the first ten minutes. In fact this initial prologue is perhaps better than the main plot. Fletcher is arguably the best actor in the piece, so it's a shame he's written out to be replaced by David Manners as a dashing lead, albeit a very stiff one. I guess the problem is his performance is too MANNERed. Tee-hee!I caught this one after having just seen the flat Wolf Man. Occasionally the camera may wobble (particularly during the striking scene where the lens sneaks up behind the praying Karloff), but generally you know you're in safe hands. And it's these shaky scenes which are the most groundbreaking, Karl Freund's vision being far ahead of what was then technically possible. The themes of sexual longing are also quite daring for the time, too.The depiction of Egyptians within the film is stereotyped at best; ("A thousand pardons!") though Karloff effectively creates a monster to rival his own Frankenstein. A shame his Fez now reminds you more of Tommy Cooper, but a good creation nevertheless. And he does wonders with mascara. The idea of a being that can cause a heart attack through will alone is terrifying, and Karloff instils fear in everyone just by showing him or her his ring. (Ooh, Matron!)Arguably the most successful melding between European cinema and Universal, the nods towards the silent, expressionist age and effective flashback sequences make this one of the very best of the studio, rivalled only by Bride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many younger fans malign this picture for its lack of action and slow, plodding pace. Well, to a degree, they are right. This film is very slow-paced and has very little action, and even shows the bandaged one only in two scenes. But the film is a rare gem of atmosphere and some great shots by director Karl Freund. The Mummy is an exercise in patience....patience for opening the crypt, patience for being brought back to life for Im-Ho-Tep, patience for revenge, and finally patience for love. It is a love story between Im-Ho-Tep, a high priest who dared love a princess. Karloff is magnificent in his roles as both the mummy and as Ardeth Bey, a more sinister character. In fact, Karloff is in top form here and in this time frame did some of his greatest roles...Frankenstein, Fu Manchu, The Old Dark House and The Black Cat. The rest of the cast is pretty good. Zita Johann makes a nice heroine, and as always it is a pleasure to have Edward Von Sloan on the screen. As with most of his performances, David Manners can become annoying. The real star though is Freund and his camera. The opening scene is one of the best in the horror film genre for its compact suggestiveness and build-up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am glad the recent remake of The Mummy has aroused interest in the original - much the same way the remake of The Haunting has renewed interest in the brilliant original.Comparing the two films is futile since they are really apples and oranges - the remake is an action/adventure film of the Raider's variety with the original being an effectively atmospheric example of German Expressionistic filmmaking.If I was to find a similarity between the 1999 and the 1932 versions it would be in the powerful performances by the actors in the role of The Mummy - Karloff and Vosloo. Karloff is absolutely brilliant in The Mummy. Watch the way he moves! His performance intensity shines through all the makeup as it did in Frankenstein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After Karl Freund did the cinematography on "Dracula"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Karl Freund did a good job on the cinematography in "Dracula" in 1931 -- some claim he actually directed the first fifteen minutes or so of that film, which are the most effective -- his studio, Universal, gave him this film to direct. It really is very similar in some ways to the 1931 "Dracula" in that it is slow, deliberate, creepy, and dark. It even has many of the same cast members as "Dracula" and, like that film, the only really good acting is supplied by the person playing the main character(Boris Karloff in this case). "The Mummy" also introduced the idea of the villain travelling across great distances of time and space to reunite with the reincarnation of his lost love. That idea was not a part of the 1931 "Dracula" but since has been incorporated into other Dracula films, especially Coppola's 1992 effort, as a motivation for the villain's obsession with a particular female.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The interactions of the characters within The Mummy are much like those of Dracula. A one line description of both of these movies would be something like "Woman must be redeemed by proper patriarchal desire after tainted by the villain's unholy desire." However the visual style and the portrayal of the characters are done in a mostly convincing manner. The Mummy is a more horror inspiring film by far, and at 72 minutes can you go wrong?</fullReview>

The bad guy in this film can't be stopped by wolfsbane, or by a dime-store crucifix. Consequently, even Edward van Sloan is powerless against him. Boris Karloff plays a 3700-year-old resurrected Egyptian searching for his lost love, a vestal virgin. Her soul now inhabits the body of a half-English, half-Egyptian girl. Effective acting all around, exotic atmosphere, many surprises. THE MUMMY is definitely a film to own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Version I watched: DVD Box Set versionActors: 6/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 6/10 The two really iconic films in this territory are Bela Lugosi's Dracula and Boris Karloff's Frankenstein. Although it takes the star from the latter, it id really the former to which The Mummy owes the greater debt. It borrows a large part of the plot, and much of the cast, many of whom (almost gallingly) play very similar roles. The actors for John Harker and Dr. Van Helsing, David Manners and Edward Van Sloan, play their roles almost identically. On top of this, it seemed to me a problem that I saw a distinct lack of chemistry between manners and his love interest played by Zita Johann. The Mummy villain himself is iconic though, and well worth seeing just for this. Karloff is an underrated actor, and gives a strong performance, especially in the flashback scenes to his ancient Egyptian origin, which are the best scenes in the film, for me. Don't expect anything like the 90s remake though, or you will be sorely disappointed. The two are clearly showing the same story, but they couldn't be more different generically. This is no action film. For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/the-mummy-1932.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mummy is without a doubt one of the finest horror movies of all time, and although it didn't age too well, it never looses it's charm. The story is intriguing, the film is high on atmosphere and creepiness, the film has a very noir-like feel - even if the setting isn't quite what you might expect from a noir film. As a matter of fact, it feels more like one of the Val Lewton horror films of the film more than your usual Universal Horror film, mainly because of this ' noirishness' and the way the plot unfolds. The acting can get slightly over the top at times, but it doesn't really put you away from the film, as it actually adds to it. The film is slow paced, but it doesn't really get boring, as a matter of fact, it holds you up all the way, making you wonder what will happen next. Overall, it is a terrific film and lots of fun. A true classic of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine example of classic horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror films have changed so much over the years. Every decade from the start of making motion pictures until now has had it's share of horror films and they have evolved for various reasons and under changing circumstances. Nowadays you can use as much blood, gore, sex, and profanity as you want in a horror film. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but some times one or more is used in excess, possibly to try and compensate for a film's shortcomings. You don't need extreme violence in horror film to scare the audience, although if used right it can have that effect. But before all of this in the Golden Age of cinema it was all about atmosphere, suspense, and imagery when trying to make a frightening horror movie.Universal Pictures knew this and it shows in their famous series of monster movies, each featuring a monster from literature or folklore. One idea that was particularly popular was the of the dead coming back to life to kill the living. For centuries there have been myths about Egyptian mummies returning to life because of some curse and hunting down and killing those who desecrated their tomb. This 1932 version of the tale is one of, if not the best of it's kind.Pros: Fine work by the cast. A good score. Beautiful, crisp cinematography. Nice production design. Moves at a slow, but steady pace. Some good eerie moments. Ardeth Bay is a memorable and creepy villain. Those shots of his eyes will give you goosebumps. Plenty Egyptian scenery and landmarks to enjoy.Cons: Would have been nice to see Boris Karloff in full mummy make-up for more of the movie. Ends rather abruptly.Final thoughts: Some films don't hold up too well after a lot of time has passed. True 'The Mummy' probably isn't as scary now as it was all that time ago and is a bit dated, but is so well crafted and was obviously made with heart by everyone involved that it holds up pretty darn well.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Golden Age of Horror from Universal Studios</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The films greatest asset is a wonderful performance by Boris Karloff as the mummy who was just a year removed from his breakout role as Frankenstein. The other strengths of the production are some very effective makeup effects and impressive cinematography which still looks good visually 76 years later and good production design.Beyond Karloff there are a few solid performances but there are also several which are considerably over the top especially when viewed today. I'm somewhat undecided by Zita Johann as Helen Grosvenor/Princess Anck-es-en-Amon, she is effective at times and certainly established an interesting look but the performance isn't consistent, some scenes are much better than others.Oddly and this may be somewhat due to it being from an era far removed from our own but there is very little about the presentation which is particularly frightening or scary. Many of the frightening images that I associated with the Mummy were it appears from the numerous sequels which are covered in a 30 minute documentary include on the DVD Mummy Dearest: A Horror Tradition Unearthed.It's also interesting to note that the initial story from which the Mummy developed had nothing to with Mummies but the rewritten story was influenced by the discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb and the subsequently popular rumor's of a curse affecting those involved in the discovery. There are also numerous parallels between the story and the original Dracula feature also written by John Balderston for Universal the year previous.The 1999 remake and it's sequel while having considerable differences and additions from the original do take quite a bit from this film both in terms of plot and otherwise.In summary while I can't really rate the film any higher it did spawn an entire horror sub-genre which is still popular today and features a great performance from Karloff and some very good production values.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an unsettling visual experience that should be praised for establishing some visual techniques in Horror movies.The plot, acting, and direction overall is solid although most of the important situations and conversations take place in just one setting so a directional work isn't needed to the full. Boris Karloff as always delivers a wicked, solid performance. The man steals the show alone! The one to praise about the movie is the eerie atmosphere and excellent performances. I really dug the clever and scary dialogs.Also, the settings that deal with Ancient Egypt are extraordinary. Myself, being a huge fan of Egyptian culture had a blast watching them and listening anything that had to do with Egyptian deities and history.Overall, this is one of Karloff's classics.

		<shortDescription>Another wonderful performance by Karloff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Anck-es-en-Amon, my love has lasted longer than the temples of our gods. No man ever suffered as I did for you." The Mummy tells the story of Imhotep, an ancient Egyptian priest obsessed with his love Anck-es-en-Amon, who he stalks across the ages in the form of an undead mummy after he was executed by premature burial. When his tomb is uncovered by a British archaeologist and he is resurrected, the terror comes to London and to Miss Helen Grosvenor, who appears to be the reincarnation of his ancient love. When he proposes to kill her and bring her back to life as a mummy herself, it is up to her more modern suitor and his colleagues to stop this ancient evil.Boris Karloff once again shows us his considerable skill and mastery of acting when he becomes the ancient mummy, aided only by a bit of make up. But he is more menacing and sinister, and he is more convincing as the mummy, than any who played the role in later adaptations of the story. Zita Johan is also marvelous in her role and appears very exotic and mysterious in her beauty. It was also fun to see Edward Van Sloan (Van Helsing in Dracula and Dr. Waldman in Frankenstein) in yet another similar role.The Mummy is not overly long and the story moves at a rapid pace, but it still seems like a relaxed telling of the tale and manages to maintain a creepy atmosphere throughout.Great movie worth watching for Karloff and Johan's performances as well as a story that keeps the attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris Unwrapped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Short on horror and suspense, "The Mummy" more than compensates with sheer atmosphere and dread, and a performance by Boris Karloff that makes a better case than "Frankenstein" as to his depth of talent, both as an actor and as a creature-feature legend.Karloff is the title character, one Imhotep, released from entombment after 3,700 years when a British archaeologist unthinkingly mutters some words from the resurrecting Scroll of Thoth. A decade later, disguised as an modern Egyptian in 1930s Cairo, he discovers in the eyes of governor's daughter Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann) the soul of the woman he lived and died for in ancient Thebes. Imhotep seeks to bring her to share his undead life, as soon as he gets that scroll."A few moments of horror for an eternity of love" is all he asks for, and the achievement of "The Mummy" is half-making you believe the idea a reasonable one, no matter how many dead museum guards Imhotep leaves in his path.This could well be regarded as Karloff's sound debut. As several posters here have already pointed out (reptilicus, bensonmum2, Fudoh-101), while Karloff had made his mark already in "Frankenstein", it was in "The Mummy" we got to hear him speak for the first time. And what a voice! Sibilant, ethereal, polite, the voice of a London undertaker with a slightly distracting lisp, it curls around the corners of the screen like incense smoke as he leads Johann and her British friends to serve his dark ends. It's one of cinema's unforgettable voices, and it is used here for the first time to its full effect."You cannot harm me," he tells his pursuers when cornered, with the slightest of smiles. "You must return that scroll to me or die."Karloff is ably helped by director Karl Freund's deliberate pacing, by set designs that accentuate the spookiness of the living-and-undead framework, and by a riveting score that gives us plenty of mournful bassoon when Imhotep contemplates his lost love. Jack Pierce's famous make-up is of the less-is-more school, leaving the bandages off except for a couple of brief instances, letting the natural hollowness of Karloff's eyes and jowls do the work with the help of a myriad of web-like lines that cross his face at every juncture, suggesting the desiccation underneath.Another plus for Karloff here is Johann as the one woman in distress in these kinds of movies that actually adds to the overall equation. Unlike others, I'm not surprised that Johann didn't have a big movie career after this; she had an exotic look and an otherworldly aura that seems ill-suited for conventional material (even Garbo had to work to find parts). But watching her in a gold-lame gown, all curves and no underwear, resembling a figure of Isis in a charm bracelet seen later on, you get a feeling for why Imhotep aches so. She sells the spooky hold Imhotep has over her character, yet at the same time manages to surprise you with some well-grounded humor.The weaknesses of the film for me are the rest of the cast, ranging from silly-smug (Edward Van Sloan) to wooden (David Manners) to flat-out wrong (Arthur Byron), with only Bramwell Fletcher's short, sharp turn as the archaeologist who frees Imhotep standing out in any interesting way. There are too many Dracula parallels, though you do have to be looking for them.As a showcase for Karloff, though, you can't ask for better, a tight, gripping tale that leaves no opportunity wasted to set off Karloff's eyes like Roman candles and leave you cringing in anticipation for what he will do next. It was a good introduction to a Karloff who could do more than just shamble and moan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly effective, engaging drama far removed from its sequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The image most people have of 'The Mummy' as a movie monster is the one from the forties Universal films (or if you're British the Hammer films with Peter Cushing). Wrapped in bandages, lumbering around menacingly, maybe with a sound effect or two added.Memory is deceptive. The original Universal Mummy feature opens as you might expect it to- a field expedition in 1921 Egypt discovers some ancient scrolls etc. etc. etc. This part is entertaining especially if you enjoy the adventure genre, but we've all seen it before. Once the plot moves away from Egypt, however, there is no lumbering bandaged corpse, instead we get a wrinkled Boris Karloff (solid makeup job, incidentally) and a movie that aside from some creepy moments seems more inclined to tell a story about loneliness, long-lost love, obsession, and history coming back to haunt us than what you might expect from a monster movie. Although several Universal films in the 40's would also steer clear of the traditional monster movie setup, "The Mummy", coming after "Dracula" and James Whale's excellent "Frankenstein", is quite radically different from the studio's previous talkie horror films.Karl Freund directs the film awkwardly in places but also succeeds in evoking quite a bit emotionally as well as creating fantastic atmosphere (the latter is to be expected of classic Universal horror films, of course). The aspect of the film which really shines, outside of the excellent acting from Karloff and Johann, is the script, and while "Frankenstein" was a better film on a technical level, "The Mummy" features one of few truly great screenplays for Universal horror films. It's an interesting, moving portrait of a man rather than a simplistic monster romp, and it is truly outstanding.If you come to "The Mummy" expecting a typical, fun monster movie you might actually find it a bit hard to sit through. A more open-minded approach may result in appreciation for this less-discussed Universal effort, at the time their best horror talkie.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff: the most menacing man ever to wear a fez</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most of the Universal horrors, "The Mummy" is a slow build that may prove too slow for some viewers, as if it's invoking the shuffling pace of the title character. However, if you stick with it, you'll be treated to another fine shape-shifting performance from Boris Karloff (as long-dead Im-Ho-Tep and his modern resurrection, Ardath Bey), and a story that is a rather interesting divergence from the usual "monster." Unlike Hammer's take on the material, the mummified Karloff is only in one scene, with the rest of the film devoted to his human reincarnation; and the subsequent story, while steeped in Egyptian notions of life, death, and the parallels between these two worlds, is more overwhelmingly devoted to Bey's long-lost love, Anok-en-es-Amon, whom he believes to be inhabiting the person of Helen Grosvner (Zita Johann). Edward van Sloan appears in his requisite role as the wise, van Helsing-styled doctor, and David Manners shows up to provide a (contrived) foil to Karloff's plans. I don't know how much (if any) of "The Mummy" was actually shot in Egypt, but the set design is excellent (per the Universal norm), providing a sense of menace through the viewer's own sense of cultural displacement. This is complemented by Karloff's minimalist performance--Ardath Bey has the looks and stealth of his bandage-wrapped counterpart, but also possesses a sly, understated cunning and manner of speaking that makes the character memorably chilling (dig the glowing eyes, too).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamlike Universal Horror film that benefits from its own imperfections</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1932 Universal Horror film directed by the accomplished cinematographer Karl Freund has a dreamlike quality that cannot be duplicated because not all of its effects were deliberately created. We feel we're dreaming up the film as we watch it partly because of its haunting images?Boris Karloff's glowing eyes; the ancient scenes reflected in the pool; the cross-cutting between Karloff and Zita Johann that establishes their psychic connection?; but also because of the murky plotting that prevents us from feeling we have a firm grasp on what's happening. Two archaeologists dig up the mummy of an Egyptian priest named Imhotep (Karloff) who returns to life when one of them reads an invocation written on a scroll buried with him. Unexpectedly?considering all the subsequent movies with marauding mummies?he rids himself of his bandages and for ten years passes as a polished?if desiccated?gentleman called Ardath Bey. Imhotep meets a young society woman, Helen Grosvenor (Johann), and finds she is the reincarnation of his ancient lover, Princess Anck-es-en-Amon.That all sounds clear enough, but in the viewing things seem a lot vaguer. We're never quite clear how Karloff and Helen become psychically aware of each other; when and how he knows his love has been reincarnated into Helen; what exactly he's trying to do with the Princess's mummy; and so forth. Few of the plot details are presented persuasively. Imhotep's foil, the occult scientist Dr. Muller (Edward Van Sloan), tells the ancient Egyptian he'd like to tear his dried-up body to pieces, but he can't because his power is too great. This scene is lifted from "Dracula" (1931) where Professor Van Helsing (also played by Van Sloan) resists the evil count; yet this time the struggle between an undead creature and a strong-willed mortal seems offhanded."The Mummy" is very nearly a remake of "Dracula." Dracula and Imhotep both want to possess the soul of a woman barely able to resist. Both are gentlemen who pass as mortals within elite society. David Manners plays the juvenile lead in both films?hoping to free his love from the clutches of a monster. Renfield of "Dracula" becomes Ralph Norton (Bramwell Fletcher), the young archaeologist who goes mad. The crucifix that protects against vampires becomes the amulet that (in a much less defined way) protects against mummies.Aside from the beautifully understated performance of Karloff (aided by the inestimable makeup artist, Jack Pierce), no one else is particularly good. Bramwell Fletcher is the most memorable ("He went for a little walk!") Johann has large, exotic eyes and a beautiful face; her acting is sometimes vibrant but mainly awkward. Manners is only slightly less cardboard than in "Dracula." The wonderful Van Sloan has too little to do here."The Mummy" is one of those very imperfect horror movies?like "Carnival of Souls," "Night of the Living Dead" and even "Dracula"?that are better than the "better" ones.</fullReview>

Dr. Muller is played by (Edward Van Sloan), an authority in the occult and discovers Im-Ho-Tep's true identity.

		<fullReview>The Mummy is one of the all-time great horror/supernatural films. It is not the most terrifying movie ever made, nor the most action packed, but it is one of the few films where one can savor the taste of supernatural dread throughout the entire picture. The pace of the movie is perfect - slow and deliberate, with rich and suggestive atmosphere. The ending is excellent and ties together the rest of the film. Clearly, the writer and director knew what they wanted and they got all of it! From the powerful opening scene of terror, the movie shifts into a rather deep look at reincarnation and the price of using supernatural means to an end (lost love in this case). There is horror, and tragedy, and a burning will to live in this picture. Boris Karloff plays an awesome character, Ardath Bey/Imhotep, and wow! what a performance! Karloff has a way of making evil sound so reasonable. And what subtle body movements. Amazing. The girl Helen/Anck-es-en-Amon is the second most important role, and Zita Johann is well cast. She has an otherworldly quality about her looks, you could almost believe she is from another time. There are plenty of memorable moments in the film, such as: The young scientist going insane in shock and horror. His reactions to the very subtle glimpses of the mummy absolutely make that first scene come alive with terror. Great bit of movie making in that scene alone! One of my favorite scenes is in the parlor, when the men-folk burst in on Ardath Bey and Helen. The two of them stare hypnotically into each others eyes, unnaturally close together, the lights out. Creepy! And near the end, when Ardath Bey almost has Helen convinced that being killed and resurrected would be worth love, and suddenly Ardath Bey touches Helen's arm and leaves a dusty, moldy imprint. Helen recoils as she realizes he is offering her only a grim mockery of life. Great bit of filming there! Nicely done. I particularly like how at the end, it is Helen's action which destroys the mummy, not the efforts of the young buck or patriarchal scientist. Hypnotism is the basis for the Ardath Bey's supernatural powers. This sort of occult power was very fashionable from before the turn of the century through the 1930s. I'm sure movie audiences back in the '30s would have been familiar with understanding sorcery in this context. We moderns tend to understand sorcerous powers as superhero powers - Xmen, Spiderman and the like - with emphasis on showy physical effects. Watching the Mummy is a nice change of pace. The camera shots of Ardath Bey's mesmeric eyes are very creepy, very well done. And if he is in a pinch, he reveals his scarab ring, and all who look upon it cringe back for a few moments. Ardath Bey's pool, through which he can project 'evil sendings' out to spy on others and kill them, or look deep into the past, is well-presented as an adjunct to his hypnotic powers. The ancient Egyptian gods (notably Isis) are the perfect counter point to Ardath Bey, who renounced all gods for his obsessive love. Overall, the use of sorcery in this film is understandable, consistent, and subtle - a combination rarely achieved in most movies.For me, the weakest link in the movie is the love story between Helen and Frank. It's important for the film to show a real human love in contrast to Ardath Bey's inhumanly obsessive love, but the portrayal of the connection seemed perfunctory. All in all, a classic horror movie with very few flaws. It delivers an awesome story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Mummy of Them All!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spellbinding. The screenplay admittedly has its fair share of corny dialogue, but it's rousingly invigorating pulp fiction all the same. The plot is so ingenious and so tightly constructed, the flashback sequence advances rather than slows or halts the action. Moreover, the screenwriter has the admirable ability to conjure up a wonderfully moody mystique by his skillful use of names and helpful smattering of Ancient Egyptian lore (Amon-Ra, Im-Ho-Tep, the Scroll of Thoth).Imperilled heroine Zita Johann climbs to superb heights, but some of the other acting seems a bit stagy. Karloff, however, aided by superb make-up, interprets his dual role with magnificently unforgettable power and poise.The art direction is stunning, the photography and other credits equally forceful. Director Karl Freund (taking a brief respite from his usual chores as one of Hollywood's most artistic cameramen) has created a marvelous atmosphere, including at least three or four outstanding set pieces. Haunting my memory as I write, I can see even now the trailing wrappings of the mummy slithering along the floor. Even now, I find myself running through vast halls of the Cairo Museum, frantically searching until, turning an unexpected corner, I see the Impossible kneeling by a flickering candle as he reads the sonorously terriftying words of resurrected death.Who could ever forget such scenes?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great horror film--and nothing like the newer versions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this horror film. Even by today's standards, the makeup for Boris Karloff as the Mummy was perfect. With today's fantastic special effects, it is possible to do BIG and EXCITING special effects, but the subtlety and believability (or at least as close as you'll get for this type of movie) make this a great film. Add to that, excellent acting, a tight script and wonderful cinematography (possibly the best of any of the Universal horror films) and you've got the ingredients for one of the greatest classic horror films.I should point out that almost a decade later, Universal Studios revived the films and created a new Mummy series. These are not related to the Karloff film but are entertaining B-movies. All Mummy movies I've seen that have been made since I found to be lacking--I love the old stuff best. Mostly because the newest films provide lots of special effects but really lack when it comes to story and acting,...and fun!UPDATE: I just watched this film again (5/10) and was amazed with the great Egyptian details. The look of the artifacts were great and the people making this film obviously worked hard to get the look and names right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Who Violate This Tomb -- Well, He'd Better Watch Out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A foolish old archaeologist and his colleagues enter an Ancient Egyptian tomb. They are all in awe. One discovers an ancient scroll -- everything in this story is ancient -- and, while left alone, and despite warnings not to, reads aloud the ancient hieroglyphics. This is a big mistake. It brings to life an ancient mummy in the tomb. The mummy drives the archaeologist nuts and then leaves.The mummy grooms himself properly in caftan and fez and looks exactly like Boris Karloff with make up that has turned his skin into something that resembles a prune or maybe flesh that has been too long under water.Karloff seeks his lost love and finds her in Zita Johann. She's a modern woman, true, but the incarnation of the woman that Karloff died for in Ancient Egypt. She has a nifty figure and the eyes of a panda. He seeks her out and brings her under his spell. It's unclear exactly how he does this because, devoted or not, he still looks a bit prune-like. Worse, Karloff has no sense of humor. He glowers a lot but never smiles. Somebody ought to tell him the one about the two pharaohs who walked into a bar on Purim.I don't know. I've never thought it was as good as the original Frankenstein or Dracula, both also from Universal Studios. It doesn't have much in the way of tag lines, like -- "I never drink -- wine." There aren't a lot of van de Graff generators shooting sparks all over the set. It's a little creepy, a little dull, and a bit slow until the very end when a bronze statue of Isis moves and disintegrates Karloff with her ancient power. The statue of Isis has a nifty figure.Gee, this torpid project was directed by Karl Freund too. He must have passed through it on his way from shooting "Metropolis" to shooting "I Love Lucy."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not quite in the same league as the Frankenstein films and Dracula, having a few scenes that drag and one or two of the dialogue-heavy scenes feeling repetitive, The Mummy is still creepy and very effective even now. The sets are still wonderfully extravagant as are the costumes and the cinematography is stunning. James Dietrich's score is very haunting, the script in general is poetic and the story complete with a superb beginning and ending and of one where Imhotep permits his love to relive her past is interesting. The acting is fine, Edward Van Sloan gives one of his better performances here, while Zita Johann is beautiful and in a unique and stunning way. Stealing the film, in a very powerful and magnetic performance is Boris Karloff. All in all, a very good film, not quite a masterpiece but it is the best Mummy film by far. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mummy / 1933 / Directed by: Karl Freund / Written by: John Balderston* * * * ExcellentCertainly, a masterpiece of the horror genre. Boris Karloff's performance as Im Ho Tep is impressive. He brings a sensitivity, directness and captivating seriousness to the role. The intelligent screenplay stays close to the known facts of ancient Egypt, as known in 1932, while the film showcases some impressive makeup, art direction and cinematography. Makeup is by the legendary genius Jack Pierce, who also did the famous Frankenstein monster makeup for the classic 1931 film. It's really an epic romance, more than a horror film. The most memorable scene occurs near the beginning of the film. The young archaeologist who opens and reads the scroll bringing Im Ho Tep back to live and his response, is genuinely thrilling and frightening. The opening credits of the film indicate the year 1933.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Curse-defying British archaeologists dig up 3,700-year-old Egyptian priest Boris Karloff (as Imhotep, "The Mummy"). BIG mistake. After his ghastly awakening, Mr. Karloff adopts the identity "Ardath Bey". Karloff completes a ten year search for his lost vestal virgin princess "Anck-es-en-Amon" by locating her reincarnation, heavy-lidded half-Egyptian Zita Johann (as Helen Grosvenor). Karloff's attempts to take Ms. Johann as his eternal bride don't sit well with her more Earth-bound boyfriend, David Manners (as Frank Whemple).Karloff, with assistance from make-up designer Jack Pierce, makes "The Mummy" a stunningly creepy classic. The "horror" may be dated, but the thrill of Karloff's dance macabre, along with the gorgeous directorial/photographic work from Karl Freund and Charles Stumar, will be reincarnated for generations to come. James Dietrich's score is perfect. And, Edward Van Sloan (as Dr. Muller) essentially repeats his "Frankenstein" and "Dracula" role. The story is slightly underwhelming, unfortunately. Don't watch to be terrified, but watch for the art of the film. ********* The Mummy (1932) Karl Freund ~ Boris Karloff, Zita Johann, David Manners, Edward Van Sloan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been years since I sat down and watched this movie from start to finish, but whenever it shows on TV, I try to catch the scene where the mummy is first discovered by the archaeologists. One of the archaeologists, an over-eager young man, stays behind in the tomb while his older colleagues leave for a few minutes, and this, for my money, is one of the scariest scenes ever put on film! The young archaeologist unrolls an ancient manuscript which, unbeknownst to him, contains the words which will bring the mummy to life. He reads the words aloud, staring intently at them by candlelight. His voice is a low hum in the eerie tomb, and behind him, we see the mummy slowly, slowly open his eyes. We see his hand break free of its wrappings and fall to his side. The archaeologist continues reading, and then we see the mummy's hand appear on the stone next to him. The young man sees it and screams, then begins laughing hysterically, horribly. His colleagues rush into the cave and find that the mummy has gone, and their young friend has gone completely mad.A truly scary and memorable scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>KARLOFF-the Mummy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That billing said it all. After the success of "Frankenstein" in 1931 Universal Studios had to keep the horror films, their greatest cash cow of the day going. With the fascination of all things Egyptian and the noted (albeit phony) curse surrounding the King Tut excavation this was the obvious next step in horror films. Boris Karloff (AKA Henry Pratt) by now was a sensation and the very obvious choice for the role of Ardath Bey (anagram "death by Ra") and his name alone drew crowds into packed theatres, even during the height of the depression. This film with it's quirky direction by Karl Freund holds up well even today. It is only a shame that several other excellent scenes filmed for the movie were left on the cutting room floor, thanks to the prudery of Will Hays and the Hays office. This film needs to be in the collection of every serious student of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>074: The Mummy (1932) - released 12/22/1932; viewed 7/15/06.Radio City Music Hall opens in New York City.BIRTHS: Little Richard, Don King, Ellen Burstyn.DOUG: The latest entry in the Universal Horror pantheon is 'The Mummy.' Like 'Dracula' and 'Frankenstein,' this film comes on a deluxe DVD with the entire Universal Mummy franchise stuffed onto one disc. Unlike its monstrous predecessors, 'The Mummy' was not based on an existing book or play, though it does borrow a lot from 'Dracula,' including a villain with magic powers who seeks to control an innocent woman to her death (but have no fear, for Edward Van Sloan is here to rescue our characters from the wrath of the monster), and Dracula's cinematographer Karl Freund as director (on the DVD featurette, one historian suggests that it writer John L. Balderston may have written similar films without intending it). Freund takes the trick he used to make Dracula's eyes glow and brings it back here, now refined and perfected, to enhance Boris Karloff's haunting gaze. Many of the same scenes are there, including a pivotal scene where Van Sloan confronts the evil Mummy. The film rests mostly on the shoulders of its star, Boris Karloff, who plays the villainous Im-ho-tep, along with his sinister alter-ego Ardath Bey. Although it's as moody and creepy as its predecessors, this particular Universal classic doesn't really stand up on its own; it feels a lot like 'Dracula: Take 2.' KEVIN: It's hard to imagine the unholy triumvirate of the Universal Monsters before they became Universal. Back when they lived by the descriptions of the authors and the imagination of the readers. Before guys like Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi gave them their iconic faces, and directors like Tod Browning, James Whale and Karl Freund brought them to life on celluloid. It's surprising that a story that is essentially a rip-off of 'Dracula' (re: Edward Van Sloan sort-of reprising his previous role) could still be as scary and visually appealing. Although Karloff's Im-ho-tep is a man who's supposed to be dead, he is shown as a figure of more mystery than outright darkness. Lugosi's Dracula was a being of constant menace just below the surface. And am I glad that Boris Karloff's baritone voice matches his long, chiseled face. All in all, I prefer 'The Mummy' over 'Dracula.' 'Dracula' was moody enough for two films and Lugosi's performance is far more memorable, but to me 'Mummy' was scarier and more exciting, and I found The Mummy's classic close-up to be way more unnerving than Dracula's (I'm sure Karl Freund tried to top himself). Plus, Count Dracula didn't get an origin story. Zita Johann's performance is very good, better than Helen Chandler's in my opinion. Johann's Helen seems to have more personality of her own, where as Chandler's Mina felt more like a tacked-on damsel. The ending was especially cool, more in-your-face and fantastical than the previous horror fare. Though of the three Universal monsters, 'Frankenstein' is the scariest of all.Last film: Sign of the Cross (1932). Next film viewed: The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920). Next film chronologically: Island of Lost Souls (1933).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) After uncovering the archaeological find of the century the valuable and historical unearthed artifacts are safely put away for later shipment to the British Museum. Ignoring a warning on one of the ancient gold boxes, as well as the head of the archaeological expiation Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Byron), that whoever breaks the seal is to be struck down by the Gods young archaeologist Ralph Norton, Bramwel Fletcher, breaks the box open. That releases not only the ancient curse but activates the long dead and buried Mummy Imhotep.Reading the scroll locked inside the box Norton sees the Mummy come alive and is immediately struck mad. The poor and demented Norton ends up mindlessly babbling to a shocked Sir Joseph and his partner Dr. Muller, Edward Von Slone, that the Mummy "just stepped out for a walk"!It's now ten years later and Sir Joesph and his son Frank, David Manners, are back in Egypt on another expedition. It there that they meet this strange looking fellow, who looks like he's been out in the blazing Egyptian sun for too long, Ardath Bey, Boris Karloff. Bey tells Sir Joesph the he found this broken artifact just a stones throw away from the excavation site that has the name of Anck-es-en-Amon, an ancient Egyptian princess, carved on it. Following Bey's instructions Sir Joesph and Frank's workers unearth Anck-es-en-Amon's tomb that lay buried for some 3,700 years right under their noses.It later turns out that Mr. Bey is actually the Mummy Imhotep who was brought back to life ten years ago by ,the later hopelessly insane, Ralph Norton. It also turns out that the long dead and buried Princess Anck-es-en-Amon is really alive and well with her soul reincarnated into the body of the English/Egyptian Cairo party girl Helen Grosvenor, Zita Johann. Anck-es-en-Amon is the virgin Egpitan princess that Bey had been executed for trying to violate back some 3,7000 years ago! Now with both of them alive in other bodies and within a few miles of each other they attempts to rekindle his long lost and tragic love affair with her.With the help of his loyal Nubian servant, Nobal Johnson, Bey gets to work casting his spell on Helen and also Frank who turned out, to Bey's outrage and disgust, to be her boyfriend as well as Frank's father Sir Joesph. Using what looks like a steam bath or Jacuzzi Bey can see, like in a crystal ball, just what everyone he's interested in is doing and is also able to hypnotize, from afar, Helen to come to his secret hideout in downtown Cairo. It's by also using this strange looking contraption, the ancient Egyptian Jacuzzi, Bey is also able to induce a fatal heart-attack on Sir Joesph. This is when Sir. Joseph found out about Bey's evil plans and tried to burn the scroll that brought Bey or Imhotep back to life.Bey after telling Helen the truth about himself in that he violated the ancient and holy Egyptian ordinances attempts to do the same for her by damning her soul in dunking Helen into a vat of boiling embalming fluid where after being embalmed she'll be his soul-mate until the end of time; Bey after waiting 3,700 years for her in a sealed crypt expects that's the least that Helen, or Anck-es-en-Amon, can do for him.It's now a race against the clock as both Frank and Dr. Muller try to get to the Cairo Museum where Bey took Helen to, with the help of the Nubian, introducer her into the Egyptian world of the dead, or underworld, and save her from his evil plan. Unexpectedly they get help from one of the Egyptian Gods who, outraged at what Bey is doing, comes back to life and stops Bey and his attempt to turn Helen into an life after death Egyptian Mummy by turning Bey into a bag of bones.</fullReview>

There is Imhothep in it, and he's trying to resurrect his love from long ago, there isn't a lot of special effects, because hey, this was the 30s right, but somehow, this is a great work of art. And this is one of Boris Karloff's best and memorable performances since Frankenstein, and I'll never forget him as the voice of the Grinch. But he starts out as the classic mummy in bandages, but is brought back to life accidentally and goes on a quest to achieve his goal. It may be black in white, but at least there's speech in it, and a great actor as the Imhothep, man I love that guy.

		<shortDescription>In the shadow of Frankenstein and Dracula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The image of Boris Karloff, awakening in his tomb and draped in bandages, his skin flaky and old, is one of the most iconic in horror history. Alongside Dracula and Frankenstein, The Mummy is one of Universal Studio's biggest hits. Unlike the aforementioned, it is not based on a piece of literature, but was inspired by the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922. Director Karl Freund was hired two days before the start of filming, and this is possibly the reason for the film's problems, with Freund's experience lying primarily in the cinematography department.When the tomb of ancient Egyptian priest Imhotep (Boris Karloff) is discovered by an archaeological expedition, an old script is read out aloud that resurrects his mummified body. Ten years later, the archaeological dig continues, and they are approached by a mysterious man who identifies himself as Ardath Bey, claiming he knows the location of the tomb of Princess Ankh-es-en-amon. Excited by the prospect, they begin to dig, but they are unaware that Bey is the resurrected Imhotep, and is searching for the soul of his lost love. He believes that a young woman named Helen (Zita Johann) is the reincarnation of the long-dead Princess, and wants to steal her soul.Boris Karloff excels here. Although not exactly the most talented of actors, he has the ability to use his sheer colossal presence to get through to the audience. His giant frame and eerie dead eyes pierce the screen, and he overshadows his quite hammy co-stars. There is a reason why Imhotep and his portrayal of Frankenstein's Monster are iconic. Karloff's face is most interesting, and glares out from beneath all the excellent make-up. Thank God, then, for Karloff, as the majority of the film is quite average.Possibly the main negative of the film is the director Karl Freund. A legend of a cinematographer, he is responsible for some giants of cinema such as Fritz Lang's Metropolis, F.W. Murnau's The Last Laugh and Tartuffe, and Carl Dreyer's Michael. He is also uncredited as co- director for Universal's Dracula and well as being cinematographer. The direction seems by-the-number and unspectacular, and while Frankenstein was in the safe hands of James Whale, and Dracula in the hands of Tod Browning, The Mummy seems to suffer from Freund's inexperience. That said, it is enjoyable in the way that most old horror films are. It is short and snappy, and doesn't outstay its welcome, clocking in at a mere 73 minutes. It is also quite silly, and Imhotep's supernatural abilities reveal some glaring plot-holes. But it obviously has it's fans, as it has been re-made and re-imagined countless amounts of times.

I am not sure they knew the great value they had with this film and the fact that they were practically "giving it away". Apparently, today's younger viewers do not appreciate the subtlety and great storytelling that this classic film offers, so the store thought that they had to sell it at a such a low price, in order for anyone to buy it.Well I am sure glad I found it, and have watched it countless times in the past month.The opening scenes when the mummy is resurrected are sure to put a scare into even the most jaded horror viewers, and the hysterical reactions of poor Bramwell Fletcher will send chills up the spine for sure.This film has such as great 'Expressionistic (German) style to it and it is worthy of repeat viewings, for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MORD39 RATING: *** of ****Now, "overrated" can still mean it's GOOD...but not EXCELLENT. The old Universal Classics have always been my meat and potatoes, yet I still cannot come to love this movie. Boris Karloff gives an exceptional understated performance, but the overall effect is still a dull film, even to a 1930's horror nut like me.People tear Lugosi's DRACULA apart for being slow, but I don't get that feeling as acutely as I do when watching THE MUMMY. At least Bela can compensate for the slow moments in DRACULA; here, even Boris can't make THE MUMMY come to life.I must say that the classic opening sequence, despite everything that comes after it, is STILL A SHOCKER! It is literally one of the scariest and most fully realized moments of terror in any horror film from 1900 to 2000. Pity I don't feel the same for the rest of the picture. THE MUMMY stands paces behind FRANKENSTEIN, DRACULA, ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, and KING KONG as a superior work of the thirties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boris Karloff is magnificently mysterious and understated in his role here as Imhotep, a frail mummy thousands of years old who emerges from his wrappings in a more human personage and sets out to possess a modern woman who he believes to be the reincarnated form of the ancient princess he once loved. This is a classic from Universal Studios, who gave us "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". It's a dreamy love story blanketed in weirdness and mystery first and foremost, and a horror film second. The opening sequence, which I shall not spoil here, is highly notable in that it chills to the bone and still holds up powerfully even today, almost 80 years after it was shot. On a personal level, I am mostly respectful of this film for Boris' commanding performance; it is not one of my special favorites and, like the Lugosi "Dracula", can sometimes be a little creaky. I tend to prefer watching one of Universal's mummy movies from the 1940's, but there is no denying Karloff's presence here. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Undying Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the triumvirate of classic Universal horror movies from the early 30s, The Mummy is probably the weakest of the three. The story is inspired by the Tutankhamen expedition of the 1920s, and its story is predictable, if only because its basic structure has been copied so many times.A British archaeological expedition to Egypt is on the point of returning home empty-handed when a tall gent with a natty fez and a skin condition points out the final resting place of an ancient Egyptian princess. What the grateful Brits don't realise is that their mysterious informant is actually the boyfriend of said queen, resurrected ten years earlier by a hapless archaeological student who read out loud from a cursed scroll. 'He went for a little walk!' the poor chap cackles before being carted off to the lunatic asylum to die in a straitjacket.In a coincidence that happens only in Hollywood films of the 30s, the reincarnation of the princess just happens to be living around the corner and falls under the spell of the lugubrious Karloff, who intends to transplant his beloved's soul into the young lady's body.The best thing about The Mummy has to be Karloff's make-up which still looks highly impressive today. The story itself, although only 70 minutes long, is told without any real attempt at tension or horror, relying more on an atmosphere that simply refuses to materialise - other than in the film's one classic creepy scene in which the Mummy comes to life. Karloff's Ardath Bey is a semi-sympathetic character who just wants to hook up with his girlfriend, and you've got to admire the guy's persistence. Sadly, his girlfriend is reincarnated in the form of Broadway diva Zita Johann, owner of a pleasingly rounded belly and a healthy contempt for movie-making that shines through in far too many scenes. She and Freund apparently waged a war of attrition throughout the shoot, and such antagonism is probably always going to leak through to the final print.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is weird, first we have in front of the only one of the classic monsters who do not necessarily apply the word "monster" to describe it as such, because we only see the mummy in its original and monstrous form the first 5 or 7 minutes of the film, and nor is the most terrifying and murderers. For me the importance of this film lies not so much on what happens during the story but in the idea of the same, its premise, which I must say that is really original, and the interpretation of Karloff whose gaze is really frightening in the close-ups. But from then on, this movie falls into the errors that most of the films of the genre produced by Universal, everything is solved very quickly and the end doesn't have a climax, although here we must applaud the fact that the hero is not so hero and is much more important the role of the lady, on the other hand there are several secondary interpretations that hinder the development of story and this provokes that at some times the story turns monotonous and slow to move after a very good start. In short film is a regular one, with an excellent player and a very creative and original premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs more mouldy mummy action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the death of his lover Princess Anck-es-en-Amon, Egyptian high priest Im-Ho-Tep (Boris Karloff) breaks the law of his people by stealing the forbidden Scroll of Thoth, which has the power to give life to the dead. He is punished for this act by being buried alive, along with the scroll.Universal Studios' The Mummy begins 3700 years after this terrible event, with an atmospheric sequence that sees the bandage-wrapped remains of the now crumbly high-priest accidentally brought back to life by an archaeologist, who unwisely opts to ignore an ancient Egyptian curse. As the archaeologist continues his work, the grotesque dessicated corpse of Im-Ho-Tep slowly opens one eye, unfolds its arms, and shuffles from its sarcophagus... It's a great opening?very atmospheric, with a truly memorable 'monster'?which only makes it all the more disappointing when the rest of the film proves to be nowhere near as impressive.For starters, that's all we get to enjoy of the mouldy Im-Ho-Tep, for the next time we see Karloff, he has miraculously regenerated himself, the only giveaway that he's not quite 'human' being a slightly wrinkled complexion and occasionally glowing eyes; furthermore, the plot is very derivative (the works of H.Rider Haggard, Bram Stoker and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are all influences)?a rather dull tale of obsessive love across the millennia, which sees Im-Ho-Tep (now masquerading as Egyptian Ardeth Bay) locating Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann), the modern day reincarnation of his princess, and stealing her from charmless archaeologist Frank Whemple (David Manners). Some say that director Karl Freund's treatment of the story has a magical, dream-like quality; I say it drags more than a mummy's foot.I've got to admit that, as a fan of more exploitative material, I enjoyed the brief gory execution of Nubian slaves during a nifty D.W. Griffiths style flash-back sequence, and Johann looks hot in her sexy Egyptian garb at the end of the film, but overall, The Mummy was far too restrained for my liking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Performance By Karloff In An Otherwise Strangely Mundane Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it hard to even categorize this as one of the "classic horror films" of the 1930's for one very simple reason - I just didn't find it particularly frightening. Even something in the atmosphere was, to me at least, lacking. Frankly speaking, blessed with a fantastic performance from Boris Karloff as Imhotep the revived Egyptian mummy, this should have blown me away, and yet I just found it lacking. Karloff portrayed Imhotep in a completely appropriate, other-worldly and quite emotionless manner, but the rest of the cast frankly seemed to follow his emotionless lead. No one seemed particularly frightened by Imhotep (or Ardath Bey as he called himself in the "modern" world), with the exception of Professor Pearson (Leonard Mudie), who encountered the just revived 3700 year old mummy in the tomb and went insane. Otherwise, even though it's clear about halfway through the film that at least Dr. Muller (Edward Van Sloan) knows who Ardath Bey is (and the rest are starting to believe him) no one seems frightened in the way I would expect them to be, given the circumstances. Even the budding romance between Frank Whemple (David Manners) and Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann) seemed forced and artificial.The story had some potential (a lot actually) but to me it doesn't rank with the great horror stories of the era. It borrows heavily in some ways from 1931's "Dracula." Both monsters have come back from the dead, and the movies have somewhat similar plots - in "Dracula," of course, the evil Count wants to take a girl's life by trying to take her blood; here, Imhotep seeks Helen's life by trying to take her soul. Similarities also include part of the musical score and a couple of cast members - Van Sloan (whose Dr. Muller in this movie is very similar to Dr. Van Helsing in "Dracula") and Manners - but this doesn't come anywhere near the level of the previous year's classic. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow and not that scary original mummy movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 5/21/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Karl Freund): Slow and not that scary original mummy movie with Boris Karloff did not impress me much. This is supposedly one of the great Universal monsters but it's not really very scary and the mummy's supernatural powers are the only real reason to be scared by Karloff's character. The movie begins as an archaeologist finds a mummy with a secret box that has an inscription that whoever opens it opens a curse. Of course, someone does, and Boris escapes. Ten years later he's reestablished himself in the area and assists a couple of other archaeologist's trying to find a princesses tomb. His whole intention is to re-awaken this princess and he tries to do so through hypnotizing a lady that is supposedly in the same family. Karloff is zombie-like in his characterization(which is, I guess, how they wanted him to be) but the real problem is the slow story and the uncompelling secondary characters as well as the direction of the movie. They overuse one scary shot of Karloff 4 times!! It's seems Universal would give them a little more money to not have to do this, but I guess not. It's really amazing that this movie spawned 4 sequels. I guess it was popular to the original movie audiences but to me the film doesn't stand up to time very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to the other Universal Monster Movies I have recently seen, this one comes as a major disappointment. Frankenstein and Dracula were brilliant and scary horror films, this really wasn't that scary and the acting was very bad. The special effects were great, though, as was the lighting and the directing. Boris Karloff is great (the only decent actor out of the lot) as Imhotep, the Mummy trying to reunite with his long lost love Princess Anck-es-en-Amon (Zita Johann). I found that this film dragged in places but overall, it wasn't all bad. It's definitely a must see classic.3/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The motion picture industry makes a mistake when these films are not properly restored, cared for,and ultimately placed on DVD.This is a film that is worthy of a classic status and if not to suggest otherwise it is worth watching even to this very day.The film in case the reader is not aware of is about an expedition underwritten by English institutions in which there is made a very real,even extraordinary find of the Tomb of I'm-Ho-Tep.However,in this well done movie we are shown a development that is frightening and even supra natural.A Mummy,portrayed by Boris Karloff somehow is restored and actually leaves his tomb which prompts hysteria to occur to one of the students as this being moves off into the Egyptian desert.It is quite an impossible idea however it is not forgotten and within the next 90 minutes of the film we are introduced to The Mummy.A tale that has the ability to frighten the young at heart to such an extent that you might have a hard time with it as such.The interesting note here is though we are or so it would seem to suggest drawn into this film it provides very excellent atmospheric quality as a Black and White film.There is a spacial quality that perhaps not having seen this film in so many years allows for,both the time and space from when this film was first marketed give a dated appeal,a timeless quality.It is not to suggest romance but indeed we are looking at a notion of the mystery of life.This was one of the intimidating prospects that witnessing the bringing back to life,of a once dead mummy some 3700 years old.The young at heart may or may not be able to know better the world than we were able, but to me this means more than one thing.The problem and as well the solution is that this is a motion picture and is not as such much more than that.The film provides an ability to know that there was early thought as to the origin of life on the Earth having occurred in Egypt however even as I am writing this Iam aware of a recent article in the New York Times stating of the discovery of the oldest living proof of the human being to that being in Africa.The Egyptian civilization which even preceded the Greeks provided for a wealth of knowledge which is something this film is good at suggesting.The ritual and the Gods of this particular culture allowed for the embalming of the dead so as to preserve them for what was suppose to be a journey to another place.(or something like that)There is also the attempt made by this discovery to return to his natural resting place but with one exception it wishes to take back with him his lover whom he was mummified as a result of loving in the first place.The story line has it that when the Princess,his lover dies,he tries to save her from the world of the dead by using ancient scrolls that were protected by the Gods of the underworld and the Egyptian culture and in his attempt to do that violated sacred law and as a result was buried alive and was cursed by all whomever his spirit was ever to witness again.This part of the film provides for an eerie even frightening series of events as even the slaves that carried his casket into the tomb were killed so as to not ever know where he was laid to rest. The film allows for the mistaken identity to occur as the mummy seems to have spiritual powers that overcome our ability to protect our selves from its power.This woman, played by Zita Johann finds that she is virtually walking in a trance while under its power and it is suggested that she is to be used as a sacrifice so as to allow Karas to return to the side of his beloved princess for whom his life was forever cursed by Egypt at that point in time.Exactly how all this is to occur is in fact not entirely clear however it is the idea of possession and of being under the influence of this powerful monster that provide the mystery and the suspense to this unfolding science fiction classic.It is a mysterious and dark underpinning that allows for some of the more intimidating prospects that this film provides for however it is not to be because in fact it is not true.It is science fiction and those who wish to dispel the evil that such a curse may provide for should know that and know more, so both knowledge and how these films are made are better recognized.This is really to suggest that these films are very good even great in there class and indeed earn the distinction as a science fiction classic.The 7 is represented of the passing of time however dated it is worth watching even if only once in awhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I was hoping.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mummy starts in Egypt during the year 1922 where British archaeologist Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Byron) &amp; his assistant have made a major discovery in the desert, a mummy (Boris Karloff) &amp; a casket that has warnings written on it not to open it. Despite this &amp; against the wishes of Dr. Muller (Edward Van Sloan), an expert on the Egyptian occult, Joseph's assistant opens it &amp; starts to translate the 'Scroll of Toth' he finds inside. The mummy then comes to life &amp; takes the scroll... Jump forward 10 years later &amp; Joseph's son Frank (David Manners) is now in charge of things in Egypt, he is about to pack up &amp; go home when a man named Ardath Bey (Karloff again) says he can point him in the right direction of the undiscovered tomb of Princess Anckesen-Amon. It's an offer Frank can't refuse &amp; he uncovers the tomb &amp; takes Anckesen-Amon's mummy back to a Cairo museum, however Frank is unaware that Bey is using him in a a sinister plot to attempt to re-incarnate his long lost love, Bey needs a new body &amp; Frank's girlfriend Helen (Zita Johann) will do nicely...Directed by Karl Freund I have to admit disappointment after watching The Mummy which is supposedly the 'classic' version. The script by John L. Balderston starts off pretty well with a nice sequence of the mummy coming to life but this is the only time you see him in the traditional bandages, throughout the rest of the film he's just an old guy with lots of wrinkles. I am positive that the image of Karloff wrapped in bandages is played upon in it's marketing (in fact if you look at the DVD cover on the IMDb's page it has Karloff in his bandages) &amp; I was just hoping to see him in the traditional get-up throughout the film. To be fair according to the IMDb it was originally called 'Cagliostro' &amp; was changed to The Mummy just before it's release so I'd imagine the filmmakers weren't planning on having the mummy as a central character but after the success of Frankenstein they probably wanted to cash-in on Karloff's fame &amp; play up his appearance as another monster. At only 70 odd minutes it moves along at a reasonable pace although it can get a bit dull during the middle, the character's are OK as is the dialogue but there's nothing that memorable here. I haven't seen them all but I think The Mummy is the weakest of the classic black and white Universal horrors that I have, it's still a decent film &amp; worth watching but in my opinion it's far from the 10 out of 10 classic that many would have you believe.Director Freund does a good job, there's a fair amount of atmosphere here although most of the horror in The Mummy is of the supernatural variety rather than the physical. Having said that none of it's really that memorable or stands out. The sets are decent &amp; the special effects are as well, apparently it took 8 hours for Karloff's make-up to be applied.With a supposed budget of about $196,000 The Mummy is well made with good production design. The acting was OK, I didn't think it was anything special but it was OK &amp; obviously Karloff stands out as being head &amp; shoulders above the rest of the cast.The Mummy was a disappointment for me, sad to say but I felt sort of cheated. I found The Mummy to be a decent watch but the solid 100% gold classic that many make out? I don't think so, I really don't. Watch Karloff in Frankenstein again. Followed by four sequels, The Mummy's Hand (1940), The Mummy's Tomb (1942), The Mummy's Ghost (1944) &amp; The Mummy's Curse (1944) none of which Karloff appeared in while it was remade by Universal as The Mummy (1999).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even when miscast, Karloff's talent still shines.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most of the other classic horror films of this time, this was already a remake in 1932, yet is thought of as the "original." While it is not the original, this movie helped clearly define what constitutes horror as we now know it.I always wondered why they cast Karloff as the Mummy. His performance was no less than one of the creepiest performances on film, however, he has just always seemed out of place in this role. He felt to me, more like the assistant to the Mummy than the actual Mummy himself, but that in no way takes away from the wonderful performances in this production. If you enjoyed the newest remake starring Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weiss, then by all means, check out this 1932 black and white production of that movie. You will see the variances but you will also see the many faithful elements carried over to the newer enterprise. While they did take a classic hammer horror and make it into this wonderful epic adventure, thereby lessening the element of horror, they still did a pretty good job in telling the story simply told in this darksome 30's classic.While it is a classic, and belongs with the classics of this genre, I liked the newest remake better. I can't say that about any of the other classics, but this one was better told in the new millennium.It still rates a 6.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welllll... it's better than the remake I suppose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Musty, dusty, ancient and stiff, stumbling from the grave to terrorise the unwary... and that's just the movie. A dated, slow-paced showcase for amateur dramatics, 'The Mummy' bores from beginning to end, and even at only seventy minutes runs about an hour too long. The eerie theme music over the credits is the only mildly interesting thing the movie has to offer - because the mummy comes to life, folks, but the film never does.The 'story' starts when archaeologists dig up the mummy of Imhotep (Boris Karloff), buried alive 3,700 years earlier for falling in love with a princess. Understandably none too happy with this, Imhotep comes to life and makes a shuffle for it, turning up again ten years later to use his hypnotic powers on Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann), a young woman who's the reincarnation of his beloved from all those years ago. Or, to put it more accurately, he does bog all for the next hour.Some people think that this movie is a horror classic ? no, seriously, they do! I have no idea why. The acting is laughable and couldn't be more stilted if the cast were literally on stilts. Only their mouths move, like in those half-assed cartoons from the Seventies. Just look at their amazement at finding out that the mummy has come to life... astonishing, the way they register no reaction whatsoever. Karloff, wasted yet again in a role with barely any dialogue, none of which is any good, is the only one who makes this worth watching.The screenplay is hopelessly melodramatic, but it's hard to see why the writers bothered when the acting's so listless. The pace isn't much better: this thing moves along like a-- well, it barely moves along. It's as though the film makers were aware they had barely enough story to fill a short and padded it out with as much dead air as possible; we also have such time wasters as a redundant prologue and the subtle device of Imhotep's handy flashback pond, which shows him being buried alive, something we've already heard about and don't really need to be shown. Just to clarify: this movie isn't rubbish because it's old. It's rubbish because it's rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This all starts out during a 1921 Egyptian expedition. They're unearthed a mummy and accidentally revive him. We never see the mummy ourselves--just the reaction of a man (Bramwell Fletcher) who ends up insane--laughing hysterically. It then cuts to another expedition in 1932. Mysterious Ardeth Bay (Boris Karloff--who is obviously the mummy) gets involved with expedition and discovers a woman (Zita Johann) who is the reincarnation of his dead wife. He plans to kill her so she can be with him forever--but David Manners and Edward Van Sloan try to stop him.It has a GREAT opening (Fletchers laugh is frightening and NOT showing the mummy works beautifully) but then falls apart. The movie moves VERY slowly with unexplained gaps in the plot (where exactly was the mummy for 11 years?) and some ridiculous circumstances (Manners and Johann fall in love immediately).The film is beautifully directed however and there's some good acting--Karloff is great (as always) and Van Sloan (basically playing the Van Helsing role he had in "Dracula") is good. Johann is just OK but Manners is terrible. He was a good actor when given something to work with--but he's got nothing here. He's tall, VERY handsome--and a total blank. Hard to blame him though--the script gives him no characterization and his instant infatuation with Johann is just ridiculous. Also we never see Karloff as the mummy (not that mummies are scary to begin with).So, aside from the eerie opening sequence, this is a very slow and pretty dull horror movie. I remember hating this as a kid too. I give it a 4 for Karloff, the opening and some nice directing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge classic film fan and this year for Halloween I got the opportunity to see the original Universal classics The Wolf Man and The Mummy. Really enjoyed The Wolf Man but was surprised that The Mummy failed to impress me on several levels. It absolutely felt dated and aged (understandably) but some classic films hold up much better than this. Universal did many of these films on a shoe string budget but this one just feels rushed and slapped together with very, very little character development, purpose or plot. There are a few (very few) impressive scenes but otherwise the special effects are average at best even for the time period. Perhaps the thing that makes the film the least impressive is the acting. With the exception of Karloff himself as The Mummy, everyone else is excruciatingly awful and cheesy. I get the entire concept of these classic monster films is campy quality but this takes it to a new level. I find it hard to believe some of these actors did anything else but this level of sheer cheese. Anything I say about a film that is considered a classic and has been around for 80 years is pointless but for me...I was left uninspired and unimpressed.I think the reason Boris Karloff is considered a legend of horror is because he really does take these roles seriously. He made you feel deep emotional connection to Frankenstein's Monster and he makes Imhotep believable in the most ridiculous of circumstances. Karloff is a method actor and he invests himself and it shows. He might be the sole reason to watch this. Zita Johann is beyond laughable. She is melodramatic, over the top, absolutely zany and ridiculous. More than anything I couldn't help but laugh at every line she delivers in the film. Honestly, her performance drags this film down significantly being that her character is vital to the already weak story. Not to be outdone David Manners is not much better. I'm not sure if they were directed to be as cheesy as humanly possible but they certainly are. The two of them have no chemistry with each other or on screen and they're interaction with the far superior Karloff makes them look even more ridiculous. Arthur Byron and Edward Van Sloan round out the supporting cast and they're okay, somewhere between the cheesy and the more serious but neither of them make much of an impression.Director Karl Freund was considered revolutionary in the field of direction and photography. Rumoredly he was also a monster to work with. He may have revolutionized camera work on sitcoms but The Mummy doesn't demonstrate any major talent with this film. The best thing I can say is that it appears he uses miniatures for some of the outdoor Egyptian scenes and that is impressive for its time. I have now seen many of the Universal Monster films in the last couple of years and The Mummy was the least of these. It just didn't feel like the same amount of work went into it. It is a classic and I suppose everyone should see it but be prepared to be unimpressed especially compared to other similar films in the same era. 5/10</fullReview>

There is a redeeming factor however. Karloff. What a great performance he gives here. Much better than Frankenstein's monster. If you're a fan of Boris Karloff, definitely don't miss this one. but other than that, i wouldn't recommend it. If you just want the story, Hammer did a great remake of this. Even the 1999 version will at least hold your attention. Other than fans of Karloff or chillers, give this one a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Universal Horror "Classic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Universal horror movies of the early 1930s may have been the final word on screen horror at the time, but some of them are so creaky as to be nearly unwatchable today.James Whale knew how to make the most of low budgets, and his unique vision and morbid sense of humour made something truly memorable of his "Frankenstein" (1931) and "The Old Dark House" (1932). But "Dracula" (1931), directed by Tod Browning, and "The Mummy" (1932), directed by cinematographer Karl Freund, are simply terrible, despite everyone's attempts to remember them as horror classics."Dracula" at least had a spooky sense of atmosphere, especially the opening scenes in Dracula's castle and surrounding countryside. "The Mummy" starts off promisingly enough; there's a chiller of an opening sequence showing Boris Karloff's monster coming to life. But after the story has moved forward in time some ten years, any hopes for an effective, creepy monster movie are doused. No one told me that after waking from the dead, the mummy would don a robe and fez and walk around speaking in a refined British accent! That considerably undermines any frights he may be able to induce. When this mummy wants entry into someone's house, he doesn't come bashing through a wall or creeping through shadowy corridors in the dead of night -- oh no, he rings the doorbell and waits to be admitted like the pizza delivery guy. And Karloff's high-pitched, soft line deliveries, not to mention his slight lisp, don't help matters.This movie is fun to see once for its historical value. Alas, I'm afraid that's all it has to offer.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mummy, The (1932) ** 1/2 (out of 4) An expedition to Egypt unearths the tomb of a mummy (Boris Karloff) who eventually shows up as a prince in search of his long lost love who he believes is a young woman (Zita Johann) in modern times. There's a lot to enjoy in this film but it's never been a favorite of mine as I find the movie was too slow and the 72-minute running time seems double due to the pacing. Freund was a masterful cameraman but his directing skills left a lot to be desired (as you can definitely see in GIFT OF GAB). The entire movie has a beautiful look and Kreund is able to capture a nice atmosphere but in the end all of it is wasted. The biggest reason to view this movie is the wonderful performance by Karloff who, as the mummy or as Ardath Bey, is pitch perfect. The way Karloff pays the role once again, as with Frankenstein's monster, makes for chills as well as a bit of sympathy. Zita Johann is also pretty good in the movie as is Edward Van Sloan and Arthur Byron. David Manners doesn't come off as good here but the screenplay could probably be blamed for some of this. Some attack this horror film for featuring Karloff as the mummy yet only having him in character for a total of a couple minutes. This use to disappoint me but it's just something we have to put up with. You can only judge what you have and what we get here is Karloff not in make up too much. I do have to wonder what Jack Pierce thought about creating this great work and then it not being shown too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mummy was the first of the classic Universal horrors that I've seen, and I was impressed by its willingness to experiment. It was a daring move to make a horror film that isn't scary, atmospheric or even interesting. With a running time of just seventy minutes, it somehow manages to be overlong - another commendable innovation.The opening scene, set ten years before the rest of the movie, was great, but by about halfway I began to realise that the set-up was better than the pay-off. I was really, really disappointed, though I'll still work my way through the rest of the classics, if only to make fun of them.As disappointing as it was, it was still more impressive than the limp Brendan Fraser remake, which somehow managed to be less scary, less atmospheric, and less interesting, with an even bigger running time to punish the audience further.</fullReview>

After a lame sequence showing a man gone insane at the sight of Imhotep, a simple newspaper headline is supposed to explain to us that it is now 10 years later.For some strange reason, Imhopted now looks relatively human, and now living as a rich man in an Egyptian city. Don't ask me, I'm still trying to figure that one out! He then proceeds to look for the incarnation of his long lost love, who conviently lives in the same city. One day, he just happens to run into her(beyond lame!). Anyone who gets in the way dies by the power of Imhotep! Well, exactly what this power is(unlike the powerhouse played by Arnold Vosloo,this Imhoptep appears to be very frail), or why he even has powers is never explained. Combine inconsistancies, with poor acting, and unintentional humor, and you have a pathetic farce that is hardly a classic. And, before anyone becomes defensive about the film's age, I only have to mention to movies. Both Univerals "Dracula" and "Frankenstien" prove that movies from this time era could be MUCH better than this boring waste of time! And speaking of "Frankenstien", Boris Karloff should have been ashamed of himself for making such a good movie, then following up with such a bad one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I decided I should watch the original version of this movie as people are always saying the originals are always better than re-makes - well in this case they are wrong, this movie is a real shocker in so many ways that there is not enough space here to name them all.Firstly, the acting is atrocious and I cannot see how anyone could find themselves scared by it, unless of course they are a student of acting then it surely could be the stuff of their worst nightmares!Secondly, the plot is thinner than a Kleenex and so un-original even for a movie of this age.I am sure at the time the special effects seemed good, and certainly they tried their best here, but I would advise anyone who has not seen this movie, not to bother unless you're really desperate, as it's a tragic waste of 70 minutes of your life.Two thumbs down!!</fullReview>
