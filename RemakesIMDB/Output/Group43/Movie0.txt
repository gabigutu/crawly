		<shortDescription>It was an honor to cry at such a fine film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best football films ever made. Yes, it's not that long, but it is great. Billy Dee Williams and James Caan were just starting out their careers and TV movies were still fairly new. This is a story of two opposites, one who was shy and kept to himself and the other who was cocky and confident. There would eventually see past their differences and become the best of friends. I like the chemistry that Williams and Caan had in this film. They made you belive they were Sayers and Pic. What was the part that made me cry? It was the scene where Gale has to tell the team before a game that Brian has cancer. Even if I have to force it, I love to cry at that scene. It's the best part of the film. The musical score is also great. The theme has a tone to it I can't describe. I tried watching the remake when it came out, and couldn't make it through the first 15 minutes. It was Disneytized for my viewing displeasure. In my heart, Williams and Caan will always be Sayers and Pic. No doubt about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In times of racial trouble, inner family strife, and complete distrust of your fellow man, this movie showed what the world would really be like if people got rid of "oneupmanship" and lived life for life itself.I HIGHLY recommend the original version (1971)The acting was not campy, there was nothing to be really showy about, the football clips were some of the best ever incorporated (they actually became part of the plot), and other male leads were extremely believable in their roles.The females weren't too bad, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I did. Anyone who doesn't the first (and probably second) time they see it is not human. The film does a fantastic job of establishing a strong bond between the two lead characters, played by James Caan and Billy Dee Williams. Then, at the end, when Billy Dee says "I love Brian Piccolo..." I lost it! Blubbering! This is one outstanding film. If you decide to watch it, have your tissues handy towards the end!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The TV show "Just Shoot Me" once had a sub-plot involving the primary male characters being drawn to watching BRIAN'S SONG...and dissolving into tears by the conclusion--as well as commenting on why "men don't cry", although they should. The use of the movie is a brilliant move, as this truly is the ultimate Guy Picture, and worthy of its unofficial recognition as the greatest television movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just love this movie! It is a story of 2 men--Gale and Brian...2 unlikely people to become the best of friends...The actors were well cast--James Caan and Billy Dee Sayers fit their roles to a tee. It is a film not only of friendship but also of love...a film of triumph of the human spirit. It is a story that transcends time and overcomes barriers to relationships, whatever they might be--racial, religious, or political. It challenges the viewer to assess his/her own prejudices and why it must be overcome. It is as timely as it was when it was first shown. A real winner but be prepared with a box of Kleenex when watching this very touching film. I saw a remake of this film quite recently but I think the original movie was much better than the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still remember sitting down with my family to watch "Brian's Song", the made for TV movie in 1971. I was 13 years of age, and my 3 brothers and I thought we were going to watch a sports movie. It's funny thinking back to that night, as all the brothers fought back tears during the final scenes. We jumped up at the end, and tried to act macho and pretended we all had colds and runny noses. Watching the movie today, it doesn't have quite the same impact, but it remains touching and dramatic. James Caan and Billy D Williams work well together. They act without any arrogance and tough-guy attributes they picked up later in their careers. The movie score wraps around the scenes to add to the poignancy without disrupting the mood. Shelly Fabarase is the perfect wife. It is a touching tribute to a ordinary football player, Brian Piccolo, who lead a extraordinary life. A updated version of "Brian's Song" attempted to capture the magic of 1971's version, but as is usually the case, the attempt falls short of the goal. The original does the best at mourning Piccolo's death, but most importantly, celebrating his life. It is a touchdown!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second Best TV movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only Steven Spielberg's "Duel" is a better TV movie than this movie. Brian's Song proves that real men can cry! When my friends and I discuss this movie, each one of us has admitted that we cried during its three dramatic scenes. The one that does it for me, is when Billy Dee Williams' character Gale Salyers has to tell his teammates that James Caan's character, Brian Piccolo has cancer. You can almost sense that the two actors bonded during this film. The inter-mixing of NFL Films footage of both players works to the understanding the relationship they had. Possibly the best football and buddy flick of all time. Outstanding performances from all the actors. Watch it with someone you love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie broke my heart....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the book this movie was based on 'I Am Third' by Gale Sayers before there even was a movie. I was inspired by the friendship of the two players. The book lightly touched on the death of Brian Piccolo. When the TV movie came on I told my sisters about him and we sat down in my room to watch the movie. By the end of the movie,we were all crying. My younger brother went running out to the living room to tell my mom someone must have died because we were all crying.Well, the next time it was on I sat w/my mom to watch it. She had the same reaction.If that wasn't enough sadness, I bought the book 'A Short Season' by Brian Piccolo and another author. I read it most of the day. I was gettiing ready for a date and I was early. I decided to read the end of the book. If you thought the movie was sad, the book broke my heart!! I cried so hard there was black mascara all over my face. I was still sobbing when my date came to the door. Naturally, I had to redo my makeup.James Caan (who did not resemble Brian at all) did a wonderful job of capturing his spirit. Billy Dee Williams was wonderful as Gale Sayers. The portrayed the guys friendship so well.It's too bad we all can't know a friend like these two had!Watch the original movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That being said, this is most definitely NOT a TV movie in the standard overacted, overly cheesy, ridiculous sense. I love this movie. Billy Dee Williams (Sayers) and James Caan (Piccolo) give the exact right emotional level to their parts, and it brings the rest of the cast into the story. I found myself laughing, hurting, and crying at various times throughout this movie. I do agree with the previous reviewer that if you can watch Sayers' speech upon winning the George Halas "Most Courageous Player" award without tearing up (or, more accurately, blubbering like a buffoon), you're probably not human.DO NOT watch the remake - it was horrible. This movie, however, is a 9/10.</fullReview>

James Caan and Billy Dee Williams are perfect as the two teammates who become friends and then even more. You WILL tear up and get a lump in your throat during the "I love Brian Piccolo" speech.

		<fullReview>With the exception of "Jesus of Nazareth", this was without a doubt one of the best made for Television films ever made. It was the story of two Chicago Bears Football players, one black and the other white, who become close friends and room mates until cancer claims the life of one of them.  James Caan and Billy Dee Williams give splendid performances as did the rest of the supporting cast. The final scene when Piccolo is dying bring tears to my eyes every time I watch the film (I've seen it at least ten times.) It's an unforgettable story of courage and true friendship. This is one film that should be in everyones library. A joy from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Brian's Song", the 1971 version was the rarest of things, an excellent TV movie. Great cast of stars on their way up such as Billy Dee Williams, James Caan and Shelley Fabares, augmented by Jack Warden, Bernie Casey and David Huddleston, with several actual Chicago Bears. This movie is full of actual conversations between the players, who are real people with prejudices and human weaknesses. Yes, those are racial stereotypes and epithets, just like were used in that time, not the sanitized, soulless P C drivel of this day. The story is powerful, the friendship that builds between two men about as different as Americans can be. James Caan is Brian Piccolo, the overachieving, loudmouthed Italian boy. Billy Dee Williams is Gale Sayers, a gifted, shy African-American All-American, high profile running back who is pestered and ridiculed by Brian in the early stages of the story, but who becomes the ideal friend. Jack Warden portrays coach George Halas. Bernie Casey is the savvy and practical veteran player, J. C. Caroline, one of the Bears who mentors young Black players in the NFL/Bears way. As Brian and Gale help each other through training camp, injuries and ultimately death, the actors mesh perfectly, conveying the joy, excitement,camaraderie, practical jokes, triumphs and tragedies of life in the spotlight. Don't miss this movie, it has humor, sports, romance, dedication, vintage football clips and an inspiring message. Don't confuse this 1971 version with the weak remake. An unquestionable 10 that will be enjoyed by just about everyone, football fan or not. An added bonus is the great score. Buzz Kulik did a great job directing this movie, getting fine performances out of not only the real actors, but also the real Bears players and coaches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could you not cry watching this film. I read the paperback to this movie when I was 11 years old, than watched the movie later that year in 1971. This movie made me learn that young people die also. I had never known anyone who died when I was 11 so this was a learning experience. I never did see the remake of this movie, thank god for that, I bet it stunk. My only wish was that they should have made it longer than it was. Brian Piccolo was an outstanding person, not the most gifted ball player but talented enough. Also liked the way they made Piccolo sing his college school song. They loved to pick on the rookies. I rated it a 10 on the story and James Caan's performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is quite simply unforgettable. This is like "Beaches" for guys. That is to say that it's one of the only films I have ever come across that men have no problem admitting that they cried to. I'm talking about every guy I have ever talked to about this movie. That's not to say it's a guy flick-women will love it too. It just seems to have a strange effect on men.The film tells the true story of two football players, Gale Sathers and Brian Picola and the struggles they must face as the first Black and White roomates in professional sports.That alone would be interesting enough, as the first half of the movie proves, but there's more to this story than that. I don't want to give anything away so I will wrap up by saying that both James Caan and Billy de Williams are exceptional in this film and I would highly recomend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course it's 70ish and schmoopy and over-the-top with sentiment...it wouldn't be the sweet movie it is if it wasn't all those things. I just watched this film as a jaded 45 year old, having first watched it (a year after my best friend's death at the age of 9) when I was a little girl. This film helped me deal with my own grief. It stands out as one of the very few "made for TV" movies of the period that I still think of fondly...and the viewing of it shows that it primarily holds up to the test of time. It still is a thing of integrity and a sweet if less complicated (in a good way) paean to the essential qualities of humanity on the way to friendship. Like someone else said, I dare ya not to cry during the "I love Brian Piccolo speech".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say that I am not a football fan. I hate it. It is a boring, slow and incomprehensible game in which guys run around patting each other on the butt. Brian's Song is not a football movie. It is a movie about decency and honor and dreams. Thirty two years and a big budget remake have not dimmed the luster of this profound and touching movie. We often make fun of the quality of television productions. Brian's Song is as fine a movie as any ever made with big budgets and big stars.I don't think anyone can watch Brian's Song without feeling something touch their soul. James Caan as Brian Piccolo and Billie Dee Williams as Gale Sayers give two of the finest performances of their careers bringing to life the friendship and courage of these two football players whose lives rise far above the game they play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1970's gave rise to the "made for TV" movie on a regular basis, and a lot of them were pretty disappointing, with weak stories and poor acting. But then there's "Brian's Song" - which 40 years later still has to rank as one of the best (if not the best) TV movies ever made. It's a "football" movie to an extent, but it's far more than a football movie. It's a story about a friendship that known no bounds and that overcomes a lot of odds. In 1965, Gayle Sayers and Brian Piccolo were rookie running backs for the Chicago Bears. The should have been rivals and not friends. They were competing for starting positions; Sayers was black and Piccolo was white. There should have been too many divides for them to cross to build a friendship, and yet they did build a friendship.Billy Dee Williams and James Caan were wonderful in these title roles. For I would say two thirds of its short run time (minus TV commercials, it comes in at a little under an hour and a quarter) this is essentially a football movie. The friendship is well developed, but there's a heavy emphasis on training shots and a lot of really good real football footage, mostly of some spectacular runs by Sayers. The movie really takes off though once Sayers suffers a knee injury that knocks him out of the lineup. Piccolo takes his place, and Piccolo wants him back and helps him get back into game shape. For a while they share the backfield, and then the movie becomes a powerful tearjerker, as Piccolo is diagnosed with cancer, and Sayers sees him through his final illness.Yes, this is a made for TV movie. It's not flashy, but it's good - very good. And it's very moving. You can't help but feel sad as it comes to an end. Let's face it. 26 years olds (football players or not) shouldn't die, but they sometimes do - and it's very sad. But sad though it is, in the end you have to feel uplifted by this movie about the power of a friendship that overcomes all the odds against it. The movie also features a pretty strong performance from Jack Warden as the legendary Chicago bears coach George Halas. You can't ask for much more than this. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Caan and Billy Dee Williams were great. Even though this deals with football it really is a movie about a very special friendship. All of us would love to have friends like this that can be counted on. As they say right at the start it is based on a true story. This has been and will always be one of my favorite movies of all time. Whenever i see James Caan or Billy Dee Williams I am reminded of Brian piccolo and Gale Sayers. It is love and friendship that make even struggles easier to face. The on screen chemistry between James Caan and Billy Dee Williams rings true, and is very inspiring. I own this movie on DVD and VHS and watch it 3 or 4 times a year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is perhaps not only one of the great sports movies of all time, but one of the best movies of all time, period. It's nice that a sports movie can be based upon how the camaraderie of the game can create friendships, especially during times of racism. I think it also portrays how truly nice it is that people who are competing for the same job can appreciate each other for who they are, not what they can do.The story begins in 1965 about two running backs, as the trailer says "one white, the other black." Brian Piccolo, a white running back from the south, and a graduate of Wake Forest, is played magnificently by James Caan. Gale Sayers, a black, naturally athletic and lightning speed superstar from Nebraska, and graduate of Kansas, is played equally well by Billy Dee Williams.We can see right away that both of these men have opposite personalities: Piccolo is a fun-loving, personable joker with a good sense of humor, and Sayers is a shy, quiet, unprepossessing gentlemanly type. Sayers is a tremendous athlete, never having problems succeeding in the game, while Piccolo is hard-working, tough as nails, and getting ahead not so much on ability, but through determination and maximum effort.The Bears decide they are going to have players room together according to position, regardless of race. Sayers and Piccolo don't seem to know how to deal with it, but they still manage to get along and later become close friends. The wonderful quality this movie has is that is shows very convincing changes in both of them. Piccolo helps Sayers rehabilitate a knee injury because he wants to beat him out fair and square, not because he was injured. Sayers helps Piccolo become a better player, and is later promoted from second string halfback to starting fullback. Sayers, who is very shy at the start of the movie, later becomes more personable, and more comfortable around people.Just when things start to go well for Piccolo, starting at fullback, gaining yards, and scoring touchdowns, tragedy strikes: Brian Piccolo has cancer in his right lung. The shocking news hits Sayers between the eyes like a rock. He makes a very moving speech to the team about dedicating their next game to him. Piccolo receives tremendous support from his teammamates, wife, and Sayers, who we now know is a true and loyal friend.The casting of this film was fantastic, and they work together magnificently: Shelly Fabares and Judy Pace are terrific as the supportive wives, and Jack Warden is very convincing as Coach George Halas. Brian's Song is a wonderful film, not so much because it is about the glory of sports, but about the value of friendship. The instrumental musical piece of "The Hands of Time" truly magnifies the poignancy of the story as well. This film is a classic, and you'll be surprised how moved you'll be by the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seems to be a pattern among the greatest of the ABC Movies of the Week, movies such as Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, Trilogy of Terror, Duel, among others. While the style of the TV movie looks much the same as others (due to TV-sized budgets), the story is so involving that it transcends its style. "Brian's Song" is a perfect example of this.The story emotionally connects us with Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers almost immediately. We care about what happens to the characters, and the chemistry Billy Dee Williams and James Caan have together totally sells the viewer on their friendship. As the plot thickens, our connection with the characters carries us through. Even though the style of the movie is a bit shoddy and carries a bit of '70s cheesiness, it adds to the charm of the movie and doesn't really matter as one watches it.Personally, I loved this movie and I did tear up. I don't think it's possible to watch this movie without doing so. The remake doesn't hold a candle to this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brian Piccolo was a joker, Caucasin, and one that was a free agent that may not make the Chicago Bears and a married father, of three daughters. While Gayle Sayles was a shy, quiet, African-American, and the best RB ever to grace the game of football.When these two men, that seemingly have nothing in common. Grow close over Sayles would-be career threatening injury. Piccolo inspired Sayles and Sayles played better than ever. But nothing could ever prepare them for the fight of terminal cancer for Piccolo. As their families go through it with them also.But it isn't why you die, but how you live. As these two men helped each other in their worst of times. And how they got to know one another. As their friendship grew. Plus, how it gives you inspiration and how you never should give up or give in.Caan and Williams really have the best chemistry on TV. And you would think that you are seeing their characters, not actors playing football players, come out to light for real! Great supporting cast and great writing. And a great director in the late Buzz Kulik.Just really makes you cry but in a good kind of way. A lot of people said that men that saw this movie, and they cried along with it. Best TV movie ever and really started the TV movie thing. Set the standards for all TV movies! 2001 Remake was OK but...THE ORIGINAL IS THE ORIGINAL! No matter how you remake. Best ever TV movie of all time! Not just about football, but about friendship and family! Inspiration to you all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a big fan of TV-movies from the 70's, you'd think I'd have seen "Brian's Song" a lot sooner. I finally watched it, and wasn't disappointed.You know the story, two football players, one white, one black, become best buds and help each other out. James Caan is superb as always, and Billy Dee Williams is pretty good.At first, it seemed a major part of the plot would have involved race. When Billy Dee is told by his team that he and Caan will be the first black and white roomies, he is told to pretty much expect big trouble in every city they play in, from both blacks and whites. However, we never see any of that trouble a single time. And really, the only hint of any trouble of any kind from the roommate situation went Caan's way - he reads a racist letter that someone sent to him, upset he was rooming with a "darkie" - and joked his mother sent it. And that's all for the big, bad roommate situation.However, this being 1971, there are various funny race jokes. Caan tells Williams he's going to name his new kid "Spade"; when Caan sees Williams fumble a ball around, he says something about "you'd think the ball had a white sheet on it"; Caan relates chicken to blacks; and there's a scene where Caan jokingly calls Williams a "nigger" and everyone gets a big laugh out of it. Ah, the days when one can make jokes that aren't politically correct! The ending is sad, and done very well. The whole movie actually is pretty good, and the friendship is built up nicely, We never really know why Caan as Picolo chose Billy Dee to be friends with, but it really doesn't matter. They made a good team in this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this film began production,Brian Piccolo had only been gone for six months.As a result,most of the film takes on the atmosphere of being rushed to production.It has an obvious look that they were given a very small time frame to get this film made.They rushed it.Also,you have real,honest to goodness football players trying to act.They are trying to come across as though they are not reading their lines as they speak,but it's obvious that they are.All of that being said,Brian's Song is still an enjoyable film because of it's story.You are watching a friendship develop,evolve,and flourish into a brotherly love.This is the hook that keeps you watching,and ultimately brings you back to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was such a touching film. Great actors coming together and making this film incredibly well done. James Caan was excellent as Bryan, and the chemistry he had with Billy Dee Williams was amazing. This film had me crying, it is just so sad to lose people to Cancer, but here, you have a great athlete that gets stricken with this in his late twenties. What a waste of an exceptional human being in general, not just an athlete.I recommend this film to anyone that wants to see a real and true story about life.One of James Caan's best performances, and then came Godfather. Not a bad movie either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In response to lew2000's question about the veracity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>of their friendship.I have the film on VHS so I don't know what the DVD extras provided. I did read Sayers book "I am Third" (referencing how he prioritizes himself) decades ago and IIRC Brian and Gale did room together. They also played the same position on the team. They also came aboard the Bears team at the same time. I imagine Gale is embarrassed by the way the Movie makes their relationship almost supernatural in it's heroic nature. In his book he devotes a chapter to Brian and makes it clear that Brian's death affected him and helped add perspective to certain things. The fact that these 2 existed together and competed against each other and found friendship during such a seminal moment in the USA's history is worthy of note.Their real life stories contain the flavor of a contemporary Greek tragedy: 2 men with gifted physical attributes. One of the men from a place where friendship among such equals is forbidden (think Ben Hur's Messala), the other man (of superior physical gifts - think Ben Hur) from a place where judgments are rendered in a more civil way. Both men full of physical courage who learn the nature and importance of philosophical courage (think Hector or Achilles). And when both men have endured much and given much to strangers and each other, when both men feel they understand how unfair and wrong the world can be, fate requires they learn the most painful of lessons: That whatever the injustice, Death (incarnate) is the most callous and unfeeling of teachers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Made-for-TV Movie Ever Made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to TV movies, there's no movie that comes close to Brian's Song. In my opinion, they should have released it in theaters, it probably would've won Best Picture.Brian's Song portrays the friendship between Brian Piccolo and Gayle Sayers, two teammates that fought for the same job. Unfortunately, their lives are challenged when Brian is diagnosed with cancer.There are so many parts in this movie that will make the biggest baddest, toughest guy break down and start falling apart. Most of these parts involve both Sayers and Piccolo, for their bond is so great that they are more than friends, they are brothers.Caan and Williams portray Piccolo and Sayers perfectly; they even resemble them too.I think that everyone should see this movie (and even see the 2001 remake, though it's not as good as this one).There will never be another song like Brian's, but perhaps the lesson taught in the film is that we should always try to be more like Brian Piccolo, by living every day to it's fullest and loving life, because it can be very short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no idea until recently that this was a TV movie. It has all the markings of an Oscar Winning feature film. The fact that neither Caan nor Williams won an Emmy is quite fascinating. Hard to believe that this is the same guy (caan) who was portraying Sonny Corleone in the Godfather at the same time. If you get the DVD, put on the commentary over the movie.It's James Caan and Billy De Williams narrating and it's great. The NFL films inserts are great as well. I do wish it could have been longer, but I'd rather have a great short film than a full length feature film that's boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this movie on TV when it first aired on ABC TV. I was about 13 years old. And I cried like a baby at the end. This was the first time I ever cried at the end of a movie. And to this day at 47, I still can't watch it without crying just a bit.You have to be dead not to be touched by this movie. James Caan portrayal of Brian Piccolo and Billy Dee Williams portrayal of Gale Sayers touched me emotionally. Jack Warden also did a fine job as George Halas.If you have never seen Brian's Song and want to see a fine movie about friendship, courage, and the human spirit.....see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this when it first came out. I was a kid of about 14. I was stunned how emotional seeing this was, and how affected I was by it. I am not ashamed at all to say I cried watching this. The moment in the film when Billy Dee Williams (as Gale Sayers) stands up at a banquet, and states simply "I Love Brian Piccolo"...Well, I don't know. It completely stunned me and blew me away. A simple line, delivered so poignantly, with so much meaning behind it. In a world with so much racial animosity, especially in this country, to see what is possible and what we are truly capable of is moving.This was truly a heart-wrenching story, delivered beautifully by Billy Dee Williams and James Caan. It's a tragedy what happened to Brian Piccolo and his family, yet he now lives on in all of us, because of these heartfelt performances, and the thoughtfulness and dignity that this movie portrayed. It may be dated, and it may have aimed at the heartstrings, but I felt the performances by the 2 actors was genuine, and they did a great job bringing this friendship to life for us.A tragic, overwhelmingly sad story, yet uplifting. You get the feeling that this is the way Brian Piccolo would have wanted it.Thank You, Billy Dee and James, and to the filmmakers for a fine job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not sit here and fill up my ten lines with words that may distract you or that may sound fabricated. However, this movie was simply one that will never be topped by remakes or forgotten. I find this movie to be highly suitable for different age groups... and sure to make any man, woman, or being cry. I laughed at points during the movie, and cried at times also. I never watched such a movie- in the sense that it was a comedy- yet a tragedy. I loved it, and that is simply all my review needs to say. It was a good movie to make me think of my own personal life experiences and friendships. At times after watching this movie... I longed for a friend like Gayle Sayers, and to be respected as Brian Piccollo was. This movie is he best... and excellent. That is all that needs to be said...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Only FOOTBALL movie I've ever loved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's strange that I'm a big fan of football but I'm not a fan of football movies. I slept through The Longest Yard and Any Given Sunday.. However, when I was 10 years old I watched Brian's Song on TV and I was incredibly moved. So I purchased the DVD recently and expected to be disappointed. I was very wrong. Once again I was moved by this movie which has exceptional performances by Billy Dee Williams and James Caan. My only caveat is that being a TV movie, it had to fit time constraints, so rather than the movie showing the ending, it is told to us by Jack Warden. Despite this, this is a truly a wonderful movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, this movie's pretty good. However, it is kind of limited by the conventions and budgets of the television movie. While some of the introductory scenes are quite good and engrossing, the second act flirts all too closely with melodrama. Yes, it's melodrama that's written, directed and acted well, but it's still melodrama.The film, as is to be expected of a television movie, pales in comparison with a very similar feature film released around the same time, "Bang the Drum Slowly", which tells a similar story, albeit without a racial element, but also without the slightest hint of melodrama."Brian's Song" is somewhat better known, but "Bang the Drum Slowly" is the true masterpiece. Still, "Brian's Song" is a solid film, especially of interest to football fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie not only about sports ,but how two men grew to love and respect each other !And I first saw it on Nov.30,1971 and enjoyed it so much .The cast that was headed by James Caan as Brian Piccolo and Billy Dee Williams as Gale Sayers with Jack Warden in his Emmy Winning Best Supporting Actor as the Coach George Hallas and Judy Pace and Shelley Fabares as their wives plus actual members of the Chicago Bears as themselves all did a great job in this truly excellent movie! And if anyone didn't sob when Gale at the sports award ceremony accepts the award and dedicates it to Brian and asks everyone to pray for him or when he tell the team about Brians illness is only fooling themselves because admit it we all cried .And I still cry when I watch it even now And I have it on DVD and when ever i go away its one of several movies i take with me to watch on my portable DVD player.And its funny when people see me watching the movie they remember it as well So indeed it has endured and will be remembered forever as a truly great movie !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quiet Gale Sayers (Billy Dee Williams) joins the Chicago Bears and is befriended by the brash Brian Piccolo (James Caan). It starts off with Piccolo playing a joke on Sayers telling him that coach Halas (Jack Warden) is deaf in one ear. Sayers returns the favor. They compete for the same job. Sayers is the sure thing. Piccolo is too slow and too light. The team decides to room the two together in 1965 based on position rather than race. The two and their wives become great friends enduring many challenges.In the ashes of the racial strife of the previous decade, this TV movie hits on the timely subject by showing the healing powers of a post-racial true friendship. The modernity of their relationship allowed the viewers to get pass all their hang ups. That's why the nigg*r scene works so well. James Caan is brilliant and he follows it up with the iconic 'The Godfather'. Billy Dee's Sayers starts off quiet but then turns up the heat. The only thing truly missing is some better football scenes. The use of real game footage to augment the inferior footage with the actors helps a little. I wish it could be done more seamlessly but that may be asking too much. This is definitely a melodrama and viewers have to be prepared for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most heart-breaking stories ever based on a really true story! I totally cried my eyes out when legendary Chicago Bears football player Brian Piccolo was stricken with terminal cancer and the other players, especially Gale Sayers, dedicated themselves to do their best to win the game for their fellow teammate and friend. If you are a football fan and you are a fan of the Chicago Bears, then I would definitely recommend that you see this movie. However, you will need plenty of tissues for this one, trust me! This classic tearjerker film, Brian's Song, is definitely and absolutely a must for all football fans everywhere, and it is not to be missed! It is an absolutely touching true story on love, courage, teamwork, strength, sacrifice and friendship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humanizing pro football and showing us that men of the grid iron hurt too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This television movie was made in an era of laden with stereotypes of gender roles, racial equality, and masculinity. I don't have to tell you what Brian's Song is about or how it ends. The story is very well known throughout the athletic community and amongst fans of the NFL. But if you don't know the story of Gale Sayers and Brian Piccolo then I suggest you watch this movie. While the above paragraph was very blunt and did not explain why I like this Brian's Song so much I will use one word to describe my undying love for this television move; simplicity. Yeah; simplicity is the reason. Now I do understand that CGI wasn't um a big thing back then but there was still big budget movies and television shows. The actors in the movie are top notch but did not peak in their careers until later on for almost another 10 years. Plus the movie didn't try and make a spectacle out of pro football. The television movie stuck to the story and draws emotion out of you by showing the budding friendship between two men. Even the strongest men and women will cry when watching this movie. The speech that Gale Sayers gives about his love for Brian Piccolo could move mountains with its emotion. The way it is spoken, versed, and yes the simplicity of the speech make it one of the most revered video clips ever. So sit back, grab a box of tissues, and get ready to join a cinema favorite of mine. Trust me if you are not moved to tears while watching this movie seek medical attention right away. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie...but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems unfeeling not to love this movie. I do love the relationship it portrayed. BUT who on earth picked James Caan to play Brian Piccolo? He is Jewish, definitely not twenty six, and not a football player. Who cast this film? Caan would have been better as the guy who owned the Bears. Yes, there was no such part, but he would have played it more believably.Billy Dee Williams is wonderful. The story is wonderful, very tragic, but the warning at the beginning of the movie (Hemmingway's quote that "all good stories end in death") was helpful. I knew the outcome, of course, but I like the upfront approach.I also like the fact this film did not try to make a statement about black/white relations, but kept the story about two men who loved and supported one another. An excellent film, but I would have cast someone like Sylvester Stallone as Brian. He has the ethnicity, the correct age at the time, and the aura of a football player.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Won me over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parts of this movie concerning the untimely death of Brian Piccolo (James Caan)had me wondering how it could be rated so highly as a tearjerker. When Gayle Sayers (Billy Dee Williams)breaks the news to his Chicago teammates that Piccolo has cancer, the two actors standing behind him are already in tears before Sayers says the first word (Mr. Director?). But Brian's Song wins you over despite it being a little dated with a strong performance from Williams and an excellent performance from Caan, who delivers more laugh-out-loud lines than any 70's TV movie-of-the-week has a right to give. The bond between the Piccolo and Sayers feels real, and the emotional speech given by Sayers as he accepts the George Halas award is a show stopper, and it shocked me how hard hitting it was after the limp locker room speech that was given. The soundtrack by Michael LeGrand is a little overbearing in some places (like I said, it dates itself a little), but in all fairness, it comes off as unforgettable in other areas, especially at the Halas award ceremony. The mix of footage of the actual players playing with the actors on the sideline during a game lends a realism that is missing with all sports movies today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good but dated film with something missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't realize that this was originally a made-for-TV movie when I first saw it and I think this movie shows how far TV has come in the last 30 plus years. Maybe I'm the only one who doesn't think this is a wonderful film, but it left me somewhat unfulfilled. The movie does have some good performances by its cast especially the roles of Pic and Sayers, their wives, and the head coach. Nevertheless, the acting seems geared towards making it play strictly as a tear-jerker, not a serious drama. My biggest complaint, however, was that there was not enough development in the characters to see how and why they became good friends. When did they go from playing practical jokes on each other to becoming like brothers? And then there was Pic's very unfunny racial humor. When Sayers gave him a pint of blood, he had an urge for chitterlings. Maybe that was funny in 1971, but wasn't a professional golfer roundly criticized for a similar comment about Tiger Woods? I couldn't understand some of the football humor either and the laughs seemed contrived rather than heartfelt. I think this could have been a much better movie if it had moved slower and there had been a little more character development to understand why these two guys clicked and became such good friends and then the loss would not seem contrived but real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually met Gale and Ardie Sayers when Gale was director of athletics at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. In fact they were guests in our home one afternoon. So I had saved this film for a special occasion. Television cooperated and I caught it last night. The acting is quite fine. The script doesn't act for any real soul-searching, nor was it meant to. It was courageous at a time when the country was being torn apart by racial unrest and an inspiration of true friendship that knows no racial bounds. Frankly, the music was terrible! Back in those days, I suppose that anything like a musical score was considered not particularly important to a film's success but the score was badly performed. Obviously there wasn't much rehearsal time (if any) and the instruments simply didn't come in at the same time and their intonation sounded as if the players hadn't even tuned up. TV movies of today certainly wouldn't fall into a trap like that. Sometimes it sounded so artificial that I was almost expecting test patterns to flick on the screen. At least it wasn't maudlin...Curtis Stotlar</fullReview>

The characters are little more than clichs in a script that is so loaded with clichs that it is amazing it doesn't sink under its own weight into the oblivion of never-never land. The screenplay by William Blinn is loaded with schmaltzy, corny scenes that are little more than feeble attempts to draw cheap tears from the audience. This type of film might appeal to jocks whose hat size is larger than their IQ, but the thinking person will avoid this movie like the plague and won't wont dare to let it contaminate their DVD.
