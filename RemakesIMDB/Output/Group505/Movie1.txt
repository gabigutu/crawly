		<shortDescription>Yo, what's with the lousy ratings?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot of things going for this movie: 1) Great, great Stevie Wonder musical score; 2) Gene Wilder in real romantic distress, and 3) first class ensemble work involving Gilda Radner, Joseph Bologna, Judith Ivey, Charles Grodin and others. Each of four very close friends encounters extra-relationship entanglement, film centers on Wilder's infatuation with much younger model LeBrock. The real fun is in the interaction between and among Wilder's friends, a truly enjoyable experience. Lots of negative comments here on IMDb related to "the original" movie (which I haven't seen) - I think it's only fair to judge this one on its own merits. I could watch this movie 20 times, in fact, I HAVE watched this movie 20 times. With apologies to all the bashers I give it 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie about 18 years ago and found it below average. The main reason for viewing it was may admiration for Gene Wilder after the early Mel Brooks movies... Gene Wilders appearances in The Producers, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and, not to forget although not from Mel Brooks, Silver Streak are rightfully and indisputably regarded as masterpieces by now. Compared to these highlights, I actually found The Woman in Red slightly dull.Watching it on Cable-TV yesterday, i.e. January 2006, I got a completely different impression. I don't know if the difference is just me being 20 years older and more tuned-in with the main character, but now I experienced a warm, enjoyable movie filled with a mild madness I found most appealing. The spirit of the early 80's is very evident, this is not a timeless movie. Nevertheless, I find it more up-to-date with human emotions and behavior than most contemporary attempts in the "daily life comedy" genre.Finally, if you - just like me - was disappointed by this one twenty years ago, give another try!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wilder's best loved comedy. It's nice to see him behind the camera also in this witty picture about a man enthralled by this model of beauty, played sumptuously by LeBrock, only to find that there's more to loving someone than just a great body. Wilder performs some of his finest screwball comedy and is given great support from Grodin, Ivey, Bologna and Gilda Radner. Stevie Wonder's song is also catchy and adds plenty of flavor to a fun romantic-comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gene Wilder goes wild!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Woman in Red" is Gene Wilder's somewhat sloppy comedy that's a remake of the 1977 French movie "Pardon Mon Affaire". Wilder did triple duty on this film. He not only stars but also wrote and directed the picture. As a writer and director, he does a so-so job. This movie has alot of silly moments that are totally preposterous. And it contains a few laughable lines of dialogue. But "The Woman in Red" for the most part is a pretty funny film. Wilder is good as Teddy Pierce, a married man who one day see's a beautiful woman wearing a red dress. After catching a glimpse of this woman, he becomes obsessed with her, and can't get her out of his mind. Wilder gets some good support from an exceptional cast which includes Charles Grodin, Joseph Bolonga, Judith Ivey, Kelly LeBrock (as The Woman in Red), and of course Wilder's late wife, Gilda Radner. "The Woman in Red" ain't a great comedy, but a good one. Only if Wilder had done a better directing job this would have been a great farce.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I literally laughed till i cried at this super piece of work. I am a big fan of Gene Wilder, he seems to have a natural ability to make me laugh, so i knew i was in for a good laugh here. I must have seen The Woman in Red about 12 times now over the years and it just keeps getting better. What a shame Gene Wilder doesn't make movies any more, i feel there is no good talent around for comedy these days. It seems to be just young guys who are good looking so people would like them whatever they do. Gene Wilder on the other hand is a comedy legend, not just an actor but a director and writer, he is a man of many talents and i really miss him. Also worth noting about The Woman in Red is the soundtrack by Stevie Wonder, it's so 80's and it just brings me back to those days again. Gene Wilder plays a man seeking adventure in his life and becomes obsessed with the woman in red played by Kelly LeBrock. That's your basic storyline, simple and straight to the point so the laughs begin immediately as Teddy (Wilder) pursues Charlotte (LeBrock) and gets into all kinds of trouble as he chases after the woman in red. Hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder's best as director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wilder's only film he directed in a contemporary setting is by far his most successful effort. His other films (most notably "The Adventure Of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother" 9/10) have had higher levels of zany gags in them, but here he has crafted a down to Earth domestic comedy and it is very funny. His performance is, as usual, superb and he is surrounded by well chosen actors who also provide laughs. The ending leans a bit too close to whimsical, but it hardly deters the viewer's enjoyment. Scenes involving Wilder's character and his friends jokingly discussing each other's affairs is equal to the perfectly written exchanges of a Woody Allen movie. Also worth noting is Gilda Radner's brilliant love lorn and scorned office colleague. Her presence on screen is a real high point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first seen this movie years ago and really liked it, and now after checking it out again, it still has that magic. It also includes a fine cast of stars. Gene Wilder is pretty funny in this. There are plenty of gags too. But, unlike most comedy films, there is a decent and enjoyable storyline included as well. So I'd say there's something for everyone in this movie. It's romantic, funny, engaging and damn right crazy at times! Check it out! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie begins with Teddy apparently about to jump off a ledge nine stories up. Why? He starts to tell us how it all began, and we go back to that day with the scene straight out of 'Seven Year Itch', only Charlotte has dark hair and is dressed in red. And it turns out she is a model for the San Francisco cable car ad campaign, which Teddy is involved with. Despite that, Teddy has a lot of trouble meeting this woman, and his attempts meet with humorous results. For example, on more than one occasion he thinks he is talking to her but it turns out to be Ms. Milner, and this is good for a number a laughs.Teddy, however, shouldn't be thinking about another woman. He is married to Didi and they have two daughters. If Teddy needed any incentive to behave himself, he should keep in mind what happened to Joey when he cheated on Teresa (Joey and Teresa's young son is staying with Teddy and Didi). And apparently he is not destined to have a relationship with Charlotte, because his attempts are just one disaster after another.Gene Wilder is good as always, especially with physical comedy and when he has to talk his way out of jams. Kelly LeBrock is pleasant and sweet, with a slightly naughty side (I saw an edited version, so I surely didn't see all there was of her). Gilda Radner is nasty in a way that didn't appeal to me, but others might like it. I liked most of the songs by Dionne Warwick and Stevie Wonder, some of which they did together--though one gets played entirely too much on the radio all these years later and I got tired of it long ago. There is some physical comedy, but plenty of funny situations too. But the movie is not all funny. Some of it is touching, and some parts are depressing.Some highlights, in addition to Joey's nasty surprise and Ms. Milner's bizarre behavior:-We hear one side of what may be a very naughty phone conversation at Teddy's workplace.-A hilarious scene in a nice restaurant where one of Teddy's friends pretends to be blind and causes chaos.-Shelly, whose hairstyle sort of looks Native American (while black on the sides, it's red and blonde in the middle) even though his parents are Jewish, has come to take Teddy's daughter Missy to a David Bowie concert.-Didi explains what happened to Joey and Teresa but doesn't say everything.-Teddy and Didi are getting ready for a big night, but that gets interrupted.-Teddy's grandmother Mama Dell is celebrating her 85th birthday. I can't say more, but from the time Teddy arrives at her apartment until the end of the movie, everything is great and most of it is very funny. I can say, since this is how the movie began, that Teddy does end up out on a ledge.This was a pleasant, slightly naughty farce that was really worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TWIR is a classic in a way that many others claim to be...but aren't. As a comedy I don't think it has you bending over in fits of laughter, but there are some great scenes in there. Kelly Le Brock's character remains one of the hottest characters even to grace the screen. She was simply gorgeous and a knockout - a perfect fit for the role. The combination of great soundtrack courtesy of Stevie Wonder, the wonderful acting of Wilder, and the indescribable beauty of Le Brock form a powerful combination that helps explain why people are still watching this flick today - 23 years on!!I'd like to hear from those who gave it low votes - just what was missing from the film that you wanted to see?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gene Wilder film I like the most.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film which is very dear to me. It stars my favorite actor: Gene Wilder.The film deals with the topic of love-at-first-sigh and what a love and at what a time in his life!!! San Francisco ad man Teddy Pierce (Wilder) falls head over heals in love with Charlotte (Kelly LeBrock) as she walks over a grate and a rush of air from the grate causes her skirt to lift up in a revealing manner (a parody of Marilyn Monroe in The Seven-Year Itch).Teddy is happily married to Didi, but he can't get this woman out of his mind. Encouraged by his friends Buddy, Joe and Michael, he tries to ask her for a date but mistakenly phones Ms. Milner, a plain ad-agency employee, instead. Teddy ultimately does become acquainted with Charlotte.He begins using elaborate ruses to see her socially without his wife finding out. Meanwhile, he incurs the wrath of Ms. Milner, whom he stands up. Events come to a head in Charlotte's high-rise apartment, where she invites Teddy into her bed.What happens next is for YOU to find out.Buy this one without further delay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but a funny movie with Gene Wilder.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hard to believe, but this movie is over 20 years old!! While not a great movie, its rating on IMDb seems to be a bit low. I think it deserves a "6" or a "7".Gene Wilder was 50 here when he played Teddy Pierce, an otherwise normal married man who catches a glimpse of temptation in the beautiful form of Charlotte, played by Kelly LeBrock, 23. A perfect older man/younger woman attraction, not unlike "10" with Dudley Moore. In real life, an attraction such as this almost always ends a split second after it begins. Teddy was a typical, frumpy middle aged man, and Charlotte a slim, beautiful young woman. But the funny begins when Charlotte actually reciprocates the attraction.They end up in her place in the daytime, Teddy has undressed and is under the sheets, waiting for Charlotte, when -- surprise, surprise -- Charlotte's young and virile husband comes home unexpectedly. So Teddy exercises his only viable option, go out the window onto the ledge almost nude. The audience below thinks he wants to jump, and that attracts a big congregation of police and news media. His family see him on TV and the rest plays out in a very funny manner.Charles Grodin is very good as Buddy, the homosexual friend of Teddy's, and has to save the moment at a surprise party where Teddy is with Charlotte. In all an entertaining movie, nothing more. Kelly LeBrock started out as a model, and we can see why. However, she wasn't much of an actress and that shows in her later work. Nothing much to write about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, thought-provoking and entertaining film in which Gene Wilder is a man tempted...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really a very interesting movie. It has some great comical situations which will make you laugh but there is much more to this film than a routine comedy. This story is about a man who has friends who are "playing around" and sees a lady who really tempts him to the max. She is a beautiful model who pushes all his buttons and he grows obsessed with the notion of having an affair with her. Throughout the film he is warned of the pitfalls of such a decision (for the most part very funny warnings) but his obsession is just too strong to resist. This film will put the viewer through a gamut of emotions, the excitement of romance, the adventure of the forbidden and the value of taking a hard look at your own life. It is a film which makes you laugh, makes you feel a lot of emotions and makes you think. I think Mr. Wilder should be commended for an excellent offbeat but funny and very interesting film that will speak volumes to those who look for the story inside the story. Women may appreciate this film more than men but this story really has an important message for anyone who is married and tempted...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Wilder, Kelly LeBrock and Gilda Radner are the highlights of this great 80's comedy. One of Wilder better comedies of the 80's, it is also one of his funniest. Kelly LeBrock was at the peek of her career, for here, it was all down hill. LeBrock's beauty makes her the treasure of ever guy's desire. For Wilder, he is ready to destroy his life, in a funny way, in order to have her. Gilda Radner is just funny. Every time she is on the screen, she makes you laugh. Her addition to the cast makes everything else funny. A smaller role that what she was use to in previous films, her addition to the cast is beyond perfect. Much like the comedy team of Wilder and Pryor, Wilder and Radner had a great on screen chemistry, that was second to none when it came to comedy (couples) team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What It Is!" What It Is Is A Pretty Decent Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be honest. This isn't a movie to take all that seriously, and it has to be evaluated on that basis. It's a bit of a thin storyline revolving around quiet ad executive Teddy's attempt to - well - get it on with the beautiful model Charlotte, in spite of the fact that he's happily married, and that Charlotte seems (at least at first glance) somewhat out of his league. Gene Wilder and Kelly Le Brock are the two main characters in this. Wilder was very good, and there were a lot of amusing scenes for him scattered throughout, and some fun moments of misunderstanding with his office colleague Ms Milner (played by Wilder's real-life wife Gilda Radner.) Even knowing that it's coming I can't help but laugh as Milner keys his car because she thinks he stood her up or sends him careening helplessly down one of San Francisco's hills or as he walks down the hall in his fancy new clothes and high fives a colleague with the words "What it is!" Wilder caught the character of Teddy - strangely drawn to Charlotte and yet knowing that he's a happy guy already with his wife Didi (Judith Ivey) and their daughters, and even as he pursues Charlotte, you can almost see the wheels turning in his head as he asks himself "why?" Le Brock (although playing the title character) was less central to the movie, which really revolved more around Teddy and his guy friends (played by Joseph Bologna, Charles Grodin and Michael Huddleston.) She was fine and certainly didn't detract from the movie at all, although I didn't think her performance was especially powerful either.The movie is a wonderful length - at 1:26 just perfect for a fun little comedy of no great importance. Not to be overlooked are some wonderful songs performed by Stevie Wonder and Dionne Warwick. The only part of the movie I really didn't care for had to do with the character of Shelly (Michael Zorek) - the punk boyfriend of one of Teddy's daughters. The character wasn't likable first of all, especially as he groped at Didi, and the character also served absolutely no purpose to the overall story. Aside from that, it is indeed a fun movie.

		<shortDescription>An Affair To Forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Light comedies look like the easiest things to make when they work, but when they don't, it's more like quantum physics on acid. Take this 1984 sex farce.Teddy Pierce (Gene Wilder) is a happily married ad man in San Francisco who goes gaga when he catches a glimpse of a beautiful model (Kelly LeBrock) in racy undies. With the help of some friends, Teddy works around the suspicions of his wife (Judith Ivey) and the anger of a spurned co-worker (Gilda Radner) to arrange a furtive rendezvous with the object of his desire.Best remembered today for the film debut of the bodacious LeBrock and a soundtrack that featured Stevie Wonder's hit song "I Just Called To Say I Love You," this is a movie that aims low and still misses. Wilder, who wrote and directed, presents a comedy that is not only not funny, but so tonally off as to become uncomfortable to watch.Take the scenes with Radner. One of the great comedic talents of her time, Radner's wasted here as the butt of humor as mean as it is nonsensical. We see her as a love-starved crone being duped by bad luck into thinking Teddy wants to get romantic with her, only to find he doesn't. This drives her to inflict vengeance on him and his helpless car. Why does Teddy put up with this, rather than take it up with her or with HR?You might answer that it's because this is a farce, but elsewhere "The Woman In Red" is played much more dramatically, too much so. Two of Teddy's male friends undergo crises involving romantic partners that are played very seriously, and developed in a heavy- handed way by Wilder that threatens his largely jokeless comedy. Or was I supposed to be laughing when Joseph Bologna has a nervous breakdown after discovering his wife and kids left him?Wilder is only a little more successful working on Teddy's home life, as when Teddy discovers his wife keeps a revolver around the house and admits to being easily jealous."You realize you might have shot me?" he tells her after her gun accidentally goes off."I would never do that," she answers. "Not without a reason."There are also little side bits that never make any sense, like a daughter's boyfriend who sports an aggressive Mohawk hairdo and makes clumsy passes at Teddy's wife, or a destructive and pointless gag Teddy's friends play at a fancy restaurant. These don't connect to the main story, and they aren't funny on their own.At one point, we discover Teddy's wife hosts a diet clinic in their home for reasons that are never explained. The entire purpose of this seems to be to provide Wilder with an excuse for some physical humor, walking through a thick crowd of people in his character's living room while an instructor drones on about something called "the Alphabet diet:" "You have to watch yourself carefully because by the time you get to 'P,' you might put on all the weight you lost on 'K,'" she tells them.And what of LeBrock's character, Charlotte? As male fantasy object, she certainly works for me. Yet except for one scene in an elevator with Charles Grodin (playing one of Teddy's friends), she never breaks out of that to develop any comic identity or dramatic interest.Wilder's performance alternates between goofy and wan; he was in an odd period in his career after some fantastic comedic performances over the prior 15 years apparently left him with no more mountains to climb. He seems tired and disengaged here, adding to the weight of a very labored film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a look at those legs.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Teddy is a middle-aged man who has a good wife, kids, friends, and a fine job. You could say that he has everything he wants; but he doesn't. One day he sees a gorgeous woman in a red dress, and becomes instantly infatuated with the model. He must have her...Gene Wilder is one of those actors you could watch reading the phone directory, he's warm, funny, and very convincing. So even when you know he has also written and directed this poor excuse for a film, you cannot help but enjoy it just a little, because he is magnetic on screen.So he becomes obsessed with Le Brock after she has danced on an air vent. That's the get up of the whole film, but it cannot decide whether its a spoof of romantic movies, a deprecating parody of promiscuity, or just an all out dumb comedy.The more serious tones of the film, like marriage break ups and loneliness, do not sit right in the film, and Le Brock proves that she is just a pretty face, she cannot act, and I doubt Seagal gave her lessons.All In all, it's more of a vanity project for Wilder, making him appear irresistible to a woman, who wouldn't look at another man his age.At least the soundtrack is good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No matter how you slice it, it comes up tacky!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is an American film version of a foreign film, it seems more to be a rip-off of "10". Married Gene Wilder spots a beautiful woman (Kelly Lee Brock) and becomes obsessed with her. He basically spends 90 minutes humiliating himself, leading on a needy secretary (Gilda Radner, totally wasted), and making excuses to his devoted wife (Judith Ivey). Radner tries to be funny with her "Fatal Attraction" like revenge, but the material betrays her. Some good shots of mid 80's San Francisco and a series of pleasant songs by Stevie Wonder and Dionne Warwick (including the Academy Award Winning "I Just Called to Say I Love You") help make this a slight bit more tolerable, but the humor is juvenile, the set-up beyond believable, and the script (by Wilder) dull. A scene with one of Wilder's workers pretending to be blind in a restaurant and destroying it is a pale imitation of the similar scene in the W.C. Fields classic "It's a Gift" and totally out of place.As for LeBrock, she is certainly eye catching in the garage scene wearing the titular red dress, but is a beautiful block of ice otherwise. Wilder is a talented comic, but he seems to be holding back (strange considering he was directing himself speaking his own dialog!) and is definitely missing the partnership that shown on screen for him with Mel Brooks and Richard Pryor in previous ventures. Radner, one of the funniest women since Lucy, deserved much better in the few films she made, and her presence is a total missed opportunity. Ivey would fare better on stage and in later character roles where she was truly able to let herself go. Joseph Bologna and Charles Grodin are even more wasted as Wilder's cronies. With talent like this, you expect so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So not today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1984, when I was 35, I saw this movie and liked it very much. Watching it this time around, on cable, I almost turned it off after the first 20 minutes. And I began thinking...what was it that I liked about Gene Wilder? What is it about Gene Wilder that makes him seem so much more dated than actors from the 1940s? Ah well. But I didn't turn off the movie, and I was glad I didn't...with a few reservations. First, the reservations. Today we call Gene Wilder's actions in this film "stalking". We call some of the comments and actions by other male characters in the film "sexual harassment". And, Gilda Radner all but disappears halfway through the film. But worst of all, this film has to have one of the lousiest endings in cinema history. Does his marriage live or die? Very unsatisfactory.However, the movie also has its redeeming facets. A dignified gay character at a time when that was rare in American cinema. Some sentimental snippets about what friendship really is (along with some about what friendship isn't).The actors here are interesting, if not good. Gene Wilder was Gene Wilder; nothing new there; pleasant on screen. Kelly LeBrock as the super model; well, a rather short film career with little real depth. Gilda Radner was fun. Charles Grodin, whom I never saw as a "real" actor, comes off nicely here as the gay character that manages to hang onto straight friendships; Grodin was always a pleasant man to see on screen. Joseph Bologna...well, difficult to like the role, but he played it well. Judith Ivey as Wilder's wife...perhaps the best acting in the film.Dated, very imperfect, disappointing...but still worth a watch...one more time.</fullReview>

And his attempt to "cheat" ....(was he daydreaming? I forget)....totally backfires in a comedy of errors. To say that this movie was blueprint for how to cheat on your wife is like saying Stripes was a blueprint for how to screw up in the army or Tootsie was a blueprint for how to cross-dress your way onto a soap opera. Kelly LeBrock was the it girl of the moment and the Stevie Wonder soundtrack kept the movie fun and upbeat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Content and married middle-aged businessman Teddy Pierce (a sound and appealing performance by Gene Wilder, who also wrote and directed) seems to have it all with his sweet wife (winningly played by Judith Ivey), good job, and several exceptionally loyal friends. However, Teddy's life goes topsy-turvy after he sees beautiful model Charlotte (flawlessly embodied by the ravishing Kelly LeBrock) and becomes obsessed with her. Wilder keeps the breezy story moving along at a zippy pace, maintains a likable lightweight tone throughout, nicely captures the awkwardness and frustration of the main character, and adroitly mines a pleasant line in good-natured screwball humor that culminates in a hilarious climax in which everything goes uproariously awry. Moreover, it's acted with zest by a game cast: Charles Grodin as the sarcastic Buddy, Joseph Bologna as exuberant horndog Joey, and Michael Huddleston as the tubby, jolly Mikey. Gilda Radner scores many of the biggest laughs as smitten and love-starved co-worker Mrs. Milner. Wilder warrants extra praise for handling a subplot about Buddy's closeted homosexuality with admirable taste and subtlety. Fred Schuler's slick cinematography provides an attractive bright sparkling look. Both the bouncy score by John Morris and a delightful array of choice songs by Stevie Wonder keep things bubbling along. A real hoot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE WOMAN IN RED (Gene Wilder, 1984) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Wilder's third (and penultimate) film as star-director is also his most consistent effort ? albeit one that was a remake of a successful French original, i.e. Yves Robert's PARDON MON AFFAIRE (1977). Wilder ideally casts himself as a happily-married advertising agent whose chance 'encounter' with the stunning title character (portrayed by débutante Kelly LeBrock, a former model and future Mrs. Steven Seagal!) in an underground parking-lot thrusts him into a frenzied, amusing series of amorous complications. Aiding Wilder in his clumsy extramarital travails are his three buddies ? gay Charles Grodin (his 'blind man routine' is side-splitting), married but perpetually horny Joseph Bologna and rotund Michael Huddleston ? all of whom have their own sentimental troubles to contend with. To makes matters worse for Wilder, ugly duckling office colleague Gilda Radner mistakes his attentions for Le Brock to have been intended for her and goes through several physical and emotional changes in her quest to please her 'man' and, after realizing her error, hilariously takes sweet revenge on the understandably bewildered {sic} Wilder. Complimenting all the above quite nicely is Stevie Wonder's song score that, not only features duets with Dionne Warrick, but is highlighted by the Oscar-winning "I Just Called To Say I Love You".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has an interesting premise, but those who made it couldn't take it seriously. Gene Wilder does his usual shy, reserved, should-I-or-shouldn't-I cutey. He and his juvenile muchachos act like children. He becomes obsessed with a woman in red whom he sees dancing over a heat grate. The movie is more about his mid life crisis (same old stuff) and how he maintains his status among these guys. He has the attractive wife, the adorable kids, and finds himself escaping an inevitable crash. It just doesn't work. Given a serious treatment and Wilder's acting ability, it could have been fairly nice. We are left to sort things out and hope for the best.</fullReview>

The supporting cast (including the greatly missed Mrs. Wilder, Gilda Radner) is strong. Kelly LeBrock's not winning any acting awards, but her woodenness isn't a real problem with he "fantasy-idol" role here. And any film with a Stevie Wonder theme song ("I Just Called to Say I Love You") has to get bonus credit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adapted from the French film 'un elephant ca trompe enormement' or better known as 'Pardon Mon affaire' (not seen the French film so can't compare the two), this American attempt shows businessman Theodore 'Teddy' Pierce (Gene Wilder) standing on a window ledge at the top of a tall building and from there we get shown how he got on that ledge in the first place.Teddy Pierce encountered a model named Charlotte (Kelly Le Brock) in a car-park and noticed her getting her dress bellowing upwards as she stands over a grate 'Seven Year Itch' style. He is attracted to her instantly and he starts to pursue her almost to the detriment of his marriage to loving wife Didi (Judith Ivey). He tries to start up a date with Charlotte by calling her from his desk but, via miscommunication, his less beautiful co-worker Ms Milner (Wilder's real-life late wife Gilda Radner) takes the call instead. As this is going on, his friends Buddy (Charles Grodin), Joey (Joseph Bologna) and Mikey (Mike Huddleston) also embark on affairs.Now I love this film because I like watching Gene Wilder act. I love the 80s backdrop, the soundtracks by Stevie Wonder and the light treatment of a serious topic but 'Woman in Red' is not rescued from my biasness. It is a flawed movie.There are some problems with the directing also done by Wilder with too many incidental moments that don't click and seem tacked on to get the film to it's hour and twenty odd minute target (one example is the gratuitous 'blindman gag' scene) but the biggest problem this film has is the quality of the dialogue in it. It can be truly awful if not confusing at times. Consider Joey, he is supposed to be the smart talking, quick-witted guy but the verbal exchange below is all they could come up with for him. This is taken from an early scene where the buddies all play tennis together. Joey makes a smash, breaks his racket over the net but the ball goes over regardless:Mikey: "You hit the net." Joey: "On the follow through." Mikey: "You can't hit the net." Joey: "On the follow through." Mikey: "No you still can't hit the net!" Joey: "On the follow through, Mikey. I hit the ball first, then the net on the follow through. It's our point, the score is 6-2, you're in the s**t-house and did anyone tell you you're cute?"Mikey: *sarcastically and walking off indignantly* "You're cute too."My guess is that Wilder was trying for the Neil Simon approach to fast-paced dialogue seen in 'The Odd Couple'. The difference obviously is that Simon would have put something funny in there. The fact that Joey calls someone towards the end of the film 'half a hard on' only emphasises my point.Here we have Didi looking after 'Joe's little boy' for apparently no reason at all apart from being an excuse for this piece of dialogue.Teddy: "What a cute little pee pee."Didi: "You leave his little pee pee alone. It's his daddy's little pee pee that started it all."*confused look from Teddy*A confused look from me too. What Teddy Pierce is doing complimenting a child's genitalia is anyone's guess, lol.The Pierce/Shelly showdown where Shelly (Michael Zorek) repeats everything Wilder says was more moronic than menacing which is a shame because Zorek did look convincing in his role. Gilda Radner did a better job of being menacing with her chilling stares.This is definitely a vanity piece for Wilder. He was the star of this film and everybody else revolved around him and almost became insignificant apart from to seemingly flatter his ego. Charles Grodin as sensitive Buddy is the stand-out for me who did a lot with the paper- thin character he was given. Oh, the ending is just as baffling. If I had a wife who saw me on the news in someone else's dressing gown on a window ledge smoking a cigarette, she wouldn't have tears of laughter in her eyes I can tell you...As for Kelly Le Brock? Well...diplomatically speaking...she tried, lol.All this from a film I do like, haha.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On his way to work, Teddy spots Charlotte - an incredibly beautiful Woman in Red. He really wants to meet her - but what would his wife say? Gene Wilder makes his 4th attempt as a director in The Woman in Red and the conclusion is a smart, silly and very funny comedy about a man who fells in love with a woman in a red dress although i got to say this movie wasn't as good as See No Evil, Hear No Evil cause that one had a great chemistry this one does work mostly because of Gene Wilder's charisma and talent and Kelly LeBrock is not in the film as much as she should her character is in couple of scenes and during the 3rd act the film kinda looses it's focus and tries to tell the story of other characters as well for example Charles Grodin and Teddy trying to tell him a joke or going into an unexpected birthday party and stuff like that and although the ending was silly cause he fall in love with another woman i found the film still being pretty nice not great but it definitely gets an 9 out of 10 just for Wilder being really really funny and that scene in restaurant when Grodin was acting like he was blind and he started tearing the place apart that was hilarious but still a weak 3rd act but a pretty good film overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I could have thrown my whole life away, and for what?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Wilder returned to writing and directing in 1984 with his film The Woman in Red. Starring Gene Wilder, in another lead role, Kelly LeBrock, and Gilda Radner, this very 80's comedy was a fun watch for audiences. A much better final product of Gene Wilder's directing abilities, The Woman in Red provided an insight into marriage as seen through married middle-aged men looking fir adventure outside of their marriage. Mid-life crisis are difficult, especially when four friends experience one at the same time.Teddy Pierce is a middle-aged man at a mid-level point in his career with a wife and two teen-aged daughters. He has hit a stall in his life and is bored. When he sees Charlotte (Kelly LeBrock) walk over a storm grate sending her red dress flying around her in the air, Teddy is hooked. He begins trying to change aspects about himself to make him appear more attractive to the beautiful younger woman. Teddy buys new clothes, straightens and styles his curly bush of hair, and takes up horseback riding. At each step of the way he is nervous to step out on his wife, as Teddy is the only one of his friends to not cheat on their wives, or run around outside of marriage. Teddy has a problem even gaining the interest of Charlotte, which becomes a full-time job in itself. When he finally does, Teddy must decide if his new quest for adventure is worth sacrificing everything in his life for. Everything about The Woman in Red screams 80's film. There was great Stevie Wonder movie all throughout the film, winning him an Academy Award. This was also a much better directorial effort from Wilder. He wasn't so unhinged, which may have been aided by his advanced age by the time of this film's production, which greatly helped the coherency of this film. The film is definitely not one to show to newlyweds or anyone with marriage on the horizon. Filled with characters who are cheating on their wives, having affairs with people cheating on their partner's, or thinking about cheating on their spouses; it definitely works to dissuade me from marriage. Hopefully, I'll still eventually marry and this won't turn me off of the idea completely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film changed my childhood!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possible I was one of the only children in my small town at the time of this film's release who had a crush on Kelly LeBrock. I know, I know, I was only eight years of age when I managed to see it, but something about it drew me in.Gene Wilder does what Gene Wilder does best - plays a very gallant and clumsy yet lovable character. I had not seen him in anything other than Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory before this, so I did know who he was.Kelly stole this film though for me. From her entrancing entrance on screen when her dress flies up around her waist to "that" lovely nude shot at the end - my eight year old heart had been stolen.I immediately did everything I could (there was NO internet back then) to find out more about her, and began to slowly learn little details, and even wrote to her "fan club!" I like to think I would have been one of her youngest fans, yet I never did hear back...Well 0ver two decades later, and I still adore Kelly LeBrock, have seen everything she's been in (even tried writing to her again after Weird Science and Hard to Kill came out), but seriously, this is possibly her best role - she suites it more-so than anything else she's been cast in (perhaps with the exception of Weird Science - but that's a whole different review!).The comedic elements to this film are actually very few - I consider this more of a romantic drama with a couple of comedic scenes rather than a full-on laugh-fest.The film paints a picture of Wilder chasing LeBrock which at times does feel a little forced, but is enjoyable nonetheless, because LeBrock is so beautiful, and Wilder is just lovable too! People who have rated this film low, have obviously no idea on what makes a good movie, nor a good story. This film is actually incredibly well written, and being an author myself, I can truly appreciate that.It was also one of the very few non-horror films of my childhood that I saw, so for someone who was an absolute glutton for horror movies to adore this film just as much - it's gotta be good, right?! Do yourselves a favor and check this one out. You won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Teddy Pierce (Gene Wilder) works in a San Francisco ad agency and finds himself on a ledge wondering what went wrong. Four weeks previous, he sees the woman in red Charlotte (Kelly LeBrock) doing the Seven Year Itch dance in the parking lot. He tries to make a date with her despite being happily married to Didi (Judith Ivey) with kids. Miscommunication leads to Ms. Milner (Gilda Radner) getting the call who assumes that she's going on the date. His womanizing friend Joey (Joseph Bologna) loses his wife who takes everything. He continues with plans for the affair anyways while the guys Buddy (Charles Grodin) and Mikey take Joey for a night out. He has second thoughts and stands up Ms. Milner while Charlotte doesn't even know who he is.There is no redeeming Teddy's antics but Gene Wilder gets a few good laughs in. I love Gilda Radner in this when she takes it out on Gene. The movie works best when Teddy gets put down. It doesn't work as much knowing he's lying to his wife. This movie should have more misadventures and hitting Teddy's nuts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are good, most not. Of the ones that are not, they still can be fun. This project made money when it was new, but is now not only unengaging but repulsive. Why is actually engaging, because it just cannot be explained by fading fashions.There is plenty of that: smoking, TWA, pretty airline "stewardesses," gay jokes, the implication that an "airline pilot" is both a status job and that they are tough. A gun joke. Below that is a notion of sexuality, manhood and marriage that is at least unfashionable, and noticeably as bankrupt as the currently marketed ones. It had all the attention that a success needs: two then popular movie comics, production values, songs by two of the then biggest pop stars... a script that was already proved as a success in France and (brief) full frontal nudity. So why did this age so poorly? I think it is because it was not good in the first place and viewers did not notice. Contrast this with "The Hangover," which banks on equally inept but currently fashionable notions in those areas. It is, however, completely novel, well constructed and essentially cinematic. This has none of those things to fall back on.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

Wilder's wife (Judith Ivey) is also along for the ride as a woman who may not be as naive as he thinks. Homosexual friend Charles Grodin nearly steals the show with his crazy antics as the leader of Wilder's unsavory pals. And don't forget Gilda Radner as Wilder's co-worker who believes that he has fallen in love with her rather than LeBrock. Sometimes funny, but really unremarkable little comedy that has that dirty little secret feel to it. In the end there are predictable twists and realizations that come right on cue. Stevie Wonder's smashing soundtrack (headed by "I Just Called to Say I Love You", the 1984 Best Original Song Oscar winner) lives on a little better than the film itself.

My only disappointment was thefact that some of the music had been changed for the DVD release - perhapsthat was why it wasn't released earlier. At the end was supposed to be Stevie Wonder's I JUST CALLED TO SAY I LOVE YOU played over the end credits -but now only a brief portion is actually heard. This is too bad because it really suited the storyline. This has happened to other releases on VHS &amp; DVD as well - most notably thehome release of Walter Mathau and Elaine May in A NEW LEAF - which on theVHS version that I bought had the background music totally changed. That's the one complaint that I have in home release versions of moviesreleased originally for theater viewing is that they fail to keep the same music and cuts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that many critics found this to be Wilder's funniest film for a long time has more to do with the paucity of quality in some of his earlier films than any greatness here. Wilder directs himself in a film which he also adapted from the screenplay for the French film "Pardon Mon Affaire", but is unable to bring the same life and zest which are the hallmarks of that production, despite adequate performances from a good ensemble cast, particularly the ever-reliable Grodin. The reality of the situation is that only the French appear able to make these gentle sex comedies with the flair which they deserve - witness, for instance, the vast chasm which exists between the entertainment values of Depardieu's "Mon Pere Ce Heros" and the straight Americanised remake starring the same actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Wilder directed and stars in this Americanized variation on the French farce "Pardon Mon Affaire", playing a married man who contemplates having a fling with sexy Kelly LeBrock. It sounds like a surefire set-up for a comic farce, but LeBrock isn't given much of a character to play (she's treated as a prop), and the other actors (Judith Ivey, Joseph Bologna, Charles Grodin) are just marking time with colorless roles as suburban deadheads. Gene Wilder has a few choice moments, but he's too fond of seeing himself be silly and he becomes a show-off. Thankfully there's Gilda Radner in a brief but very funny role as an office nobody/Plain Jane who thinks Wilder has a crush on her and then plots revenge; Radner, although helped along in her career by real-life husband Wilder, never got that great, hilarious movie-screen role after leaving "Saturday Night Live", which was a crime, but here she's used just right, and she performs without vanity or resorting to mugging. Wilder might have learned something from her. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From his position on the window ledge of a fourth storey room wearing only his dressing gown and slippers, Teddy Pierce thinks back over the last four weeks to work out how he managed to get into this situation. It all started when he was putting his car in the parking garage and saw a beautiful woman dressed in red walking across a hot air grill. He tries to ask her out on a date and keep it from his wife but things don't really go to plan. As his desire grows for this mystery woman, he finds himself getting deeper and deeper into trouble and lying.The headline in the satirical newspaper The Onion recently was "Gene Wilder's career in ruins after death of Richard Pryor" which at the time I thought was pretty cruel but on the basis of this film (which he directed and starred in) I don't have that much sympathy. Opening in San Francisco at least offered me something to be interested in (I'd just spent a fantastic week there a month or two ago) but quickly the "I've been there" novelty wore off as I realised that the jokes had been left in another city. The plot never questions Pierce's affair or the attraction that he offers to Charlotte. The female characters are about as broad as you like, with an angry one, a frumpy one and a perfect one; the male characters are just as simplistic and nothing in the writing offers anything of interest in regards the people.This leaves nothing but jokes about Teddy's middle-aged crisis-driven libido. Problem is, very little of this is actually funny. Teddy comes over desperate and frantic and it is this we are meant to be getting our laughs from. Wilder doesn't really help things by just mugging his way through this vanity piece of a film, his material isn't funny and he isn't good enough here to lift it. LeBrock is not to my tastes and all she does here is provide a body and a smile ? there is nothing else to her. Radner is amusing but Ivey is not. Grodin is a bit dull although Huddleston is at least lively. To be honest though, none of them are any good and in that regard they just follow Wilder's lead.Overall a pretty poor comedy that expects us to laugh at the unfunny and desperate failures of a man to have an affair with a woman way out of his league. As someone who likes Gene Wilder even I struggled to find any value in this at all and all the mugging and comic situations just fell flat at every turn. All in all a very basic and unfunny comedy.</fullReview>

Amazingly, he gets to first base, but... The story has been done many times, and this version is without surprises.The model is meant to induce more than mere desire. The audience has to feel her preternatural appeal for this movie to work. Unfortunately, she acts-and looks-like a robot. That kills the movie plot right there! Any redeeming features?

Nothing like playing a nice song like that at that moment. Hey, I am going to cheat on you, but calling to tell you I love you! All that said, this is a disappointing 80s comedy that has really nothing going for it. A few days after seeing it, you'll likely not remember it.

		<fullReview>"Pardon mon Affaire" is the French film which gets the re-make treatment in director/star Gene Wilder's "The Woman in Red". One is hard pressed to recall a memorable effort at this now common practice ("Three Fugitives" was perhaps the most enjoyable), and this 1984 movie is no exception.Wilder plays a happily married man who suddenly finds himself in mid-life crisis when he falls for a stunning young model whom he attempts to have an affair with. His naive pursuit of the woman (Kelly LeBrock) sees his once cosy family life and his safe existence soon rapidly unravelling.As a comedy the film is reasonably enjoyable, though most of the best moments are totally unrelated to the plot, which of course is rather weak. "The Woman in Red" doesn't work at all as either a romance nor as a serious drama about infidelity.Of course director Gene Wilder probably never meant for his movie to be taken very seriously at all, however the comedy alone is not enough to carry it, and none of the acting helps any either (Charles Grodin - with his uncanny ability to turn nothing into something - is the only exception). Not much to laugh at in this impotent show.Friday, June 10, 1994 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfunny film from Gene Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Wilder tries to pull off the triple threat of writing, acting and directing in this remake of a French film but he doesn't succeed, much like Jerry Lewis failed in his similar attempts. The film is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not funny at all and there's probably nothing that makes people cringe more than an unfunny comedy. No one is any good in this film. Charles Grodin, Joseph Bologna and Gilda Radner are wasted. Yet another model trying to be an actress, Kelly LeBrock, as the woman in red, stinks. Don't waste your time on this. Instead, see Wilder in his only good role as the hysterical Leo Bllom in Mel Brook's classic The Producers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This miserable production of a sham of a mockery of a travesty wasn't worth the paper that what passed for a script was printed on. Thee only action was heard and not seen, none of the characters had any depth, all the actors seemed to be reciting their lines directly from an invisible cue hanging between whoever they were sharing a dialogue with, and what's worse, they recited without any emotion whatsoever. Gene Wilder, while certainly a member of the more attractive part of the human race, has a lot to answer for with this shambles. He should have faded into anonymity immediately after his performance as Willy Wonka, for as a screenwriter he certainly fails to compare with Oscar Wilde and as a director he neglects to so much as try to equal the standard set by Alan Smithee. Woman in Red? More like S**t!</fullReview>
