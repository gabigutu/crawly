		<shortDescription>"Sadako? You did this?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2002, Dreamworks released a movie on American theaters called THE RING, by Gore Verbenski. It expanded to great lengths around the world. People claimed they had never been so scared while watching a movie in their entire life. Critics had mixed opinions of it, most for the better. But while the entire world was screaming to THE RING, others decided to reach out for the original version that Dreamworks decided to "hide" while THE RING was in it's theatrical run. The 1998 Japanese phenomenon RINGU (a.k.a RING.)Based on a 1991 novel by Koji Suzuki (claimed as the Japanese Stephen King) RINGU tells the story of reporter Asakawa Reiko (Nanako Matsushima), a middle-class Japanese single mother. Her latest story is the investigation of a mysterious urban legend that circulates around high schools about a tape that kills whoever watches it seven days later. She learns that five teenagers recently died from a heart attack at the exact same time, and that they were all friends who spent a vacation on a cabin resort exactly one week before. It becomes up close and personal when she finds out one of them was her recently deceased cousin Tomoko (Yuku Takeuchi.)Reiko eventually tracks down and watches the mysterious tape, and in one of the movie's many chilling moments, receives a strange phone call confirming that the urban legend is true, an element that reminded me of the 1992's similar CANDYMAN. She finds help from her ex-husband Ryiuji (Hirouyuki Sanada), a psychic with paranormal powers (an element obviously removed from the US version). Both Reiko and Ryiuji examine the tape carefully and realize it was shot in a nearby volcanic island. With only a few days left, they travel to the island where the dark, disturbing truth remains hidden, waiting to be discovered.Taking liberties from the infilmable novel, director Hideo Nakata (DARK WATER, CHAOS) and screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi (DON'T LOOK UP) were able to create what is perhaps one of the most impressive horror films of recent memory, challenged maybe only by the less-subliminal AUDITION. Nakata's direction already explains what makes RINGU so unique: The absence of music, limited photography, simple camera movements, and no cheap jump scares. The fear in RINGU comes from skin-deep slow burn. If you are looking for jumps, watch the American remake instead. Which brings us to the infamous RINGU vs. THE RING internet battle: A pointless one.The 2002 remake had more technological resources and a stronger desire to freak out the audience. Director Gore Verbenski decided not to copy the original and went for a less subliminal more artsy Dario Argento dreamy approach with a Nine Inch Nails vibe and a David Fischer love for rain. While THE RING improved on the upcoming flaws of the original, it had problems of it's own. Not wanting to change the subject, let me tell you the Japanese version is the one to see. The problem is that most people who watch the recent remake will hate RINGU, and vice-versa.Unlike THE RING, RINGU avoids CGI shocks and cheap jump scares like a plague. You won't find any suspenseful moments, chases, or any physical struggles between the cast here. While the remake scared you with fast zooms, weird camera tricks, and inhuman freaky bursts of weird noises, RINGU scares you with it's lack of... sadism. A good example are the videotapes. The videotape seen in THE RING is a Nine Inch Nails video, in a good way, with very weird supernatural images and weird gross-out quick glimpses. The original's videotape is shorter and maybe even weirder. It shows you different but equally impressive images that belong to a David Lynch nightmare while a "scratching" noise is heard on the background. A noise that was unfortunately omitted in the remake. The Japanese tape can be either laughable or scary depending on the mentality of whoever watches it.But what makes RINGU the phenomenon that it is today is the character of Yamura Sadako, who turns out to be pulling the strings. Not wanting to spoil the plot, I will just say that never since Hanniball Lacter has a character with such little screen time terrorized the audience as good. The American doppelganger Samara was badly used in the remake. While what made Sadako scary was that she was pure evil, the remake's screenwriter Ehren Kruger tried to turn her into a Batman-like repressed character that you are supposed to feel sorry for. This terribly reduces the impact of "the scene". Which leads me to "the scene" itself. If you ask anyone who watched either version what "the scene" is, they will probably know. Let me tell you that "the scene" is done much better in this version. I will go as far as saying "the scene" is hands down one of the scariest moments in cinematographic history, very close to the shower scene and the climax of DON'T LOOK NOW. The remake tried to hard with it's own "scene", adding CGI effects, quick cuts, and many other gross-out elements that the original didn't need.But RINGU is not without it's flaws. Either the fact that I am not Asian, or maybe that I am not familiar with psychics, but the whole Ryiuji character left me wishing for more. Maybe the subtitle translation didn't make it clear enough, but I couldn't connect to that way he always had an answer to everything. Not that Sanada's performance is lacking. He steals the scene and carries out most of the movie. Remember Bruce Lee in GREEN HORNET? Maybe not, but that is Ryiuji here. And Matsushima is equally good, although she is given less to do than her American counterpart Naomi Watts. I will give credit to the US remake by eliminating the psychic subplot. I won't forgive the fact that Ryuji's American counterpart is a pointless and boring sidekick which is what ironically gives Watts her chance to shine.RINGU is still a superior horrifying experience that you will not easily forget. Forget the sequels (RING 2), forget the spin-offs (RASEN), the rip-offs (FEARDOTCOM), or remakes (RING VIRUS and THE RING). It all rounds up to here. Be sure to watch Nakata's equally good DARK WATER, which is already getting a remake on early works. Oh, the humanity...*phone rings*(4.5/5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a word terrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS**Ringu is an unassuming little movie that my boyfriend and I rented from the local DVD store knowing little about it other than it had inspired a recent Hollywood remake.The first thing which accosts you when watching this film, is it's lo-fi documentary-style reality. Ringu has the look and feel production wise of a TV movie, but this only adds to the objective of it, to terrify.The story unfolds of an everyday Japanese single mother, the backdrop is nothing unusual but this is required as the bizarre begins to unravel before the eyes of the watcher. The woman has a child whom appears to be a strange little boy, and in many ways he parents her in her hectic schedule. Her ex husband is an amiable fellow, though he has an annoying quality to any female whom observes him which one assumes is the reason for the couple's politely handled split.The story takes a turn for the more macabre when a videotape emerges which is shrouded in urban myth. The short synopsis is you watch the tape and die within seven days of doing so. A group of teenagers inexplicably die, one of which is the niece of our leading lady. Being the plucky reporter that she is, she begins to investigate the eerie tape initially by watching it herself and embroiling her ex in this grim fairytale by seeking his counsel, on technical matters relating to the tape itself. The two find themselves in a race against time to discover the secret of the tape when their son watches a copy that was made. The bogeyman of this psychologically rattling outing, is Sada- a child or a demon?, perhaps a freak of nature? No answer is given and the viewer is left to their own conclusion and speculation. This reliance upon the viewers observational conclusion is what makes Ringu a truly adult horror movie above all others, we are not told what to think or moralised. Ringu simply displays the evidence on the nature of Sada, and leaves you to suppose whether she is a tortured victim cast from society, or simply a demon and nothing more.If the objective of any horror movie is to scare, then Ringu succeeds with flying colours. Everything about this movie is genuinely disturbing and unsettling. From the mythology of the tale to the ghastly contorted faces of the corpses that Sada, the demon of the story leaves in her wake.The grainy gritty production plays and builds upon anybody who dares to watch. The bittersweet relationship between the two leads encourages us to care about them and their plight. The story piques the curious child in all of us, and dares us to look when we should not, and tamper with things that are beyond our understanding.The absolutely heart ripping and bone chilling climax to this movie is unmissable. You will not be able to stop watching, but be wishing that you could rip out your eyes simultaneously!This movie is a quiet and unpretentious if imaginative little piece from Japan, which displays something that Hollywood has lacked in the horror genre in many years. The director has a true innate gift for knowing exactly what it is that we can not put our finger on that horrifies the human mind. This film is very Japanese, and I cannot imagine it doing well when converted to Hollywood form.Ringu is a movie made to be watched on your TV at home, exactly the way I did renting the DVD from your local store. This plays upon the very nature of the story. The TV is something we all think of as safe, it's in all our homes, and it is exactly this that adds such an overtone of terror to this particular filmAs an additional note, my boyfriend was flicking through the extra features on the DVD and came across the cursed video clip, and proceeded to watch it. I couldn't, I left the room. This fact serves as the best conclusion that I can muster as to the brilliance of Ringu. It is not to be missed, but do not watch it alone!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A joy (or rather, terror) to watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the fact it's subtitled - that only adds to the effect. The director's use of angles, sudden appearances of characters in the frame, wonderfully puzzling flashback and periods of absolute silence combine to form THE best horror film I've seen in years. Forget Blair Witch, this is a true horror story - it could happen to anyone. The Japanese location may make the story more remote, but also makes it more mysterious. The story would work in another locale, say, the Deep South, US, but there's just something about "Ring" which works due to its defiance to comply with cliche. Just when you think you've got the film nailed down and swaggeringly predict the next events, you're proven totally wrong and dealt the double joy and horror of a perfectly timed shock revelation or two. No spoilers about the ending, needless to say, you will not see this one coming...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring couldn't stand up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched The Ring before Ringu and was sorry that I did. Everybody thinks that the US always does things better. This is one example of how wrong those people are. Now, don't get me wrong, The Ring was a good flick. I enjoyed it very much, BUT, it really fell short of the original. So much was lost in the translation and in remaking it. If you have never seen The Ring, do yourself a favor and see Ringu first. It really shows how the Japanese can make good horror. The story is based on a novel written by Koji Suzuki entitled "Ringu". If you get the chance, you can pick this up over at Amazon, it's a very good read and shows you how the story was meant to be told. The Japanese film was a better adaptation of the movie. I give Ringu 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ringu and The Ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike some reviewers here, I'm happy to have seen Hollywood's 'The Ring' first. Now that I've seen both I would have to say that 'Ringu' is the better film (marginally).The Hollywood version was quite an unsettling experience in it's own right and having seen it first I rather expected 'Ringu' would be a 'ruined' experience as I was already familiar with the overall story and, of course, THE scene. After all, when the scene finally occurs in 'The Ring' the unexpectedness of it very much increases the shock of it. I hadn't been truly frightened by a scene from a horror movie for a very long time so I was unequivocally impressed.So when I got around to watching 'Ringu' my expectation was low. I assumed that the absence of surprise would diminish the experience greatly but, as it turns out, the difference in the styles (and some of the substance as well) was adequate enough to scare me all over again even though I thought I knew what to expect. Somehow I doubt that this would have been the case if I'd watched these movies in reverse order. I believe 'The Ring' would have been less enjoyable as it likely would have suffered from comparison.The familiarity actually served as a primer for watching the original. I've found that reading subtitles often detracts from the complete enjoyment of a film as one's appreciation of the visual content usually suffers from the distraction. In this case though, I found it to be less of a problem. Of course it certainly doesn't hurt to have the ability to rewind and in instances where I was unable to finish reading the dialogue completely you can be sure that I made use of it.The first difference that struck me was the teens found in the car. Like the girl in the closet in 'The Ring' their faces are frozen into grotesque masks, but the more terrifying aspect is that they have been 'gotten to' outside of their homes and all at the same time. This really drives home the realization that there may be no way to escape this thing. Safety in numbers? Nope. Don't go home? Nope, won't help.'Ringu' is somewhat more detailed in providing background than is 'The Ring'. The demonic child is shown in a scene that was omitted from the copied version and it adds a little something extra to our understanding of this terrifying entity. Also, I found that the valiant attempt to lift the curse by trying to 'free' the spirit from the well was more intense and claustrophobic (not to mention yuckier) than the American film.But what is it exactly that is so disquieting about both versions? Well, to begin with, the seemingly unrelated, disjointed and positively eerie imagery that is seen on the mysterious videotape really gets under the skin. The first time we see these we are troubled by the strangeness of them and thoroughly perplexed as to their meaning. We come to realize that a seed of uneasiness has been planted within us. The direction is masterful at nourishing this seed not only by showing short repeats of these images, but also by giving us incremental hints of what is still to come. We are briefly shown the well. Briefly again, the beginning of emergence. Briefly again, it's almost out. More and more I found myself getting cold shivers at each progression. The uneasiness is becoming dread.But there's something else that frightens apart from the film's construction. Is it the ultimate realization that this thing will not be placated no matter the heroic and well-intentioned efforts of the film's principal leads? Yes, that's an acutely chilling slant to be sure. But ultimately, I feel that the most disturbing element is that, were we to find ourselves in this position, we would be faced with a terrible choice - face the horror ourselves or deliberately inflict it on another. Escape it and you condemn your own soul. Now that's some scary sh*t</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsettling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows the story by now: there's a videotape which, when played, reveals a discordant string of disturbing images including a circle of sky seen from below and a man looking down from above, the word "Eruption" written over and over again and moving of its own accord across the page, a hooded figure pointing at some unseen accused, a woman brushing her hair before a mirror and, last but not least, a well standing alone on a neglected patch of land. The video ends and the phone rings...but there is only an eerie silence on the other end. In seven days, the viewer of the video is dead, their heart having suddenly come to a stop for no apparent reason. One such victim is a seventeen year old girl, and it is up to her aunt, hotshot newspaper reporter Reiko, to solve the mystery of the strange video.Like the American remake "The Ring," Ringu is not a perfect film. It leaves more than a couple of unanswered questions and may move too slowly in some parts to hold the attention of horror film fans who are used to a bloody slaughter scene every seven minutes. But for fans of good, spooky, old fashioned ghost stories, "Ringu" has a lot to recommend it.One of the things I appreciated the most about this movie is the complete and utter lack of gore. There's not a drop of blood to be found in this film, which makes the sight of so many dead bodies, their faces frozen in hideous screams of horror, all the more effective. The character of Sadako also has more of an impact than the child from the remake. Sadako never speaks, her face is never seen (but for one hideous, floating eye) and her presence is solid, unlike her static-y American sister. Sadako's emergence from the TV screen in the films final moments is worth waiting through the rest of the movie to see; it is a truly creepy moment which looks to have been filmed backwards as Sadako creeps with jerky, inhuman movements across the floor and up, swiveling to face her victim. That scene haunted me (no pun intended) for two full nights of broken sleep...mostly because Sadako seemed so terribly human, as sad as she was frightening. You pity her before you see her merciless side, and this throws the balance way out of whack. Unsettling, to say the least.This is a film about dread, about knowing that something dark and terrible is waiting for you and not knowing how to stop it. You can only wait and hope for the best...but the wait itself is the real horror, and the unseen unknown is the most frightening monster of all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to disagree with the comment above from Mike Washen. Indeed, the storyline of both movies is similar for the first part of the movie (no complaints so far), but the second part of the originals movie is more believable IMHO. The original has only one real special effect but this does not mean that the movie isn't scary. Especially due to this lack of special effects a better thrill is created al throughout the movie. One sees just enough to get scared. The originals story builds up a tad more slowly which gives a better story overall. If you are going for special effects, take the remake. If you like to see all 4 movies and like a scary experience overall take the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent atmospheric horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The storyline is based around an Urban legend that involves a piece of footage that causes the eventual death of anyone having watched it. A female news reporter, Reiko Asakawa , investigates this case after her niece is the latest victim of the alleged curse. From here on, the film follows the female lead's search for clues as she races against time to find salvation. Caught up in the events is former husband, Ryuji Takayama , who possesses latent psychic abilities which come in handy later on as things start to spring to light. The film is made in typical Japanese horror genre style that plays on the mind as well as including sudden shock effects. Fans of urban legend type horror will take delight in this offering from director Nakata Hideo and whilst the film does lack substance somewhat, it makes up in suspense and mystery. You are also made to sit on the edge of your seat by the film's soundtrack which is disturbingly quiet, subtle and sinister. The atmosphere is the key part of the film that makes it a horror masterpiece. The story is cleverly written to move at a rate which keeps the audience interested and finally end in a twist that sets itself up for a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tepid Techno-horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late 90s saw a resurgence of well-crafted horror movies that have to this day virtually reinvented the genre. The Eye, Pulse, Audition, to name a few, are truly disturbing films that create horror out of objects or elements which are the farthest from the genre: a medical surgery to reestablish sight, the Internet, videotaping.With Ringu, Japan came into its own with a legitimate tale of horror which implies that the act of watching can actually kill you, and that evil can and will replicate itself through elements of our own technology as a means of feeding itself and thus, spreading itself out like a web. This is the secret within the film, and the theme which later on defines it (and the Ringu series).Ringu is not an excellent film. Far from it. But it does manage to instill a decent amount of atmosphere and eerie moments within its narrative (although there were scenes which, like the book, caused unintentional laughs, such as when the bodies of the two teens who first saw the video were taken out of the car and we are informed they were "making out"; and Ryuji's sudden revelation that he too has psychic powers) without resorting to cheesy special effects. Spooky, but not terrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Hollywood Industry Insists in Spoiling Excellent Screenplays?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The journalist Reiko Asakawa (the gorgeous Nanako Matsushima) resolves to investigate the death of four teenagers who watched a videotape that might kill the viewer seven days after watching the film. The viewer would receive a telephone call and seven days later would die. She herself finds the videotape, watches the strange movie and becomes afraid of being killed. She prepares a copy for her ex-husband, who decides to help Reiko in her investigation, specially because their son has also watched the film. This movie is great, with characters well-defined, excellent cast and direction and a screenplay focused on the story and not in special effects. An original horror movie, with a tight plot. Why Americans insist in spoiling excellent movies? It is amazing the quantity of (expensive) remakes of marvelous foreign movies that Hollywood spoils. Once I heard that American people would not like to read subtitles, but I refuse to believe in such non-sense. The American remake 'The Ring' is not a bad movie, and Naomi Watts is a great actress. But why the remake? The modifications introduced by the American screen writer and director changed a simple and terrifying plot into an expensive, complicated and non-resolved story. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Ring - O Chamado" ("Ring - The Call")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just plain creepy ? really unnerving film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rumours abound about a video tape that, once you watch it you have a week before you die. When a relative dies in a way that suggests she saw the video, journalist Reiko tracks down the tape and recklessly watches it. She finds she is under the curse and shows it to her ex-husband to get his help. When her son watches the tape Reiko and Ryuji race against time to discover the meaning behind the curse to be able to lift it.I came to this only knowing the hype and the barest bits of the story. I knew it was meant to be scary and I wasn't disappointed. The plot is good in it's one word description but there are a few holes in it and something's aren't well explained. However it is a good story to follow as it is a form of a ghost hunt as they try to unravel the mystery. The whole thing has an air of uneasiness about it.The film has some very scary moments ? especially the ending which I won't even hint at. However for the most part it is just plain creepy ? which is even worse. There's no blood or gore ? just a real sense of being uncomfortable. The director has seen teen horrors before so he teases us ? he has shots of people with doors just over their shoulder, or the TV lingering in the rear of the shot ? knowing that we are conditioned to expect something to jump out ? but then nothing does. Instead the scares come slowly and blatantly really not being shocking but just making your skin crawl.The acting is superb all round although Sanada is a little stony at times but he gets better. The real star is the director who uses music and sound effects to get the eerie effect but also uses images that are weird to just creep out the whole film. I hope Hollywood directors learn what can be done with subtly rather than multimillion pound monsters or effects.I have said before that Fire Walk With Me was one of the creepiest films I've seen. And that was for the same reason, just making me feel uncomfortable and unnerved. Here this little gem takes that to a whole new level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a superb horror film. There's something about this film which gets under your skin, into your nervous system, and then it turns out the lights and creeps maliciously into your brain. The film has few jump-out-of-your-seat moments, and minimal violence, but as the plot develops the atmosphere becomes almost unbearably sinister and unpleasant. The climax of this film is one of the most frightening scenes in the history of cinema, and is guaranteed to turn your bones to jelly and leave you a quivering dribbling psychological mess.Forget the pointless Hollywood remake, go and see this film today! There are no cheap tricks here, no melodrama, just poker-faced top performances from the cast, and some genuinely unsettling dark ideas which will bubble away in your subconscious for years to come.</fullReview>

If you can sit through this film without a feeling of eeriness and not crack up at the final scene, then you must be some form of superhuman.Everything about this film is excellent.

		<fullReview>While I realize that it might simply be that I am an american with no knowledge of the japanese language beyond "Mushi, Mushi" and "Arigato" but I simply did not think this movie is as good as it is hyped up to be. In fact, (oh god save me) I enjoyed the American version of the movie more so than this one. Perhaps it was due to cultural differences that I simply couldn't 'get' this movie but I'm somehow don't think so."Ringu" simply did not draw me in and make me really believe in what the characters were doing. Like many Japanese movies, I simply could not accept that the character would really do what they were doing; it just didn't make sense to me that these people would go running around Japan trying to discover the mystery of the 'video' based on some people dying. The american version seemed to give characters some extra motivation to go in search of the truth, with unexplained supernatural events, scary dreams, etc. Perhaps its a testament to Japanese work ethic or American laziness but I just thought there wasn't enough to back up the characters actions.I realize it might somehow be hip to say that you enjoy foreign films more than their domestic counterparts and insult the Hollywood 'money machine' and decry the end of american cinema but I simply can't do it with this movie. The ultimate and final test to determine whether a horror movie is good is of course whether or not you are scared. And I can say that the american version of "The Ring" made me ruin a perfectly good pair of underpants whereas the Japanese version made me jump maybe twice and laugh once. The main problem this poses is which movie do you see first because seeing either film will ruin the ending of the other. And so not to take anything away from "Ringu" (which is, in and of itself a great movie), I can honestly tell you that you should see the American version first... and bring an extra pair of underpants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you were wondering what the difference between Ringu and The Ring is, I 'll try to sum it up for you. You remember that TV series adaption of Stephen King's "IT"? Ringu is a lot like that. There is a lot of reflection scares and horror-mystery elements, but it has such a weak pay off. With the American version, you get significantly better scares and death scenes. I would have been okay with the classic "scream then cut to next scene", but the black and white-invert color thing, too? Any respect or immersion I had was ANNIHILATED by those scenes! I laughed at the death scenes! Those scenes made Ringu is a complete and utter failure of a horror movie! I would still recommend watching it if only to see the original Japanese version, but that's only justification I could give. To be honest, I didn't find the American version all that good either. A tape that takes 7 days to kill you is just not that threatening to me. Now if Sadako were "Final Destination"-ing people near immediately after they viewed the tape, THAT would have been glorious!</fullReview>

I watched while I was alone one night and had to turn on all the lights in the house when the movie was over...and I am a horror movie nut from way back; I'm not an easy scare. Sadako is one frightening character. I'm in complete agreement with those who say this film actually is better on the small screen: it is an intimate film and being closer to the screen actually adds to the intensity.I won't rehash the storyline since so many others have already done so. I will just say that there is one scene in this movie that will imprint on your brain for the rest of your life. The whole film is wonderful...a great exercise in tension and anxiety.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hideo Nakata's 'Ring' is a masterpiece of the genre. Without a doubt, this is the scariest film ever made. It also marks the only time in my entire life when, upon finishing the film, I rewound the tape and WATCHED IT AGAIN without moving a muscle! This was partially because of how much I loved it, and mostly because I couldn't have slept anyway!Watch this along with 'Ring 2' and 'Ring 0' before seeing the crappy american version, as the remake contains elements (and scenes) from those two films as well.I also feel that anyone who likes the american remake more than the japanese original should not be allowed to have opinions about anything. Not politics, religion, movies, restaraunts, parking spaces..... NOTHING! Shun these idiots like lepers. Or just pity them...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supremely creepy Japanese horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ring was such a sensation on release that it led to a cycle of Japanese horror films. This Japanese invasion became known as J-Horror and they had quite an impact. Ring is a perfect example of why these movies were so effective. The cultural difference between the West and Japan meant that these films seemed somewhat unpredictable; some of the horror concepts and imagery were genuinely unsettling. We in the West could never have conceived of these ideas, they grew organically from Japanese culture. The unknown is often the scariest thing of all and the success of J-Horror is a perfect illustration of this.The basic idea of Ring is a clever combination of the traditional Japanese ghost story with modern Japanese technology. In it, a strange videotape curses anyone who views it, resulting in a terrifying death exactly a week later. It's an extremely creepy film that is truly unnerving at times. The pacing is very deliberate as we are taken through to the unforgettable final act. It's all about mood and atmosphere. It's quite economic with its shocks, relying more on mystery and growing tension. The key to the puzzle lies in the enigmatic weird video at the heart of the story. This bizarre short film leads the protagonists on a journey to discover the sinister secrets that underpin it. Strange details surround those who view the tape, such as the fact that their images in photographs become disturbingly warped. It's a highly effective central idea for a horror film.The visual presentation is very good, with some excellent cinematography. The sound design also works extremely well with the imagery on screen, adding to the ominous tone perfectly. On top of this there is good characterisation, which helps a great deal in giving the story an effective psychological edge. The husband and wife team are well played and believable; this makes their urgency in solving the mystery all the more pertinent. But nothing, I repeat nothing, can prepare a viewer adequately for Ring's one moment of true genius. Everybody who is reading this must surely know what I am about to refer to. I mean, of course, the moment when Sadako crawls out of the television screen. This must go down in the history of horror cinema as one of the most audacious and terrifying moments ever conceived. It's quite brilliant in concept and execution. The film may have been relatively subtle up to this point but after this scene perceptions of Ring suddenly and jarringly change. It's worth watching the movie for this scene alone.It was remade in America to much lesser effect as The Ring in 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have NOT seen "The Ring" (American) then I urge you to see this one first. Not because this version is "better"--actually, the American version is superior in my opinion. In fact, I gave "Ring" the score I did ONLY because of the originality and suspense of the plot line and the quality of (most) of the acting. The execution of the plot line, however, was completely and utterly ruined right in the middle. Right when the ex-husband OMG SUDDENLY HAS AMAZING PSYCHIC POWERS and KNOWS ALL. Can you say, "lazy scriptwriting leads to completely anti-climactic deus ex machina?" I knew you could. I think it also lacked in subconscious imagery to play up the creepiness and sense of dread. Some fans call this "realism" but for crying out loud, this is a ghost story and there is no realism in ghost stories! I will say, though, that the use of ancient legend and certain real historical elements lent it a very "shivery" flavor and that worked well with the plot.It's definitely worth watching though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike any western horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ringu (undubbed of course) was the scariest horror movie I've seen for very long. While "The Excorsist" was entertaining and nice, and "the Shining" was both hilarious (Jack Nicholsson) and effective, no horror movie I've ever seen has been as unsettling as Ringu.Nothing much happens compared to a western horror piece, where the director often spends a lot of time explaining and making things dumber for the broad audience, and squeezing in as much scary stuff as he can within the time frame. Ringu let's you think and make assumptions yourself, and doesn't assault your eyes with jump-scenes. Even though I had a rough picture of the plot, it was very tense and I was on the edge of my seat all the way to the climax.The climax was nearly unbearable to watch, not only because it was scary, but because the mood had built up to that one scene. It was masterful. The actors where good even though I cannot really compare since I don't watch a lot of Japanese movies.The movie is worth seeing, but not if you've seen "the Ring" first. Sorry, but this movie is spoiled for you if that's the case. To all others, I recommend this movie. It's scarier than any other movies that has come out since then.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ringu A great Japanese horror film about a cursed video with random images on it that is linked to the death of several teenagers. When her niece turns into the tape's latest victim a journalist makes it her mission to find a way to lift the curse.Now for comparing Ringu to The Ring.The Ring was an overall good movie, but it didn't really leave me with a sense of paranoia like Ringu did. There are many differences between Ringu and The Ring. A lot of scenes that where in the American version, such as the part where the father electrocutes himself in the bathtub or the scene with the horse, that weren't in this version.Highlight: The climax when we get to see the girl's eye.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fantastic. I can't say too much about it because it would not do it any justice! There would be no point! What I will say is that this movie is, without a doubt, one of the best horror movies in history and one of the horror icons. No doubt it has inspired a LOT of other movies - think 'the Grudge', 'FearDotCom', 'The Ring', 'Kairo' (very brief part where ghost with long hair over her face attacks Junco in the red-taped room), 'Phone', 'The Ghost'/'Dead Friend', 'Dark Water'... the list goes on! The ghostly girl with hair over her face may have become a bit of a cliché, but Sadako was there first! What's so great about 'Ringu'? Could it be the great actors? Or the suspense and shock around every corner? Could it be the thrill of the race against time to save yourself from Sadako? I think it's all these and more.If you don't see 'Ringu', then you're DEFINITELY missing out. This film is a landmark in horror. The sequels are good if you've seen this one first - this one is the main story, the sequels provide extra information. Actually, the seconds more informative and the third more dramatic than scary! But 'Ringu' is chilling to the bone. And Sadako is GRUESOME. Those nails. That walk. THE EYE! I love this movie so much, I have even made my IMDb name related to it and made my own LiveJournal based on Sadako! Or am I just over-obsessed? :-P</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film that rekindles your interest in horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I made the mistake of watching the US "Ring" before this, the original Japanese version. The US version is OK and indeed better than most modern horror films, but Ringu is superior and of course the impact of the famous ending is lessened slightly. This is the film that rekindled my interest in horror films after feeling for many years there were no new ideas or quality any more. As everyone knows Ringu follows the story of a cursed tape, once watched you receive a phone call that tells you of your impending doom. The tension of the film is the key to the impending terror, and it has a really cloying, dark feeling throughout. As is the case with most Asian horrors, especially the earlier films of the recent batch, the director does not make the plot too obvious to the viewer. You have to watch closely and decide a few things for yourself. I must admit I really enjoy this aspect of Asian films, you have to work at it, as opposed to the usual spoon-fed Hollywood story lines. There are some major differences between Ringu and Ring, the father is psychic, which makes sense, there are less jumps and telegraphed shocks, but the same dank, dirty atmosphere is there in both films. It is not a perfect film. It obviously lacks the budget of Ring and there are patches when nothing much happens which is difficult for an audience fed on constant periodic shocks. Asian cinema has a different pace, there are points of quiet, leading to out of the blue shocks. This actually increases the tension of the film, leading up to one of the most terrifying climaxes possible. Once you have seen the ending you will wish you hadn't, as you cannot watch it fresh again. A great film that is perfect for TV viewing, excellent acting throughout, with possibly the best ending of any horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5 months on, and I can't shake the image of that vengeful ghost.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being someone who defines themselves freely as a wuss, I usually tend to avoid Horror movies like the plague. In retrospect, had I known what Ringu would entail I would have avoided it like the plague. Not because Ringu is a bad film, by any means, but because it is singularly the most terrifying film I have ever seen.Ringu is a slow burner, with the action not starting until about 3/4 of the way into the film. The beginning follows Reiko Asakawa's investigation of a mystery tape that kills anyone who watches it, 7 days after their time of viewing.The investigation takes Reiko and her (somewhat gormless) ex husband Ryuji to a desolate island in Japan where they learn the story of Shizuko and Sadako Yamamura, the latter being the creator of the 'Ring' tape.Sadako's character is an interesting one, as her notions within the film are somewhat ambiguous. Whether Sadako is a lonely, repressed little girl or outright evil force is left unclear, though based on Rie Inou's superb eerie bodily contortions and ghastly presence in *that* scene, I'd opt for the latter every time. There is something unshakably evil about Sadako's character- I put a large part of it down to the inhumanity of her. Her strange bent posture, the freaky eye and the lack of articulation. Keeping Sadako silent was a fantastic directorial decision by Hideo Nakata; the shroud of mystery surrounding Sadako mean she is even more scary. For the short amount of time she is in the film, Sadako's character makes a huge impact. The simplicity of her move of choice is made terrifying by the familiarity it is contained within. We all have televisions, phones, and VCRs in our home but never expect these to be a source of terror. About 4 months on I still fear the television opposite my bed, and have slept badly as a result of this for months. I don't exaggerate here. If you scare easily, don't watch Ringu; it is unspeakably eerie. I've read a few reviews calling the filming and shots amateur but I personally think the hindered view is frightening- you never see what is near, working alongside the main premise of the film- the unseen is scary. I think it is beautifully shot, well acted and superbly climatic. A film as subtly conceived as it is hauntingly realised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest, most original horror film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ringu (as it is known in Japan) probably started the modern interest in Japanese horror. It established Hideo Nakata as one of Japan's foremost modern film-makers, and rightly so. The story is by now a familiar theme of video tape from hell that curses the viewer to die within the week. This is merely the mystery hook to initiate a much more fascinating and deeply terrifying story of the brutal death of a young girl and the manifestation of her will from beyond the grave. For those who haven't seen either Ringu or the Hollywood remake The Ring, it would be a travesty to reveal the cause of death to the hapless victims, but suffice to say that Ringu's sustained feeling of spine tingling unease builds and builds to a truly horrible catharsis that marks it as the most frightening horror film I have seen, bar none. If my phone had rung just after I finished watching this film, I would probably have soiled myself. Don't watch this alone. Although this film is in colour, it has a stripped down quality that gives the impression of it being almost black and white, which somehow adds to the tension and a feeling of loneliness. What starts out as a slightly ridiculous premise becomes a totally believable and gripping horror film.</fullReview>

Arigatou Hideo, your movies and your culture are a part of us now.The movie itself represents the contrasts between the modern and the past Japanese society, both truly respectful about ghosts.

One annoying aspect of the film is the fact that there is no resolution, it feels like the mission becomes a waste of time. i additionally feel that it is very hard for western society to understand how she could ask her own father to watch the film and die. however i feel that the film is psychologically very clever, ordering the audience to permanently wait for something terrifying to happen, even though it doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to horror films, no film has had the effect that Hideo Nakata's psychological thriller Ringu has had on me. No film has ever creeped me out the way Ringu did. Never have I felt such a thick, unbearable tension then when I first watched Ringu. And never has a film made me sleep with the lights on. To this day, after viewing the film several times, Ringu still gets under my skin, with it's bizarre imagery, slow burn pacing, and ultimately the most terrifying force ever seen in a horror film: Sadako Yamamura.The plot revolves around a mysterious urban legend too silly to be true. A strange video tape promises death to anyone who views it. Once viewed, victims have one final week. Reporter Reiko Asakawa(Nanako Matsushima) thinks it nothing but a silly story; that is until her cousin, young Tomoko(Yuko Takeuchi) and three other young students die simultaneously one night, a week after watching the tape. Reiko comes to possess the tape, and watches it herself. Now, with the help of her ex husband Ryuji Takayama(Hiroyuki Sanada), who has also viewed the tape, Reiko has only seven days to save herself from an inevitable death, and protect all that she loves from a powerful evil.Where Ringu strikes its audience the hardest is not with a gratuitous amount of quick cuts, ample jump scenes, or gory images It is all in the slow pace, the feeling of inevitable doom drawing near, for with each passing day, the characters are closer and closer to their final breath. The fear that the characters experience is shared with the audience, as the evil of the tape presses down harder, and harder, and harder. As the film progresses, questions are answered, but more are raised, and the super natural world and the physical world begin to collide. Watching Ringu is comparable to digging a pit, looking for answers, with no where to go but down, knowing full well that time is running out, and that giving up may be for the best.Director Hideo Nakata films Ringu is quite a simplistic, low key way, focusing on the mystery of the video and our protagonists quest more so than fancy visuals and cool images. Ringu looks very, ordinary, in most scenes. Filmed in such a way, the paranormal, downright disturbing episodes are exceptionally distressing and shocking, as they seem completely random and unparalleled to reality. And that's the beauty of it. Even during bright, outside scenes, the audience is never left to feel safe, for what is around the next corner remains unknown. The audience never feels safe. There is one scene in particular, the basics of which I will not discuss here, filmed entirely in grainy black-and-white, bringing all to the heart of the nightmare, and grabbing the audience at a rather unsuspecting moment. It is one of the scariest scenes in the entire film. And thats saying something. I also love Nakata's play on water and darkness, two themes that prevail throughout the film.The character of Sadako in this film is an absolute force- pure, monstrous evil. She lures victims, plays with them, keeps them guessing. Once you enter her territory, you lose all control. She is not the cute little girl seen in the American films. She is not the sympathetic loner seen in Ringu 0. She is not the sexual figure seen in Rasen. She is not the cheep scare tactic seen in Ringu 2. She is a powerful monster, a physiological demon whose powers sweep into the physical realm. Her presence is everywhere, even though the character herself receives very little screen time. Its all about messing with your mind, and that's what Sadako does best.The film's score by Kenji Kawai is also very noteworthy. Though not used often, when it is employed it it incredibly frighting. Distorted, surreal, piercing, and not overly dramatic, the score heightens the viewers sense of unease and surrealism. The films use of sound effetfs is also incredible; Not since the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre have sound effects created such vivid images.The acting is all very good. Nanako Matsushima does a great job in the lead role. She portrays fear and realism very acutely, and easily gains our sympathies as she fights to find an end to the tape's curse. Hiroyuki Sanada is brings life to his character, who himself is shrouded in mystery and intrigue. Yutaka Matsushige, who plays Reiko's young son, plays his part very low key and is quite enjoyable to watch.I can't really explain to you how or why Ringu is so great. It just is. If you like horror films, watch it. If you like Japanese films, watch it. If you don't like horror films, watch it. If you hate reading subtitles, watch it. Whatever you do, just watch it.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This deserves to go down in history as a classic of the horror genre and heavily deserves the honor of being considered an innovative movie in its genre, one that broke new ground. Japanese population certainly knows that better than myself. But does the rest the world too? That I am not so sure, as the Americans, as usual, felt like they *had* to spoil another amazing movie with some fast-food remake.'Ringu' is rich and complete when it comes to the horror element. Yet, this isn't purely horror, there is a dramatic story behind this groundbreaking styling. Suspense and the feeling of horror are intense, almost of the type "chilling to the bone", but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't sleep at night, unless you are oversensitive on that matter.This is the disturbing story of a videotape that is bad to the bone - literally. And me saying this as if videotapes had bones! It's just a force of expression, so do not take it so literally. The basic idea of the film is pretty simplistic but works out fine.The artists do generally fine in their acting. While asians are clearly the sort of people who are noisy and can be either shy and reserved or the type who can't shut their mouth, they do perform pretty well, as this movie proves.This should definitely be on Top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Reiko Asakawa's niece dies, she goes to the funeral and thinks it's just another death. But when she learns three other teens died on the same night and at the same time, and that they all watched a "cursed video" a week earlier, she realizes that there is a mystery behind it all...This is the premise for Hideo Nakata's masterpiece of modern psychological horror, Ring (a.k.a.Ringu). This film shattered box office records all across Asia, and by 2002, had spawned three sequels and been remade twice. Everything about this film is wonderful: the creepy atmosphere, the tension building, the acting performances, the idea... And the payoff sequence will leave you in total fear of your television. It will also make you craving for more. The movie is a great achievement within itself, proving you don't need gallons and gallons of fake blood to make a horrifying film. The story really crawls under you skin, and sticks with you. Ring is, in my opinion, one of the scariest films I have ever seen. Watch this, and you won't regret it. 10 out of 10.P.S.: Ring is available with English subs from company called Tartan Video, but if you live in the US (I do, but I have the Tartan disc), Dreamworks released it on DVD. And if you like this film, also see the director Hideo Nakata's other film, Dark Water. This is the only movie I have seen that actually can be compared to Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to overstate the impact this film had on modern horror and Japanese cinema in general. It was a bolt out the blue, a back to basics horror that re-affirmed the original principles that make it such an enduring genre. It's almost unbearably tense - creepy, atmospheric and downright terrifying.Ring spawned an industry within Japan but also brought J-Horror (dim lighting, grubby kids, face-obscuring hair, bloody-minded weirdness) to the attention of Hollywood, becoming the first in a string of films to inspire American remakes. But what the remakes lack is what Ring has in spades - otherness; a kind of indefinable and intrinsically unsettling Japanese-ness that is the DNA of the film and makes it what it is, certainly for Western audiences. Ring is really a modern take on ancient fears - contagion, in the form of video, and the fundamentally terrifying prospect of the supernatural becoming flesh and blood, dissolving the comfortable boundary between the real world and the imagined, through the medium of the television screen. Literally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember the American version of the movie. I sure watched it when it came out and remember being very impressed. but watching the original now, over a decade later I won't be able to compare the two.Which is fine since the original deserves to be treated like an individual movie. I can say for sure that it is a great movie and by now one can really say that it is a classic in the horror movie genre. It is one of the most successful Japanese horror movies that also started a big interest in the West towards Japanese horror.What makes this movie so great is that it is very atmospheric. The idea itself is original but not complicated. The atmosphere is very creepy and keeps one full of suspense. This is the better kind of horror than just some blood massacres.The suspense keeps a tight grip on the viewer and doesn't let one relax until the very end where we get some great twists that make the movie even more shocking and giving more room to imagine what comes next.The acting is not the major part of the movie where as I said suspense is what plays the greatest role. But the actors are really good fitting in with the mood of the movie. The one who causes all that horror is almost never on the screen and yet keeps the viewers terrified. Great work of art.</fullReview>

Ringu is the most successful film in Japanese history in terms of financial box office records, and is seen as marmite for horror fans (love it or hate it?).The first time I saw this film I almost wet myself. Seriously. Every twist, dark camera angle, screeching of the non-melodic soundtrack had my heart racing. Unfortatnutley, it wasn't true of the second viewing. The scares are obvious a mile off (due to long build ups), and in terms of horror it doesn't quite work.However, I would still say that as a film it still works. Unlike most of its fellow genre inmates, even with the horror stripped away, there is enough narrative to make the film work and the detective side of the story (although fairly underwhelming at times due to the easy accessibility of what they are looking for) makes it far more worthwhile than the typical slasher flicks that have plagued the horror films recently.The dark undertones (murky lighting, and slow panning shots) certainly create an atmosphere suitable on first viewing, but on second time round, without the shock value, they are a little bit too obvious, as if the plot is stuck in a linear rut in terms of style.The film is superior to its American cousin in my view due to the strong cast, and the horrifying first viewing (if you haven't seen this film I would advice you watch it with someone, with the lights on), and whilst directed very tastefully and artistically (and far better than any American horror of the last 10 or so years) lacks the brutal or horrific punch an effective horror film should have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See this one in Japanese!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all,you should see this movie in the original version.Why?Because it's based in Japanese culture and folklore.And,the remake won't give you the same feeling at all.It's Japanese.See it in Japanese. The basic plot is as follows;a short video clip is said to be shown on a local TV-station every now and then and anyone who sees it will die,within 7 days.Basically,all the victims seem to have died from plain terror,they are found with horrid expressions on their faces. Most of them are teenage girls. When journalist Reiko's cousin dies after seeing it,she decides to defy her fears and investigate the story to the full,helped by her ex-husband. What begins as sheer curiosity soon becomes a race for her own and her son's life.She discovers connections to a tale of a child with special and horrifying powers who met a dreadful end.I love Ringu.Psychological drama is mixed with good old horror movie dramaturgy to a nearly perfect horror blend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a breakthrough in cinema this film has turned out to be! The perfect blend of a very emotional tragic journey into the suffering of the soul. Strikingly well performed and executed, this is one classic horror film that will stand out and be remembered.Not often is there a movie that can open the gates of hell and release a horror tornado throughout the world like the Ring has, judging &amp; taking into account the newborn explosion of ghost stories both throughout the Asian cinema market and America. Most horror films out of the Asian league have been feeding off the similar premise that the Ring has created and this is a clear indication that it is the birth of today's modern horror template.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film that made me an Asian horror fan is probably the most tense and chilling horror to rival Audition. The famous plot about a killer video tape that will kill anyone who watchs it exactly 7 days later is told in such a great way that every scene delivers a chill. The film has some incredibly eerie 'humming' as music which helps make those shivers hit your spine. The camera work plays a major roll in the fear factor as well, swerving around to neatly reveal the shocks on the victim's faces. Those who viewed the Hollywood remake first will be more shocked as the famous crawling through the tele finale is even more chilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This films happens to be one of the scariest films i've ever seen.It is set in Japan and is the film that the American film "The Ring" is based on. The story is simple yet effective and the film has twists that are not clear until the end. While it is hard to understand as it has subtitles the action and storyline are exciting and creates tension and suspense, which will have the audience on the edge of their seats. The monster/killer is an interesting character and the film provides information on the background of the killer and why they do what they do. While people with a nervous disposition will be scared, this film is a must see for anyone who likes horror!</fullReview>

This film should be viewed with an open mind and with positive thoughts.I was pretty amazed how it went through and it seems to be unavoidable, when you hear about this tape, you know humans have the curiosity to learn. When they do, they're it. Same thing when walking into the house when haunted, you can't escape from your fate. If you have to watch this haunted video well, there is no stopping you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Asian cinema and after a long time waiting I decided to buy the ring to see what all the fuss was about. I found that it was very well made, but it didn't scare me nearly as much as I was told it would. The end scene is slightly scary, but i thought that was the only part that was. I have also seen Dark Water and The Eye which I enjoyed but did't find overly scary. I think this may be due to the fact that many films use a single image to create the shock. The slightly strange embracing of dead bodies which comes with a lot of Japanese films for example. I must admit I found The Blair witch project more scary. However I don't want to take anything away from the fact that this is a very good, original film. Maybe I have watched too many 'scary' films.Overall well worth a watch for anyone that appreciates good films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This horror movie scare the crap out of me, literally -- the last part (you know which part!) almost have me peeing in my pants! What impressed me most is that this horror movie is 1. Without blood, 2. No cheap camera tricks or CGI and 3. little screen time of the source of fear - Sadako. It relies on a formula of a good plot, good acting, disturbing soundtrack and great, great directing. In fact, I think the director is the star of this movie. The mood of the story, the way each scene is captured, letting you expect something might just jump out at you, but didn't - works really well at building up the crescendo of fear.Yes, fear is the element of this movie. It's not that kind of chased-by-demons/monsters kind of fear, but a quiet, disconcerting, uncomfortable and subconscious fear that have you screaming from nightmares for a few days after the movie. You'll be afraid to watch TV alone after dark and the ringing phone will have you jumping out of your skin! Don't tell me I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ringu (1998)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Japanese original was the first exposure to the world of the cursed video tape I experienced. It is still my favourite and is one of the best horror films of all time (along with such classics as "Don't Look Now", "The Exorcist" and "The Wickerman"). Upon watching it for the first time it was a fantastic departure from all the usual Hollywood slashers that were filling multiplexes at the time, the story had a simple premise but a complex unravelling of the mystery. From the very beginning the film creates an unsettling mood, and raises many questions, but doesn't answer all of them which is fine by me. "Ringu" is also a brilliant display of restraint, as the film builds up slowly, taking its time (Slow and steady wins the race). Less is certainly more, and the low budget proves to be a blessing rather than a hindrance, as simple techniques are used and the audiences imagination plays a crucial part in creating the horror. All the performances are very impressive, especially by Nanako Matsushima, who really portrays a sense of urgency and fear in dealing with the super-natural. The departures from the novel never once hurt this adaptation, all the changes seem justified and work well in the context of the film, although the characters do not develop as much, they do have more involved relationships. As for that infamous finale, it is the most terrifying scene I have ever seen, and the practical nature of its set-up makes the film seem nothing more than realistically horrific. The film is a real trend setter, a lot of films owe it their thanks. The film is anything but 'in your face' and so don't watch it expecting the horror to slap you round the chops. Watch, listen and think. Some of the psychic sub-plots may seem peculiar to some, but I just love a bit of foreshadow and telekinesis. The film is also the best introduction to the mythology of The Ring, which is a very in depth and well rounded creation in either novel or movie form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first horror Asian movie I had the luck to bump into in my entire life, and besides opening me eyes on a few things it made me a lot of good, not only because it scared me shitless. It was a few years ago: a late movie series on channel 4 i think, or maybe bbc. I didn't know that it was a horror movie, so I went on watching it. Brilliant. Absolutely perfect. And nothing scared me more in my life before. I have to say that after watching it i made 3 MuuMuu laws: 1. Asian horrors are the finest; 2. Asian directors have a finesse westerners can forget about; 3. never EVER look in a mirror, or a TV screen, or a picture [or everything still or moving now that i think about it], when you feel spookable, especially if you are alone. And avoid get in a lift in the mid of the night [its very weird if there is a big mirror in it, believe me, lol]. The last time i was so creeped was when i watched poor dolores claiborne's daughter in the scene on the ferry. I love that movie but I still avoid to look when it goes to that scene... YES i am a coward :D PS: It is so obvious that the new o-ho blockbuster shamelessly copied the posters... so sad really. They couldn't even manage a spooky one, lol</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FANTASTIC HORROR (there's a bit of a spoiler in here)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This gives away a little about the happenings in both this film and in the American remake, "The Ring." If you haven't seen either one or both, it might be wise to STOP HERE and hit the back button on your browser. I do try not to become too specific, but just to be safe...Unlike most American films, the fear inspired by this piece has little to do with gore, blood or violence. And the very structure of the film is distinctly (and, not to sound too biased, but in this case, gloriously) un-American. The entire plot style of an American film is to build up in a series of little jolts, to prepare the viewer for a grande finale, some sort of climax that will finally wind down and by the end of the film, all the loose ends are (psychologically speaking, anyway) tied up, rounded off, and smooth - leaving the viewer with memories of frightening imagery, but with everything resolved and taken care of. (In the case that it isn't, there's usually a sequel involved.) Such is the case with the American remake - most things get cleaned up. The Japanese film, though - in my case, I went into it not knowing a thing about the film. I'd never seen any Japanese horror films, or that many Japanese films at all, for that matter - at the tender age of thirteen I had no clue what I was getting into. I was glad to find it wasn't your standard gore fest, but a bit disappointed when it seemed to me to be a simple ghost story - I was hoping for something frightening. And, lo and behold, after my defences were down, after I was relaxed and resigned to the concept that it wasn't going to frighten me... Well, the middle-aged guy sitting in front of me screamed out loud.Personally I found that this was the perfect structure for a horror film. With such atmosphere and visual effect at the zenith, and so little to prepare one for it, it's far more potent than any other moment of any other horror film I've watched to date. It's certainly among the best of all of the true horror genre I've seen, if not the crowning title.</fullReview>

Maybe the only problem with this film is that it is subtitled I myself have no problem with this but I know some people will not watch or have trouble following a subtitled film which is a shame as those people will most likely turn to the American remake of this The Ring. Although the American version isn't at all bad it just doesn't have the same atmosphere as this film does. This film does tend to have a rather slow pacing but this all adds to the climax at the end, when I first watched this I had no idea of any of the plot details and really enjoyed the ending which was the best ending I've ever seen in a film of this type and I never guessed it unlike some films eg.

The actors play excellent roles showing us that a movie dose not need big famous actors to be successful.

		<fullReview>I finally saw this movie late last night on VHS and was quite impressed. I have not seen 'The Ring' so I have no basis for comparison. But the eerie atmosphere and creepy video set the stage for a good film. Surprised there were not many jump-at-you scare scenes like most 'newer' horror flicks possess (usually failing to scare you). There was one scene which actually made me stop breathing for a second. SPOILERS!! When Tomoko's mother is in her room talking with Ryuji and she points to where she found Tomoko dead- then yells "TOMOKO!" and rips the closet door open to see her dead daughter- scared to death. That was real unexpected. Great job!The video got creepier and creepier the more they analyzed it. Of course the ever-progressing well scene and the final movie scene was the keystone to the scare factor. I thought the actors did a great job portraying real emotion and fright. The only time the acting got to me was the (SPOILERS!!!) well digging scene and Ryuji gets grabbed in the arm by the corpse and then proceeds to hug the slimy skeleton. Not very believable- I think she would have tried to get out of there damn fast. The ending was awesome. The fingernails- or lack there of- was real unsettling. Overall- not too exciting- but if you are in the mood to get into a story and are vulnerable to being scared than this movie is a great pick. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based off a popular novel and has been Japan's most successful horror film to date, RINGU is a well made movie that tests your nerves while you cheer for the victims of the videocassette. I could never find the movie completely plausible for the real world, but it was good enough to keep the suspense of a race-against-time thriller.Urban legend becomes reality when four teens die a week after watching a videocassette while vacationing. The news prompts a reporter's curiosity, and ends up putting herself and her ex-husband in the same dire predicament.The video is a grainy, strange yet disturbing one indeed. For a horror movie the pace is slow and tries to scare you by non-abrupt actions. It is a compliment nonetheless, but because RINGU is more movie than experience, you might cheer for the couple simply because they are in danger and not because you know them personally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard about this film when the American film, The Ring, was being advertised for release in theaters. I'm a curious sort, so of course I had to track down and see the original film ;) In my opinion, the original far outshines it's American counterpart; Japanese films tend to have more in the way of thought-provoking content. This film, in particular, makes you work to put the clues together; they don't hand everything to you on a silver platter. You have to think in order to understand the progression of events and the motivations behind a character's actions.. to me, that's the essence of a good movie. I've purchased a copy of this movie on DVD, and will continue to watch it as one of my all time favourites; I highly recommend that everyone find a way to watch it as soon as possible.

		<fullReview>A superb horror thriller from Japan, Ring somehow manages to be remarkably unusual and innovative while at the same time stealing elements from innumerable Western precursors. Visually, there are nods to Poltergeist, Suspiria and Carrie while the plot borrows generously from Candyman.But Ring is the exact opposite of Hollywood's recent trend towards knowingly ironic, camp comedy-horror movies. This is a downbeat, serious movie full of a typically Japanese sense of fear and ambiguity, an interface between the modern, technological era and an earlier age of superstition, curses and vengeful ancestors. If Ring occasionally provokes sniggers rather than chills ? it's hard to know what to make of a film which pivots on the phrase ?Frolic in brine, goblins be thine,' for example - that's mainly because the film was made primarily with domestic Japanese audiences in mind. But even this ?foreign-ness' ends up as a plus, building up a genuinely unnerving sense of unpredictable dislocation.Seeing Ring on the big screen not recommended, it is probably better on the small screen. This is because the plot pivots on the malign influence of a ?curse video,' its power the focus of a fictional, but entirely believable urban myth: after watching the video, the story goes, your telephone rings and a voice informs you that you have exactly one week left to live.The story attracts the attention of divorced journalist Reiko (Matsushima) after four teenagers, including her cousin, simultaneously drop dead. She tracks down the tape, and watches its brief succession of bizarre, haunting images. Then the phone rings, and the film becomes a race against time as Reiko tries to ?exorcise' the curse, which soon extends to her surly ex-husband Ryuji (Sanada) and their young son, Yoichi (Nakatani) as they also view the tape. Ring shows an unusual attention to detail at every level, from Hayashi's multi-layered, evocatively cryptic script to Nakata's no-nonsense direction. The film has a deceptively flat, everyday look that contrasts all the more strikingly with the arty experimentalism of the ?curse video,' and the starkness of periodic black-and-white flashbacks - the rational world thus disrupted and subverted by ?impossible' manifestations of evil. Kenji Kawai's diverse score adds enormously to the growing impact of the story, as does the technique of announcing each new day with an on-screen title ? it's been done before in movies of all kinds, most notably The Shining ? but never with such skilful creepiness. Though it works brilliantly as an intelligent thriller ? and the final two scenes wrap things up with a pair of especially satisfying twists ? Ring isn't ?just' a frightening horror picture. It subtly dramatises the tensions in a Japanese culture that, no matter how urgently it strides into a westernised, baseball-playing, high-tech future, can't quite shake off the insistent ghosts of its mystical past, just as Reiko is forced to abandon her air-conditioned, neon-lit Tokyo office and head to the countryside, then to a wild, wind-swept island, then into the very darkness of the earth itself, to confront the demons that threaten her very existence. And if many questions, many tensions, remain unresolved ? a sequel and a prequel have already been released in Japan ? that doesn't mean Ring is either inconclusive or a lazy cop-out. Like all the great horror directors, Nakata is primarily a collaborator. He starts the circle ? we finish it.The American remake The Ring, starring Naomi Watts and Daveigh Chase was released in 2002.Verdict: Easily better than most modern horrors, Ring is a spectacular chiller which is thought provoking, and nightmarishly original. *****</fullReview>

Now do excuse me but I can't think of one good word from Verbinski's version simply as it is a copy...he just replaced the Japanese actors by Americans and for the rest, expect a better understandable ending, is the same. It's totally unfair to judge Ringu as I constantly was thinking now it will be that and now that simply as I watched it all before. What's better you say?

		<fullReview>I tracked this one down, having been impressed with the American version. Whether it is better or not remains in question, but what is not in question is the quality of this film. The film starts out with some nice tension from the beginning and carries it out till the very end. The Ring seems to be a scene by scene copy of this film till about two-thirds of the way, and then it makes some noticeable detours. I find that I enjoy both story lines equally. This film has some stellar acting and some very memorable scenery. What I did like about it was the differentiation of Japanese life from city to countryside. The film showcases the differing values and lifestyles with ease and strength. Ringu is also a beautiful film. The much talked about ending DOES seem to assume a sequel and DOES answer more of the viewer's questions. I heartily recommend watching this shortly after seeing The Ring.</fullReview>

I say luckily, because, having seen both versions, I definitely think that the original is much better. Not only is it more subtle, but it explains things more fully than the American remake. The American remake seemed to be full of special effects and things that did not matter as much to the story. Everything in Ringu meant something. In fact, The Ring seemed to be one big attempt to keep Americans attention, as if we were two year olds who could not pay attention to something as wonderful as Ringu. I would most certainly give this film at least a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ringu (1998) a film that inspired countless knock-offs and remakes (official and unofficial) all over the world. A old fashion horror tale about a vengeful ghost. Sadako is a scary but tragic figure, a victim of greed and exploitation. She seeks revenge for all those that did her wrong. Trapped in a dark damp well for many years she waits for that day when she'll escape from her prison. I actually enjoyed this film. The direction well good, the storyline made sense and the acting was above average. A few cultural differences aside, the movie had an aura of realism. You can view this film is many different aspects. I have read Ringu and there are many differences. But I like the changes that they made.The scares are genuine and the soundtrack is excellent. Highly recommended. This is the film that raise the bar in horror films. Often imitated by never duplicated (the American version noted). Watch out for T.V.s, unmarked videotapes and wells!Highly recommended!P.S. Reiko's looking good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyed it but not as good as the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried for some time to get a copy of this film having seen the American re-make. I was impressed with the re-make and found the plot fascinating. I have to say I was equally enthralled by the original, in fact in some elements found it to be superior. The key to this films appeal is the way the suspense, horror and unease is built with no gore or real action. It is just a slow relentless ramping up of suspense and the dark foreboding which is accentuated by the dark moody filming. I feel this is where this film scores over the re-make. The hollywood version comes across as slow and almost boring , in comparison. There is one key defining scene in both films (which I wont reveal of course)and , I have to say, this was done better in the new version. This is a great film but I think that comments like "best horror ever" are a bit over the top. Overall I would say, a great suspenseful example of sheer horror without the gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slice of the American remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just imagine, a writer in Japan who've written a book about a mysterious video tape killing people exactly seven days after they've seen it.... Some director read this book and make a movie of it, it's just that simple. But that doesn't mean it's not frightening.... :)Let's start with the story. Four people died at exactly the same time. A rumour about a killin' video tape goes around the streets. A journaliste start investigating and discovers the tape. She think that the only option is to watch the tape to unsolve the mystery.This are the most important things that you should know. The whole movie is 'dark' what gives it a frightening atmosphere. You feel the fear.... The 'monster' is very frightening, a great character. But.... ....if you've seen the American remake before watching this you know what's going to happen. The climax of the movie is not so scary if you've seen The Ring. However, it is still a good movie, and if you liked The Ring very much, I can you advise this masterpiece of horror. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies ever made, if not the best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film during the day, not the sort of time you should be watching a horror film, their for night time. I was so glad I did, this is the scarest film I have ever seen, I serious I still cant look at an off TV with out thinking about Sadako!FOrget the crapy American re make which so many people seem to like, I've watched and it sucks. This is a film that never needed to be re made, unless your highly intolerant of other cultures which holloywood seems to think America is.The film being based on a book has a very intresting plot, perfectly adapted into movie format. Many mistorys are make by the end, the sequale exsplains some of them and makes some more.For me the reason this film worked so well was because it was so un hollywood, it did not rely on cheap jumps and gore. Instead it relyed on tension and un ease, each scene took as long as it liked.It never realy tryed to show you that much, it left alot up to your imagination. This is why its so scary because you have to visualise it, all the way throught I was wondering what she looked liked.That sticks with, the ending is the best I have ever seen in any horror film ever. Forget the american version it will only spoil the end of this one, watch the two sequals as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than English Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented Ringu and The Ring over a weekend, giving me a chance to view them both in a short period of time. I found Ringu to be the superior movie. Like many remakes for American audiences, `The Ring' feels the necessity to explain far too much. There are masses of talk in that movie where the characters in `Ringu' are surrounded by stillness and thought. The quality of silence around the child in this movie reminds me the muteness of the child actor in `The Sixth Sense'.The American version is sentimental-although not as sentimental as I feared it would be. For instance, we do not have the divorced couple falling into each other's arms at realization of their common fear. However, this version does attempt to come up with a psychological explanation of the impending horror that `Ringu' does not need. Ringu's terror is a force as explicable and relentless as nature.The American movie shows the American couple desperately trying to solve their problem, to fight their way out of a box, to change nature. The Japanese couple also wants to avoid their common fate, but I am not left with people seeking to change nature. I am left with the image of people seeking to live within the natural world as it exists even as it seeks to destroy them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good atmosphere for such type of movie, but nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of people argued about which movie is the better, is it the original-Japanese Ringu (1998)? Or the American re-make Ring (2002)? Before I give you my opinion, I have to say that viewing one of the two movies WILL affect your review of the other one. I guess most people knew about the two movies after the release of the American version [since it's more popular], although Ringu (1998) was popular in Japan but not everywhere else.So, to get things straight, I'm one of those who first saw the American version: Ring (2002). And I'm saying this because it surely affected my opinion on Ringu (1998).Lots and lots of people are going crazy about Ringu (1998), saying it's the better one, and it's the original [yeah blah blah], and the most importantly, more scarier. I even heard [someone acclaimed] that the tape itself looks scarier too [now I found out that wasn't true at all]. From the very beginning you wait to get scared but nothing. Having seen Ring (2002) made me feel like this is not scary at all. To be honest, there was only two or three shots that I felt could be scary, but still not that much scary [and I'm telling you that I get scary easily plus that I find the-very-underrated-horror-movie What Lies Beneath (2000) is the best I've seen in scaring-me-by-the-mood genre]. When comparing Ringu (1998) to Ring (2002), the American version was much better to me. I find the American version as one of my best 5 horror movies. I know that there are people saying this movie wasn't scary, but I don't care. It was scary as hell to me.The best thing about Ringu (1998) is the soundtrack. The music sets the mood, the atmosphere and it's the only thing that proves this as a horror movie. There's a scene where Yoichi Asakawa [son of Ms. Reiko Asakawa] goes upstairs, that was nice. The directing is very good but not all the time. The Cinematography was good and was a big support for the movie. The acting here is good, although nothing special, but at least Nanako Matsushima [Reiko] did a well job. The story was very good, but can be confusing. Some people even didn't understand it either here nor in the American version, but the American version was quite more understandable. There are some differences in the story [for example there are no horses in the Japanese version]. I liked the American-version's story more, because this one [Ringu (1998)] sounds more extraordinary. The best thing about Ringu (1998) against Ring (2002), that Ringu (1998) sets the mood in the entire feature, which is really great to me. The best horror movies should always set the mood for enough length of time. A great example of setting the mood is Signs (2002). I don't think the American version laked this, since it kinda does set the mood somehow, it didn't leave a space for me to feel a need to have my mood set. I still have to give 4 stars out of 5 for setting the mood. Here is a high-suspense movie in which you even feel something scary was going to happen [almost] every moment in the process. The thing is that there almost weren't any scary scenes to hold up to that great atmosphere and mood [SPOILERS: at least that scene near the end with the TV was great]. Check out What Lies Beneath (2000) &amp; The Sixth Sense (1999) to understand what I mean. I have three points to raise here: 1- The Japanese language which I'm sure most of you don't understand it so you will waste your time reading the subtitles [instead of watching the movie] just trying to keep up with the dialogue. 2- The cultural differences which we are again unfamiliar with. 3- The whole new-American-movie-generation thing meaning we became unable to wait for something to happen for so long. We want stuff to happen, we want it now and we want a lot of it! [Aliens (1986)] In addition, Spielberg once said that if he made [the masterpiece] Jaws (1975) now after more than 25 years people won't get excited to it, because we learned to become impatient [and I believe he's right]. One last thing, is that everybody says low-budget never necessarily means bad, so why does high-budget [Ring (2002)] means bad this time?Bottom line: Someone said a theory that says: "Everyone who saw Ring (2002) first seems to have liked it more than Ringu (1998) and vise versa". So, to you, I guess you should see Ringu (1998) before Ring (2002). To me, I choose Ring (2002).3.5/5.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Runs Rings Around The Ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1998 Japanese film's American release was delayed due to plans for an english version remake, which showed up (as we know) earlier this year.Ringu is the most successfull Japanese horror film EVER, and has already spawned a prequel (Ringu 0: Baasudei), and a sequel (Ringu 2). Both, of course, are said to be vastly inferior to this fine, eerie gem from director Hideo Nakata (The Sleeping Bride, Chaos). Unlike the Americanized remake, this one actually makes some sense, and with about 1/3 the "explaining" used in the Seattle lensed clone. Great photography, solid performances, and some truly scary scenes earn this tight little shocker 3.5 stars from this humble reviewer.</fullReview>

A woman investigating her niece's death comes across a video tape that might have been the cause of her demise and ends up, unintentionally, putting the lives of her son and ex-husband in jeopardy in the process. Subtle and intelligent, which is exactly what the American remake was short of. 8/10</fullReview>

Of course the original is better on the merit of being original. Watching Ringu, I saw what an almost verbatim rip off The Ring is off of Ringu. And I wished I hadn't watched The Ring first, which ruined it a bit for me when I watched Ringu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd heard about this on the film circuit for a few years and when it was finally released on DVD in the UK I went and bought a copy.It's story is simple ? if you watch a certain videotape, then the phone will ring and seven days later you will die (in a shocking manner). A journalist starts digging around this urban nightmare and finds the myth to be true. She watches the tape, the phone rings, horrible screeching and then she has seven days to break the curse.To say anything more would ruin the various surprises in the film (and there are many). Where this movie really delivers though is in its atmosphere ? it gets right underneath your skin and stays with you all the way through (and for a while after). The fact that's it Japanese adds that mystical foreign aspect which really suits the film and adds to its overall creepiness.I have seen many horror films of varying types, from the bog-standard Hollywood fare to the more extreme stuff and I have to say that this film genuinely frightened me. I couldn't get one or two images out of my head for days after.Having said that, the movie splits its audience firmly in two ? either you are really frightened by it, or it doesn't work at all on you and you just find it dull. Half my friends found it almost too much, the other half were asleep.Personally, I cannot recommend this enough ? for whatever intangible reason, this movie got to and scared the willies out of me. Hollywood take note!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes a Great Comparison with the US Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I have a hard time choosing between the two films. I saw the American version first when I bought the DVD the day after the World Horror Convention in Kansas City. I just RINGU for the first time last night (August 2), along with RINGU 2 (In a very poor Hong Kong release DVD) and noted both the similarities and the differences. The US version had the business with the horses, the original had the volcano, something the is unique to each culture, as is the business of the lead female protagonist being subordinate in the original and much stronger in the US version. I found it interesting that the US version had to have her falling into the well, while she goes down willingly, trading places with her ex-husband. Both movies are superb and I recommend them both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow... And I'd lost faith in horror movies. Ring is the most unsettling and frightening film I've ever seen! The dark atmosphere leads tototal mind-numbing apprehension and when the climax hits... all that pent-up nervousness and anxiety burst in a wave of blood-chilling fear. *possible spoilers* The plotline: Reiko is a journalist researching the latest urban myth - a video that kills all who watch it. Without warning the investigation turns much more personal when her niece, Motoko, and her friends die suddenly. No apparent cause of death, except for the fear on their faces. Reiko tracks the video down to a cabin on the Izu peninsula, and watches it. After a series of disturbing incomprehensible images the phone rings... As the clock ticks both Reiko's ex-husband Rijuyi (i think that's how it's spelled) and her young son Yoichi watch the video, and the race is on to find the origins of the tape, and the mysterious girl called Sadako... Brilliant horror. ****** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reporter Asakawa Reiko (Matsushima Nanako) is in the midst of investigating the latest urban myth - a videotape that kills all who watch it - when her niece Tomoko (Takeuchi Yuuko) suddenly dies under mysterious circumstances.She discovers not only her niece but three of her friends died on the same day at exactly the same time.Reiko manages to track the four friends previous activities to the Izu Peninsula,where they stayed overnight in a rental cabin one week before they died and apparently watched the very cursed videotape that she has been investigating.When Reiko is able to find the videotape curiousity gets the better of her and she watches it to discover a host of inexplicable images that leaves its viewer with a view of a well before it ends (I've heard the DVD of this film has the option of playing this strange clip but has a warning from the producers that they can't be held responsible for the results!), afterwards the phone rings - The Ring - and when Asakawa picks it up she can hear inaudiable sounds being made by someone or something.Disturbed by the events unfolding Asakawa enlists the help of her ex-husband Takayama Ryuji (Sanada Hiroyuki) to help untangle the deadly riddle of the curse before it's too late.Together, the two discover the identity of a strange woman seen on the video as that of long-dead psychic Yamamura Shizuko.The duo go to Oshima (the birth place of Shizuko) to find clues.What they discover is the secret of the Yamamura family.That Shizuko had a daughter named Yamamura Sadako who mysteriously vanised thirty years ago.Later on they discover the grim fate of Sadako along with the origins of the video and the vengefull spirit behind it.The rest of the film details our duo's efforts to stop the impending inevitable doom that is coming...What is written above is just a synopsis of the film and can't describe the slow burning sense of terror that builds up as the main characters time is runing out(the screen fades to black and the date appears in white letters before each new day starts in the film).The twist at the end is a real humdingger that can't be described,you just have to see it for yourself.Walter Parks,one of the producers behind the Dreamworks version of The Ring,watched the Japanese original at 4:00 pm with an associate and were so blown away at what they had seen that by 7:00 pm the rights to remake the film had been secured.A fair number of the comment's I've read from people who claim to of seen both versions of the film often say the Remake is really great whilst the original is vastly inferior.I take exception to this because even though I have yet to see the Dreamworks version(although I plan to) I don't know how a film that could inspire a producer to spend money to buy the right to remake it on the same day of first watching it be so crap,for the life of me I just can't get my head around that one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishing- watch it before the remake, if you can!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a film in horror movie folklore like no other. On its release, it made little impact possibly due to the fact it was made by a set of unknowns and received little media hype. Within just four years it had gone from relative obscurity to cult superstardom, spawning numerous sequels, numerous Internet fan sites and the ultimate accolade- a Hollywood remake. This is Ringu.Shot in a dark cityscape, the film is drained of colour both visually and thematically. The characters drift from scene to scene and the direction is also initially stark. There is little love or emotion, with the possible exception of the relationship between the enigmatic child and his journalist mother. But this is intentional. Throughout the film, the audience is told little and the shocks few and far between exist; only appearing in the Scream-esque opening sequence. What makes this film so different is its sense of foreboding and stillness. The threat increases slowly throughout and the last 15 minutes are truly exceptional. Forget the Hollywood remake, which is effective if flawed- this is the real deal. Ringu, is not perfect, and sometimes is too slow and static for the subject matter, but no matter. This is a film that scares you, not so much while you are watching it, but afterward. It stays with you way after you see it giving many a sleepless night. Along with The Blair Witch Project- the most astonishing and disturbing horror film of the 90s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting psychological-drama, coated in a creepy ambience narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before my commenting any further, I must notify anybody that wants to watch `Ringu' you must first identify with the Japanese films rhythm. Appealing to the American style, Japanese will look slower on the pace and more reliable on the situation and the atmosphere it builds. So if you already throw away your American style expectation, then you can embrace this film with the good mood. If not, you'll find it boring and annoying (and incoherent crap, silly, or makes no sense!) Let's not talk about the plot, because it seems nowadays it already is well-known. Many people said it's a horror movie and I agree with them, but basically, it's a pure psychological-drama about a certain terrifying situation, which could happen to anybody (including you!). The plot development is structured and makes it feel good and overwhelming. There's no stutter or gaps that can annoy the film's pulse. The plot itself is simple (and really not trying to make an abundant cliché to scare you much). The eerie situations are not excessive and make it easier to pleasant. One thing that you must understand here is the film is not trying to scare you in an overacting way or frighten you in a gross blood bath (if that the term of horror movies by you!), but to make you realize that living is full of circle and your life is like a ring. I don't mind if you insist to have some creepy moment from those splatter instead. But what you could get from it anyway? Now, after you dive on its deep, you will feel satisfied for watching it. Of course it has it own absurdity and holes, but `Ringu' definitely is a well-done alternate product that manages to entertain in a good way. It's highly recommended for the fans of drama or (the true meaning of)horror. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original version here lacks many of the extras that one can see in the US version of The Ring. Still, it is a scary and brooding film. It is amazing how much of the US version retains from it. Much of the original story makes much more sense then then the US version and the story is much shorter. As a foreign film, The Ring is a great movie all by itself. There are many excellent outdoor shots at many fascinating locations. I have heard it was shot in Korea, but looks like it might be Japan. The cast is great and the movie is well crafted.So, which was scarier, this or the US version? I was expecting the US version to be much scarier and so my experience was dulled. Also, I knew the story, so it is hard to say. The US version should have been have been a shorter story as this one is, maybe not as short. There is much that is very scary in the US version that is missing in the original. But the US version might have omitted the role of the couple's child, this was a little over embellished and not in the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The American version of THE RING was not that bad in my opinion. I was told by many a people that the Japanese original was far better. So, yeah I had to see it.Recently, I discovered one of the cheapest ways to rent a film ever (and this was good because I see a lot of movies). Since you don't have to pay to rent movies at the library, just go there are borrow them. That thought had never occured to me before. So, there I get to rent movies that I have always wanted to see, but have never wanted to pay money to see. RINGU was one of those films. (EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and ELIZABETH were the other two).So, about RINGU...I found the beginning of the film to be much, much, much better than the American version of THE RING. It was actually very scary because you can always count on the Japanese to throw in an entire symphony of music right when there is a shocking image on screen in an attempt to scare the s*** out of you. It worked on me several times over. The middle half of the film was not as good. I thought the middle was extremely boring and it began to stray very much from the American version of THE RING. Sorry, I loved the first half of this film, and I feel that the beginning is much better, but the second half made me want to shut it off. But, then again, the ending does get better. The scenes where they are watching the videotape was classic and the opening sequence is a little better than the opening in THE RING. Overall, a very good film, but you should also see THE RING. You will also have to bear with the subtitles. But hey, at least it wasn't dubbed.RINGU: 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Ringu on DVD after seeing the U.S. remake (The Ring, with Naomi Watts in the lead role) in the theater. The two films are virtually identical in plot for the first 30 minutes, but they diverge after that. Ringu gives us more insight into the mysterious girl in the video and her mother than does The Ring, which deliberately leaves more in the shadow and leaves it up to us to draw conclusions. Both approaches work well.Naomi Watts' role as the reporter/mother in The Ring is stronger than that of Nanako Matsushima in Ringu. Whereas Watts' character is the central investigator in The Ring, it is Reiko Asakawa's ex-husband, Ryuji Takayama who takes the lead in Ringu. Indeed, Ryuji seems to have a special insight into the curse from the point where he first learns of it from his ex-wife. He knows more than he lets on, and it is he, not her, who drives the investigation.Overall, I enjoyed Ringu a great deal. It is a first rate horror film, using the unknown and unseen to play on the viewers' minds and build suspense. I believe that the U.S. remake does justice to the original, and would recommend it for those who do not like subtitled films, but encourage you to see both.

		<shortDescription>Was better than "The Ring".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone kept telling me how the original Japanese version of the Ring was better than our version so I tracked it down and finally found a copy of the Japanese version. For the most part I agree that it is quite a bit, better than our version. The story is basically the same as it revolves around a videocassette that kills anyone who watches it within a week. Though in this version, the images on the tape seem to fit the circumstances better, and more is explained in this one as well...though not all of it, there are still things that are unanswered. The atmosphere and mood of the movie are better than ours too, as the Japanese do not have constant music throughout, so there music cues make you a bit more edgy. The story of the girl's parents in this one is better too, and there is this thing with ESP that is simply ignored in our version. Here the father has ESP and that helps explain why the boy seems to have some sort of visions. The cast does well in this one as I think the father in this one is better than the American version. Though I did like the way the Ring looked in the American version more, and the scene where the boy told his mom that he shouldn't have helped the girl. This one ends basically looking like it has a sequel in mind, and considering there is a sequel I would have to say I am right. I hope it comes out too, as I would love to see it or any other Japanese horror, cause it seems they do a good job with horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers)this movie is deceptive. Utterly deceptive. You watch the entire movie and think, hey it wasn't that scary, but then you turn the light off. Whoops. That woman coming out of the tv screen keeps popping back at you.I must say I wasn't overly impressed until the last half hour. Thats when I figured out it's little game. By then it was too late. I was ensnared and couldn't find a way out.The remake of this movie though is to be avoided. Or at least watch this movie first. This movie doesn't contain alot of cgi fakery, so it's alot more to look at. I like computers, but todays CGI fakery is still so so. Makeup still beats cgi hands down.I don't like the fact though that the dvd doesn't contain the trailer for this movie. It contains The Ring trailer. And with The Ring dvd vice versa. Basically either way, Dreamworks comes out winning.8/10Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb japanese terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen both versions of Ringu (Japan-US), and I stay with the original; The ring sucks despite all it's money, tricks and visuals wasted in it. Anyway, Ringu it's such an awesome way to get you scared and, as I suppose everyone knows by now the main plot of this movie, I'll keep my comments short. The scares here it's not about gory scenes or dead people in a lot of make-up. What Ringu means the most it's psychofear. In terms of story development, it may seem slow -because it is- but this, instead of being boring, it does Ringu more and more captivating; this movie sucks you in it's premise deeper and deeper as time runs. I really liked the killer video, I liked the way they tell the story, I liked the story, and the directing, the acting, and the ending (it's explanation is way better here than in the US remake). I think the most important thing shown here is that you don´t need big budget to create a great movie. It´s clearly that they, instead of underestimating the power of the mind, made it an advantage because of it's capability to create images 100 per cent more horrifying than any scene they have or could may show. That´s what Guillermo del Toro does and Carlos Enrique Taboada did some years ago (both mexicans directors, and both great!). They use YOUR mind for their own benefit at the moment of get you scared and, based in the results, you sure can't fight against that; this si exactly what Ringu does (besides a few very good visual moments). If you like this kind of cinema, be sure to get a copy of this japanese masterwork of terror. And to watch it, turn off all the lights and turn up the volume. This enhances a lot the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now THIS is a GREAT HORROR film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not nearly as frightening as many people have claimed, it still is one of the scariest films out there. I mean, honestly, horror films don't exactly scare me to death like it does for some hyper-sensitive people who watch films. Now that's not a slight on the genre, however. I love horror cinema. I feel critics need to be more open and appreciative for the creative aspects of many horror films out there. They see a couple awful horror films (mainly in the U.S., unfortunately)and shut themselves out for others out there that deserve to be seen and given respect. They're really missing out, especially when it comes to Japanese Horror. And Ringu IS the primary example of how wonderfully dazzling the horror genre can be. Warning!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!! The idea of the vengeful spirit (Sadako) putting out a curse on society for living the life she couldn't live was brilliantly conceived by director Nakata with a hypnotic use of sound and creepy atmosphere in the air. Some complain that since it is not as scary as the hype made it out, it is not a good film. That's just not fair judgment. It was well shot, well composed, well acted, well made, and had a genuinely intriguing premise. It has high aspirations as a work of class art. It wasn't as fast paced as other films within the genre, but I welcomed that. It was slowly building up to a truly shocking climax. Some guy mentioned here that he saw the ending a mile away, yeah sure. Ok, maybe he did guess that Reiko was saved from the curse because she made a copy of the video and had her ex watch it...but there's no way he expected her to end up planning to have her DAD watch the tape to save Yoichi. I don't care what anyone says, that was unexpected. But it was a fitting end. It just takes the idea of the chain-letter to the extreme. END OF SPOILERS!!! In conclusion, not all horror films are junk meant to give some cheap thrills. Many are actually quality pieces of filmmaking that can provide the audience with an ample dose of entertainment, thrills, and intriguing tales. Ringu is a must see for anybody remotely interested in horror films and just films, for that matter. It is a classic so get the Region 1 DVD for those who can make use of it(Besides, it's better than the U.S. remake for those wondering, although that one was solid in its own right.) It is worth noting that I feel Ringu 2 was a disappointment, although competently made. But Ringu 0: Birthday, is a GREAT prequel and another GREAT movie from Japan, while not really a horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it's American counterpart has a lot going for it, there is something more when you watch Ringu. The Ring spends more of it's time focusing on cheap on second thrills throughout the film whereas Ringu builds up more which untimately leads to a better scarefest at the climax. The acting is very well done, even by those with minor roles. The actress who plays Sadako did tremendously well with her physical movements. The plot seemed more air-tight than the american version, the conclusion was more satisfying. Overall I give it a 9/10. Excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring or Ringu??? (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw both movies, and I enjoyed them equally. Normally I prefer the original one when a Hollywood remake is made (like "Abre los ojos" vs "Vanilla sky"), but this time I found them about equally good. The cursed video in The Ring was made better and the fly coming out of it was a great addition to the story. Also for once the American version didn't over explain, but explained less. In Ringu however, there's more symbolism and a better way of tension building. Even though the video in the ring was scarier, Ringu was more frightening. The atmosphere of the movie was just better than in The Ring. And the curse was better. In The Ring copying was enough, here you have to show it to someone else, you have to curse someone yourself. And even though Ringu explains more, it leaves more questions(psychological, not questions about the plot). It gives you a strange feeling, it stays with you longer than The Ring.So in conclusion they both have their ups and downs, I gave them both an 8/10. If the ups of both movies were combined into 1 movie, it would have been a 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was rather eerie, and it kept me waiting for something to jump out. The fact that it did not behave in such a way did not change the fact that it was making me nervous watching it. However I was wondering just why the countries around the world gave it such a severe rating.

		<fullReview>I've seen FRIDAY THE 13TH, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and SCREAM and highly enjoyed them, but none of them were as truly frightening as RINGU, wich is in my opinion one of the best horror movies ever. Those who have seen the remake (wich is IMO not scary whatsoever, sometimes plain laughable, often annoying) may be dissapointed and like the remake better for these reasons:The remake's pace is quicker. The remake is American. The remake has better special effects.I don't think any of these is a reason to like the American version better. First of all, a slow pace is one of the best ways to create suspense and a creepy atmosphere. Of course it's important to make the movie go slow, whitout making it boring. Ringu succeeds in this perfectly and made me be scared all the time. The fact that the remake is American and this one is Japanese has nothing to do with the quality. Some might be annoyed by the subtitles, but I'm used to reading them and I had no problem with the language. Then, the remake has better special effects... You can argue about that. I don't agree with it. I think the original has better special effects because it has no special effects. In The Ring, you get to see a (laughable) monster face that belongs in an Excorcist parody. In Ringu, the only thing you get to see of Sadako's face is her eye. Now to me, that's ten times as scary as ten thousand of these freaky monsters. Of course if your mainstream audience, you'll probably enjoy The Ring more. But true horrorfans will love Ringu more. I loved it. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty darn good horror film . . . but is it better than _The Ring_?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a word, no.There are lots of folks who cringe when I say that. However, I think I'm being fair, here. I'm an ardent supporter of independent filmmaking, foreign and otherwise, but I just don't think this one is as good the American version.First, what's been done right. This is definitely scary. It's also got a bit written in that its American counterpart doesn't. _Ringu_ steeps itself in an entire supernatural mythology that drags you in and refuses to let go. It also tends to explain things more than American horror does generally, and I approve of that. I'll also say that Sadako is no doubt one of the most disturbing things I've seen lately.Where this film falls short, though, is atmosphere. Nakata gives us a fantastic story but he can't consistently craft an atmosphere of suspense for an hour and a half. Sure, there are some _great_ scenes. (*The* scene at the end of the movie where Ryuji happens to look over his shoulder and see the television is fantastic.) Despite this, the film is too choppy and gives the audience too many breaks in the action to be really scary throughout. Admittedly, this seems to be a unique characteristic of much of Japanese cinema. I'm aware that there are cultural differences leading to this sort of thing, but this is a difference that just doesn't translate very well for me.The death scenes are just cheesy. Period. What is this, the 1950's? The corpses looked almost comic.See both films if you can. If you can only see one, get _The Ring_ and pass this one up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its as good as most say it is, but not the greatest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler I have to say I don't see why more people don't like this movie. All these posts saying that the film bored them to sleep, or that it wasn't really scary at all perplex the hell out of me. Ringu in my opinion was one of the most intense horror films I had seen for a long time, all thanks to a director who deserves more attention than some that are currently recieving it. What makes Ringu so intense is the combination of dark images, with one of the creepiest soundtracks in recent memory. Sure everyone can agree that the image of Sadako emerging from the television is scary, but with the inclusion of a sound like nails on a chalkboard to me everything was intensified. This is what the remake failed to understand for the most part( although this version does overdo it a bit with the creepy music, scary image shock. Sadako emerging from TV good, Reiko's picture distortion a little too much) opting for beautiful haunting images, and a good score from Hans Zimmer. Another plus is the thought of what is seen offscreen. For example when Reiko sees the Man with the Shrouded head reflected at the end of the film, or the image of Sadako in the television after the tape is first viewed, these are moments that work better than just a blur on a screen that the remake presents to the viewer. Another thing that amazes me about Ringu is that the story never loses control of itself like the remake does. Scenes like Ryuji's psychic visions, or the contents of the tape itself seem perfectly logical to the narrative. This can't really be said of the overly long video tape, the weird horse death scene, or Brian Cox's suicide in the remake. Oh and by the way the kid is less annoying in this film. The filmmakers here didn't saddle an eight year old with deep philosophical quotes that sound as corny as Maize. That just brings back to many painful Episode One memories (Are you an angel?) All is not well though. Even though it was perfectly logical the Ryuji tough guy act and Reiko scaredy cat act got on my nerves. Sure it fits with the characters and their professions, but I like the remakes use of the two characters better. Also better was the setup for the ending, which just sort of happens in this one. In the remake I liked the false pretense (Even though I already new what was to come) that Noah and Rachel were going to get back together and be a happy family with Aiden. And that moment (where it should have ended) where Rachel turns the chair around, priceless. Also disturbing was the fact that Reiko chooses to show the tape to her father to save Yoichi. Knowing who she going to show the tape to sounds mean since its her own father, even if it does set up the sequel in Ringu 2. Still a great flick, worth watching if you don't get annoyed when people in different countries actually speak in their native languages. I've heard too many complaints from people who didn't want to see it because its a foreign film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films; Japan's answer to Psycho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was not only one of the most tense movies I've ever seen, but the roller coaster ride to the end is so mind bending that it leaves you dreading ever to watch an unmarked tape again. The story follows a young reporter who is investigating an urban legend about a video that kills whoever watches it one week after viewing. When the tape is believed to have killed a relative and her friends the reporter goes in search of the tape itself and the story behind it. After finding the tape and watching it, she realizes that she only has one week to find the story behind it before she dies. The film is very well acted and the newly released DVD has a very clear picture; A lot better than the picture I've heard described on various websites. This movie is definitely worth watching because it is different than the American re-make. The story doesn't take as long to tell and there are several key differences that separate this movie from the American version and make it better. I don't know how this movie could receive a vote of any less than 7 from anyone who watches it. There is one last thing I would like to say... Although this movie is classified as horror, there isn't an abundance of blood and gore; It is more of a suspense/thriller/mystery than it is horror. It is definitely a must see. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, what do you know? The original DID make it here after all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After getting lots of flak about the Hollywoodized version of THE RING that audiences saw, Dreamworks makes amends by releasing the original RINGU with subtitles.I didn't even think I had a choice until I went to my local video store and the clerk pointed out that they had *both* versions. Delighted, I immediately picked the original (I haven't seen the American version yet) because... well, hey, I wanted the real thing. I don't like it when Hollywood remakes perfectly good movies "for me" to supposedly "devour" better: I want to see it in its pure and unbastardized form.I liked watching RINGU and found it quietly unsettling. I have the feeling that this is the sort of movie that is going to eventually work its way under my skin within the next few days because it's taking me a while to sort out emotionally what I experienced after watching it.The only difficulty I had watching it has nothing to do with the movie, which is really well done; it only had something to do with me. I suppose it's because I'm an artist and I've always thought oriental decorations and style beautiful, but I have had the opportunity to watch so few live-action Japanese movies that when I do, I tend to be so enchanted by all the things that are common to oriental culture but otherwise seem pretty and unique to my western eyes... things like paper doors, Japanese writing, lanterns, cushions on the floor and the like... that I keep going "Wow, that looks so cool" to the point of getting somewhat distracted from the main story at hand. That was the case here, as I loved the way this movie was filmed and was so busy enjoying all the decorations and such of everyday modern Japanese life that I kept smiling with the feeling of a happily travelling tourist. I had to keep mentally slapping myself to remember that I was watching a spooky story. ;) But that certainly isn't the film's fault.And so it is, and a very uniquely oriental one at that. The way the images and tale are handled, it's not just creepy. It's also sad, angry, hurt and hreatbreaking as well. I found one particular scene involving our heroine (please forgive me, I just can't remember the proper spelling of her name at the moment) deep in a well to be both unsettling and incredibly touching and compassionate at the same time, the sort of thing you just don't normally see coming from Hollywood these days.I wouldn't really call this a "horror" movie, I'd use the term "psychological puzzle thriller". I'm not sure if I would watch it again since the surprise has been spoiled... but then again, I just might. After all, I got the pants scared off me by THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now I love rewatching it because I loved "playing games" mentally with its content. So that just might be the case here, too.I don't know if I want to watch the US version, I'm afraid it might spoil it for me. If I do, I'll comment on it. But for now, I just want to bask in this special little accomplishment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ring, Ring, Why don't you give me a call?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And the search continues for a film so terrifying it makes me want to sleep with the light on. I recently received Ring along with The Eye. The latter has already been reviewed here and I don't really want to compare the two despite both being recent Eastern contemporary horror films. However for me, I found The Eye to be a more thought provoking, better made, and ultimately scarier film. And that's what horror films are all about, right kids?LOTS OF SPOILERS OF VARIOUS SIZES NO DOUBT FORTHCOMING!The story has been well documented so if you want a recap go look at the plot summary on the main page. Or rather, don't, and give yourself a chance to see a spoiler free film. I wanted this to be THE horror, the one that makes me shake uncontrollably when watching it and ends up affecting me for ages afterward. Sadly it wasn't, it just didn't scare me or put me on edge enough. The soundtrack was used rather nicely to build tension and suspense, but that tension and suspense kept ebbing away rather than continually building. There were very few big moments throughout, which isn't really a bad thing, but... For instance, at the climax where Sadako claims Ryuji, it was easily the scariest moment in the film, but I think it would've made more of an impact if we were given the chance to see Sadako or feel her presence more beforehand. It just seemed that for all the build up leading to it, more should have been done with it. The acting was competent throughout, but no-one really stood out. There were no prizes for acting here. I have one complaint though. At the end where Asakawa discovers what the cure is for the curse and is driving off to save her son, she seems to be remembering in her mind the voice of a girl who is basically telling us the cure and what Asakawa is doing. However, the voice seems to be from the same girl she was interviewing about the tape at the start of the film, so if that was the case, she would've already knew what to do to lift the curse and save Ryuji in the process! Minor quibble I guess, but the voiceover shouldn't have been there, we should have discovered that information another way. But anyway. It was a good film, a different kind of horror with a nice edge throughout but I was expecting more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard a lot about this horror film before watching it. For those who haven't seen it I'd say "watch it but don't expect too much". Maybe this works better to get into the "skin" of it. This movie was presented to me by friends as a masterpiece and as the ultimate horror movie. You'll be disappointed if you expect this. The concept is nice, it goes on exactly where you think it's over, some nice scenes too and an overall good atmosphere (you get the feeling of some good 70's horror films), but I think the plot -especially in the beginning- has some gaps and is going on somewhat fast. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it so i won't be specific. As a conclusion I would say it is worth your attention. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why its better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a lesson for Hollywood. Less is more. Everything is just more believable without CGI and special effects. From an asian standpoint, the characters were also believable, and made you feel sorry for them.Look, in Ringu, Riyuji was the more dominant character, an A-male with all the answers. I felt sorry for him when he died. I didn't feel the same for Noah. He was a wimp! Rachel was more dominant in the remake. I could go on about the gender-cultural context of the two movies but I guess my point is clear.Secondly, Ringu made good use of techniques to heighten the power of suggestion. Sometimes leaving the biggest scares in the minds of the audience. Example: Riyuji takes Asakawa's picture. He takes a look at the polaroid, but the audience doesn't see the picture right away. We first see Riyuji's reaction. This A-male-with-all-the-answers first looks puzzled, then disturbed. He hands over the picture to Asakawa, we see her reaction: Distressed! Then....WHAM! We see the picture finally with some twisted music! Bravo! I really felt bad for the pregnant lady in front of me. She was crying and begging her husband to leave. They left, which I think is a good thing. </fullReview>

You give the audience a LITTLE glimpse of dread and leave the biggest scares in the minds of the viewer.Case in point(spoilers): Riyuji takes Asakawa's polaroid picture. We don't see the picture right away. We first see Riyuji's disturbed reaction. Leaves us thinking...what could be so bad as to bring shivers down this A-male's spine? . He hands over the polaroid to Asakawa. She takes a look at it...she's DISTRESSED! Now we see the picture for the first time, accompanied by jarring sound effects....WHAM!! It was too much for the pregnant lady in front of us, as she was tearfully begging her husband to leave the cinema.That was power of suggestion at work. You knew beforehand what was coming, but the film prepares you for the scare. Hollywood didn't get it.Of course, nothing could prepare you for the final scene. Just as a fighter leaves his guard down when he thinks his opponent is down and out....he gets a fast one in his face. What makes it worse, is that Riyuji was the more dominant character(he had all the answers didnt he?). Thus, we feel sorry for him in the end. The same couldn't be said for Noah.Listen Hollywood: If it aint broke, don't fix it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ringu...Fact or Fiction???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who ever wonder if Ringu is based on a true story, then read on...Answer is, it's "semi" true. If you haven't seen Ringu yet, then I suggest you to go watch it first because you won't understand anything I'm going to say.**POSSIBLE SPOILER**The two unique characters in Ringu, are the mother and the child; Yamamura Shizuko and Sadako. The movie itself was base on the novel by Suzuki Koji. Shizuko and Sadako were based on real people.The idea of Yamamura Shizuko was from a real Japanese woman name Mifune Chizuko who lived during the early 1900s. Ironically, this woman possesses the same "future prediction" abilities as Shizuko. An assistant professor of Psychology at Tokyo University, name Fukurai Tomokichi, who has an interest in the supernatural, discovered her and took her to an infamous public demonstration that held on September 15, 1910. Her death was also suicide like Shizuko, but she killed herself by poisonous injection. She was 25.Lastly, the famous Yamamura Sadako was based on a psychic name Takahashi Sadako (That's how Suzuki Koji got the name "Sadako"). This real life Sadako was born right after Mifune Chizuko's death, and possesses the same ability as Yamamura Sadako. The ability is called "nensha"; the focusing of will to produce an image on film or some other medium (Spirit Photography).The internet has many detailed information and resources of these two women.*There was rumors of actual hauntings on both the sets of Ringu and The Ring (American Remake).*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japanese version is way better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**I watched both the Japanese and the American film and found this one to be better. I watched the original first and could not stay alone in a room with a TV for days. This movie creeps you out with your mind; none of those blood-guts and cheap sudden volume changes. All the things I loved in the original, the re-make took away. It removed having to imagine as it explained almost everything. Imagining how the first victim ended up in the closet is much more frightening when left to the imagination. I never saw Sadako's face and wouldn't want to since those who have died or became crazy. In the re-make, I found Samara pretty, not scary. Instead, the re-make scares you with just audio effects. I'd recommend that you watch the original first before the re-make.To all those asking what's up with the title, it's not "RING" as in a round object but "RING" as in the ring of the phone. Before you die, you HEAR the ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I say that because I never wanted to see a television with static again. Nor did I want my phone to ring. I saw this soon after I saw the American remake. This movie is downright creepy. Someone else before me said that anyone who found this movie scary has obviously never seen a scary movie before. So I guess I never have because I found this movie to be really scary. I like both this movie and the remake equally but for different reasons. What I like about this version is that it's low budget roots give it an overall creepier air than the remake had. I like the "whole less is more" approach. The acting was actually pretty good, especially the kid and his father. Some things were changed for the remake, like with the father having the psychic abilities instead of the kid. Also, there's no horses anywhere to be found in this movie. This is more of a psychological horror movie, so if you're looking for Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street, look elsewhere. It's a movie for those with the patience to sit through an increasingly intriguing film that is easily one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. I recommend this movie whole heartedly. Rating: **** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it yesterday in a theater, and it was a very good horror/suspense film, although I don't think I can stand watching Ringu 2 and the Hollywood remake. Now, I'm scared of TV static or even of my reflection in TV screens. I don't know if I should recommend seeing it, but do so at your own risk. It's not the movie itself that's really scary, but its effects on you afterwards (and on overactive imaginations) can lead to sleepless nights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A class on its own. A chilling story with a tinge of romance and comic relief.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One would think that "Ring" merely adds to the string of movies that do away with the blood and gore that traditionally characterize scary stories. "Sixth Sense" and "What Lies Beneath" readily come to mind in this regard. It is interesting to note that "Ring" was already shown as early as 1998, and, curiously, both "Sixth Sense" and "What Lies Beneath" also involve a then-unsolved murder. The respective plots of these movies also draw their "scariness" from the subtle, "near-dragging" antecedents of the murder, and how each detail is, rather startingly, revealed to the protagonist and, ultimately, to the audience. But, even if taken together with these movies, "Ring" proves to be the most promising in that it both created a new trend and added more to what it had already started.Intentionally or not, "Ring" is interspersed with comic relief -- the implausible facial expressions of Sadaka's victims, Ryuji's uncaring disposition toward his ex-wife, and characters appearing from nowhere. (As far as the first is concerned, one would later discover, particularly when Ryuji himself is haunted by Sadaka, that the facial expressions were the inevitable result of Sadaka's ineffable horror)Also, unlike the usually-graphic approach of horror movies, "Ring" instead relies heavily on suggestion and inference. Except for the ghastly reflections on the television screen surface and, perhaps, the eerie, distorted photographs (especially that of Asakawa), practically all the scenes were, in themselves, bereft of any creepy undertones. Not even Sadaka's face was revealed completely, and almost everyone in the movie house screamed every time a phone rang -- ordinary scenes made dreadful by conditioning references to a disturbing urban legend.Lastly, "Ring" is a laudable attempt at an Asian element to the horror bandwagon. True, "Sixth Sense" was written and directed, masterfully at that, by a fellow Asian. But "Ring" excludes the foreign element altogether. It is, thus, uniquely Asian in this respect.The American version has yet to be shown in this country. And, judging from its trailer, it appears to add nothing substantial to the original. But when it does come out, the question that would crop up is not whether it faithfully represents the original, but whether it even comes close to a new Hollywood standard unwittingly created by a non-Hollywood film. "Ring" is manifest proof that the sun does rise in the East.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well first of all i saw the ring yesterday rented from the shop, never heard of it before, but seems to make a suddenly appearance with the outcoming Ring that will strike our country only in November here at the movies, so i can't judge the US version yet.But What i saw in this movie, well it has been long veryyyy long ago i feeled like this, my god this was a grim movie. I say congrats because since years the US Movies in Horror hes gone down faster then the Nasdaq :) We have enough of that blood thing with big breasts and a script made in 10 minutes.K Here you don't get the most impressif acting or story, could have been done a bit better, but when i see the way the movie has been filmed, well it makes you feel on certain moments like you not alone if you watched in the dark alone, the only movie that done such feeling to me was The Shining. Since that day i never saw a horror movie again that made me feel something beside laughing at them of ridiculous.Giving this 8/10 for this amazing performance but should have been a bit more clear and a bit longer but great job!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Possible Spoilers**I saw this movie last night and I have to say that I am disappointed. I do like chilling movies that rely on building tension rather than blood and guts, but this failed to build sufficient tension for me to be scared. I think this is because the suspension of disbelief was too hard for this premise and not only that, it failed to explain the exact motivation for the deaths. There were just too many gaping holes in the story and even then it felt as if the story was stretched to thinly over its hour and a half's length. A missed opportunity then? Perhaps, but as I said earlier the concept did not make much sense to me.**MAJOR SPOILERS**How is it that a ghost of a girl that died in the 50's has a notion of video tapes, let alone put one together? What is with the title? Why did her father kill her? What is with the title? Goblins in Brine? What is the exact motivation of Sadako for killing/scaring these innocent people? What is with the title? I just didn't get it**END OF SPOILERS**The acting was wooden but that is probably because I am not used to the sounds of the Japanese language. The characters were cold and distant and I did not feel drawn in. This is probably down to the translation. The second is forgivable but the first is not. You need to be drawn in and be able to sympathise with the people involved to be able to build tension.It wasn't all bad, though. The last scene was creepy enough and makes me want to see the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd seen this film in the 'World Cinema' in the shop and looked at the precis on the back. It looked good (for a dubbed film) but not good enough to buy. Then a couple of years later it came on TV so I thought I'd have a look. I LOVED IT! I admit that I was slightly prejudiced against Japanese film after the Godzilla movies and various bad martial arts films that friends forced me to watch. I take it back.This film is by far the best psychological horror that I have ever seen. The premise is just that little bit too believable that you end up having that rush of paranoia whenever the phone rings or someone says "I've got this new video that I think you should see"...Watch this film if you dare. The mood is very claustrophobic and despite the low 'ick' factor, there are many chilling images and scenarios.I give it ***** (out of 5)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The japanese movie "Ringu" was so scary I couldn't quite think straight after watching it. It makes you feel so tense and alters your perception somewhat. The american "The Ring" is not as purely horrifying as Ringu and Ringu 2, as the pace in the japanese versions are methodical and steady as it gets scarier and scarier. You have to really see both Ringu and Ringu 2 BACK TO BACK to get the full effect. Ringu is essentially an exercise in fantasy-horror, an indulgent push into the strange human interest in the macabre. It is obsessed with two notions: suffering and rage, but highly muted. It is the on-screen equivalent of someone shouting at the top of their lungs in horror as the mute button is pushed. It's just very disturbing to sit through this thing, and I don't think many horror films can even come close to this one. There are several recurring elements that are of interest, most notably how news reporters are centrally involved with the downfall of the odd and strange, or interfere with others without concern, and the use of television to "babysit" our kids these days. These two elements reinforce the reality of the movie as they correspond with our own ideas of "meddling journalists" and "the danger of TV for our youth", adding a dimension that gives the movie more weight and pull for the viewer. A marvel, go see the original japanese "Ringu" now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, original Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the U.S. remake, The Ring (2002), a week before seeing this Japanese original. The remake stuck very close to this original, really only changing the background story a bit. Ringu definitely earns the originality points for this quality horror story. Though there were a couple added elements and variations that I liked in the U.S. version. Remakes are coming to Hollywood in droves. One pattern, I've noticed lately is to take a good, lesser-known, foreign made film and churn out a Hollywood version to make a quick buck. I have mixed feelings, because on one hand they are somewhat unnecessary, while still some of the recent remakes have been quality movies, like Insomnia. I prefer to see the original first, but it doesn't always work out that way. Ringu is a quality original story that is well directed and acted. It should be seen, but a lot of U.S. movie goers will never know about it and assume The Ring is an original film, while in reality it is just a slightly Americanized version with a few more jump cuts thrown in.*** (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay I'm a big horror fan...especially of movies that are played out realistically. Stuff you can really believe. Last summer I ran across reviews for the movie 'Ringu' and I knew I had to see it (even though it was hard to get here in the US) the reviews were so good for it, everyone seemed to truly be creeped out. Anyway I heard an American version was coming and I know I had to see the Original for the American one...So now I've seen 'Ringu', however...I think time I spent reading all the reviews about it kind of spoiled it for me...I knew what to expect...or expected something similar to what actually happened. It was a very good movie even though it didn't creep me out like I wanted it to. It kept me entertained with the unraveling supernatural-mystery type story. This movie gets compared to THE OTHERS, and I have to say, The Others did creep me out in the end...it had totally flipped me out. While I was watching the others I thought I wasn't going to be too pleased with the ending, about the time the kids snuck into the graveyard and figures *something* out about their housekeepers -- I thought that was going to be the big twist...and I was like 'well that wasn't too special' ...but after that they caught me off guard and totally blew me away...NOW, in 'RINGU' I kept waiting for the big thing to trip me out in the end...but it turned out the scene in the end that I thought was going to lead to something greater...was the creepy scene that everyone was talking about...so it kind of let me down in that way. (Although, remember when I saw it I wasn't completely unspoiled and that probably took away from the affect) Rating this movie is hard, but I think I give it 7/10. Now I can't wait to the the American version to compare them...</fullReview>

I have to say although its in subtitles, it is very easy to follow and absolutely worth getting hold of. The ending was top notch. No blood and gore here, but when the heckles on the back of your neck are standing bolt upright, and the goosepimples cover your body from head to toe at the climax, you know you have seen something special.It was so good that I went and purchased Ring 2, the followup, and Ring 0, the first and last part of the series.

		<shortDescription>Avoid this for your mental health?s sake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this last week. At the core of Japanese horror stories (and filmsbased on them) is the idea of "Noroi/On-nen". In this film, On-nen wastranslated as "curse", but this doesn't really bring out the darknessof what On-nen is. Curse has a religious sense where gods or spiritsexercise their "power" upon mortal us. On-nen is rather closer to"haunt" (for the lack of appropriate word in English, or the lack of myvocabulary). It is an accumulation of extremely negative, harmful, andpowerful emotion; a harsh mixture of anger, humiliation,disappointment, fear, hatred etc, piled up within ourselves. This isdark, heavy, and so relevant to us. And this relevance is preciselywhy we are frightened. Remember when you were dumped by the person youdreamed of dating, and then find out that the worst human being in yourclassroom is now dating that very person? Remember the humiliation,the frustration, the anger, hatred you felt all together? Every nightyou dream of them dating and spending all night together. Everyone?slaughing at you and cheering at the couple. Imagine those feelingsaccumulating and amplifying within you. Well, Japanese believe thatthose powerful emotion personifies. The blur line between the living and the dead adds to the gore. Itdoesn?t matter that the idea of a dead body coming out of a TV screenis cheesy. The notion of On-nen behind that sufficiently scares us. On-nen defies our sense of security that death parts everything fromus. Death does not free us from sorrow, fear, hatred etc. Death doesnot free us from our past, especially the ones we regret. They?ll staywith you like a circulation without end, hence the title Ring; andhence, I suspect, a sequel is in order.Ring has depicted powerfully the notion of On-nen, and introduced thisto the Western world. I hope that this will not be welcomed in theWest. This is too dark and negative to monkey around, and is beyondredemption. I hope this will be buried for long. If you have hurtsomeone very bad in the past, I suggest you avoid this for your mentalhealth?s sake.</fullReview>

This is a review of the Japanese version).I've seen a lot of horror movies in my time. I remember the days when I used to watch a fang-toothed Christopher Lee from behind the sofa, or shudder with horror when Oliver Reed howled at the moon.But then I grew up, and horror films were never quite the same again. Until yesterday.Yesterday I watched Ring on channel 4 television, and, believe me, I was scared.I don't claim to know the secret of making good film, but I do know when I'm scared witless. Ring was spooky throughout - disturbingly so - but the ending is the stuff of nightmares. It freaked me out. Even now, thinking of it, I feel the cold touch of fear.This is not a film you should watch if you are feeling depressed or emotionally vulnerable. And I wouldn't recommend you watch it alone, unless the sun is shining and there are plenty of distractions. It is very, very frightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1998, 'Ring' caused a turbulent murmur in South East of Asia. Itwas even banned in Malaysia and Indonesia, for whateverreasons. But as usual, the movie and its sequels were madeavailable in pirated VCD format and became an instant classic. Itssuccess was phenomenal, something to the equivalent of 'EvilDead' in the West. In S. Korea, it was re-made into Ring: Virus, itspawned several copycats in Hong Kong and many parodies overthe Internet.If you ever lived in SE Asia, you would eventually find out that it is adisturbing region with a long bloody history. Consequently many ofus grew up with stories, factual and fictive, of what in the Westmight be considered as ghost stories. Not surprisingly, many ofour ghost stories also relate to ancient villages' wells or hauntedforests and apparitions of a slim lady in a long white dress, herface covered by long black hair. The stories were told for generations in different versions andlanguages, but regardless of the divisions of nationalities, Ibelieve, we share a psychological fear of similar spirits andentities that we learnt to live with, through those stories.Having said that, 'Ring' is a haunting (horror novel series madeinto) movies by Japanese horror director, Nakata Hideo, whichattacks our sub-conscious fear of those stories we heard aschildren. His directing was superb: haunting atmospheres,excellent soundtrack and great performances. He avoided goreand blood and relied more on suspense and our own imaginations.The shots of vernacular oddities: the wells underneath the foresthostel, the earthquake, the dimly-lit corridors, the beautifullyfrightening lady in the mirror, etc. But any more applaude shouldgo to the writer of the novel, Suzuki Koji, who cleverly binds ourtraditional ghost stories with modern artifacts (videos and TVs)into a chain-reaction of curse. An endless cycle of hauntings anddeaths. Horrible ones.I was an amid horror fans for many years, Ring is definitely in mytop ten list.If Hollywood teenage slasher movies are tickles for you, Ring willbe a blow to the solar plexus.</fullReview>

I have not been genuinely scared watching a horror movie in many years, but these two films had me cringing... along with the rest of the audience. I knew the film was having the right effect because of the repeated tingles of fear I had all over my body, especially during some of the weirdest scenes. Something just made a noise outside the window and I almost jumped out of my skin! This was the Japanese version of the two films, which in my opinion probably can't be bettered. I have not seen the Korean copy and I doubt if I will watch any hollywood copy because it would spoil the image in my mind. The tense claustrophobic atmosphere of this film is very "Japanese" and cannot be copied. I highly recommend the Japanese version of this film! 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

Ring is good horror because it strikes at the very heart of our sense of safety in the modern world.Asakawa is a divorced journalist with a young son. She begins to investigate a series of strange deaths, deaths that have been linked to the viewing of a videotape. The rumour at a local school is that whoever watches the tape will die within one week.Restful moments, carefully considered colours and shot composition and excellent sound and music design all add to the suspense and sense of impending doom. The few minutes of the haunted video that we see are genuinely disturbing without being over-the-top or cliched.(I am dismayed that Hollywood has decided to re-make this film using American actors. I am also appalled at another reviewer describing the original's Japanese heritage as a "hitch". When will Americans learn to appreciate other cultures' films as they are?)Ring is an excellent film AND an excellent horror film. For best effect, watch it in a darkened room late at night, or a darkened theatre as it is still playing in many independent cinemas. But you might want to watch it with someone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better film than the genre deserves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a handful of the very best "horror" films - for instance, "Psycho", "Rosemary's Baby", and "The Shining" - and chances are you'll find they aren't really horror; at any rate, they don't belong to the same genre as "Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Hellraiser", whatever genre that may be. (The three films I named aren't even in the same genre as one another.) Horror is what you get when you have a mercilessly cold universe, protagonists who are hunted, toyed with, and ultimately helpless ... and while vivid gore isn't an essential component, something akin to it is: we must see, at least once and preferably not too much more than once, the living human body reduced to the status of an inanimate slab of meat. ("Ring" conveys this bloodlessly, with the disturbing photograph, and with the villainess whose body moves oh so eerily, like a cross between a cheetah and a sack of potatoes.) You can see why true horror films are by and large pretty poor affairs. I'll admit I haven't seen the genre's two or three recognised classics (except perhaps for "The Exorcist", which is unquestionably good but only questionably horror), but until recently, the only one I thought highly of was "Candyman"."Ring" is considerably better. Scary, no doubt, but also beautiful - there's a kind of sinister romance even in pearly-black, polymer-coated cameras and VCRs, and it somehow feels like the VERY SAME kind of sinister romance we detect in the calm open sea and the empty back alleys of a Japanese city. There's a nicely shaped story, protagonists worth the effort of following (we can care for them even if we feel they're doomed), some mystery at the start, but not an overwhelming amount, and some residual mystery at the end, but not too much. Perhaps the most refreshing thing about it is that it's got the guts to take itself seriously.My only quarrel is with the soundtrack, the "shock" moments being accompanied, for no better reason than to make us jump out of our seats, by loud noises (artificial, somewhat resembling the sound of a sword being pulled out of a metal sheath) that are neither representative of anything nor audible to the characters nor part of the musical score. I think this is cheating. But then, everyone cheats these days; no doubt many directors regard such noises as obligatory, like the whooshing sounds that accompany spaceships as they fly through empty space. A pity a class act like "Ring" couldn't stand apart from the herd in this respect. It does in every other. It doesn't need these noises, or any other, since its jolts are well enough engineered without them. Watch "Ring" with a large crowd and you'll hear a lot of laughter - the tense, unconvincing laughter of people who were terrified out of their wits a second earlier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a disappointment ! After reading so many good reviews I bought a copy of the video and settled down one evening with the lights off to watch it. Apart from the actual video itself, which is mildly creepy at best and only about 30 second long anyway, the rest of the film was about as scary as my cat. I almost fell asleep an hour into the film and couldn't wait for the (predictable) ending to come around. I didn't think much of the Blair Witch Project either, but in comparison to Ring it is far more disturbing. Don't believe the hype - this film is highly over-rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the single most frightening films since "The Others". Hats off within an instant to one Hideo Nakata. All I'm saying if Hollywood intends to do a remake just make sure it's done with someone who hasn't already had an established credibility yet, but more on the rise.From the creepy start to the shocking climatic conclusion this film hit every jolted nerve like blade piercing through skin. Scares a plenty. What was odd though was the film was released in 1998 in it's native land Japan and released over seas in mid 2001. However the interesting concept was how original and inventive the idea was of the ghost Sadako appearing through a TV and scaring one to death. Every detail from the music to the settings seemed to be perfect in every way. No flaws, not to mention outstanding acting from Nanako Matsushima as "Reiko Asakawa" and Hiroyuki Sanada as "Ryuji Takayama".Lets just say that if Hollywood does intend to remake this I hope it won't lose any of it's originality in terms of thrills and intensity.Excellent. 10/10</fullReview>

Unlike the mainstream blood, gore, shootemup,type of films, this movie succeeds in horrifying you by using the old methods of mystery,suggestion, and imagery as well as a wonderful plot which is based in part on actual events and people. My hat is off to the Japanese for producing one of the scariest films ever. Stunning performance by Nanako Matsushima and the rest of the cast. This movie is so good that Steven Speilburg has bought the rights and is remaking the movie for us Americans, but I don't know if even he can top the original...it's that good!</fullReview>

It's also a movie that you will be proud to share with your friends -- because you KNOW that they will enjoy it as much as you did! After about 5 minutes into the film, you won't even care that it's subtitled (trying saying that about Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon).

I though the genere was dead. Now, I had heard a lot about this movie called "Ring" on the internet and the imdb,people said it was so scary it made Blair witch look like kids stuff,They were right. Ring is one of the creepiest movies i´ve seen in my life, it keeps you on the corner of your seat until the end of it. The ending is so horrifying my girlfriend was not watching it, if you have a chance go to your nearest independent film video and get it. You wount sleep at least for a night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all those people who believe horror is on the verge of extinction, think again, it is very much alive. The director uses sound and your imagination to make this one of the most scariest films ever made. We do not see what happens to Sadakos victims but we do see what they look like when the bodys are recovered and it isnt pleasent but you will be shocked what they look like. The cursed video tape is not one for the most unstable person, although you dont see much but the images and sound used is a enough to scary anyone, on the dvd you get to watch the video but it took myself and mate half hour to pluck up the courage to watch it, sad i know but that is how effective the film is, and i urge everyone to see this film, before Dreamworks start work on the American version, and you know what will happen, it will be the director from Party of Five and the cast from Dawsons Creek. The film will be the opposite of the original and will be CRAP!!!!!!! Its a shame America cant think of films for themselves George Lucas take note.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some things in this review which may be seen as spoilers I don't scare too easily while watching horror movies. Most of them are either ridiculously boring and have dodgy music, but every so often, a film like Ringu comes along. And then, my impressions of the horror genre is changed. Ringu is the most scary film i have ever seen. In terms of making you Sh*t scared, this film is incredible. If you like art films, the music and ambience of this film is amazing. The camera work is superb, and i thought that the way that they used flashback and change of medium was very effective.This film is memorable not just for these things, but for the television scene. A woman pulls herself out of a sealed well in a video, and walks slowly towards the camera. She is almost shambling, and her neck is bent with her hair falling over her head, so you cannot see her face. She is wearing a white dress. Slowly she comes closer to the camera, while one of the lead characters stares, horrified. Eventually, her head is pressed against the TV screen. suddenly, the screen ripples, and she slowly comes out of the TV, dragging herself through. The man tries to run, but she inexorably comes closer and closer to him. then, she looks up. All you can see of her face is one shrunken eyelid, with a shriveled eye inside.then, it cuts to someone else. The music, and the almost balletic way that the scene is choreographed, makes it the most scary sequence in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best supernatural thrillers ever to be filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brilliant piece of japanese film-making, shows just how to make a modern supernatural thriller with the minimum of effort, gore-wise, using effective camera angles and superb music score, along with incredibly eerie sound editing, makes this one of the best supernatural thrillers ever to be filmed.The film has a very dark and sinister feel to it, and some of the most unsettling sequences is the video itself which is being handed from person to person in the movie (you can find this sequence in whole on the DVD edition of Ring 2). The flashback sequences have been wonderfully post-produced, black&amp;white with suitable amount of grain making it very eerie. One of the most complementary things about this film is the notion of violence, instead of making it graphical, it rather suggests it instead, forcing the viewer to go to the dark corners of his imagination - thus making the experience of the film even more intense.If you're not a serious film-buff the fact that it's japanese might set you off in the start, which is a pity, because this is film-making Hollywood can never, or hardly, achieve. But if you appreciate international film-making this is a must-see, especially if you're into japanese films.</fullReview>

The atmosphere (which is the essential ingredient for a good, scary horror film) was brilliant and the music was absolutely spine-tingling. The main flaw was that it left a little too much room for a sequel, and left some of the central questions unanswered.

		<fullReview>For a closed culture, Japan sure is a county that loves to shock. With extreme manga comics and shocking storylines, you can be sure they will make a horror movie to make you scream. And it has not taken them long. Or has it? Ringu is really a good movie. Maybe not as good as some other japanese movies, but its only fair to say the movie is scary, which is what it is meant to be. There are many movies that fail to reach their goals, and with todays standards and what people can tolerate, its a challenge for any filmmaker to produce material that will make the audience marvel in fright. The plot revolves around a mysterious video cassette, after it has been watched, the viewer receives a phone call claiming that they will be dead within a week - inevitably they always are! A young woman and her boyfriend are mysteriously killed after viewing the tape, so a journalist attempts to solve this mystery. I will not give up anymore details, simply tell you, this is a sure keeper, and one to stack with your other horror collectables.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to check it out because I thought the idea of "a video that brings certain death to anyone who watches it" is straight out of the Stephen King school of daylight-occurring-horror, which I like.The first half of the film felt like an eternity. So, so dull, with no real soundtrack (as I recall). But you really do need that false-sense of security for the second half..It's not a gory film, and I didn't fully understand the whole psychic powers bit until near the end (which is quite understated, so don't worry - it's otherwise a very realistic setting). Now, like the film itself, finally onto the good stuff..The second half gives me the creeps more than ANY other film I can recall (more than Twilight Zone. Stop sniggering). When bad things start to happen (I'm thinking of 'watching the well on the video') I almost turned away in boredom, only to see one of the scariest 'monster' scenes I've ever seen (and that's a short list!). Then all the plot threads start to come together. The rest of the film is easy to watch, because you suddenly become glued to the screen.Quiet, relentless horror. Now that's scary. And quite unusual.</fullReview>

I'm a huge horror fan and I've seen everything: Cheezy monsterfests, 80's slashers, Italian potboilers, giallos, gorefests, and finally psychological creepouts. The latter best describes "Ring." It has the ability to get under your skin without spilling a single drop of blood, slowly building to a really, REALLY creepy climactic scene....You have to understand that it's no "Scream" or "Urban Legend." This is no in-jokey, Kids of the WB starring lump of pop-bubblegum. It's a refreshingly serious, somber, well, "ghost story" in the vein of, yes, "The Sixth Sense." If you didn't like that film, skip "Ring." You certainly won't like it, go rent something with Josh Jackson or James Van Der Beek....and if you don't want to read subtitles, go watch "Dude, Where's My Car?"

Just as with Nightmare 14 years before this grabs you and doesn't let go without resorting to just killing people off every five minutes, but actually scaring you - kind of a mix between the Exorcist and Videodrome; don't watch it on your own, and make sure you don't leave your t.v on standby after seeing it.

I don't even usually like horror movies-- they don't scare me, and there's usually no point in watching a non-scary scary movie-- but I loved this one. Although people compare it to the Blair Witch Project, there is one big difference: the fright value doesn't depend on your believing "this is a tape of real events" throughout the film. I wasn't scared by Blair Witch because I kept noticing ridiculous details like the fact that Heather turned on the video camera before she turned on her flashlight. Ring isn't like that. With Ring, you know it's a movie, you can tell it's a movie, and IT DOESN'T MATTER because it could easily be both a movie and a real curse at the same time. That's what gets you long after you've seen the film, makes you wonder, makes you want to take precautions "just in case."A note about the movie's scariest scene-- when I was little, I used to imagine that this very thing could happen. I'm sure everyone's thought about it at least once, when they were little kids-- it plays on a rather obvious wild imagining. We know better, and yet we can't deny that we have once thought of it happening ourselves...The film is very dark, with mysterious shadows instead of clear outlines. It adds to the mood of the film. The VHS tape that I saw was not of the crispest quality; I'm not sure whether the DVD is like that or whether it was just that I saw a copy. Either way, with this film, it didn't matter one bit. In fact, the effect made it far creepier. I wouldn't be surprised if the DVD is deliberately blurred like a second-generation copy, because the effect--Excuse me, I have to answer the phone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a true horror fan and haven't already seen this movie then I strongly suggest you get hold of a copy now.Like other users I won't waste time filling you in on the story but just want to say turn the lights off,crank up the volume and, erm,disconnect your phone!.Trust me you do not want to recieve a phone call during this movie.Or after for that matter.Oh,and check this out.This is actually what it says in small print on the back of the movie box;'DISTRIBUTORS WARNING: TARTAN VIDEO LTD WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INJURIES OR FATALITIES THAT MAY OCCUR DURING OR AFTER THE VIEWING OF THIS VIDEOCASSETTE.' Sure it's just a clever way of building atmosphere for when you watch it,but ultimately it does give you one more reason to look over your shoulder as you're climbing the stairs to bed.As if the final 10 Minutes weren't enough.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a nutshell: Journalist finds cursed video tape watches it and has one week to unravel the mystery - or die!I won't waste time telling you how good this movie is - everybody else on the imdb can do that. What I would like to do however is draw your attention to an earlier classic ghost story. Although there have been many comparisons to the inferior Blair Witch the true filmic &amp; literary predecessor of this movie is Val Lewton's Curse of the Demon (aka Night of the Demon in the UK) which was based on M.R James's Casting the Runes. If you enjoyed this film and would like to see something spookily similar (and just as un-nerving) seek out this 1950's classic movie. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the hundreds (thousands?) of horror movies I have seen over the years only a couple of dozen actually stick in my mind as being truly frightening. None of these movies are really gorefests and only a handful are jump-out-of-your-seat scary. Amongst them are Roger Corman's Pit and the Pendulum, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House on the Left, Shatter Dead, Jacob's Ladder, Se7en, Night of the Demon, Romero's Zombie Trilogy, most of Cronenberg's early work, Evil Dead and Halloween. Last night I added another to the list, in truth very high on the list. Ring is without a doubt one of the most frightening, unsettling and downright mind twisting movies I've ever seen. It is the first time in twenty years that I have gone to bed genuinely afraid (by the way I just turned 40 so I should know better).I was expecting some kind of Japanese version of the lame slasher movies that have infested our screens for the past too many years, but had heard enough about it to be sufficiently intrigued. Also being a fan of Japanese cinema I knew it would be quite different to the Screams and the Urban Legends. A good friend bought me a copy for my fortieth - which was nice (thanks Chris, now I can't sleep at all). Why does Ring work so well? Atmosphere... it is soaked in the stuff. The common factor that runs through my short list above is an overwhelming sense of doom that this just isn't going to end well. Ring is played completely straight and in a somewhat understated fashion. We believe these folks are ordinary people trapped in a nightmare (their worst nightmare). There is little of shock value and no blood. There is just an overwhelming sense of creepiness both visually and audibly - from the hyper-real everyday sound effects, to the portentous yet subdued score, the disturbing TV and flashback imagery to the stark relentlessly brooding photography.This movie is still playing in my head, which is entirely the point. I know it's a movie but even so I won't breathe easy until next Wednesday night when I'm still alive... if I'm still alive!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No gore, no action, no suspanse music to make us expect things, no loud sounds to make us jump, no blonde bimbos with large breasts being butchered by some idiot, and no videoclip style direction to integrate a pop soundtrack just so the kiddies can go buy the Cd afterwards. This is a real horror movie, filmed in a way i haven´t seen it in a very long time, (with the exception perhaps of The Sixth Sense). Anyone who found that movie or The Exorcist boring to watch, don´t bother to see The RING because you won´t like it. But if you want your horror stuff creepy and atmospheric with a good plot and a good, but slow build up of tension, then this is THE movie to see.And don´t be surprised by the fact, if that by the middle of the movie you´re asking yourself, what the hype was all about. I know, it´s creepy, but it doesn´t look that particulary scary in a classic terrifying way, untill...Untill you reach the ending with the tv scene. Believe me, you´ll be trying to get out of the front of your tv, but you´ll be to scared and petrifyied to move. It´s just a brief scene, but you´ll never forgget it.After this (and if you´re still alive and didn´t died of heart attack), comes the great ending wich psychologicaly adds even more chilling factor, for the second time you may watch this movie, and makes this one of the great endings ever. After seeing that you won´t be thinking anymore that this was just a good horror movie. You´ll be thinking this is one of the all time greatest horror flics ever. Even despite having a very simple story when you think about it. One thing is certain, even if you won´t like it that much, it will stay on your mind for days, that you can be sure. This movie, The RING wipes the floor with all the Hollywood pseudo-horror crap, wich has been infesting american "horror" films since the last twenty years. Someone in Hollywood should be taking notes and learn how to do a realy chilling movie from movies like RING. And then again...stick with your popcorn teen crap fellas, it´s really preferible we keep getting our hands on more japanese movies like this. This is how you do it !By the way, if you have region 2, get this DVD at once ! It will creep you up, with it´s surround sound, and i doubt that after seeing the movie, you´ll have the courage then to watch the cursed Video, wich comes as an Extra on this disk. I didn´t. This is how creeped up i was after seeing The RING.Watch it at night. Watch it alone. With the lights out, if you dare. Oh, and if you have a good surround sound system, beware. Multiply the chilling effect ten times up. Good luck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japan rules once again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched Ringu and the sequel at the annual night film festival here in my home town of Copenhagen and what at treat! The first film is by far the better although the sequel isn´t bad either, it just can´t compare with the first one.The outline of the film has been told several times in other user comments, so I would just like to point out a few details I found interesting.The Ringu saga integrates modern and ancient myths to combine the background for the tragic and horrible story it tells. For many this integration of modern and ancient constitutes a key to the understanding of the Japanese.It is interesting the way the writers have expanded the universe of the story as we go into the second chapter. I haven´t read the novel so unfortunately I´m unaware if the author dealt with the topics told in Ringu2.But the force of this film is the continuation from the point where Ringu ended. (An ending that has to be seen, to be believed!) To compensate for this Ringu2 opens with a psychological shock, when we are told about the plight of the poor Sadako in the well.So we pick up where we left the antagonists of the first film, but cleverly the film takes focus on fresh characters. These are introduced in Ringu but left at the periphery of the story. Therefore the theme of the ring, of inevitability becomes stronger as they are dragged into the flux of things in the second chapter. The main characters of the first chapter still play an important role because they make up an integral part of the background story.The focus on the ancient myth building is a welcome insight into the old ways of Japan, as we visit the underwater cave in Ringu2, where the unwanted new born are left for the tide . It becomes clear that the birth of Sadako is the main catalyst of the story; Just the first of many horrible events to occur. However we are still left to ponder the identity of Sadako´s father, which is hinted at in Ringu but downplayed somewhat in R2.That´s all for me folks, I hope you enjoyed my ramblings. I´ll end with suggesting that you CATCH THESE MOVIES IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a comeback for horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outstanding, horror at its finest. Finally there is life back in the genre that has for some time been worn down to the bone by American, teen slasher horror, Wes Craven crap. If you're like me and agree that Wes Craven is not the king of the genre and prefer horror movies such as The Shining or the work of the Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg then I think that you will appreciate this film. This fresh movie boasts all what a decent and respectable cinemagoer wants from a movie, excellent visuals, great script, story and the thrills and spills are as well paced as the drama and the scenes of suspense are played out just long enough to give you a heart attack, and I bet if the phone rings after you've seen this movie you'll be washing the stains out of your underpants for weeks. Horror doesn't come anymore spine tingling than this, if you have any sense or respect for movies then I suggest you stop playing around on the Internet and watch this damned fine motion picture. The film has been compared to The Blair Witch Project and The excellent Last Broadcast, but I think it is the sequel of Blair Witch that is more similar to this movie, and there's no doubt that it's Ring that inspired the second Blair Witch movie. Don't let subtitles put you off as many did with the recent (best picture in my opinion) Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon because you'll be missing a hell of a movie if you do. I just pray that one-day Hollywood will learn from films like these (and I don't mean putting subtitles in films).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening sequence features two high school girls talking about an urban myth, "watch this video and one week later you are dead". They laugh about it but when one of the girls dies minutes later her journalist aunt sets out to investigate when it transpires that three of her school friends died the same day. Their only common link is that they rented a cabin the week before and watched a supposedly cursed video.Tracking down the cabin, the journalist finds the video, watches it, receives a call which tells her she will be dead in one week, and then she tries to work out where the video originated. With the help of her ex-husband she begins to piece together the story behind the video and the likelihood that there is truth to the curse. Every so often she experiences strange visions and a sense of dread begins to build up.This is an excellent film and one scene, where one person suffers the consequences of the curse is extremely chilling. If you get the chance to see the film - DO! You might not look at your television the same way again.The acting is excellent, the chills and suspense build up at a nice pace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately I can't say too much about this film without giving too much away. The plot centres around an urban myth of a strange video tape which, when watched, issues the viewer with a one week death sentence. This is no urban myth, and soon the journey to discover the secrets of the tape is underway, in only seven days.I loved this film, very well written and directed, with some excellent performances guaranteed to freak you out. Definitely not an in-your-face shlock slasher, it shows the recent spate of so-called intelligent creepy Hollywood films who's the daddy.It requires some intelligent thinking from the audience, instead of characters blatantly pointing out facts to the screen, the conversations are at a very normal level, with the audience expected to listen and understand rather than be force fed by profit orientated writers.With brilliant imagery, with moment reminding me of both Videodrome and Prince of Darkness, you're eyes will be working overtime as well as your brain.This goes in my top ten horror. Now I must see the sequel and prequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Files meets Videodrome in Japanese Horror Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nakata Hideo's twisty-turny horror movie, based on series of novels by Suzuki Koji, borrows motifs from such diverse genre pics as VIDEODROME, CANDYMAN and ONIBABA. Mix in a healthy dose of one of X-FILES better episodes and a closing shot ripped straight from THE TERMINATOR and you'd probably expect an unholy mess. Well, you'd be half right because this is one of the most disturbing cinematic experiences in recent memory. The premise, a cursed videotape that dooms the viewer to a bizarre death exactly one week after watching it, may seem hard to swallow but Nakata plays it straight and an atmosphere of dread pervades the film. Characterisation is minimal but effective with good performances from the two leads as an estranged husband and wife fighting against time to save themselves and their young son from the curse. What really makes this film work though, in ways that superficially similar Hollywood efforts often don't, is a plot that constantly throws suprises at you right up until the final scenes. There is also some startling and genuinly unsettling imagery and very clever editing. RINGU may be nothing more than an effective little shocker but it makes most big budget Hollywood "psychological thrillers" look as anaemic as Sadako, the melancholy spirit at the center of the madness.

		<fullReview>OK so this is the movie that started the horrorwave in Japan. If you want to make a movie as a director in Japan the first thing a financer asks you is if it is going to be a horror. Why??? All because 'Ringu' was a box-office smash hit in Japan. Remind you of an American horrormovie that did the same??? Yes 'Scream' started the whole new teenage horrorwave in Hollywood. When you look at the beginning of 'Ringu' you are asking yourself if it's a Japanese remake of 'Scream'. The thing is that 'Ringu' is better than 'Scream'. Not that it has much in common besides the teenagers and opening scene because the story is better and spookier. A videotape that kills whomever looks at it? Or is it a person who kills the people who look at the tape? Well it all is very spooky. The thing about this movie is that it is too slow. There is nothing wrong with slow movies but the slowness kind off hurt the movie. The result is a middle part which is a little boring. The whole theory of getting to the well and meet Sadako was all a waste of time we know at the end. It didn't add to the story. Now the good things. The direction sometimes was just perfect especially the black and white parts were just beautifully integrated in the whole movie. And the ending!!!! The ending is just SO COOL! Sadako is like a sister of Mike Myers only more original. Just see it if only for the ending. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fascination of "Ring"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Ring" films have become a phenomena in Japan, with two sequels already out on video, and a fourth in theaters now. However, not many people outside of Japan may be aware that the initial excitement was generated from the TV mini-series. If you aren't familiar with "Ring", the films and the TV series are based on a novel. The plot revolves around a mysterious videotape. Anyone who views the tape will die in seven days unless...Well, I don't want to give away the details. A reporter doing a story on the tape, which is circulating among school children, views it, and the race is on to escape the curse. In the TV series, the tape has a music video on it. It is only through thorough analysis that the strange messages appear. However, this only scratches the surface. Something sinister lies behind the tape; events in the past which have created this curse. Like the films, the TV series has some chilling moments, and boasts fine acting. Also, the cinematography is excellent (too often overlooked in American TV). I was first drawn to the series at a Japanese video store in my town. I am interested in Japanese horror films, and the owner recommended this. Even without English subtitles, I found the series captivating and, at times, even terrifying. It is really hard to go into details without giving away key plot points. I will say that this is a good example of the quality that Japanese TV has to offer, and I whole-heartedly recommend viewing this series. Incidentally, there was also a TV series made of the second film, "Rasen", and it is very good as well.</fullReview>

A rather long time has passed where the Great Classic such as Jacob Ladder, The Exorcist and The Shining bring great fear to audiences. In Singapore, the horror movies that we exposed are usually from the HongKong Film Industry where many gory effects are over used which made it unbelievable.However, this year, we have the Ring, Six Sense, Nang-Nay and the coming Blair Witch Project. For the Ring, it is highly successful because the buildup of the movie is slow and the fear slowly crept to you. The Curse Video Segment is fabulous with great screeching sound effect being used. This movie captivate the audiences successfully as they will anticipate what will the fate behold the actor and actress as they are exposed to the video.Finally, the rule of thumb, just like movies The Shining, The Exorcist and Six Sense. All will create the movie such that it is entirely believable by having a slow buildup and also using subtle horror effect to frighten the audience instead of gory effect such as from the Hollywood Slasher Movies, Friday the 13th.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE most horrifying picture of 1999.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a nutshell: "Ring", which was presented during this year's Fantasy Festival event, appeared to be an extremely disturbing experience. Opposite to any American so-called horror movie (especially the terribly overrated "Blair Witch Project") this Japanese production presented a pretty gripping secret (a video-tape of some mysterious content) and built up to a sticky climax at the bottom of a well. Then, when everything was over, at least that's what everybody thought up to that moment, it kept on going and what followed was possibly the most horrifying scene I have seen in years; a scene that makes all efforts by guys like David Lynch (Bob in "Twin Peaks"), Wes Craven (the opening sequence of "Scream") look like a children's cabaret. Everybody who was lucky to see "Ring" came to the same conclusion:_This film gave us the creeps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sound. No music. A woman who crawls out of a television. One of the most terrifying scene I've ever seen in a movie.Ring (and Ring 2 BTW) is a movie that will haunt you long after you've seen it. The story is quite simple (a woman with long hair on a videotape), the pace is slow, but the tension is ever present. Not unlike Cure (another great Japanese film), you never know what's going to happen. No music to announce an attack, no gore, nothing. Only slowly building tension, never knowing... The couple of Japanese Horror films I've seen seem to be all slow paced, but it adds so much to the horror.The use of sound in the movie and it's sequel (by the same director) is breathtaking. Removing a grate from a well sounds like hundreds of damned souls screaming. It has to be seen and heard to understand.So go see this movie before Hollywood does a remake with lots of special effects and scary music. Don't be put off by the subtitles. Let yourself be drawn in by the slowly building tension and, as the director told us at the North American Premi?re of Ring 2 at the Fantasia film festival in Montreal, : "Relax and enjoy".patrick massé</fullReview>

What I saw was another great example of how a good thriller can play on your mind with a little music, some good acting and the ominous ringing of a telephone. In this film there's no gore, no blood, no CGI graphics and very few of the cheap horror jumpy moments. The idea is simple, it's all about an 'urban legend' to do with a video tape. The central characters see the tape, and the countdown to their fate begins. Photography is excellent, with various locations in Japan used to best effect and the directing is sharp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised by this movie. I was expecting to be disappointed, but I was wrong. Good performance by Sanada Hiroyuki &amp; Nanako Matsushima. They really work together well. The basic plot of a cursed video sounds er...campy....but this film really keeps the viewer on the edge of suspense. It is very well paced. Please do check it out. Just don't watch the film alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ring" is a psychological horror film so radically removed from the Hollywood genre film, that it is something new under the sun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world so glutted with predictable Hollywood horror films that the genre's luminary directors, men like Wes Craven, have chosen to satirize their own work to create something new, Japan's "Ring" comes as a welcome repast. Based on the first novel of Suzuki Koji's best-selling trilogy, "Ring" introduces its audience to the story of Sadako, a young girl with super-natural powers who is killed by her father and dumped into a well in rural Japan with the intent of halting her eventual transformation into a demon. Such as it is, however, this murder serves only to set the evil force within Sadako free and it is subsequently linked to a mysterious video cassette (the origins of, and Sadako's relationship to which, are never explained) that, when watched, marks the viewers for death at Sadako's hands exactly one week after their having viewed it. "Ring" follows two of these people as they search for a way to avert their fated appointment. Beautifully crafted through careful non-sequential editing, the movie draws the viewer into the plot in a way that goes beyond the conventional cinematic explanations of voyeuristic theory or suturing. . . "Ring" is terrifying because in watching it, the audience is marked for death as well. Accompanied by a terrific score and excellent all-around performances (something you don't really expect from a horror movie), it is a film well worth your time and any lack of sleep which may result from watching it. Blood and gore fans please take note: "Ring" deals with the psychological foundations of fear, playing on your mind's ability to recognize the subtle, therein eschewing scenes of grotesque violence. If you want to be seriously scared, this is your movie. If you want to be able to laugh, or to sleep after watching a horror film, try looking at some of Wes Craven's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest movie I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the scariest horror movie I've seen. The background story, the atmosphere, the "monster", it all adds up to a movie that still give me the chills several days after I watched it. It's a very simple, but effective movie, that doesn't show much special effects or side stories to distract from the main story. While scary, it is also a good mystery movie, where the main characters have to follow leads to answer questions about the curse and past crimes. If you live the TV show Supernatural, I think you'd like The Ring. There's some parts in the movie that isn't very well explained, like the ex-husband's powers, but in a way it adds to the mystical atmosphere of the movie. Haven't seen the American remake, but I can't imagine it being done any better than this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very scary, shocking and electrifying film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ringu is the movie that started the whole J-horror trend. I have to admit that I watched many J-horror movies before ringu. I am really very impressed with this film. This film did not hit my top five but it did hit my top ten J-horror films. In comparison with the other J-horror films that I watched, ringu is really unique. Its scares only rely heavily on one scene, and it really works very well. Tension and fear builds towards the scene at the end. No wonder why this film is so famous. It is really scary. I did not dare to look at my TV set after I watched this film. There is only one electrifying scene in this film and it works very well. This film has the mystery elements, the shocking elements, no wonder this film is rated so high. The actors and actresses did a really great job in showing real tension and fear. The TV scene was just so memorable. The storyline in the movie is awesome. The creepy atmosphere was awesome. This film is highly recommended to all horror fans. Although this film is an excellent piece of work, there are still flaws in this film. The ending should include how another victim died from the curse. (Sadako coming out of the TV set to attack the main character's father.) The scary scene in this film was shown in a very unexpected moment. I thought the main characters had stopped the curse but they didn't. This made the scene much more effective. However, I have one very major complain regarding this film. Why must the scariest scene take place during the day? Most horror movies like One Missed Call, Shutter, Ju-On, Cello, Phone all have their scariest scenes taken place at night. In fact most horror movies do. If the man had watched the videotape at night, Sadako would come out from the TV set at night and the scene would have been much scarier, the atmostphere would have been better. However, despite the scariest scene being held in the daytime, this movie was still electrifying and very scary. The scariest scene in this film is extremely memorable. This film is highly recommended. Score: 9/10</fullReview>

Reiko tries to get the bottom of mystery and discovers the secrets of life of Sadako and her father . Besides mysterious events are happening at home her husband and both of them are caught up by ominous Sadako.Based on original Japanese novel by Koji Suzuki , it was a real success in the Asian cinemas and all around the world . This horror film provides great load of screams, grisly killings and creepy atmosphere which becomes pretty sinister with the Sadako appearing . The picture is a sleek production with average budget by approx 1.200.000 dollars , and packs genuine chills , suspense, tension , and shocks , it's a terror-thriller very exciting . The film is paced with intelligent edition, special use of color and slick utilization of shock images . This frightening movie displays thrills , chills , hard-edged drama and ghastly images . While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie, the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point. This is an acceptable adaptation of the novel and movie that took successfully Japan . The movie has some special effects describing series of weird and otherworldly happenings and a magnificent make-up specially reflected on the hair-raising countenance of dead . Eerie musical score and tenebrous cinematography with the TV surrealist images filmed in 35 mm and in super 8 style . The motion picture is professionally directed by Hideo Nakata in similar style to Takashi Shimzu movies . Nakata is an expert on horror cinema with eerie phantoms of pale complexion and long hair and directed its following ¨Ringu 2 (1999)¨ ; furthermore he directed US version ¨Ring 2¨ with Naomi Watts. Of course ¨The Ring¨ followed its American version directed by Gore Verbinski whose argument copies exactly the Japan original movie without surprises.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have stated this before but I'll state it again: Japan makes some of cinema in the world. As well, most of the world trend to be a lot better at making horror films compared to the Americans, which is too reliance on slasher films.The premise of the Ring is there is a videotape which when another watches it they will receive a phone call telling them they only have a week to live, and guess what: after a week they die. When four teenagers from Tokyo watch the video and die on the same day television journalist Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) investigates it. She has a personal stake because one of those victims was her niece. She is a single mother, with a young child, but her works makes her life a juggling act. When investigating the cast she goes to Izu providence, just south of Tokyo and finds in the cabin the teenagers stayed in the tape. She watches it and receives a phone call afterwards. It before a race against time to figure out the mystery of the tape, and she enlist the help of her ex-husband Ryuji Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada). Matters take even more urgency when they son watches the tape.It's a simple premise, but that's what you need in horror films. Unlike some horror films which rely on violence to get their message across, Ring has little violence. The director Hideo Nakata took a much more subtle approach, which was the right way to go. He did go for direct scares and it works. As well Nakata took great care about getting the atmosphere right, which is very important. It made you believe in the film and the characters. A nice light touch was making a film seem a little scratchy, like an old tape/film, adding to the film.Ring is creepy, and that's what you need.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd heard of Ringu, or Ring as it was called here, but didn't know much about it so when it was on television I decided to watch it, I'm glad I did as it is an excellent film. Unlike most horror films I've seen it didn't rely on shocks, gore and a high body count to scare the audience but instead was constantly creepy.The film opens with two girls talking about the rumour of a strange video which as soon as you've watched it the phone will ring and tell you that you will die in a week's time. Of course one of them says that she has seen the tape almost exactly a week ago. Soon she is dead, her face frozen in a look of terror. It then cuts to a female reporter who is interviewing school children about the legend of the strange video, she hears that is was first seen in Izu and some people who saw it died alone in their stationary car with no signs of foul play. She later discovers that they were friends of her niece who was the girl who died at the start of the film. She heads off to Izu and goes to the place they all stayed and finds the tape which she watches. The phone then rings and she realises she has one week to figure out how to break the curse. She goes to her ex-husband for help and together they examine a copy of the tape in detail which leads them to believe that the strange girl in the tape has some connection to the island of Oshima so they head there.There are of course other plot points but I don't want to spoil them all, especially the ending which really surprised me. I really enjoyed this film, the acting was very good in a low key manner, not the usual running around and screaming one would expect in a horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I enjoyed the American remake of this chilling film, seeing "Ringu" made the remake comprehensible to me. When I first saw "The Ring" I failed to grasp what kind of story this was--it hit me as I watched "Ringu:" this is a classic Japanese ghost story, from a culture as fascinated by ghosts as the English are. This is the spirit, if you will, in the videocassette. It is a presence so powerful it can physically kill its victim.The American film is far more atmospheric--it is a horror film that pulls out all the stops. Can anyone forget the frenzied horses on the ferry boat? Or the demented drawing of the soon-to-be-murdered child, which resembled those I have seen created by talented schizophrenics? The Japanese original is far more subtle. It is, however, more explicit about the child's demonic origin somewhere in the sea. No Godzilla she but a baleful force whose malevolence continues beyond the grave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a great movie, it contains so many good elements, like shocking images and great music and there's a very mysterious atmosphere. It deserves a ten, it is also very well filmed after the novel. But I have a question, ring 2 isn't available in the Netherlands, is it? the Japanese one I mean. And I'd like to know where exactly because I would like to see it. I've also seen the prequel: ring o birthday. Which was also very good. Because they stayed with the original movie and yet gave it a little twist, like that there was a second Sadako. Who was the mean one. Anyway, I'm a big fan. I think I'm gonna buy or rent all of the ring movies, including the American ones. Here's how I bought ring: I heard about it through my friends and they advised me to watch it. I saw the American one first and me and my dad thought it wasn't all that. It contained too much Hollywood-style. Anyway, I went to the place were the rented videos and DVD's, and my friend came along. they had both the DVD and the video, for sale! only one euro. (not that I wouldn't buy it for more). I watched it and afterward I knew why they had a warning at the beginning. And I must say, having it on video is very traditional according to the movie.. greets Fabienne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Ring', in Hideo Nakata's hands, has turned out as an unrelentingly terrifying film, that will have you on edge around your television set for days to come?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ring Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) is a reporter who, while working on an article about an urban legend involving a videotape that kills whomever watches it, starts to investigate the unexplained sudden death of her niece, Tomoko (Yuko Takeuchi). Reiko is understandably reluctant to buy into the rumour, and as soon as she finds the tape down at a holiday cabin where Tomoko and her friends stayed a week before they all died, she watches it without hesitation. But then the phone rings, and Reiko discovers just how much truth there is behind the talk after all. Now, she has just seven days to live, and with the help of her ex-husband, Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada), Reiko must delve deep into the mysterious origins of the tape, before it threatens to destroy her.Originally published in 1991, Kôji Suzuki novel 'Ring' has been adapted once before, in the form of a television movie from 1995 ('Ring: The Complete Edition'). But that film is generally regarded as a rotting turkey of a motion picture, which leaves producer Takashige Ichise to give Suzuki's 'Ring' the proper treatment it deserves. To help him achieve this goal, Ichise has enlisted the help of filmmaker Hideo Nakata, who has just one film under his belt, 'Ghost Actress', which came out two years ago. At first, some may have reservations about a relatively inexperienced horror director helming a screen adaptation of what is actually more of a mystery than a thriller. But by the time those people have reached the final reel, their reservations will be sure to have been replaced by pure, undiluted fear. Because that's essentially what 'Ring', in Nakata's hands, has turned out as: an unrelentingly terrifying film, that will have you on edge around your television set for days to come.Nakata hasn't much of a budget to work with, but makes the most of everything he has, and constructs each scene with impressive precision. Nakata is certainly a tease, inserting slightly open doorways or shadowy corners into the background of almost every shot. But rather than satisfy the audience with a multitude of "jump" scares, he instead leaves them writhing in agony, using each moment of the film to summon up a palpable sense of impending dread. Nakata also tinkers with the sound design to great effect, but thankfully does not lazily fall back on scratching violins and close-ups on corpses to shock the audience.And at the same time, 'Ring' is also just as creepy when everything is dead silent, with nothing going on except the main story right in front of you. Nakata is eager to thrill the audience, but never interferes when he doesn't need to, and only releases the tension when the time is absolutely right. It has to be noted, however, that the lighting of certain scenes does seem to be non-existent at times, causing the large dark areas bleeding into the screen to actually irritate the mind rather than chill it, but for the most part, cinematographer Junichirô Hayashi's work here is the stuff of nightmares. As is an exemplary orchestral score by Kenji Kawai, which will send shivers down your spine from the moment the opening credits sequence starts. Nakata has now proved himself as a maestro of horror movies (or at least this one), but I'm tempted to hate him for it; 'Ring' got under my skin so much that I almost wanted the film to just stop.Nakata hardly relies on star Nanako Matsushima for 'Ring''s quality control, but her performance is nevertheless worthy of note. The actress is the focal point of interest during the calm before the storm, and she handles her role sublimely, reacting well against Hiroyuki Sanada, who is also quite good, but his character is a little too cold and gruff for my liking. It's Matsushima who provides the emotional heart of 'Ring', and you'll be behind her character every step of the way.While 'Ring' as a whole is considerably frightening, the final few scenes (where the seven days are up) are perhaps the most unnerving of all, with echoes of David Cronenberg's 'Videodrome', and a parting shot borrowed from 'The Terminator'. I don't mean to overly praise it, but 'Ring' is more of an intense experience than an actual film, and the horror becomes amplified by the unexpected twist ending, which paves the way for an immediate follow-up. 'The Spiral' (based on Koji Suzuki's sequel novel), comes out at the same time as 'Ring', and I look forward to seeing it, but am also disappointed that Nakata was not involved in its making. At this point, Nakata seems to be the best, and only, man for any 'Ring'-related job. Why? Well, many reasons, but like I said, you'll be wary of your television set for quite a while.~ 9/10 ~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well...where to begin? I suppose a clean pair of pants would be a good start. And upon your first viewing...you better be damn sure you can afford some! Make no mistake that this is the one that started it all...one beast of a horror movie oozing not only bucket loads of originality, but some of best acting capabilities that Japan has to offer.The story revolves around Reiko Asakawa, a news reporter who has recently found out about a group of people (one of whom is her niece) who have died in unexplained circumstances. She decides to investigate and discovers a mysterious video-tape that is rumoured to kill a person after one week of viewing. Dipping as far into the rumour as she possibly can - with the help of her ex-husband - she finally views the tape for herself. But when the phone rings after viewing, she begins to suspect that the mystery of the video-tape could very well be fact after all. And seeing as she now only has one week left to live...she sets out on a path to discovery to find and eradicate the curse's source.Throughout the entire film there is enough eeriness and gritty atmosphere to keep you grabbing for your dear life on the edge of your seat. You are waiting for the ending...and due to the mounting terror of each scene, you know it will hurt when it comes.And oh does it! I can't go into too much detail, because of just how affective the ending sequence is. I really don't want to spoil anything for those of you who haven't seen it...The stunning direction of Nakata (Dark Water) shows throughout. Building up the tension between each character that meets their ultimate doom, Nakata truly brings forward the fact that he IS the God of J-Horror as we know it.This film will definitely make you uneasy...there's no doubt about that. However, i will admit that not EVERYONE will actually be scared by it. After all different films affect different people. But no matter whether this film scares you or not...you'll damn well be thinking about it for around another 6 months. And be damn sure not to watch any other Asian horrors within the same week, due to the J-Horror's obsession with female characters with long black hair (THIS is the film that started all that), you can be sure that you'll see a lot of reference to this film in ANY other Asian horror film you're likely to come across. Even the likes of Shimizu Takashi's Ju-On series have reference to this beast.There really is no doubt in the world that this is the true landmark film of the Asian horror genre. Final Verdict: Ringu is the one that started it all: the long black hair...gritty imagery/audio...signature pop-shots...the lot! Enduldge all of your senses into this remarkable film...and let your nerves do the talking!Entertainment: 9/10Scares: 10/10 (Depending on how you watch a horror film)Finger Nails: BrokenMy Pillow: A Life-saver...Performances: 10/10Direction: 10/10 (Wonderous atmospheric Nakataness)Sadako: OMFG!!!/10Final Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when horror movies were slipping back towards mediocrity and worse, after the high of Scream and the many lows which followed, Hideo Nakata decided to bring Koji Suzuki's hit novel to the big screen. The result is the most terrifying movie of the decade, and one of the most chilling movies of all time. Made on a tiny budget the film is relentlessly evil, the tension never gives in, and you will not forget it for the rest of your life. Stylish, borrowing from other films and surpassing them Ringu is a demon reincarnated as a movie, its effect on us everlasting, ensuring we spread the word- you must see this movie...The film opens with a Scream-like scene and the tension is already high, our wrists put in a deathly grip from the outset. Two teenage girls are discussing a video one of them claims to have seen, saying it is the scariest thing she has ever see. Once you watch it the phone rings, and a voice tells you you will die in seven days. The girl though says she is joking. Then the TV switches itself on and she hears scratching noises. It has been seven days. We cut to a reporter, Reiko Asakawa who is doing a story about the video curse. She investigates some local deaths, including her niece and soon realises that all her niece's friends are dead too, having watched a mysterious video. Leaving her son behind she goes in search of the video. Eventually she finds it, watches it and answers the ringing phone. Convinced she is going to die she contacts her ex-husband and tries to find a way to save herself. He is not convinced, and watches it as well. However, later that night their son Yoichi also watches, so they all try to solve the curse, uncovering the story of the Yamamuras, in particular- Sadako.Aside from having one of the most frightening moments in movie history, one which the remake completely failed to resurrect, there is an eerie atmosphere throughout the film. There are many other scary moments all adding to the atmosphere and building towards the infamous final scare. The last 15 minutes are extremely scary as Reiko and Ryuji search for Sadako and feature some of the best filmed scenes in horror history. Everything in the film is designed to unsettle- the unearthly soundtrack reminiscent of Argento's Goblins, the fixed and cornered camera angles so we can never see what is near, the grim surroundings, the complete lack of humour, the use of colour etc. The performances are all very good as well, Nanako Matsushima as Reiko swiftly moves from confident to frantic wreck, and exudes every possible emotion. Hiroyuki Sanada is extremely strong, slowly coming to realise the truth, conveying guilt over his son and remaining both mysterious and strong when his ex-wife gives up. His final scene is perfectly acted, heightening the overall effect.Rikiya Otaka as Yoichi manages to be creepy, but his role becomes more central in the second film. The rest of the cast are all immensely good. The inclusion of the timer is also highly effective, ensuring the tension rises as we know time is running out.Of course the film has its flaws. Some people will be put off by the slow nature. Some people will feel the need to have every question answered, and Ringu leaves many unanswered-that is the point. If we were in this situation we would be looking for answers-anything to help us, to relieve the fear, something real to hold on to, but nothing is given. As we are left wondering, the film will stay with us, continuing to haunt us over time, ensuring we do not escape the ring. As it was adapted from a novel, certain inherent difficulties arise. In the novel it is a man who is the reporter, his wife is barely around, and his near-sadist friend takes up the Ryuji role, hoping to put some excitement into his life. In the book, beware all reflective surfaces. The curse is more of a disease than a ghost. Nakata takes the best elements, and makes the story his own. There will be some confusing moments, but the constant threat of something happening will mean you will continually be focused on the film.The sense of isolation is strong, and there is a coldness surrounding the film. Many rooms are blank, place lack expression, and people speak in monotone, and avoid contact. Nakata explores Japanese culture and mythology, showing the intrusion of the West via moments which remind us of past films. There is more than one reference to The Terminator- the final shot, the dates, the relentless evil of Sadako, technology backfiring, and it recalls other films such as Videodrome, Eraserhead, Straw Dogs, and there is veiled thanks to Stephen King. (Translate the name of a certain familiar Stephen King town into Japanese). Nakata shows himself to be the new master of tension, and along with Miike, Kitano and others is proving that Japanese cinema is a force not to be taken lightly. I first saw this around 5 years ago, and it is still rewarding and scary today. The themes of abandonment, fear and guilt stay with the viewer, coming out more with each viewing, once the initial fear has gone. This is one horror movie everyone should see, vastly superior to the remake which opted for cheap scares, flashy camera-work and loud noises. This is subtle, both nightmarish and real, and uses one of the most effective themes of horror movies to the fullest- the inevitability of death. We are doomed and there is no escape, but that should not stop us fighting for each other and ourselves, no matter how invincible our enemy.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a mystery than a horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was considerably hyped up, so I saw it eventually. My personal opinion is that this is more of a good mystery movie than a horror movie - it really wasn't that scary, to me at least. The only really scary moments were spoiled for me because I had already seen them before on things like "The 100 Scariest Movie Moments" on TV or something, and the notes by a critic inside the DVD box also spoiled it.Sound design was one part of this film that struck me - quite good at doing what it was supposed to, sometimes unsettling. I didn't feel a lot of character to be honest - just people making their way through the story.In my opinion, worth seeing just to investigate the hype, but don't expect to need a new change of underwear after seeing it. For that, you might want to consider The Grudge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ringu tells its story with a quiet eerie power and is a fascinating film to re-watch. There are certain implications made earlier in the tale that contribute to an overall circular motion, a ring that has no bottom and no top, an endless chain of events (for the record--yes, I know the Ring of the title refers to the ring of the telephone after the tape is viewed but there is still this aspect of completing-the-circle in the story structure); certain unsettling questions are left to the viewer to ponder afterward and this is a good thing. Listen, for example, to Yoichi's explanation as to who told him to watch the tape (the implication being that death is not necessarily the end for Sadako's victims); note also the hooded figure in the video and its reappearance near the end of the film and the name to which the heroine assigns to it (the question here is along the lines of whether certain events were preordained from the start)....all of this is interesting stuff to mull over. Told with simplicity and economy, Ringu is superior to the American remake -- in itself still a good thriller but one short on subtlety -- a textbook example of Japanese horror at its most inventive and frightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen about 200 horror movies, and none of 'em scared or compelled me as much as this one. This is also one of the few only horror movies I'd call an utter good movie, and not just a scary one.I've seen my share of Asian movies, so this wasn't something entirely new to me, but since this one is a fairly a-typical Asian picture, I think people from Europe and America can enjoy it as well.I love the way of implying rather than showing(like the Asakawa - Ryuji relationship). I love the way you never REALLY get a grip on Sadako's character, being torn between feeling sorry for her, and fearing her and her evilness.The static shots still give it a very Japanese feel, and the soundtrack is just awesome! Not the usual shrieking when something scary happens, but eerie, low tones. And I also love the way the movie doesn't explain every single detail without seeming incomplete. When I watch normal Hollywood style horror/thrillers I always get the feeling the filmmakers see us like some kind of morons, explaining everything 3 or 4 times... This movie doesn't do that.I watched it in the dark, 'round midnight, in my bedroom, and when I wanted to go to bed I just couldn't look at my TV... Still, when I'm alone, and I think of the movie, I kinda get the feeling Sadako is near or something, and no other horror has ever had such an impact on me. I'd definitely recommend this one to everyone who can appreciate subtle movies that don't use gore and gross things to catch your attention. And if you like this one I'd definitely recommend ring 0; basudei, ring 2 and dark water(very similar to ringu).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Horror Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past few months, it has been a popular topic to discuss. What is the greatest horror movie of all? Some would argue it's THE EXORCIST and its head spinning demon-girl. Others would argue it's THE SHINING, for its axing actions or PSYCHO and it's famous shower moment. Still, gore and sickness isn't as popular with some, so they got for the psychological horrors. Hence some would say either THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT or THE WICKER MAN. Of course in every 90's horror flick, we have our protagonist and going against the rules again. It isn't a stupid teenager who runs about in the dark with a butcher knife to attack the killer with. She's early-twenties, single mother; T.V reporter whom is researching the evil cursed videotape.Reiko Asakawa (played outstandingly by Nanako Matsushima) TV reporter is researching an urban legend about a cursed video when her niece dies. At first, this just seems to be a sad tragic event that Reiko and her seven year old son Yoichi (A small but remarkable job from Rikiya Otaka) but, she soon finds out that three of the niece's friends died the same way, same day and same time. Reiko shots off down to the roots of all the rumors Izu Pacific Land. However, on her arrival, she finds nothing but friendly people, a nice and conformable rental cottage and beautiful weather? Reiko is relaxed and yet, disappointed that she can't find anything. However she soon comes across the un-filed videotape. Allowing her curiosity to get the best of her, she watches the tape. After it ends she gets the 'ring'? Leaving her with one to live? Now in every movie, horror or not, the damsel in distress has her 'Prince Charming' to come and rescue her. This is no acceptation when Reiko calls on her estranged ex-husband, Ryuji Takayama (Played by the wonderful Hiroyuki Sanada) to help with the situation. Whatever the reason they divorced, it certainly wasn't lack of love, as Ryuji watches the video and is cursed also. Now Reiko and Ryuji have just six days till their deadline. Together they manage to pick out clues from the videotape, including a mysterious young woman looking in a mirror and the character 'Sada'. When they find out about the eruption on the videotape, Ryuji tries to take charge of the game and sends Reiko to her father's home. However, it's not to be a smooth ride or as simple as that as one fateful night, little Yoichi watches the tape. Fighting for the life of their son as well as their own, Ryuji and Reiko must face off the darkness they are plunged into about the maker of the cursed videotape. How Reiko will make her deadline with only two days left? Will they be able to save Yoichi and themselves from the fear of Sadako? RING is staring some of the best names in Japan, before some of them were famous. Each character was detailed and played by the perfect choices. Reiko Asakawa is portrayed perfectly by the beautiful and talented Nanako Matsushima. Ring's leading lady was a perfect choice for the role, and fitted the role like a glove. Her acting was just a shining example on what a gifted actress she really is. When watching the movie you'll be lost in how believable she is. She plays the respectable, kind, loving and brave Reiko who will do anything to try and protect her loved ones, especially her little son Yoichi. She is a woman who is sweeter then sugar and she proves that even the nicest of us can end up in terrible danger. The gripping chemistry that ran between the main stars was very powerful. Each one behaves as if they have known one another for years and there is an aura there. Ryuji Takayama was played by the wonderful and handsome Hiroyuki Sanada really opened the screen wider. His acting was spot-on and made the role. He is Ryuji Takayama. Ryuji is a very pained and depressed man but he's very loving and lovable. You feel such glowing warmth from him. Despite the fact that Ryuji and Reiko are divorced, there's still a strong bond there. Though they aren't all over each other, they are clearly very special to one another. When with Ryuji, Reiko seems to feel more safe and relaxed. When she thought she was going to die, she pleaded with him to stay with her when she died. He seems to try his hardest for her. As soon as she presented the problem, he came straight to her side to try and help. Not only does he seem to still seem deeply in love with her; he always asks after their son.With a brilliant cast of characters that you really learn to love and a plot line that takes you by the hand and throws you're imagination off all the walls. This is one horror movie that shouldn't only be rented; it should grace the shelves of any other horror movie fan, next to all the other classics. This is a classic horror movie and it will be remembered when everyone else has forgotten the Hollywood remake. This movie will be open to many more remakes over the next twenty years or so and millions of Japanese horror movies will be made around this movie as well as Hollywood remakes. This is the movie that you have to watch first! Forget about the remakes like THE RING and RING VIRUS. Forget the sequels, the rip offs, the spin offs? You will always remember 'Ring' because it is top of the pyramid of horror!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most tense movies out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd really like to write this review without reference to the U.S. remake; "The Ring", but I guess that'd be ignoring a major influence on many people's desire to see this film. So I'll say this; "The Ring" is a poor schlocky Americanised film which takes a good idea and stamps it into a mediocre mold. "Ring" or "Ringu" is a very good film. If you're trying to decide which one to see, use that as your guide. In fact, an interesting point about the films can be summed up looking at the titles. "The Ring" has an added 'definite article' indicator; "The". This implies that the film is about a ring. It isn't. Enough said. There's a lot more ambiguity in the one-word translation of the Japanese film's title; "Ring". It's ambiguous, maybe even... thought provoking! I think that sums up the differences.So, yes, Ring is a good, tense, movie. It runs almost like a detective story rather than a traditional horror film as the main character works her way closer to finding the facts behind the mysterious video tape. But all the while there's an ever-mounting tension as her numbered days expire. In this way it's reminiscent of Angel Heart, another dark, tense, supernatural detective story which demonstrates that the big American studios will sometimes make a good dark thriller. In fact, the tension, partly thanks to the minimal music and synthesizer noises as well as the excellent subdued lighting and camerawork, is the making of a film in which very little actually happens. Ring is a lesson in how to make an everyday cityscape seem scary and bleak while the addition of supernatural overtones, which I'm told weren't in the original books to the same extent, are a welcome addition and source of mystery. I suspect, although I cannot read Japanese, that the film is probably an improvement on the books. Perhaps the main skill in creating a popular horror movie is to create a viable adversary. Sadako is perhaps the best example of this in film making. She is just a damp, bedraggled figure in an off-white night-dress whose hair obscures her features and who, as far as I can remember, isn't even seen until the last few minutes. Yet she invokes a real sense of menace, you know she is powerful and malevolent through the characters' reactions to her, even if she doesn't graphically do anything horrifying. Say "Sadako" to anyone who's seen the film and watch their face tense up for an instant.So, should you watch this film? Yes. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody else seems to have noticed that this is an update of Robert Chambers "The King In Yellow", a classic horror novel about a book so evil that those who read it, die afterwards. I admit that the book is rather obscure these days, but it is rather well regarded, especially among the Lovecraft/Cthulhu-mythos folks. This is a good updating of the basic concept, with a fascinating explanation, excellent acting and effects. I also truly appreciate the Cronenberg references, the most I have seen since "Demons 2".

		<shortDescription>The greatest horror movie I've ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well... I had heard about this movie being really different from common "Hollywoodesque" horror movies, so I was anxious to get it.One day I had the luck of running into it in a local dvd store. It came in a pack, along with another GREAT film, Battle Royale. I ran home as fast as I could.As soon as the movie ended, I just felt I had to watch it one more time (at least) so I could believe my eyes... I had just watched the greatest horror movie of all time.Why do I say this? Simple. Some say it's boring; some say nothing happens in the first 30 minutes. I say I was glued to the screen the whole time. This movie has a great atmosphere, it is intense and it just keeps getting more intense as the action proceeds.One of the main aspects I have to underline is that this film has a different sensibility in its direction. It may be low-budget, but it sure looks and feels like a million-dollar movie. The acting is awesome, the camera almost sucks you into the action, the plot is original and well conceived.To the ones who condemn this movie, I can only say one thing: either you're too used to americanized, cliched horror movies, or you tottaly lack sensibility. This movie is the reason I started "believing" in horror movies again. In my scale, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done psychological drama with supernatural elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen hundreds of horror movies, the genre rarely scares me anymore, but I am still vulnerable to being caught up in the tension and suspense of a well-played scene. Ringu had plenty of those. The style of the film is subdued and haunting, and the dialogue, although sparse, is well-delivered and effective. I did not feel that the mood was compromised by the subtitles. The special effects, which are admittedly less spectacular than in the Hollywood version, were still gripping and creepy. The music was wonderful, fitted the scenes well, and underscored the suspense without being overwrought and heavy-handed as is with so many U.S. made horror movies. Even though I knew the plot of the movie beforehand, I was caught up in the drama and suspense and found myself holding my breath and jumping, even when I knew what was coming next. In my opinion, that's a sign of a good horror film.There were several small touches that I really enjoyed. The back story on why the couple in the movie divorced was deftly handled in a succinct and poignant scene. The mother's relationship with her little boy is also very touching and realistic. The actors captured perfectly the dread and horror one would have in realizing their fate, should they fail to solve the mystery. The acting was excellent, easily as good as is seen in classic Kurosawa films and the more contemporary Takeshi Kitano movies.If you're looking for a gore fest or a scream-a-minute movie, this ain't it. However, if you enjoy psychological dramas with supernatural elements and the sort of horror that sneaks up on you and continues to make your skin crawl long after the movie is over, this is your pick. **** out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ringu: 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original movie that the Hollywood-based hit The Ring is based on, Ringu is tons creepier and scarier, with better acting, better production, better script, and better everything.Reiko (Nanako Matsushima) is a newspaper reporter who is learning about a cursed videotape: after viewing an odd video, a phone rings, and the person on the other end says, `You have one week to live.' After her niece dies from, presumably, the tape, she decides to investigate, so she gets a hold of the video and watches it. She, along with her husband/boyfriend Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada), dissects the tape frame by frame and tries to figure out the mystery.This is the only movie that kept me up at night and had me terrified at night, which is odd because the American remake is basically the same, except that Ringu is in every way better. The video is shorter, and many things, such as flies, bloody noses, drawing rings, and shading faces, are not in this version, mainly because it wasn't necessary. Those were just to American-ize it. Also, the character played by Brian Cox in the remake has a larger role in this one. I did not `jump' once, while in The Ring, that seemed to be most of the scares. This one got its thrills naturally, not cheaply.Hollywood movies seem to have booming music throughout the entire films, while Ringu only had music during the suspenseful scenes, which is odd, since, to me, the entire film was completely suspenseful. The ending, with the TV, was the same as The Ring, but it still gave us more answers than the remake, and didn't give us any unnecessary information (such as the horses dying). It did not seem over the top, in fact, it actually seemed plausible? It had to have palpable dread to get me this scared. There also was a lot with ESP, while there was none with the remake, which I unfortunately had to see first.Matsushima was very good, she really acted well. I hope that Ringu 2 and Ringu 0 get released here in America so I can see more of her work, since she was very good. Sanada was also very good, and another standout is Rikiya Otaka (Yoichi, Reiko's son). He seemed to have ESP too, and was great. His role seemed very demanding for such a young age.I would recommend seeing Ringu before The Ring because: it's better, the ending would be more of a surprise, and it's scarier. One more point: why is it called Ringu if there isn't a ring in the video? You won't notice if you're constantly biting your nails when watching, which is what you'll do.My rating: 10/10Not Rated</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a jumpy film. This film will have you crawling back up your seat in absolute terror. Believably disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw RING at the cinema during an all night Horror fest. With an audience of about 250+ people. The whole movie is believably freaky and disturbing. You can very much follow this even though it is in Japanese and you can imagine it actually happening.The part where Sadako (the ghost) crawls out the TV is the scariest thing I have ever witnessed. The whole audience jumped back in their seats, literally crawled back away from it. I myself did that swearing while trying to catch my breath. All around me I could hear pants of "F**k, S**t, Jesus &amp; Oh My God"If that whole terrifying moment wasn't bad enough, the one thing that sticks in my mind is towards the end when the dead husband appears with the cloth over his head pointing towards the video. That image is actually hard to talk about without me frightening myself.It's not cowardly or lame to be afraid of this film. This film is something very believable. I recently bought the DVD which, in the extra features section had "THE TAPE" that was featured in the film. Me and a friend watched it and immediately after made a copy and next day sent it on. We didn't get a call but neither did the husband did he...? Or the son? So I'm not taking any chances.I will never watch this film alone, especially not at night. I have also bought Ring 2 on DVD, it is still in its wrapping as I will not watch it alone and haven't had time to get people over.RING is not jumpy or scary. It is disturbing, believable, un-nerving and all-round horrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original is far superior to the remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, first of all I have to say it irks me that so many people don-t get the meaning of the original movie title. Since the american relase was titled THE ring, and not ringu, I feel like I have to shed some light on this situation...In japanese, when you use a form of writing called katakana, it means the word you are using is either a foreign word or an onomatopeia, and in this case, RINGU refers to the RINGING OF THE DAMN PHONE! not *A* ring, like they did in the american version.I hope this will never be an issue again.Another thing, I loved this original and spooky japanese movie, much more than the american remake. The pace is taut, the feel is much more consistent and elegant, it has a fantastic use of silences, the photography is stunning, and the acting is first rate -if you dont feel yourself sympathysing with the characters it must be because of the cultural differences, but the lead character seemed sweet and geniuinely concerned for her sons well being, instead in the american version Naomi Watts looks blank and totally self centered.I thought the story was gripping from the very start, leaving just enough room to doubt whether the murders might be the work of a lunatic. It just has a great urban legend feeling to it. Then slowly they start hinting towards something more freakish and supernatural, and it always keeps you guessing. Every time the characters discover another lead, it still leaves something unanswered. And the japanese think their audiences are just smart enough that you dont have to spell everything out with ABC blocks like the americans do. Some things you just KNOW without needing to be told, like the video is actually a psychic projectation of Sadakos rage, hinting towards all her reasons for it. Sadako is an unnatural entity, one that needs no reason for being evil.Oh and one more thing... Sadako would scare Samara to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To be caught up in a Sinisterly, Mystical, Terrifying surrounding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the reviews on this site about Ringu, my curiosity was no longer bearable. I love horror and suspense in movies and i'm pretty much used to be scared the hell out of and took no further notice of the "scariest movie ever even for the die hard horror fanatic" lines. What can i say....i was stubborn. This movie holded a grip out of me and wouldn't let go. I couldn't sleep for hours scared of nightmares. It haunted my mind for days and days. Now i'm able to write about it.This movie is not to be compared with slasher movies like Halloween (for heaven's sake when are the sequels going to end?), Nightmare on Elmstreet, Scream etc. It's more of a mystical, psychological, mystery, horror movie. Kind of like The Sixth Sense or The Others for example. Only this is more scary and unpleasant in a good way. While you are watching the movie and seeing the leading actors finding out how to undo the curse you actually live up with them. And the suspense is building more and more with the minute (credit goes to the magnificent score) that even a ringing phone or a man standing in a room makes your heart wants to abandon your precious body. But the final scene is truly the most sinisterly piece of art ever made for a horror movie. It has the timing to make the viewer nosy just to see what that moving "thing" is and as it comes closer the viewer tries to get away from the T.V but still is watching. Heartbeat is going faster and the score is building the tension up. Anxiety overcomes your state of mind and after watching the scene, it won't go away for days. I have seen tons of movies but not like this one. The Others comes close i have to say. This is truly a piece of cinematographic art and a recommendation for every horror/mystery/psychological movie fanatic.</fullReview>

You absolutely HAVE to see this film if you're a horror fan, and you MUST see it before you see that bloody Hollywood remake, it's just a damn shame it was never released in the US, so many people have been unable to see it because of this.Basically, Ringu is the story of a reporter,Reiko follows the story of a video tape that is supposed to cause people to die exactly a week after they saw it, as she finds out more about the history of the video, she and her ex-husband Ryujii are in a race against time to break the curse, and save themselves, and their son.Some VERY VERY creepy scenes in this, scenes that will stay with me for a loooooong time. If you loved this movie, I suggest you watch Ringu2 and Ring 0 to see the rest of the story :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What has not already been said about this terrifying film?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I probably shouldn't even bother posting a review! About the aspects of the film itself, there's nothing more to say. On the other hand, I was compelled to add my own personal reaction to this movie and the reason I found it so impressive. I was convinced that no horror movie could ever scare me. I had taken the mind set that "It's just a movie! What's to be scared of?" I've gotta tell you that "Ring" came along and blew me away. I was scared senseless. Other movies/shows had succeeded in creeping me out a bit: "The Shining", "House on Haunted Hill"(the 1999 version. Fun at some places but downright unnerving at others!), and "Twin Peaks" to name almost all of 'em. And recently, "The Mothman Prophecies" was a welcome addition to the list. Oh, and Stephen King's "Rose Red" too! I even let my imagination loose and allowed myself to be bothered by the infamous "Blair Witch". I've also enjoyed many an ominous Lovecraft story. The point is that as much as these things disturbed me to an extent, none of them compare to "Ring". Any movie that has the ability to give me an unbearable cramp in my leg from remaining tense and breathless for an hour and a half and bestow upon me a fear of the dark (and of my television of course) has to be doing something right! Even now, months after my first viewing, I don't think I have the courage to watch it by myself in the dark. "Ring" did what I had thought no movie could do... it terrified me. I never knew I could have such a psychological and emotional reaction from a mere movie. I was proven wrong (BOY was I proven wrong) and it has renewed my faith in the horror genre. A horror movie that actually terrifies? Wow, what a concept! One more thing.... I defy you to find a more terrifying presence than Sadako!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is no doubt the best horror movie out there in the world. Ironically, there is no gore, which is good.I have viewed other horror movies but most of them only succeeded in making you laugh. A few good ones managed to scare you using cheap tricks such as sudden blast of sounds or sudden appearance of monsters, yadda, yadda, yadda. This includes Scream, The Shining and the stinking Blair Witch.All of those PALE against the mighty RING. Because the fear and images of The RING stayed long long long after the movie is over. It'll stay with you at night, in the shower, on the bed, or any other time you managed to be alone.Hmmmmmm.Scary. Some women cried out of the theater when I watched it the first time. The second time I watched it with friends, and we screamed. I'm a guy by the way and that was the first time I ever felt compelled to scream in a theater. But since everyone else screamed, that kinda took out the embarassment of the situation.</fullReview>

(END SPOILER)All of the characters in this film are excellent and a great atmosphere is created mostly due to the great soundtrack and a few disturbing images. I recommend you to watch this with at least one other person and not in the dark unless you're really brave :0 Be prepared for many sleepless nights and having an urge to look over your back every minute.

		<shortDescription>Now THIS deserves the tagline "Scary as hell".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard a lot about this movie, and what I heard 99% of the people who saw it say most often was that it scared the living &amp;^%$ out of them. It's kind of hard to track down in the US (you may have better luck just buying a used copy of the VCD over the net than you would have finding a video store that has it in stock) but worth it. It's not available officially on VHS format at the time of this writing, which upon reflection, is probably wise due to the storyline. I don't know if this is the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely up there in my top 10. Also, it's probably the movie in my top list of scariest movies with virtually no gore.The plot centers on a reporter who investigates what could possible be a video tape with a 'curse' on it. Yeah, I know that sounds ludicrous, but the way the story is laid out, it doesn't turn out that way. It starts with two teenage girls talking about the VHS videotape, one telling the other a sort of urban legend (anything involving an urban legend scares the hell out of me right there-I think I heard too many of them at slumber parties as a kid and was permanently warped). Anyone who watches the tape, then gets a phone call (we never hear what the voice on the other end of the phone says exactly) telling them they will die in a week. So far, everyone who has seen it has died in exactly a week. And guess what? One of the girls saw it slightly less than a week ago! One dies, and the other goes incurably insane. One of the girls is the main character's niece, so she and another journalist (who I think was her ex-husband- the English subtitles were pretty badly translated in parts, but you get the idea) have a week to track down the source and try to stop things before the next Sunday evening.There's plenty of big jolts and scares in the movie-times where I really jumped. That's scary enough, but what's more frightening is the creepy sense of dread you get as the movie goes on. It's filled with extreme suspense as well- captions show the days counting down and their time they have left ticking away. The dread was the worst-there are quite a few very creepy images, such as those shown on the videotape itself. You have a horrible feeling you're going to see something you really, really would rather not see very soon, but you can't stop watching. This is a good one to watch with the lights off, though I am very glad my husband was asleep on the couch next to me. There's a scene towards the end where the two main characters must bail water out of an abandoned well in an area that is already dark and creepy. One of them, of course, has to be lowered down into the well (which is somewhere you *really* don't want them to go, but they have to) to fill the bucket, and I actually had to wake my husband up to hold my hand only about 20 seconds into the scene. That scene is wonderfully filmed and edited. You have the nail-biting suspense when the clock is ticking for the characters to bail out the deep well as quickly as possible to find what they need to, yet you also REALLY don't want to see what is at the bottom, so along with the suspense there's the creeping dread.Unfortunately I read a review that gave away the TV scene at the film's climax, but it still made every hair on my body stand on end. Jesus! I'm a grown woman who has seen some pretty hideous, frightening movies, but I still spent at least the last half of the movie curling up into a smaller and smaller ball and covering my eyes in parts. The story-line is clever yet simple, with a couple of twists, the scenes are beautifully filmed, the cinematography is gorgeous, the editing and pacing are perfect, and the acting is also pretty impressive. The score is great-I had to keep lowering the sound during the movie because it was giving my cat (and me) the creeps so badly. It also says a lot when a movie can scare you this bad without virtually any blood, gore, or the popular sudden-discovery-of-a-mangled- corpse effect.I really can't think of anything negative to say, other than to see this movie before the American remake/version comes out and probably completely screws it up. Younger viewers who only have seen those teen slasher pics and expect every horror movie to be exactly like that, may just not get it. Either that, or they'll realize what they've been missing. Viewers that get bored unless there's not slam-bang action and over-the-top gore every other scene...I just feel sorry for them because they will probably get impatient and turn the movie off after 20 minutes and miss out. If you want that kind of movie,(not that there's anything wrong with that) rent TerrorFirmer or something instead. But if you don't fall into either of the above categories, like a well-made, atmospheric movie and want to have the hell scared out of you slowly but surely, see Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite a few simple things in it but the good directing puts it all together. First people who have watched a weird video died 7 days later. The terror is on their faces. For the spectator this is the terror of a random spell as well as a punishment for curiosity. Then you see the weird video and you learn the spell is on the main character. It's simple: the hero does everything you would not dare to but you're too eager to know. Some scenes are more creative on the field of suggested terror. They make the movie create that tension with other scenes where you think you can breath. The good directing and good editing make Ring bring out fear from the suggestive power of screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the wait and hype, my copy of The Ring arrived in the mail today, and I was excited to see what was touted as one of the great horror masterpieces of the last decade. And what I got was something close. Real close...The movie starts out great with two girls talking you right into the mood the great parts of the movie generate. Dark, creepy, and atmospheric. Here is a modern horror film that doesn't have to rely on over the top gore to send your heart into overdrive. THERE IS NO GORE AT ALL for all you gore hounds out there. Sorry! The story is nothing new, view this cursed tape that is going around, and a week later you'll die. Maybe it was just the translation on my copy, but half way through, the dialog didn't seem to make much sense. I will watch it again, but I don't really think that it will matter much because this middle section is used to just throw you completely off track. But don't get me wrong, it is interesting to say the least. The movie doesn't live up to it's bill until the end. WOW, now that was creepy to the max and worth the wait. The score was great and acting believable. If you are looking for a good reason to get creeped out The Ring is it...the only problem is that you may have a hard time finding it due to the fact that it isn't released here in the states. But if you have patience, go for it. It's not the greatest movie but it kicks the Blair Witch any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`RING' is a Japanese horror film and stars Nanako MatsushimaOne day, four young people die at the same time on the same day. Several days later, a journalist called Asakawa thinks it's very strange, so she starts to investigate it. While she is investigating, she finds out the cause is a videotape. Then she watches the video. After finishing it she is consumed by hatred, but finally she finds the means to break the spell.I don't recommend this film if you like horror films, because most horror film fans say it's very boring and that they didn't feel anything during the movie; but I like this film. While was watching it I trembled to think how it would end and I think the sound effects are very good and complement each scene perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat-out the scariest movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night, I had a chance to see a beautiful sub-titled 35mm print of "Ring" at the Egyptian theatre in Hollywood, and I was in awe. As a long time fan of horror films, I've long since gotten past the point of being particularly scared for the most part, but this movie had me paralyzed and breathless from the first shot through its entire 98 minute run time. I got home and had to sleep with the lights on. This morning, in class, I couldn't concentrate because I could not get "Ring's" haunting images and deeply disturbing ideas out of my mind. It will probably be a long time before I even work up the courage to watch "Ring" a second time, but when I do, I know I'll love it just as much as I did the first time."Ring" is full of twists that catch you off guard at every turn (unless you've read some of the spoiler-filled reviews people have posted here), and the twist ending (which fortunately was not revealed by any reviewers here) puts "The Sixth Sense" to shame. I am still running through the movie in my mind, examining how every little element pays off in some very unexpected ways.Do not watch "Ring" alone. But if you like to be scared, then DO watch it. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Movie I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "The Ring" late at night, in a dark room, while rain beat on the windows, and, without showing a single drop of blood, it scared me half to death."The Ring" tells the story of a haunted video tape that causes anyone who watches it to die exactly seven days from when they saw it. A reporter, Reiko, becomes interested after the death of her cousin, and ends up watching the video. She and her ex-husband then embark on a frantic search to discover the secret of the video, how it kills, and how they can save themselves from it's powers.&gt;This is a totally psychological horror movie, there are no axe-wielding mutants waiting to jump out and slice up the heros. Rather, the horror is achieved through images from the haunted video, *very* spooky sounds, startling glimpses inside the characters' minds, the passage of time, and an absolutely terrifying scene at the end.If you can find this movie (I am not aware of an English-language version), watch it, and you'll be scared of your TV for at least a week. Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay...so there were some language barriers, since I don't speak Japanese and I couldn't read the Chinese subtitles very well (I saw this in Taiwan.) but I still got the gist of it and boy was I scared! Yes, the premise of a cursed videotape is a little silly, but it's not the story, but the elements that make this a great film--the suspense of eerie silence and especially the disturbing images! The smeared faces in the snapshot of those destined to die bothered me for at least a month afterwards. This movie messes with your mind, not your stomach...it doesn't have to resort to blood and guts to make you scream. I was so freaked out after watching this that I had to have my friend escort me home on his scooter (after I dropped him off at his place) because I was too scared to drive home alone!

		<shortDescription>Good Japanese horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I am quite surprised that this movie did not get more votes than this, as it is quite popular here. I don't know if it has been released somewhere else in the world, neither do I know if it has been released on video in other countries than Japan. The plot is quite common, it's a very "Japanese" style horror movie (curses, ghost of a young girl, but no gore...), nevertheless what strikes from the very beginning is the excellence of the directing. The set/lights are quite astonishing, the soundtrack is also very good, with a lot of "scratchy sounds" that make you jump from your seat. In my opinion, there are some few scenes that are close to the perfection (the sequence of the cursed video on which the story is based has to be seen, it makes you feel sooo uncomfortable). To sum it up, although the plot would have deserved more development, it's a good Japanese movie, if you have the chance to find it somewhere, don't hesitate, it gives another vision of "horror". By the way, I've only seen Japanese versions on sale, I don't know if there is an English dubbed/subtitled version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror movie that's actually scary. Yes, I know you don't believe me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RINGU is an amazing mystery-drama with a heavy spooky atmosphere and great psychological horror. I guess everyone knows the story by now, but I'll tell you anyway, because it's such a fascinating, clever yet simple story.Anyone expecting a light-hearted night with a Jim Carrey flick will be direly disappointed when they shove the anonymous videotape into the machine, press play, and stare and stare at the horror that is the RING. The movie starts off pretty slow, with just some dude watching you from inside a ring, but soon excitement races as we see...wow! A guy with a towel on top of his head, pointing at something off-screen! Seriously now, this movie is very, very scary. The urban legend of an incomprehensible videotape that kills anyone who watches it after seven days, leaving only one clue for the cops (extreme fear on their faces), is very chilling and creepy, and should make sure that anyone who's seen The RING looks twice at their rental movie's title before putting it on.A mother and reporter hears about the tape and the many mysterious deaths surrounding it. Desperate to solve the mystery, she seeks to find the tape, and when she does, she actually watches it, like an idiot. Pretty soon a bunch of people have watched the tape and had that horrible phone call, including the reporter's own son, Yoichio. Now the reporter has less than seven days to solve the mystery and rescue her son from the evil of the RING. Along with her psychic ex-husband, she unravels the horrible history of Sadako.The scariness of the movie is hard to explain. Maybe it's the fact that you'll be reluctant to sit down in front of a TV ever again, or the fact that Sadako is so horrifyingly gross, or the sadistic conclusion of the movie, or perhaps the atmospheric sets and environments, where the horror is merely implied to the viewer and never actually seen.The strange thing about RINGU, especially for a high-ranking horror movie, is that there is actually only one murder (on-screen). But the perfect, smooth unraveling of the Japanese mystery makes it a one-time once-in-a-life-time experience for the viewer. When Sadako finally makes her appearance on-screen (pun intended), you'll be shocked out of your pants and have a hard time sleeping after wards.Watch it alone, at night. You'll have a permanent insomnia.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only I saw this before the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am one of the unfortunate ones who saw the remake version of The Ring before seeing the original. I thought it was quite good but not amazing but it left me with wanting to see the original just to compare them. I really wanted to like the remake but just found to many faults with it so when I finally got to see the original I was pleasantly surprised to see it was actually bloody good and had a lot more to it than the remake did.For one the history of the video and the people in it was a lot more interesting and in depth. What I also liked with Ring was it wasn't trying to be scary, it just was. Everything about it whether it be the shot's of landscapes or the surprising flashbacks when happen when you don't expect them is just creepy and intriguing. I think when you are intrigued by a film it is quite scary to see what the actual outcome is like and with Ring you never know what to expect. What was also good was that I saw the US Ring about a year ago and thought that less of it was that I couldn't really remember the film except from the beginning when the two teen girls are talking about seeing the video but when scenes came I did begin to recollect them.I am pleased to have finally seen the original as I really enjoyed it more and now I am going to role onto Ring 2 and Ring O and hopefully will come out watching the best horror trilogy since never.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This is a rare case where the non-US original is vastly inferior to Hollywood remake.The remake is more polished for sure, and avoids the more laughable shock techniques (negative freeze frames at death). But that's not the reason, even though `Ringu` was a bigger hit in Japan than `Ring` in the US.The reason is that the US screenwriters apparently did some thinking about the matter, and what works. In the original, the emphasis is on the girl and her ability to psychically connect. In the remake, the emphasis is on the evil in the tape itself. That tape acts on its own; the girl is a result, opposite from the cosmology of the Japanese version. The remake supported this in many ways. Remember the fly which moved from within to without and why? Remember all the extra visual meaning the remake added to the tape, like the tree? Remember how the Dad had his own collection of video equipment?That's because it is a whole lot spookier to be watching a movie and be convinced that movies themselves can be evil. American kids are remarkably sophisticated in this sort of self-reflection (though they stupidly call it irony, go figure). I think way more than half of the Hollywood projects aimed at kids not only use self-reference, but depend on it as a central feature.

		<shortDescription>The short 'curse' film is a masterpiece. (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Such was the cult-like swelling of appreciation around this picture, that I was surprised to discover that in terms of effect and ambition it was at best a variant of 'The X-Files'. A particularly good, intelligent, eerie X-File, maybe, with an excellent sense of narrative, but an X-File nonetheless. In the West at any rate, it does not have the same impact as the movie it's been most compared to, 'The Blair Witch Project' - 'Ring''s exquisite formalism (in direction, plotting and acting) is in contrast with the compelling contrived naturalism of the American film, its roots in America's past, folk legends etc. The disparity between the Michael Haneke-like clarity of the image, and the various traces that can be made out - a reflection on a window, the glow of a lamp - is where the real chill is.It is a cliche that the horror movie puts on the surface those things a society would rather not acknowledge - 'Ring' takes this literally, the source of its horrors being a young woman buried alive in a well. The repressed traumas that Japan is hiding, then, on the basis of this film, is the old, conservative past. It is surely significant that the victims are all 'morally suspect' - the teenage friends who go out of town for presumed sexual licence; the daughter of a mother who isn't in the home. The heroine is an independent single mother who leaves her son at home for alarmingly long patches. The new Western liberalism taints everyone.The new capitalist Japan is not even as we might imagine it from received opinion - there are few teeming streets, noisy traffic jams, bright neon signs, consumer overload, towering skyscrapers. This is very much a quiet, minimalist Japan, of large empty rooms filled with dread, of quiet empty streets. All everyday sound is magnified to seem hyperreal, threatening. All absences betray the expectation of a malevolent presence. Old Japan is very much alive in the elaborate, formal religious rituals, but in this film they are funeral rites, linking the traditional to death, and it is this suppressed tradition that returns from the dead. After all Sadako is killed by an adulterer. It is also the revenge of forgotten provinces on Tokyo, the regional infecting the metropolitan, nature fighting back artifice, history versus post-modernism. Women, though, are always witches. Plus ca change.Of course, the curse is disseminated by modernity's most sophisticated and pervasive mode of communication, TV, itself a museum of the dead, especially late at night, when Sadako strikes, along with all the old movies and forgotten stars.If 'Ring' itself seems rather smallscreen, the little curse-movie is a masterpiece - part-Bunuel, part-Dreyer, with its hair-brushing woman, characters teeming like an insect hive, crawling men, hooded votaries, incredibly symbolically-loaded well, it is easily the best film I've seen all year. This makes the potentially risible denouement, as Sadako emerges from the TV, so poignant, as she jerks like old scratchy film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tonight, I saw both Ringu and The Ring. My frineds wanted to compare, and I was just there for the ride, having not seen either.Ringu is far better, as far as explaining things goes. I like the psychic parent deal - the smooth, psychic experiences do a far better job at connecting the background pieces, than the disjointed moments of the American version. The steps taken are more logical (let's get a shovel and buckets to locate and empty the well, rather than just look in and end up getting shoved in by the TV), and while the effects aren't as impressive, that's ok. Acting is better on the whole, as well.Plus, Yoichi is far more likable than the kid in the American version, who, while adding creepiness, just isn't that likable.Overall, better than The Ring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While I prefer the American version, this is still a must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Series Note: There are many different films, television series, books, comic books, etc. based on the "Ring Universe", and it's very complicated trying to sort them out. While this film was the first released and is considered the "grandfather" of the Japanese series, there was a prequel released in 2000 named Ringu 0: Basudei (Ring 0: Birthday). Depending on your preferences, watch this film first for "maximum mystery", or if you like a more chronologically linear story, as I do, watch the prequel first. In either event, you should follow this film with either Rasen (aka Spiral, 1998), which was the original "Ring 2" (and which more closely follows the second novel), or with the "official" Ringu 2 (1999).---------------------------------------At the same time that some teens are turning up dead, a rumor is going around that the deaths are correlated to a mysterious piece of video, sometimes seen on videotape, but rumored to also be broadcast. If one sees the video, one receives a call telling them that they will die within a week, and it's not an idle threat. Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) is a television news reporter doing a story on the rumors about the video. When her niece mysteriously dies, she happens upon evidence that links her niece and the videotape story, including seeing the tape and receiving a call herself. Can she, with the aid of her ex-husband, Ryuji Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada), get to the bottom of the story before her time is up? The bad news for the "anti-Hollywood" crowd is that I don't think this version of the Ring is as good as Gore Verbinksi's 2002 remake. The good news is that this is still a quality film, and it is imperative viewing for anyone interested in the Ring mythos, which has become quite extensive over the years.There are two reasons why I feel this film is inferior. The first is that it is constructed mostly as a straightforward, linearly logical "detective story", but keeps wanting to go back to a more surreal plot--the two never quite mesh. The detective story at times has an almost Hitchcockian feel, which is certainly an asset, but that invites a meticulously analytical attitude from the viewer, in the midst of which we're given more typically Asian (and European) horror film dream logic. For example, it's not quite clear what happens to some characters; often events just happen "out of the blue". And the rules of the curse--especially the telephone call aspect--are never quite clear, either.The second problem is that director Hideo Nakata makes most of his revelations too easy for his characters--a lot of suspense is lost because more often than not, the answers just fall into their laps. If we're in mystery/thriller/suspense mode, we need to not have characters figure out the references from the videotape so quickly, for example. We also need them to not figure out the geographic source of the curse so easily.Also, at least in the DVD pressing I have, the picture quality is horrible, with the darks frequently being too black to make out the action, there are lots of dirt and scratches on the print, which isn't very crisp, and so on. This latter problem is probably not due to bad cinematography, but a lousy import edition (so I didn't subtract any points for it).But the film has two facts strongly in its favor--strong enough to recover at least one point lost to the flaws above. One, the basic idea of the story is simply enchanting. Two, Nakata is good at building subtle atmosphere.The success of the story is easy to discern from the legions of films that have been influenced by the Ring in some way, including FearDotCom (2002) and Ju-On (2000)--and these within only a few years. Beneath the surface, the story stems from deeply rooted urban legends and fears that one can be cursed or hexed by a malicious person in some way. On the surface, the film is creepy because of its inscrutable mystery (and again, this is felt strongest if you watch this film before the others, at least on your first cycle through the films), aided by the ingenious device of the enigmatic videotape. As the mystery is delved into, it becomes disturbing for "the facts behind the case", rooted as they are in taboos, incomprehensible injustices and possibly intimately tied to supernatural beings.Nakata gradually takes us from innocent teens in an at least functional slumber-party mode to a strongly metaphorical descent into hell, which is then unwittingly brought back up to the surface. Although he and scriptwriter Hiroshi Takahashi (basing his work on Koji Suzuki's novel) touch on a lot of horror clichés along the way, such as teens getting killed while having sex, they more often circumvent the banal. We don't even meet the "villain" for almost an hour and twenty minutes, and of course it shouldn't be any sooner. The key to the film is gradually circling the entrancing mystery, with terror being a factor of a face-to-face counter with the unknown and inexplicable.Most of the horror in the film is extremely subtle and bloodless. This is an excellent example of how the genre can be realized in our contemporary era without relying on gore or over-the-top violence. Of course, it's not that I mind gore and over-the-top violence, but I like variety.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie proves that people from different cultures are freaked out by different things. When they remade this movie in the US, they made a couple parts more scary (the weird corpses are definitely scarier in the US version...gave menightmares, they did. "I saw her face." BLAAAAAAHHHH). But they also tookall the mystery out of Sadako, giving Samara lines like "It never stops" (she's scarier as a mute, you fools!) and for that, I'll never forgive them. In fact, I'll probably burn down their homes while cursing their mothers.Ringu's requisite "weird little kid" character is much better than the grotesque Aidan in The Ring. That Aidan's eyeballs are trying to escape the confines of his skull in every scene. No thanks, I'd much rather see a film where kids don't behave like adults (much less adults with morbid ocular disorders). So in that respect the original is superior.Nanako Matsushima is great, and I praise this film for launching her popularity and allowing her to do the cute green tea commercials I've been seeing lately in Tokyo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Haunting, Surreal &amp; Disturbing Cinema With A Mystical Power Of Its Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A downright creepy, cleverly paced &amp; patiently narrated chiller whose success spawned a trend of Hollywood remakes of Asian horror flicks, Ring (also known as Ringu) doesn't rely on conventional tricks like jump scares or blood-filled gore to frighten its viewers but allows their imagination to do the required job, and lets its ominous atmosphere act as a catalyst.The story of Ring revolves around a videotape that is fabled to bear a jinx that kills its viewers after 7 days. The plot follows a TV reporter who conducts her own investigation, when her niece &amp; her 3 other friends die under mysterious circumstances, and ultimately stumbles upon the ill-fated video herself. With limited time on her hands, she attempts to find a way to lift the curse.Directed by Hideo Nakata, an aura of mystery &amp; menace permeates every frame of this feature and the controlled manner in which its events transpire allows those elements to ingrain itself in the viewers' subconscious. The haunting, surreal &amp; disturbing imagery that make up the contents of the cursed tape carries a mystical power of its own, and manages to deliver the chills despite not revealing much.The entire picture is encapsulated with a grim tone &amp; overcast ambiance, each scene unfolds as if there's a clue hidden somewhere in every frame, and the cold colour palette adds more layers of bleakness to it. Editing is expertly carried out, for it keeps the narrative tightly-wrapped and allows it to unfurl at its own pace. And the cast does a commendable job in their given roles, and play their part with utmost sincerity.On an overall scale, Ring makes each &amp; every one of its aspects work in favour of its story and remains one of the finest horror films to come out of Japanese film industry. Shrouded in complete mystery, effectively sustaining its sinister mood for the entirety of its runtime, and wrapping itself up with an unforeseen twist, Ring may not be scary on a visceral scale but its eerie element will still be an onslaught on the viewers' psyche.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish I saw Ringu before The Ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am one of those people who wished they had seen the original version before seeing the remake. I made this mistake twice now. Not anymore. Last year, around the same time, I started watching Japanese horror movies. I watched The Grudge trilogy (2004, 2006 &amp; 2009) before watching the 2000 movies, Ju-On: The Curse and its sequel; which I both had mistaken for the movies that was remade as The Grudge, despite the fact that certain elements were taken from The Curse; such as the jaw scene. However, luckily enough, I have a chance to make this right when I plan on watching Dark Water soon. I also watched Kairo (2001) before watching its American remake: Pulse (2006), and I'm glad I did. If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge you to do so.Ringu is a quite minimalistic horror movie as a whole, which is definitely not a bad thing. In fact, it's even better. Overall, I prefer The Ring over Ringu, but there are certain elements that Ringu has that its American remake, The Ring, doesn't have. Ringu doesn't rely on jump scares as much as The Ring does. Like most Japanese horror movies that came after Ringu, it relies on its atmosphere. While the feeling of dread is surely not missed in The Ring, the combination with its cheap scare tactics is what ultimately weakens the atmosphere in comparison.As a result of watching The Ring before Ringu, I was quite underwhelmed by the last scene of the movie. I did not feel frightened by the scene because I knew what was coming. If I hadn't seen the remake first, and thus hadn't known what would happen, this movie surely would've scared the living hell out of me. In the end, The Ring blew Ringu right out of the water. But for reasons very obvious: a bigger budget and improved technology, it is clearly the superior movie. A 6/10 for Ringu, and an 8/10 for The Ring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>effective ghostly horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Teenagers Masami and Tomoko talk about a videotape that kills you a week after viewing it. Tomoko dies with a horrified expression and Masami goes insane. TV reporter Reiko Asakawa is investigating the killer videotape and is shocked by her niece Tomoko's death. Tomoko and three friends had rented a cabin in Izu. Reiko goes to Izu and retrieves the videotape. She watches the tape herself setting off the cycle once again.I watched the American version before the Japanese original. I think it actually helped me follow the story because the American movie essentially copied the Japanese movie. This one is not quite as polished as the American version. However it has the same moody atmosphere if not more. This is an effective ghostly horror no matter which version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Essential Modern Japanese Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ruthlessly murdered by her father, the ghost of a seer's daughter kills all those who watch a weird video after seven days; unless the viewer finds the escape clause.Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Hollywood horror had largely been dominated by the slasher subgenre, which relied on on-screen violence, shock tactics, and gore. "Ring", whose release in Japan roughly coincided with the stylistically similar "The Blair Witch Project" in the United States, helped to revitalize the genre by taking a more restrained approach to horror, leaving much of the terror to the audience's imagination. The film initiated global interest in Japanese cinema in general and Japanese horror cinema in particular, a renaissance which led to the coining of the term J-Horror in the West. This "New Asian Horror" resulted in further successful releases, such as "Ju-on: The Grudge" and "Dark Water".This really is the essential modern Japanese horror film. Not only did it launch a cycle of American remakes and get more people to notice Japanese horror, but it is terrifying in its own right. Some have tried to analyze it as a metaphor on motherhood or being about traditional Japanese culture. But really, it was just scary... and still is almost 20 years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still One Of The Best Horror's Of This Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a young girl by the name of Tomoko Ôishi dies in mysteries circumstances, her aunt, Reiko Asakawa, who is an investigative journalist, starts to look into the strange accounts in which Tomoko died. Reiko learns of three other teens who died the exact same way and at the exact same time as Tomoko. She also finds out that they all watched a strange video tape a week earlier which upon finishing, they received a phone call. Reiko's investigation takes her to a cabin that the teens were staying in and it's here she finds the mysterious tape. She watches it and, low and behold, she receives a phone call. Not knowing what to do, she calls her ex-husband, Ry?ji, for some help. Ry?ji views the video tape but unfortunately, a few days later, so does their son, Y&#x14d;ichi. Learning that it is real, it now becomes a matter of time to try and figure out how to lift the curse...if possible.Ring (Ringu) is one of the original Japanese movies of this genre, and it's still, to this day, one of the best. I have actually seen much scarier movies than Ring, but it's the originality &amp; delivery of the story that keeps it good. That and the scares of course.As a side note, I'd just like to say that there's absolutely nothing wrong with the American remake, and that is still a good, creepy movie, but this original version is just that bit better. The story does get a bit slow in places but it doesn't ever get to the point where it just drags on. It keeps you involved and interested as it unfolds, and there's no unnecessary scares or "plot fillers" just for the sake of it.It's well written, it's well filmed and it keeps you watching right up to the climactic ending.Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mysterious video kills whoever views it, unless that viewer can solve its mystery. Sight &amp; Sound critic Mark Kermode praised the film's "timeless terror," with its "combination of old folk devils and contemporary moral panics" This film is in my opinion one of the most atmospheric films I have ever seen. It is full of a brooding tense atmosphere that lasts for the entirety of the film. I personally love this type of film because it leaves you on the edge of your seat. This is one of the scariest films that I have ever seen. It takes a lot to scare me but this film scared me in different ways.

		<shortDescription>If only all modern horror was this good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ring is the only J horror I have watched to date. In general, I'm sick and tired of horror movies because they're all the same. Not this one. This nightmarish, chilling and stratospherically creepy horror movie isn't just a great horror movie, but in general a great film. The story is simple: A video tape kills people 7 days after they watch it, and a journalist tries not to become the next victim. It may sound ordinary, but I have never seen such a creepy movie in my life. Rather than jump scares and gore, the movie is filled to the brim with creepy imagery, atmospheric lighting, shiver inducing music and chilling locations. Even though there aren't many actual scares, you forget about it and are still watching through your fingers even when there's nothing going on. It is the best type of ghost story: Simple, clear and effective, and even though VHS no longer exists, it's still utterly terrifying.Without CGI or gore, the film takes normal modern technology and turns it into a living nightmare in a way no other film I've seen has done. As for that final scene, let's just say you'll never look at a TV the same way again. Some may find the film dull, which I can understand, but don't expect loads of repeated scares because you won't get them. It's endless creepy imagery, with one massive scare at the end. This might be the best horror movie of the 90s, and most modern horror films cower in its shadow. The villain, despite little screen time makes a huge dent, and the temperature in the room will drop many degrees every time she appears. A haunting and influential horror bull's eye. Comparing this to the remake is like comparing the altitudes of a plane and a submarine.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the American remake first and loved it. So naturally, the original would probably fail to impress me as I've seen it done already and on a higher budget, right? Wrong. The original deserves all the respect and praise it gets. There are several elements it does better than the remake: this includes the video which is far more psychologically disturbing and Sadako herself, whose scenes represent the pinnacle of horror. Our two leads are also pretty likable, though the son is unfortunately the creepy zombie I disliked in the remake.I'm sure some people won't be scared by this, especially since it s an older movie with a plot most are well versed in by now. But this movie must get credit for just how groundbreaking it was at the time. Personally, I think it holds up really well, considering I only saw it for the first time recently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most effective horror films of the past 20 years, Hideo Nakata's "Ringu" (or "Ring") is a terrifying and very human ghost-story that will chill you to the bone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something to be said about the strength of good, eerie, slowly- paced horror. Especially in a day and age as we are now, where horror is misinterpreted by filmmakers as loud, lazy jump-scares, buckets of gore, and nubile girls running around in next-to-nothing, fleeing from deranged murderers. There's something almost immediately admirable and exciting about a horror film that eschews these more modern (and decidedly not scary) tactics, and instead respects its audience, using atmosphere, a slowly building pace, subtlety and well-developed characters to draw us into a pervasive, overwhelming sense of dread.Think about some horror classics: John Carpenter's "Halloween" (or even more effectively, his remake "The Thing"), Hitchcock's "Psycho", Peter Medak's "The Changeling", etc. They all were respectful, subtle films that didn't rely on cheapness and laziness like so many other modern horror films. And I do believe that Hideo Nakata's "Ringu" (or "Ring"), a 1998 Japanese horror film inspired by the novels of Koji Suzuki, belongs on a list with those classics. It is a powerful film for it's quiet nature, subtle storytelling and well-developed characters, and they are what makes it so effective and frightening. (Although tragically, it's most recent sequel, "Sadako 3D" does eschew the classic, subtle storytelling for a more messy modern affair... more to come on that train-wreck in a later review.)We follow Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima), a reporter who is investigating an increasingly popular urban legend regarding an alleged "haunted video", which supposedly causes the death of all who see it. After probing the recent death of her niece, Reiko decides to retrace their last few days, and discovers a mysterious video-tape in a cabin they had rented. Realizing that the urban legend of the haunted tape is true, Reiko and her ex husband Ryugi (Hiroyuki Sanada) are forced to try and solve the mystery of who created it and how to stop it.The performances are fantastic. Matsushima as our lead is brilliant and very well-developed, and is able to show both strength as well as draw the audience's sympathy. (Plus my piggish side does have to admit she is very easy on the eyes) Sanada shows a lot of talent and intensity as Ryugi, and he is able to balance well with Matsushima with their good chemistry on-screen. And other performances, including Rikiya &#x14c;taka as Yoichi, the son of Reiko and Ryugi, are all very well-played and elevate the film quite a bit. It's a phenomenal cast.Nakata's direction is quite a sight to behold. It's very subtle, simplistic and direct, which actually makes it all the more unsettling. He doesn't go out of his way to highlight the horror, or present the monsters with dramatic camera angles and musical stings- scenes are staged and shot simply, and it makes every feel very real. You get a sense that anything can happen at any time, causing non-stop dread later in the film. The script by Hiroshi Takahashi is fantastic, slowly building the tension and developing the characters over the 96 minute run-time in a way that puts many other films to shame, and makes us not only care about everyone, but have a very real, human fear for their safety.The rest of the production is fantastic and very true-to-life. The set design is great, giving us a world that feels like the same one we live in. Costume design is simple, real and effective. The editing is top- notch, giving us a slow-build. And the musical score by Kenji Kawai is amazing. It's very minimal, and only comes in when it's needed, giving us an occasional spine-tingling violin shriek, or an eerie scraping of strings in the background."Ringu" is easily not only one of the best horror films to come out of Japan in the past 20 years, but it's easily one of the best horror films worldwide to be released in the past 20 years. And it's cultural impact (spawing so far four sequels in Japan, an American remake and sequel, and countless other works inspired by it) is something to behold. I do believe that 50 years from now, it will still be looked at as a fantastic accomplishment in horror filmmaking. The only thing I don't like about it is one particularly bad sound-effects choice that caused me to laugh out loud during a fairly crucial moment (A cartoonish sound that comes near the end and sticks out like a sore thumb), but even that cannot diminish the film in any way whatsoever."Ringu" gets a perfect 10. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor... get it, turn off the lights, and have a spooky time watching it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clichéd horror movie, but understanding of some deep anxiety.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Either I'm stupid, the Japanese are stupid, or something was lost in translation. This was such a mixed bucket.Built around the weird and upsetting, Ringu combines supernatural elements with it's own original tape-horror aesthetic. It's unfortunate that the film is riddled with silliness, dumb character decisions, and chuckle-out-loud(?) conversations. Hell, it's also filled with quite a few incredibly eerie moments (I mean so eerie as to make me get up, turn on the lights, refill my tea, then sit down and hold on) that can make you forget it's earlier transgressions.Eerie is key here, it's not terrifying, but definitely a scary experience. I'm sure it was scarier when you actually watched the movie on VHS or with one sitting back at home. Now it's hard to make a connection. I mean, my blu-ray would NEVER do such a thing (his name is Franklin)!What brings most people to the film is it's touching on our collective anxiety with these newfangled VHS machines ( too cynical?). And it still applies to Franklin. I can't say much on this that hasn't already been said, but I can agree that the film tapped into a collective feeling, whether consciously or not, I'm sure the Japanese ( being the techno- infused cyberpunks they are) feel more than I ever will.Either way, give it a look. It's an hour-and-a-half well spent.</fullReview>

This film was said to be one of the best horror movies made in Japan, but i think it's the worst, The Grudge is much better. Movie is really slow, victim's faces when they die not scary at all. But the best thing disappointed me that i can't see Sadako's face. The only reason i give this film 4 because it's original, and the scene Sadako went out the TV is somewhat real. But i suggest you shouldn't see this movie if you're a fan of Japan horror movies, i have to skip about 45 minutes in order not to doze off.

		<fullReview>I must be fair and admit that I've heard of this film because of the Hollywood remake, which I watched and really loved! So being the Horror fan that I am, I've decided to educate myself and watch the original. Because I saw the remake before the original, all I could do is compare the two... and I must admit I found the remake to be a lot scarier.Many believe that the the original version of a film, especially the original version of a Japanese Ghost-Story, is always better than the Hollywood remake. I can't honestly know what I would have though had I seen the original first... but seeing as how I hadn't, I stand by my opinion. The remake, which was a lot more "graphic" (especially the petrified faces of the victims and the way it showed the ghost), along with the small changes it made to the story and plot - scared me almost half to death. Whereas this one, original, artistic and excellent as it is, is somewhat of a "scare-downgrade" in comparison.All in all, I must pay the proper respects to Ringu, it's horrifying story and originally terrifying ideas. Those of you who are less fans of "cheap scare tactics" and appreciate a genuinely terrifying atmosphere would really enjoy the original version. As for me - I prefer the remake (unlike The Grudge, where the original is a lot better). In any case, if you consider yourself a true Horror freak, you must give the original a chance, and you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Videotape Scares In The Age Of DVD and Internet Download</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ring is a Japanese horror film directed by Hideo Nakata that was adapted from the novel Ring by K&#x14d;ji Suzuki that draws on the Japanese folk tale Banch&#x14d; Sarayashiki. It features Nanako Matsushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Rikiya &#x14c;taka together with Miki Nakatani,Y&#x16b;ko Takeuchi,Hitomi Sat&#x14d;, Y&#x14d;ichi Numata,Yutaka Matsushige and Katsumi Muramatsu.The story is about a cursed, disturbing videotape that, when watched, will cause the viewer to die a week after.The screenplay was written by Hiroshi Takahashi.In this movie, a legend circulates among teenagers that if one watches a certain video at a certain time of the night, the telephone will ring right afterward, and one week later, you will die. When Masami tells her friend Imako this story, she scoffs -- but a week later, Imako dies. Imako's aunt, a television journalist named Reiko, hears that not long before she died, Imako was watching a strange video with her friends -- all of whom have turned up dead. Reiko tracks down a copy of the video, and as she watches its strange, spectral images, the telephone begins to ring.The next morning, Reiko begins a desperate search to solve the mystery of the video, convinced she has only seven days to live; assisting her is Ryuji, a mathematics expert and her former husband. This film is done expertly as it combines supernatural elements with anxieties about modern technology in a truly frightening way.The story is engaging.The acting of the Japanese cast was top-notch.And most of all,the direction of Nakata was phenomenal.It retains the power to chill despite the fact that the use of videotape seems old and low tech due to the technological advances now that we are living in the age of DVD and internet download.Nevertheless,Ring remains a landmark in horror films not only in Japan but world cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got around to seeing this movie last night (Halloween!) and found it enjoyable, but a little disappointing after all that I had heard about it. However I woke up this morning thinking about the plot and feeling genuinely uneasy about the open cupboard door in my bedroom so it definitely did its job to some extent.After checking in here and reading so many reviewers' comparison of this film to 'Videodrome' I'd also like to point out its similarities to a classic old b/w horror called 'Night Of The Demon' (1957). That film features a paper inscribed with runes which will a short time later lead to the horrible death of anyone who finds it in their possession.Similar, then, to the videotape conceit of 'Ringu'; however, the protagonist in 'Night Of The Demon' is highly sceptical of the supernatural and the film follows his gradual conversion as he realises the true horror of the fate that approaches him. Personally I found this idea more interesting and more realistic than the bland acceptance of the supernatural exhibited by the characters in 'Ringu'.So if you enjoyed 'Ringu', check out 'Night Of The Demon', a creaky horror classic! (But steer clear of the US edit re-titled 'Curse Of The Demon', which removed much of the vital exposition.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy And Original, If Slightly Over-hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hideo Nakata's "Ringu" of 1998 is one of the most widely acclaimed Horror films of the 1990s, even more so since Hollywood remade it as "The Ring" in 2002. I haven't seen the remake, and I probably never will, since Hollywood remakes tend to make me angry. The original "Ringu" is definitely a creepy and immensely atmospheric film, but, as far as I am considered, its reputation as a highlight of Japanese Horror cinema is exaggerated. Horror is probably my favorite genre, and there is no doubt in my mind that Japan is one of the world's greatest cinematic countries. Yet, I find this particularly famed Japanese cult-horror film to be slightly overrated, both for its genre and country. The 1990s were not a very good decade for Horror, however, and "Ringu" is without doubt an original and eerie film."Ringu" is about a mysterious videotape that is rumored to kill everybody who sees it exactly one week after viewing it... This is a quite original premise, which keeps the story interesting throughout the film. The film maintains a gloomy, menacing atmosphere, and the frightening sequences are definitely creepy. Yet, it wasn't quite as suspenseful as I had hoped, and in spite of the eerie atmosphere it never keeps the viewer stuck to the edge of his chair (at least not me, that is). The performances are entirely very good, especially Nanako Matsushima and Miki Nakatani (a very charismatic and beautiful actress, whom I personally admire) are great in their roles. The bleak colors and good photography make the film even more atmospheric. All things considered, "Ringu" definitely is a good film that Horror lover's shouldn't miss. I just don't agree that it one of the absolute genre highlights of the last decade. If you want to see truly brilliant Japanese Horror from the late 90s, I recommend Takashi Miike's nightmarish masterpiece "Audition" of 1999. "Ringu" is, in my opinion, not quite as brilliant and essential a film as it is sometimes hyped to be. Nonetheless, it is definitely an atmospheric, creepy and original chiller that I highly recommend!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An iconic, inventive and at the time, highly original mystery/suspense thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing I like best about Japanese horror is the sense of atmosphere. The use of lingering, slow burning tension, when a character approaches a closed door that we know they shouldn't open, but we still want them too regardless. For me, it's everything that horror should be. No gratuitous gore, no shock MTV style montages; just a slow, lingering feeling of dread that grows with intensity from one scene to the next. It also helps that the majority of these films are directed with flair and imagination, whilst - for the most part at least - offering us intelligent characters and interesting scenarios.Ringu (1998), or The Ring as it is more commonly known, is largely considered to be the first major release to kick-start the recent revival of Asian horror/supernatural cinema in the west. As a result, it has probably lost some of its initial appeal since first gaining cult-notoriety as a straight to video picture ten years ago (doesn't time fly?); with countless parodies, rip-offs and the inevitable Hollywood remake all detracting from the original film's sense of slow burning mystery and suspense. Now, I'm certainly not going to pretend that I was amongst the very first wave of viewers to champion the film; especially since I only got around to experiencing it after having already witnessed the 2002 Hollywood version, as well as having experienced countless other Asian horror films, such as The Eye (2000), A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) and Ju On: The Grudge (2003). It must also be said here that all three of those particular examples excited and enveloped me much more than any fastidious viewing of Ringu; although again, this is perhaps down to how iconic and over familiar the images of the film have become from the innumerable references that have been made to it in the name of popular culture, as well as something of a process of refinement; with each subsequent Ringu-knock off expanding and elaborating upon the template set here.Like Psycho (1960), The Exorcist (1973) and countless Spielberg blockbusters, Ringu has become one of those iconic films that are familiar to audiences who have yet to experience even a single frame. As a result, you could probably call the film a victim of its own success, or maybe even something that really needs to be experienced within the context of which it was originally created. You also have to try and disassociate yourself from the hype; something that seems to have confused certain viewers and led them to lash out at the film with a plethora of one-star reviews because it perhaps failed to deliver on what someone on the Internet suggested it would. This isn't really a fault of the film, as obviously, different people will always like different things; with the majority of Asian horror being so deeply rooted in the religious, historical and social conventions, concerns and taboos of actual Asian culture that it will always going to require a certain element of compromise on the part of an audience more familiar with westernised horror cinema; which tends to place more emphasis on sex and violence (be it psychological, or merely physical).Like the subsequent, similarly-themed films that came in its wake - such as Audition (1999), Ju On: The Grudge and director Hideo Nakata's own ensuing feature, Dark Water (2002) - the horror of Ringu looks back to the days of the slow-burning, classical Japanese horror of films such as Kwaidan (1964), Onibaba (1964) and Kuroneko (1968); films that perhaps don't seem all that horrific to a more adventurous or desensitised audience, with the horror really coming from the personification of ghosts and demons, or the sense of taboo. There's also elements of social commentary, with the idea of home entertainment pushing people further outside of society and allowing them to wallow in loneliness and alienation; an idea that is further developed in Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Pulse (2001). So, it was and still is a kind of horror that the majority of UK/US viewers were unaccustomed to, and this in itself is one of the reasons why I'm so fond of this particular style of film-making, and Japanese cinema as a whole. It also worked as a great gimmick too, with the idea of an audience renting a video about a tape that causes anyone who watches it to drop dead. This, for me, only added to the sinister atmosphere of foreboding menace; especially as I watched it alone at 2:30 in the morning (really the best time to experience any kind of horror film, in my opinion).Although admittedly less immediate in terms of shocks than the Ju On series, and a lot less thematically successful than similarly minded Asian horror such as The Eye and A Tale of Two Sisters, Ringu is still a solid piece of supernatural mystery and suspense. Yes, it is slow, and yes, it might require more than a single viewing to get the full effect, but it does stand up surprisingly well; even though I'm sure most potential viewers will know the broader aspects of the plot already. Ringu is definitely a film for anyone who appreciates interesting characters, intelligent and deliberately-paced plotting, and an atmosphere of claustrophobic and foreboding dread.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High in creep, low in shock and a rather entertaining mystery as well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the film that started the whole Asian horror remake fad that's been popular in the US as of late. Not that Hollywood hasn't been happy to remake movies from all over the world, but Ringu is at the start of it all. Having seen it, I can see some of the appeal.Ringu is a rather quiet movie that doesn't rely on a ton of scares. Rather, it works to create a sense of unease and impending doom and uses the suspense from that knowledge to propel the entertainment of the film forward. The story is essentially about an investigative reporter, while investigating the death of her niece, discovers a bizarre video that upon watching curses you to die within exactly one week of watching it. As her ex-husband gets drawn into the matter, they find themselves fighting a week-long deadline (pun intended) to find out how to reverse the curse, lest they meet the same terrible fate of the four high-schoolers that unfortunately met the tape before.One underlying commentary I found really interesting about the story was the relationship between the ex-es and how, although they clearly are no longer together for a reason, they still can't fully leave each other entirely either. I also like some of the running mythology about ESP and mental powers as it all helps the story make some good amount of sense. Both of these are different from the novel, which actually has a male protagonist and his snarky professor-friend racing to save their lives. The snarky professor friend isn't a psychic, but just brilliant and insightful, if a bit strange. Making the changes really helps the ghost-story aspect of the film to work well as well as providing a medium to tell a story about relationships as well.The overall film looks pretty good for a Japanese film from 1998. The direction is decent, good at building and maintaining suspense. I don't know if there's anything wrong with the acting; due to cultural differences, I accepted what I saw as what ought to be in terms of reactions, but I generally thought it was all pretty believable. I can't remember the score or the mixing, so I can't comment about that either. Visuals are a strong point, with a rather creepy video and some creepy images of death. I like the rhythm of the film, which builds like an atmospheric mystery that slowly unfolds, rather than a jumpy spookfest.While the film does lack in serious substance, I really like the understory about relationships and I wasn't really a fan of the novel's ending (which is somewhat replicated here), it still left me satisfied after watching it. I can't tell you how scary the film is because I've pretty much completely desensitized myself to scary movies, but I know that a lot of people I know were creeped out by the thing, so if you're looking for chills, you can probably still get them here. What we have is an above average horror film with a high-concept premise that pulls you through to the end. It's rather good for a horror film and if horror is what you're looking for, this is a good film to check out. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best Asian movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start by saying that the ring was the best horror film ever made- no joke- and it's Japanese original ain't too bad either. It sure does beat the ju-on series. Let me just give you the good and bad of it. GOOD: Its scary, very scary. It has a lot of atmosphere, but not as much as the American remake. The video tape is so nightmarish, i loved it. Its subtle and doesn't give away too much too soon. It has great acting and pace. The whole fantasy side of the film is also enjoyable. Some scenes are enjoyable for reasons I don't even know. And the final 20 minutes include some of the most amazing scenes ever. BAD: The video tape is a bit too short and had a lot of reasons to be longer. The make-up on Sadako was a little too simple and her hair could have been much darker and wetter. And i think it should've ended with a bang, not like (jump out of your seat bang) but maby a subliminal image of Sadako or something. Over all this is a real classic, i loved it and highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9.7 On The Creepometer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1998 Japanese thriller "Ringu" has turned out to be that country's most successful horror film of all time, spawning a series of movies over there as well as here in the U.S. I have not seen the American remake, but word on the street has it that the original is the one to go with, and since I've seen very few remakes that could compare to their original (1941's "The Maltese Falcon" being the most notable exception), I would tend to agree. I CAN tell you that "Ringu" is one extremely effective modern-day ghost story. It involves a mysterious videotape that spells the death of anyone who watches it, and the beautiful journalist (Nanako Matsushima) who investigates the background of said tape. It is a fascinating, involving story, which sometimes plays out like a police procedural, but with at least a 9.7 on the Creepometer. Eerie sound effects and music constantly keep the viewer primed for shocks, and although there is no real blood or violence to speak of, there IS a constant air of menace and dread. Many scenes will remind the veteran horror fan of other classic film moments: the supplied dates (e.g., Sunday, September 5th) with accompanying gonglike noises reminiscent of "The Legend of Hell House" (1973); excavating under a building for the bones of a dead child, like in "The Changeling" (1979); and the whole "teens in jeopardy from an urban legend" setup, from everything from the Freddy Krueger movies to "Candyman" (1992). I'm not sure whether all the pieces hang together in "Ringu," or if all our questions are answered, but I DO know that this film does indeed scare! Be sure to take the phone off the hook while watching this film; if it should happen to ring, you just might jump through the roof! And look out for that TV crawl-through scene!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ringu is a film that has terrified me to the bone. Its original story line and unnerving images is enough to send shivers down anybody's spine.When I first watched the film it's simplistic low key style was what struck me the most, but this only adds to the objective of it, to terrify. The Japanese location made the story more remote, but also made it more mysterious.Ringu is a movie that has used style, location and brilliant actors to scare the living day lights out of people, and believe me - they have done a very good job! I would recommend this film to all horror lovers, but would advise you not to watch it alone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very different approach to the source material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to say it right from the get-go.This story is very human and character-driven. If you were looking for a movie with real depth, I'm glad you found my review. The characters in the movie, with great acting and dialog, are very deep and you can tell how they will act and react as if you actually knew them. This gives a sense of familiarity, and you will be comfortable with it. But I highly doubt you will be comfortable, because this movie is probably one of the scariest you will ever see. The tension between Reiko Asakawa and Ryuji Takayama can be eerie at times because of their current relationship and history with each other. Aside from dealing with the threat they are faced with, they must also deal with each other and their anger with one another.This movie also discards the scientific approach to Sadako Yamamura's curse, by focusing on the supernatural aspect of it. This is probably the reason why people tend to like this movie better than "Rasen" (Spiral). Since the story is modified so much, do not expect an adaptation of the novel... expect a re-interpretation of it. If you want to watch an adaptation of the story, watch the television version... but have fun finding it! Because of Hideo Nakata's wonderful directing, Koji Suzuki's stories finally got the attention they deserved. People have become so familiar with the story, it's astounding. There is also many knock-offs of Sadako (Grudge/Ju-On, anyone?); saying it has become a worldwide icon would not be an overstatement. And even if you know the ending of this movie, it will scare the hell out of you. If you knew the budget of this movie, you'd be even more scared.Asakawa is in the midst of a new urban legend - a tape that murders in a week's passing - and must get the scoop on it after her niece and her friends die (at the exact same time too, I might add).Her investigation leads her to a rental cabin they had stayed at, but ends up getting more than she bargained for when she actually discovers the tape and innocently watches it. She knows that something specific must be performed before the deadline is up, and so enlists her ex-husband, Takayama, to help her solve the riddle.There investigating reveals that a long-dead woman is featured on the tape, brushing her hair. Shizuko was a psychic that was branded a fraud and drove herself to suicide. They find out her living location, and after more investigation, discover a secret that was meant to be buried. Shizuko had a daughter, Sadako, and she had mysteriously disappeared thirty years ago.Asakawa and Ryuji then discover that the tape was created by Sadako herself, who was thrown in a well left to die thirty years ago. They think that the only way to save themselves is to find Sadako's corpse and to release her vengeful spirit, in a race against time.*****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most original Horror movies that came out of the eastern film industry! And one that has been copied so many times it hurts. So watch this, to see where the hype started! But beware, because many will be alienated by the Japanese slow pacing of the movie. Many of my friends or people I know who watched this (with or without me), were bored! Again, not because the movie is bad per se, but because they're not used to what Japanese people watch in terms of storytelling! Some even laughed at very serious moments or even scary moments. So this shouldn't be necessarily your first Asian movie you watch, but if you can cope with those minor "flaws" (for most western audiences that is sadly true, although I myself don't see that as a flaw), than watch this horror movie! It's great! :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is It Really THAT Scary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered what would happen if you crossed The Mummy's Ghost with Poltergeist? Neither have I. But I am not Kôji Suzuki, writer of the novel that the movie Ringu is based on. Now, I must admit, I've never actually read the book, however I am aware that it is amazingly popular in both its native Japan and around the world. So presumably Hiroshi Takahashi had a lot to live up to when he produced the screenplay. Luckily I am neither a massive animé fan nor prepared to go and read the graphic novel to compare the two. Besides, would it really help with my review of the movie? Almost certainly not.Opening with a classic horror movie conceit, the 'camp fire' story, Ringu is a post-modern telling of a classic story; the vengeful ghost seeking revenge on the living.Investigating the death of her niece, news reporter Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) stumbles onto the urban legend of a video tape that is rumoured to be cursed. Anyone who watches it will die seven days later. After much investigation she manages to track down the tape and so naturally she watches it.Thanks to this rather obvious faux pas, Reiko spends the rest of the movie trying to lift the curse. In doing so she shows her psychic ex-husband Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada) the film as well. Her poor, innocent son also watches the video, although, to be fair, she didn't actually give it to him, she just left it around so that he could watch it when she wasn't looking.Now, I may be coming across a trifle harsh. However I would like to stress that I did enjoy this movie greatly. While I may not think the story itself is fantastic (though a few elements are wonderful) as with any ghost story, that isn't important. What is important is the telling, and judging by this movie Nakata must have had all the other Cub Scouts soiling themselves by the fire.What this movie has in bucket-loads is style. Nakatas use of camera angles is both compelling and awkward, and the sudden appearance of characters into frame leaves the watcher unsure of what may happen next. When you watch you see great scene after great scene. Some stand-out moments include: a skull seeming to cry ooze; Sadako climbing out of the well on the television, approaching the screen and stepping into the physical world, (probably the best scene in the movie); and of course the cursed video itself, a mis-mash of images and sounds that Dali would be proud of.I watched this movie with a group of seven or eight other people, most of whom had seen it before. I noticed two things. Firstly my friends are eminently predictable (the house phone rang just after the first time the cursed video played). Still, it was amusing. Second, and far more interesting, was noticing their reaction to certain scenes. At one point, during a flashback./vision, we see Sadako kill a reporter simply with the power of her mind. I fond his death quite horrific as he collapsed in agonising pain, however quite a few people watching the movie laughed at that point. I don't know if this reflects on the way I watch movies or the way they do. However, as I hadn't really watched this movie before I did find myself regretting watching it with others, as I think I would have been able to immerse myself in the movie more, which is something you have to do with a psychological horror if you are going to truly enjoy it as the director wanted.The importance of this movie to Western audiences cannot be overstated. This helped open the doors to Japanese horror movies. (Or, as those of us in the know like to call them, J-Horror). It has also been remade at least twice, by Korea and America, with the American adaptation made by Nakata himself.If you haven't yet seen this movie then I do advise you to watch it alone. It is scary, but it is an intellectual fear and so one we need to truly process, which is much harder to do with someone munching popcorn next to you. Go ahead; let yourself be drawn in and given a fright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good and influential horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror genre of the early 21st century has been marked by a strong influence from modern Asian cinema, as a whole new generation of horror films began to reach worldwide audiences charming fans across the globe due to their highly artistic visuals, stylish language and creepy atmospheres. This New Wave of Asian Horror Cinema suddenly became one of the most important sources of horror films as it gave new life to a genre too damaged by the huge amount of derivative slasher that copied the 1996 hit, "Scream". And to think that everything began with this modest Japanese film that single-handedly changed the face of horror forever.Based on successful novel by Japanese author Koji Suzuki, "Ringu" is the tale of a news reporter named Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima), who is investigating a strange series of deaths among teenagers apparently linked to an urban legend. Suppousedly, there is a cursed videotape that causes the death to those who watch it, exactly a week after being exposed to it. At first Reiko is not really convinced by the story, but when her own niece, Tomoko (Yuko Takeuchi), is found dead in the same circumstances as the other teenagers, Reiko's investigation gets serious. As she comes into the possession of the tape Tomoko watched, she'll discover the mystery and the horror behind the urban legend.Adapted by Hiroshi Takahashi, the plot takes a good amount of liberties in the adaptation, however, it's safe to say that the theme and overall atmosphere of the novel remain the same. Focused on the mystery of the tape, as well as in Asakawa's attempt to stop her own demise, the movie flows with a smooth rhythm, despite having a slow pace most of the times. Takahashi's changes to Suzuki's novel make the story a bit more personal and intimate; by making the main character a mother (instead of a father) and using the family as a plot device, Takahashi creates a more likable heroine that certainly carries the film very good thanks to the effort put in the development of the characters as well as in shrouding the mystery.Directed by Hideo Nakata, "Ringu" is a minimalist horror film that for the most part favors atmosphere over jump scares (although it has its fair share of this kind of scares). Playing cleverly with his budget, Nakata successfully makes a believable story of supernatural powers with almost minimal use of special effects and trusting more in the atmosphere of dread created by the mystery and the suspense of the story. Visually, the movie owes a lot to Japanese folklore, and it could be said that the story cursed videotape is a clever update to classic Japanese folktales about Vengeful spirits and cursed items.For the most part the acting is effective, specially Nanako Matsushima, who really puts a lot of effort in her character and truly makes a likable main character. While Hiroyuki Sanada's character got sadly diminished (compared to the novel), he still makes a good Ryuji, although he overacts a bit in some crucial scenes. The young Rikiya Otaka is a nice surprise as well as Rie Inou, who plays the mysterious Sadako Yamamura. The rest of the cast is mostly good, although it really could had been better.While there is certainly a lot to praise in "Ringu", it's definitely not a perfect film. The main problem arises as some small yet important details are omitted from the novel, mainly those relating to Ryuji's character, leaving him almost without background and his "special powers" end up poorly explained. As written above, some of the acting is not really good, however, it's safe to say that this doesn't take away none of the impact the film really has. Nakata's atmospheric vision of a ghost story is remarkable in the way he uses his limited resources to create a classy, visually appealing film that feels not only fresh and original, but truly creepy and scary.After a series of sequels, an American remake (with sequel included) and a Korean remake, it's true that "Ringu" is probably overexposed by now, however, the true force of this film remains intact and it's definitely a film that will go on history as an influential classic. Probably there are better Asian horrors (Miike's "Audition" and Nakata's own "Honogurai Mizu no Soko Kara" are good examples), but "Ringu" is still the one that started it all. At least for us, western audiences. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly influential and creepy film that's enjoyable despite its flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ringu" came out back in 1998 and caused quite a stir. It's really the film that kicked off the run of Asian horror movies that have since garnered a massive following and become the inspiration for umpteen American remakes. I think I'm one of the fortunate ones that picked up on the sensation early enough and saw "Ringu" long before the remake was released. Those who watch them in reverse order may be a little disappointed as they simply lose out on the effect that this unique (at the time) experience held. I'm not suggesting that "Ringu" isn't worth viewing. It just has flaws that the creators of the remake were generally able to rectify and having the knowledge of what happens at the end definitely takes away from the result.The plot involves a videotape containing bizarre and creepy imagery. When someone watches the tape, they immediately receive a phone call and the countdown begins. They will die in seven days! The reasons for this are completely unclear for the majority of the film, but the main characters (who are attempting to save their own lives after watching the tape) slowly unravel the mystery to discover who is behind the curse and why. When I first heard this plot I thought it was stupid. Describing it to friends that haven't seen it still gets the same response. Yet "Ringu" is convincing enough to really get under your skin. The tape really is creepy for starters! It's far shorter than in the remake, yet the combination of grating sounds and atmospheric visuals that you just can't quite figure out works really well. The music in the film is minimal to say the least and it really only kicks in when something scary or important occurs. It's certainly not utilized for shock value like in so many American movies these days which is a breath of fresh air. Without a doubt though, it's the shocking finale that the viewer will never forget. I nearly soiled myself on first viewing and I consider myself to be a fairly difficult person to scare.As for which version is better, well in most cases I find remakes fairly pointless exercises and nearly always disappointing. Yet "The Ring" is in my opinion far superior to "Ringu" for the following reasons. The acting is much better, the story doesn't rely on one of the main characters being able to read minds to unravel, and there's a whole heap of new background information on the characters involved. But even with all these flaws, I still really enjoy "Ringu" and suggest fans of the remake check it out to see where the whole thing started. If you haven't seen either, I highly recommend watching the Japanese version first for full appreciation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ringu has a good twist to it at the end which is also a horrific sight to behold. However the story is hard to keep up with and can be confusing especially in such scenes as the one on the beach with the owner of the hotel, who is related to Shizuko, and Ryuji starts to shout at him. The death of the first girl was not shown particularly well as her positioning was not well placed because she was standing in front of the fridge which does not make the space behind her very threatening and so when she turns around and we see the look on her face it is hard to feel scared at that point because we cannot imagine it because there is no space for the murderer to come up from behind so our imagination is restricted. Although it has some scary parts, the scariest easily being Sadako coming out of the TV, it could have been better with its telling of the story and its acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A competent horror film; fun and entertaining but not the terrifying masterpiece it's often made out to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor, insignificant spoiler.As the US remake frenzy of Asian horror films got in the full swing at the start of the century, so developed the Western cult following of films such as Ring. Na?ve film watchers from the west were terrified enough by that fact that "Ring" was in a foreign language and from that oh-so-mysterious country of Japan, so the hype around the film grew out of proportion until most people had become so convinced it was some sort of life-changing horror fest that would turn their children into axe murderers and turn even the strong willed into alcoholics as they tried to recover from the ordeal they had just been put through.Not so surprisingly, the film is all hype. That isn't to say it's a bad film; it's well executed and slightly creepy in places, but the pinnacle of Japanese cinema, even recent Japanese cinema, it is not. It's no more scary than your average American horror film; but superior in that the plot hasn't been dumbed down for three year olds like Hollywood has a habit of doing.Something I've noticed is that Japanese horror directors since the 80s have had the good taste to take heavy inspiration from David Cronenberg. Watching Ring, any Videodrome fans might have a slight sense of déj? vu as the basic plot is laid down; a TV transmission corrupts whoever watches it. Thankfully, these Japanese teenagers aren't subjected to what James Woods had to endure. This is another example of just how commercial Ring is, contrary to what the hype will have you believe. The unlucky ones who watch the video merely die with a surprised look on their faces.The film has its good points however; the story is handled well, there are engaging performances from Nanako Matsushima and Hiroyuki Sanada, who, if "The Twilight Samurai" is anything to go by, is one of the best actors in Japan at the moment. The best bit, is of course the ending, which everyone in the west is probably is familiar with because of the remake. That obligatory twist and the ending which sets up a sequel is obviously commonplace in horror films, but the story has been handled so well up to that point that you actually care what happens to the characters, which is not commonplace for horror films.This all said, Ring is far from being a bad film, just another example of how a film can be severely damaged by hype. Watch it as a superior thriller, rather than a horror film, but don't expect anything life changing.PS, probably the most hysterical aspect of this film is the American trailer, with the wonderful pronunciation "RING?.OOOOO".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Often subtle and remarkably restrained (and straightforward in its depiction of the paranormal), RINGU runs rings around the competition. That's not to suggest, even for a moment, that there are no hair-raising moments: there are, and they're genuinely hair-raising- the "big reveal," in particular (which is one of the creepiest scenes you're ever likely to see). The balance the director strikes between the low-key performances and the gut-wrenching terror is most commendable. In many respects, RINGU reminds me of a T.M. Wright novel: very matter-of-fact in its approach, and beautifully understated. And most definitely worth one's time and attention.</fullReview>

It was like watching "Monkey" from the seventies, the effects were non existent the music poor, and it was so dark i could hardly see anything Apart from that it was no where near as scary as the remake Last night after the ring I rushed to bed just hoping the TV would not switch on in the night, hardly daring to go pee !!

		<fullReview>it may be that things are seen from a different perspective. For one, being Japanese adds multiple flavors to this film... and if you are squeemish at heart, you would most probably hate the fact that you are Japanese watching a film such as this.I, on the other hand, loved the fact that I got the extra hint of intensity... and it's really quite difficult to explain, because it's just something you grow up believing, or knowing... certain ways of understanding things, which is uniquely Japanese--not even "Eastern" per se--and just plain creepy.There are a number of reviews bordering on "oh, it wasn't scary at all" or something like "it's a good story with poor adaptation"... etc.... Everyone is entitled to their opinions, and quite obviously absolutely EVERYONE is a critic. And so I choose, also, to be a critic... For one, this REALLY isn't a film for the "Horror" fans, as it lacks sharp knives, axes, and other objects which are used to kill the victims in the film. THIS IS BY EVERY MEANS a film for Suspense/Thriller fans, as it is more of the genre. Is it scary? Oh yeah, it has its moments... and if you're Japanese... well, it's pretty damn scary--trust me, it's not just me.The "mother" and her case is closely resembling of a true story... and the rest of the film details, is loosely based on old urban legends. Having that background, obviously, makes for adding to the fear factor. Extra sensory stuff... well... it might be a little too hoeky for the Western viewer, and quite rightfully so. But just let that aspect be. The well... oh, the well... it's not even funny. Having any idea of how many stories and legends surround that of a well... of people getting killed in/around one... suicide... everlasting feelings of vengence, the longing for a better life, the feeling of jealousy against those who all beat the odds that the individual couldn't... all, such old and over-repeated stories. BUT, it still manages to creep the heck out of people, young and old--really.Having the premise of "being Japanese" makes the film that much more freaky... To the critics who didn't enjoy the Japanese version of this film... I beg you, do not think that the American remake will be better, because it won't... because I will bet, that the essence of the characters and the overall aura of the film will NOT be captured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RING really gets underneath your skin in a way that few other films can</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years I have heard great things about RING, both from Internet message boards, and from various publications. Having long been familiar with RING's storyline and reputation for being relentlessly scary, I finally decided to seek it out. Getting ahold of a copy was a challenge in itself, since it has not yet been officially released in the United States. But eventually, I found a distributor in Britain who agreed to ship internationally. Upon receiving my long-awaited DVD, I immediately tore off the shrinkwrap, popped it in the CD tray, turned off all the lights, and excitedly began watching.I was impressed. I must say RING had me thoroughly creeped me out, and by the end, I was so chilled that I was unable to move. The next time the telephone rang, I seriously hesitated before picking it up. And every time I find an unlabeled videotape in my collection, I now think twice before popping it in the VCR.RING was not really what I expected at all. Don't get me wrong, it WAS a really good film, and I DID anticipate that it would be scary. It's just that I assumed it would be a different kind of "scary". You see, RING really isn't out-and-out horrifying, but rather works at providing more of a subtle fright. Instead of bombarding its viewer with constant cheap scares, chase scenes, or gory murders, RING spends its time drawing you into its unbearably eerie atmosphere, making you unwittingly become entangled in its mystery. RING makes you become so engrossed, so involved, and so unable to sit still that the slightest movement or the tiniest sound (on or off screen) will startle you half to death. You begin to develop a feeling of dread whenever a character is alone or in the dark, as if some malicious, unseen force is present in the darkness and waiting to strike when they are alone. Then, before you can even realize what kind of stress your emotions are experiencing, the conclusion arrives, which is so jolting that it can only be described as the cinematic equivalent to a sucker-punch in the gut.If you're a fan of moody horror movies with an unbelievable amount of tension, then I highly recommend RING. Fans of FRIDAY THE 13TH, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, or SCREAM probably won't see what all the fuss is all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While flipping thru the stations last night as I prepared to go to sleep, I found 'Ringu' on the local public access station. Undoubtedly it was broadcast in anticipation of the 2002 remake. Anyhow, I found this film to be a genuine creepfest with an ending that made my skin crawl. Admittedly, the plot had weaknesses and some of the concepts were a little goofy, but the kernel of the thing, the cursed video, was just dynamite. It recalled some early 20th century horror stories revolving around "The King in Yellow" - an obscure play so disturbing that it drove its readers mad.My one complaint was with the image quality of the broadcast that i saw - I could have sworn that I was watching a 'cursed' broadcast - dim and grainy with often blown-out subtitles. I'll surely pick this up again on dvd sometime in the future.Still, if you love picking up a few creepy films around halloween like I do, I'd recommend giving 'ringu' a try - particularly if you liked the Blair witch Project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Public comments (as well as the DVD cover) will sell this film as the "scariest film since The Exorcist" or "makes The Blair Witch Project look timid" and so on. So I watched it at home, alone, with the lights out for the best possible horror film atmosphere. I'm sorry to say, but Ringu doesn't scare like that. Ringu is a solid, compelling, and creepy film that works, but I can't say I was ever frightened. Attentive? Fascinated? Sure, but not frightened. I do recommend the film if you can rent it (or buy it for less than $20) as the story is original and the last ten minutes are very cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No hype - just justifiable praise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally set the timer to record this film, knowing next to nothing about it, because the description sounded like a Japanese version of "Videodrome" one of my favourite movies. Rather than the derivative copy of a horror classic that I anticipated, Ring turned out to be something better; a worthwhile original horror classic in it's own right (maybe it does borrow from some other films, Japanese ghost stories, Lovecraftian ideas and the atmosphere of "Twin Peaks" but the way it's put together gives it it's own unique voice). The tv introduction from critic Mark Kermode gave me some information about the film, but still kept his description vague so that I still didn't know quite what to expect. As promised though, the famous well scene really did scare the **** out of me and still gives me the creeps when I think of the film. Very few films can actually really scare me as an adult. The Halloween series has it's moments, as does "The Fog" and the concept of "Scream" and parts of "Black Christmas"."The Shining" can still be scary. "Carnival Of Souls" hasan eerie sense of deja vu and "The Haunting" definetlymanages to be scary. I'd have to that with the possibleexception of "The Haunting", "Ring" is the most genuinely terrifying film I've ever seen. Apart from the conclusion, the cursed video footage in the film is genuinely eerie and there is a creepy feeling of dread to the whole film. Also impressive and refreshing is that this film rewards repeat viewing and retains it's fascinating atmosphere and there always seems to be something new to discover and much to analyse. The film has it's share of great scenes from the opening nod to "Scream" with the two teen girls alone in the house to the eerie finding in the well and the video's creepy imagery. It's a pity that many people won't even give this classic a chance just because it has subtitles, doesn't have exploding heads or car chases and doesn't spoonfeed the viewer. A film that dares to expect some intelligence from it's audience! The sheer nerve! All I can say is to ignore the scoffers and cynics who have come out from beneath their rocks to dismiss and scoff at this film as they have many other classics. They remind me of the jaded journalists in the film's flashback, covering up their fear and lack of understanding with mocking tones. The many reviews here of others like me who came to this fresh of the hype and were genuinely impressed and scared by this film speaks for itself. This is no hype but justifiable praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadako's directional debut "Anger rising"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is really amazing about this deftly made Japanese horror is that very film-within-film. Made via forces of the supernatural activities it shows some definite awareness of the Soviet montage school inheritance. The effect brought on by the juxtaposition of the truly bizarre ingredients is not the communist propaganda, but the stunning hypnotism of the Unknown. Apart from Eisenstein (who also used to admit his obsession with the Unknown in his writings), the principle allusion that rises here is Kenneth Anger. His "Invocation of My Demon Brother" and especially "Lucifer Rising" use montage technique just in the same (and masterful) way - as a powerful generator of that enchanting sensation of the Hardly Explicable, the Inexplicable and the Better-Be-Inexplicable. Let's cherish hope that Sadako's little masterpiece will give birth to the whole brave new wave of the Montage Cinema From Beyond (which other roots will include Bunuel's "Chien d'Andalou", Jodorowsky's exercises and the films they showed poor Alex in "Clockwork Orange")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not a scary movie. That much you should be sure of (assuming you've seen it). I found it to be much like a detective story, except the clues came quite unexpectantly. Frankly I think I have to watch the movie again to understand the story, and I'm not in too much of a hurry to do that.Aspects of the movie, regardless of whether you've seen the trailers, is quite shocking. The facial expressions of the dead, while not exactly living up to 'as if they had seen something more frightening than any other thing', is more of your own fantasy. That's why I didn't enjoy the reporter's expression; by the third time, it had lost its charm.Sadako's visage isn't scary either, but the hair....unkept, tangled, LONG. And the final scene. The gradual build up. I was at the edge of my seat, and when....well you know, I just freaked.Very good movie. It's not 'the scariest movie ever' which I never thought it was, but quite a good way to spend a dark and scary night ^^</fullReview>

There is the one solid scare (and sweet jesus its damn terrifying) but the majority if the film is more like a Hitchcock thriller. No that this is bad thing, because the whole film is damn good, from start to finish (perhaps not the stereotypical giggly japanese schoolgirls at the start). I reckon a lot of people rate this film highly as it's Japanese, which makes it cooler and more artistic to us uncultured western swine, but either way it's worth seeing for that one fooking creepy scare, and makes it on to the list of the movies that have actually managed to scare me (without using the cheap bang loud music makes you jump trick).5.Signs 4.Ringu 3.The Wizard of Oz 2.The Lost Boys 1.The BirdsDread the Hollywood remake and cherish this nice little Japanese horror</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A ghost story with a chain-letter-ish videotape hook. Unless you just came from who knows where, you don't believe in bump-in-the-night ghosts. Weird video (ref. Videodrome) is for some reason, even if it's just that everyone hears patterns in static, more credible. The killer tape, which you can play solo from the DVD's extras, is scarier than the film that contains it. Within the tape, the shot of kanji and hiragana floating, waxing, waning, off what looks like a news page, immediately followed by blurry crawling men whose dark legs look like kanji fragments, is scarier than the b/w images of Sadako, because we haven't a clue how or why the type-characters are doing that.Kairo is a much scarier film, because, believe or not, god, God, or no god, in an age of multiple universe theories and time-traveling nano particles, a place where dead go is at least just barely conceivable. Kairo's wholesale, absolutely beyond mortal control, phenomenon trumps Ringu's maudlin, old fashioned, why-only-her, Sadako legend. If I recall, Kairo's manifestations begin as video, yet later have a static-like manifestation independent of any medium.Where the two films merge, and where the true horror of Ringu lies, is in Ringu's human chain, the social responsibility thrust onto each who views the tape, especially media rep Reiko and her ex. Reporting an aids or Ebola story isn't a lethal endeavor. Nor does reporting a war, a murder, whatever, have to be. Kairo isn't about running from a irreversibly waxing contagion. It's about reaching back again, again, and again to pull at first friends, then someone, then anyone along to the only maybe salvation offered by Koji Yakusho at the finish.Ringu's well made and acted, and never boring. Yet, even as old fashioned ghost stories go, the emanations of the child in Kurosawa's Seance are spookier than anything in the Ring series. And I don't think it's just that Nakata didn't have Koji Yakusho to react.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not terrible, this film has been internationally highly overrated as being "one of the scariest movies ever made." It isn't scary at all. If anything, there is just a slight feeling of dread and foreboding. The truth is, not that much happens in RINGU. Some say it has a gradual pace that American audiences aren't used to but this is just wrong, given the success of slower-paced supernatural films like The Sixth Sense. Others say American audiences are turned off by the subtitles, but Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon didn't seem to be hindered by that either.Yes this film is somewhat entertaining as a thriller and yes it is slightly creepy at times but it certainly doesn't deserve the hyperbolic praise it has received.While not exactly a "Blair Witch" (in terms of clunkers), it gets 2 an 1/2 stars out of 4 from me.Fortunately, the sequel RINGU 2 improved upon the original and actually did deliver a few scares.</fullReview>

If you're new to Japanese horror you must first adjust to the pacing, as it may seem too slow to you - but if your idea of horror is a rubber mask and bloody screeching teenagers watch something else. The terror is psychological rather than gruesome, and the wraith Sadako is one of the scariest creatures you'll see, period.

		<fullReview>The movie that caused every Asian horror movie made after it to be derivitive of it; sort of like Dawn of the Dead and the millions of zombie movies that followed it. And rightly so: this is one of the spookiest ghost stories in a long time.The movie start with a reporter investigating a popular urban legend: a videotape that, once viewed, causes the phone to ring and inform the viewer that they will die in seven days. Seven days later, they die. When the reporter's niece dies a mysterious death, she suspects her niece has viewed the tape. During her investigation, she views the tape, and, sure enough, the phone rings and relays its dreaded message. It's now up to her and her ex-husband to figure out how to reverse the effects of the tape. Get ready for some scares.The title may confuse some shoppers into thinking this film has something to do with Wagner's Ring Cycle or the Lord of the Rings or some other lame ring thing (the title actually refers to the phone ringing). It's actually a great thrill ride (although Ring 2 has more scares). It's here we're introduced to the loveable Sadako, who will turn up in your nightmares (and in every Asian horror film made after this one). In addition to her, this movie has everything you could ask for: suspense, tight pacing, good acting, good character, and an ending that may be one of the creepiest things committed to film. Recommened for everyone, but be prepared to sleep with the lights on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best genuinely frightening horror movie in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring is one of the genuinely scariest movies I've ever seen, apart from Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. The other movies that could compare to this unique Japanese little horror flick (astonishing it was made for less than US$1.5 million) are the 1963 Robert Wise flick The Haunting, The Changeling (with George C. Scott), M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense and Alejandro Amenábar's The Others.To be honest, I rented this movie on the whim that I should see the original before seeing an American re-make after debating the necessaries of re-making already good movies for the new audience with a video store clerk at an independent video shop specializing in obscure, foreign and hard-to-find DVDs and videotapes. I took home the movie knowing the basic premise of the plot, but nothing could prepare me for the tense suspense and atmosphere, not to mention one of the most horrifically convincing and authentic bone-chillingly creepiest scenes (near the ending, you will understand what I mean) in the history of film.Now I see why The Ring is a hugely successful movie in its native country and in Asia and Europe. It's a very good suspense-horror movie, and the twist is, the movie does not show the gratuitous shots of blood and gore. That's how wonderfully frightening this movie is, relying on the viewer's patience as the movie paces in suspenseful tension to the totally unexpected climax.If you're an ordinary movie viewer or a disaffected horror film fan who demands a good quality movie in the horror genre, The Ring is an ideal choice. In fact, I would recommend watching the movie with family or friend willing to be patient and stay alert late at night in the dark room illuminated by the television light. If you can bear to watch the slow-paced movie in English subtitles, trust me - it will scare the hell out of you and the family or friend out of consciousness. It did for me, considering the fact most horror movies I saw are so repetitive, tiresome, clichéd, bland and predictable they don't scare me at all. The Ring is an unforgettable experience of a ride that's actually better than The Sixth Sense in some aspect. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Runs a ring (hmmm) around most contemporary horrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll discuss the plot briefly, as others have already covered it. Like any good horror movie it keeps the basic idea simple but frightening ? a mysterious video tape is floating around. Those who watch the video tape have a week to live after seeing it. A reporter, Reiko Asakawa, decides to investigate the truths (and lies) surrounding this and? finds herself drawn into a world (mandolins please)? of terror!The idea of watching TV killing you is a neat one, as is the race-against-time if you watch it (take a wild guess as to whether the heroine sees it). As you may be watching the movie on a video, as I was, it shows a little touch of genius as the supernatural, often constrained to cultures of yore, manages to enter our own living rooms through the science we thought could hold the world at bay. The video in question is quite scary, and needs to be viewed to have the full effect ? it's got far more impact than the shaky camera work employed by The Blair Witch Project.In a horror movie you don't need acting generally (after all the characters are going to often bee too busy filling up body bags, to need acting). Fortunately though `Ring' scores itself fairly well in that department ? Reiko is played out nicely as a determined single mother but also tempered with an obvious fear of not wanting to die. That is to say she has more dimensions than one. Similarly her estranged husband, Ryuji, has a nice mysterious flavour to him, seeing as he has some vested interest in the paranormal in a cloudy past?What gets `Ring' into your head is the smart script and directing (by Hideo Nakata). The movie is brisk ? coming in at 96 minutes ? and the count down on people's lives adds a delicious air of desperation and tension. This is heightened by the freaky appearances of the killer in momentary flits, and twisted dream sequences. The killer is chillingly silent, and made more foreboding by the ability to look innocent and menacing in alternate moments. Certain words, which have meaning in the movie, come to strike fear into the viewer's hearts in spite of the fact that they've often not yet been explained ? we've been drawn into the movie universe, and are experience the character's terror at events.There are some flaws to `Ring', such as the character's somewhat too-readily acceptance of the nature of events surrounding them. However for the most part you're sucked in along with them, wondering what's going on (and, thankfully, finding out), while appreciate Nakata's ability to create a truly scary opponent (who doesn't need a hockey mask). One to watch ? 8/10.</fullReview>

Add this with Kanji Kawai's chilling soundtrack which at one point sounds like violins bleeding. You find yourself dreading to look at the screen, but anticipation keeps you asking for more. Thank that to Hideo Nakata's great use of pacing (some action is slowed down at times adding a psychedelic feel) and awesome cinematography work. Certain angles give an almost dreamlike state and adds a dreary, dark factor to the surroundings.Acting is great in this one. Emotions seem genuine and the paranoia and fear of the characters makes scenes intense to watch at times. Mai is so eager to find the truth that she blindly fails to see the imminent danger. Or at least believe it. Ryuji finds it hard to believe as well; an attitude which changes drastically as the story progresses. Even Yoichi had a creepy heir about himself especially when he mentions he's speaking with Tomoko. Sound effects such as voices slowed down, ringing, and static are simple, but very effective. It's easy to see how this film set the standard in the Japanese horror genre.Overall, this is one extreme psycho-thriller from Japan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hatred behind the fear...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam 3's comments below concerning "Noroi" and "On-nen" are fascinating, and, though I am certainly no expert on Japanese traditions of horror and ghost stories, I think his thoughts on the subject really touch on the power of this film. At the heart of RINGU is an overwhelming emotional presence of not only fear and dread, but also bitterness, hatred and humiliation. To me, the best horror films have a strong sense of meanness to them, as if the ghosts, undead, evil presence, etc. has a bone to pick and will pick that bone in the most uncompromisingly dreadful manner imaginable. In a film like RINGU, no quarter is spared in causing great suffering and terror on a victim, and we the audience must feel that terror and suffering in a manner of near osmosis.This film reminded me of other films which had similar elements. The creepy video reminded me of the creepy pirate broadcasts in David Cronenberg's VIDEODROME. Also, the opening scene in RINGU is somewhat reminiscent of the powerful opening "Telephone" segment in Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH (later homaged in SCREAM) -- though far more mysterious. And then there is the powerful theme of a (seemingly) innocent who seeks to cause great harm and terror -- a theme present in many of the greatest modern horror films such as THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, THE BROOD, THE CHANGELING, etc.All of these elements are combined successfully, not through a great story, but through the great talent of the director. In fact, the film's weakness is its highly contrived, overly complicated and occasionally silly plotting, which often drags and other times simply leaves you scratching your head. It's simply not that well-written. But it is written well enough for a talented director to create a highly forceful film with a visual quality disturbs in its uncomfortably suspenseful transitions and its genuinely disturbing visuals. This director has an extraordinary feel for simple visuals that are authentically creepy. Much of the power in this film is, like in much of the best horror films and books, in its use of familiarity -- its use of everyday things. This movie makes watching TV and answering the phone scary. It makes reflections frightful. It scares us by intimating that the everyday has the potential to be something completely unknown and threatening. It implies that representations of horror and terror can creep into reality. The two dimensional recording becomes three dimensional and alive -- in all its meanest, most spiteful and evil manner.Then there is an ending that is among the most memorable of any horror film ever made. Well-done. It made this jaded dude cringe in fear. The effect takes hold more after the film is over than when the film is playing, but I'll say that when it's playing it scares delightfully. Watch this film alone at night at your own risk, but please do not show this film to kids. It's too scary for children. They'll be up at night for weeks, if not months...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After this...watching television will never the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been trying to get a copy of The Ring for quite some time now. I´d heard a lot of things about it, from that it was very unpleasant to watch, to that it was so boring that I would possibly fall asleep before it ended. But it didn´t matter how many things I heard it was one of my missions in life, I had to get it. Until I did a month ago...and now my mind and soul cannot be saved.I don´t exactly know what is it about the movie that chills, scares and excites me the most. It might be its slow but mysterious pace that never lets go; the quirky music that dissolves into the background creating a gut wrenching sensation throughout the whole movie; the dark photography that makes you feel uncomfortable but, like an addiction you prey for more; or simply a plot so innovative that makes you never guess what´s coming next...Once you see Sadaku, you´ll know what I have been talking about.The story resolves around a reporter who´s investigating a series of strange deaths that apparently had something to do with certain videotape that kill whoever sees it, only to be trapped in the curse of the videotape herself. Sounds cheesy, corny? for a film like this those words are nothing. This film makes The Blair Witch Project look like a trip to grandma´s house, or even more like camping day at school. It is so bad that this film will never hit American ground, and I mean the whole American continent by that, since it is a very delightful experience to watch, or unpleasant, well, you get the point. While we are stuck with all these Scream trash here, overseas they are dying of fear with gems like these. Is there something wrong here?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It gives me the creeps &amp; that 'hair at the back of your neck' garbage just to write this. 'RINGU' A.K.A. 'The Ring' is not a Japanese monkey business. If you intent to underestimate what the movie will provide, then you will end up denying that you are actually are afraid or enjoyed the horror from the movie.Although the film was made for the movies, its indented theme is best on video or DVD, or should correct myself - the TV screen.When a relative died mysteriously, Reiko, a journalist was reporting a case of 4 similar high school deaths. The friends at school were giving hints about their vacation a week before their death, and a strange video &amp; a phone call that would mark the curse. At the relative's funeral, Reiko found a receipt from a Photo print shop, and realises one of the prints had some unexplained smudging. Her investigation has lead her to the retreat where the victims spend, and place herself into the '7 days to live' curse. In the pursuit for answers and for her own sake, Reiko gets help for the investigation, a boyfriend who happens to be a video editing technician.I won't go any further, but you will see ghost, ghost and more screen reflections. Perhaps the most frightening part of the movie is that the curse is still out there, so watch the sequel - in your bedroom's TV screen. Hint: just look out for the reflections &amp; make sure your phone (&amp; portable ones) is working. I spent almost 2 weeks without a goodnight sleep, definitely not for the young.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an adventure: Watch small Japanese film; Go online to talk about it; Discover it's huge, there's several versions, many titles, some knock-offs, non canon sequels, controversy etc. It's great! Good thing it's not just me that's confused. If you go to the Korean version's entry on this illustrious site you'll find several comments that seem to be talking about -this- version (and people pointing out the difference in both).Well, I saw a DVD called "Ring" (not "Ringu" or "The Ring" as it is sometimes known) and this is definitely it. At least, I think so. One thing's for sure; this kind of situation is only going to become more widespread in future. And imagine when the MP3-like remix/re-edit culture takes off!Anyway, the movie... It's pretty cool. It's not the scariest thing I've ever seen (that plum goes to 'The Woman in Black', which I highly recommend to folks who like this sort of low key "creeper" ghost story). But it stuck with me for a while just the same. It (like Woman in Black) reminded me of Hitchcock describing 'Psycho'; that it's not so much what happens on the screen that gets to you, more what it does to you when you're alone, in the dark. I found this film interesting to watch, but didn't think much of it at the time. There were even laughs; Why doesn't Kyuji get a call? "The spook has the wrong phone service!" we joked (well, it was funny at the time). Sadako as a child looks quite comical and one flashback segment looks like something out of a silent era slapstick comedy (you know: the 'daddy's got a bat for daughter' bit &lt;---not a spoiler). Still there's enough good stuff and nicely resonant images and themes for it to work. The way, as the week progresses, each re-viewing of the tape seems to add just a few more frames to the end and we are taken closer and closer to that tiny hint of movement just before it runs out.I seem to recall many films and TV shows using televisions and their snow/noise in conjunction with stories of spirits, but none as well as this one. It has the same spine tingling dread as an inexplicably open door or window drifting in the breeze. Makes you wish you had eyes in the back of your head and emitted bright light from your every pore. But this is only long afterward, when one is alone in the dark.Plus the films seems to be having a slight dig at a work obsessed culture that leaves its children to fend for themselves from a very young age (or perhaps I should say, some aspects of the film remind me of some things I've heard about Japan. So anyone who actually knows about these things is free to tell me I'm full of it). One way or the other the film's human base is what makes it interesting.It's a pity that the "creeper" or "chiller" ghost story isn't a bigger genre. But it really does have to be small I guess. A glance around the comments here will show people who raced out to see it after many breathless recommendations and found it didn't live up to expectations. That's because flicks like this have to sneak up on you. They have to catch you a little unawares. So get this one out at the bottom of a pile of other videos and then forget about it until you and your chums have had an all out gore session, everyone else around that night has gone home or fallen asleep after too much pizza and only the hardcore are left, half awake at 3am. Then just let it sink in.This one actually works better on video, for obvious reasons (although the phone didn't ring after I saw it. But expect stunts like that to appear once this Digital-media-confluence we've all been hearing about gets off the ground).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually saw this movie one week ago today. I had heard so much about it and had read all of the reviews on this page (Including spoilers unfortunately) and was really exited about the film. Upon viewing it, I was indeed impressed, but was a little dissapointed. Maybe because I had read spoilers that weren't marked in the reviews, maybe because I had hyped myself up for the movie. It wasn't Blair Witch. This is due to the fact that the plot sunk in and out of highs and lows. Blair Witch had a constant fear that I associated with it. But when it was over, I tried to go to sleep, and couldn't. For the last 7 days I haven't been able to sleep. I keep hearing little noises in the house, and I keep thinking of this movie's frightening ghost and the fact that I have a TV in almost every room. She didn't really instill fear into me until after the movie. But if even in daylight, you are afraid to go into a room that has a silent Television set... Well, now that its day seven, and I'll have seen the movie 7 days exactly at around 9pm, Maybe I'll be able to sleep tomorrow.I think the beauty of this movie isn't in your first impression, but in the mental impression it leaves on your subconscience. The fact that, if you believe, even just a little, in the supernatural, this could very well be a true story...</fullReview>

It makes me feel the Fear of the victims. And it 's also so different from the Ring Hollywood. I read the novel in midnight and I couldn't sleep, I also couldn't close my eyes because I am afraid. I downloaded the film Japanese RINGU, and it 's far from my expectation, it's incredible, best film ever. There 's no violent scenes, no blood...but it came from the inner Fear in my head, The Fear is so invisible but real and full of death's smell.Especially the last scene, when Ryuji saw the woman out of the well and he discovered the truth about the Curse and died! I even dare not to see that scene!!! The novel and the film are not only about the fear, the horror, but so human being! The Love, the Hate, the Fear, The Nerve, the Revenge...and when she has to choose the life of her son or her father, let the virus spread or let her on be a sacrifice</fullReview>

Reiko is willing to even put the life of her ex husband at risk in her search for the next big story. As the story unravels the audience uncovers that Sadako was pushed down a well by her father, and through a supernatural power has created this video that if watched the viewer will die in 7 days.The film is jam packed with worrying, edge of your seat horror moments, the best being when Sadako at the end of the movie crawls out of the TV to kill Reikos ex. There is a painful build up leading to the big climax of her disfigured water logged face finally being unveiled. Also the son of Reiko Yoichi has a creepy vibe to him which leaves audience wondering if he is helping Sadako with her revenge, creating a sense of caution whenever he is on screen.

		<fullReview>I'm getting sick of Hollywood trashing respectable foreign films into remakes. Not that all of them are bad remakes, but it denies the original credibility from its creators. The Japanese version is slightly different, but with the same plot, though this time it reveals more about Sadako (who is Samara in the US version) and her mother's abilities of phychic powers. The Japanese version adds more of a fearful element because it is based in their culture rather than the US version which relies more on special effects and stereotypical characters who are sometimes out of place.However, the original has some flaws. The character of the the female protagonist's kid doesn't seem to have much substacne and you don't really feel the connection with him that you did with Aidan in the remake. What's more, the original doesn't boast a very effective soundtrack at times, which made the remake spooky as hell. Nevertheless, the sound effects are pretty good in the film.You should see this version first, (pity i didn't) for its originality and cultural significance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surely so! Along with "the Blair Witch Project" (1999), "the Sixth Sense" (1999) or "the Others" (2001), this Japanese gem is a bonanza for the genre aforementioned insofar as it favors in real screenplays, pure psychological terror which is the leading thread to a crescendo. This crop of masterpieces constitutes a valid antidote to the flood of horror movies coming from the Hollywood firm in which a ton of special effects supersede cinematographic invention. But Hideo Nakata shows us that it is still possible to shiver with a minimum of means and a maximum of shrewdness. I watched Gore Verbinski's remake shot in 2002 prior to Nakata's original film and so I can compare the two works. I do think that it's every bit as good as the 1998 film from an artistic perspective. Both are terrific even if Verbinski tends to show more of the plot and its ambiguous sides and his reflection on the deadly power of TV and the media is more pronounced than in its Japanese ambassador.My general impression about Nakata's work is that his style is more thrifty and straightforward than Verbinski's with sparse moments and a nearly contemplative pace. Evolving in a Japan caught between a modernism epitomized by the TV and an archaism which wants to protect one-time manners and customs, the filmmaker made the good choice of favoring the suggested and the off-camera to mold an unnerving atmosphere. This makes the viewer's imagination work and also makes him feel ill-at-ease when he realizes that the frontier between the rational and the irrational becomes increasingly thin. Because if one has an inking about who shot these outlandish images, one doesn't know how they were filmed. Unsettling isn't it?However, Nakata borrowed a little from American cinema: the first sequence with the two young girls all alone in a house in which strange phenomena occur echoes "Scream". The character of the audacious estranged journalist who investigates a serious case has been seen many times before or since. But fortunately, Nakata skipped the possibility of a new union with her ex-husband. Anyway, "Ringu" bears the mark of a genuine work which revived Asiatic fantastic film. It caused so much stir that the evil Sadako became a cult character. Her figurine even dethroned the mask of Frankenstein and the killer in "Scream" in terms of popularity. "Ringu" also gave birth to a sequel and even a prequel, probably to shed more light on the mysterious character of Sadako and to work more the seam. Meanwhile, Hollywood stared at this cultural phenomenon with a keen interest.</fullReview>

It's very eerie as the viewer is taken beyond the scope of imagination that would send even the most hard-edged person into a state of shock....A fine ending to the movie too - what a cliffhanger!The Japanese are masters in the horror genre, and few foreign films match the sheer shock and horrific scenes we witness in Ring.

Part road movie, part journalistic drama, all horror. Although it departs somewhat from the novel, in many ways it improves on it. Changing and merging several of the central characters works better than it had any right to. The sense of doom and urgency is unrelenting. The use of sound is ground-breaking. I have watched this more than 5 times now, and it never pales. All the actors are on the money, the camera work is good, the effects effective (sorry!), the pace just right. It's all good and set a new standard, not just for "Asian" movies but for all horror movies. It is to Hollywood's lasting shame that their response to this challenge was to remake, badly, instead of upping their own game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the "Ring" because it is the epitome of what horror films should be. It builds up tension and suspense that is sadly lacking in the modern horror films. Even the American remake of this film is sadly lacking the edge that was needed to be a successful remake(also it was boring and it was in the English language)What made "Ring" brilliant was the locations. Japan looked spectacular it looked amazing and even though some of the scenes took place away from the bustling city(The islands look amazing)This was the first subtitled film I had seen and it has got me more and more interested in subtitled films(Which added to the tension because it was like reading a visualised book)and this film made me realise that all modern American movies were riddled with Clichés it was unbelievable. It also made me realise that modern horrors were trying to create an iconic character that will be remembered and they all fail(Except the "Creeper" from "Jeepers Creepers") which was both scary and original in terms of satisfaction and if it will be remembered. What I like about this film is that both the female main character(Nanako Matsushima) and the male character(Hiroyuki Takayama)are central to the plot because all the fear,Tension, and suspense revolves around them and whatever situations they find themselves in. What makes this an iconic horror movie(In my opinion)is the REALLY scary spirit;who is called "SADAKO" she is one of the scariest characters to ever appear in a horror movie she is in the same league as Leatherface from "THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE" and Michael Myers from the "HALLOWEEN" films. One other aspect of this film I like is it is an original idea. The idea of a cursed video tape that will kill anyone within seven days of it being viewed and has spawned many other ideas(FEAR DOT COM cursed website) and many more.In Conclusion, I believe that if you want a decent horror film for Halloween go for this film and remember it for being a great modern day horror that has put Japan on the map and we as a film watching nation should always be open minded about foreign language horror and not be satisfied with over used Clichés that are raining down on modern day horror films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the conflicting opinions of the American version of The Ring...I think I am still have nightmares. It was downright terrifying. Hands down the scariest, creepiest film I have ever seen. It took me some time before I worked up the courage to watch the Japanese original of the same name. Plus I've never been a big fan of the foreign film although I have seen a few in the last short while.Ringu is almost the same story as it's American follow up. It follows the story of Investigative Reporter Reiko Asakawa played by the excellent actress Nanako Matsushima who of course I have never seen in anything else but she was excellent in this role. When a close family member and three or four of her friends die mysteriously after watching a video tape made from a strange television transmission the reporter sets out to find the tape. Asakawa watches the tape and then brings in her ex-husband Ryuji Takayama to help her investigate before her time is up. He watches the film and is determined to help her solve the mystery of where the film came from and why it exists. Unfortunately their son Yoichi accidentally watches the film as well making their investigation ever more urgent. They uncover a horrible secret regarding the death of a woman and her strange daughter, and with moments left to live they must solve it.I had some issues with this film that I thought the American version covered much better. For one there was really no reason for Asakawa to watch the tape especially being she had a feeling of truth behind it. Yet she does not hesitate to pop it in and watch in and than gladly shows it to her ex husband. Granted I found the Japanese version slightly harder to follow and maybe that's just a language gap I am not used to crossing. I couldn't understand their actual jobs, I'm guessing they were reporters. I also got lost on several other minor plot things. That's not the fault of the movie maker probably but more likely my understanding. I am a little confused why everyone seems to think this Japanese version is the most terrifying film and how scary it was. It had it's moments, one of the top ones being, as it was in The American version Sadako's appearance into reality, quite terrifying. I found this film to be much more a mystery thriller than a horror or even a fright film. The mystery unravelled brilliantly and it was absolutely captivating especially as the clock ticked down on their time limit. One of the great moments in the film is the scene with the well as they desperately struggle to uncover the last clues with literally minutes left to live. I have not watched the sequels to the Ringu series but I am excited about doing so. The film started out slow but had me riveted by the end of it with incredible acting by the whole cast and a great story. It was also great to watch a movie in a unique original setting which I am not used to seeing in films. The biggest difference between this and the American version is the addition of the ESP. Not only is it shown that Sadako had powerful mind control which was never full explained in The Ring but Asakawa is given the power of visions at one point and her ex-husband also had powerful ESP in which he can see people's past and things that have happened. Although it is not gone into great detail, it's a power that is used to help save them. All in all even if you're not a foreign film fan I highly recommend checking out Ringu especially if you're a fan of the American version. It's a great film and will always entertain. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I am writing this review on the assumption that 99% of people reading it have at least seen the US re-make, 'Ring'. Quite simply, the Americans did a better job. 'Ringu' is an interesting, original and entertaining enough supernatural thriller, but 'Ring' far exceeds it in terms of atmosphere, acting, general production values and overall eeriness. Whereas the plot is more openly explained in 'Ringu', I actually found, in hindsight, that the puzzling aspects of 'Ring' add to the movie.'Ringu' is different enough in plot, particularly in the second half, to be worth a look. It's certainly an above average movie, but this is one time that Hollywood took a foreign movie and improved on it. I would give 'Ringu' about 6.5, and 'Ring' at least 8.0.Oh, by coincidence, the night before watching 'Ringu', I watched 'The Changeling' - the US horror movie from 1980. Now watch that, and tell me 'Ringu' didn't borrow a rather central idea from that. Well, well...</fullReview>

(The American) Ring simply copied most of good features of original (that's good), added easy-to-recognize euroamerican faces (that's good too), made characters too young (alas, it looks like teenager B-class movie!), well, TOO young to have so big baby (isn't sex illegal before 15 in the USA? the actors were way too young and their "son" was too old), removed most of IQ from characters (if they didn't fell in the well, then, well, then would NEVER found it), replaced scary TV record with something which looks like German expresionist movie from 1920 (too bad...) and - AND - TOTALLY FORGOT TO ADD THAT REALLY GREAT MUSIC from Ringu. The music from the Ringu is scary like hell and made the movie unique... I have to mention that Sadako from Ringu Zero is much more intersting than Samara and I DO'NT REALLY TO KNOW WHO IS HER FATHER, because it must be something really horrible. Well, US version is more action-oriented, way more stupid and filled with C-movie class stupidities like "deux ex machina", when the right person suddently jumps from the door, even he should be miles, miles away... I try hard to find any features in US version which are really better than those in Japan original... well, maybe "Samara's pictures" and YES, the actress are better-looking (to me :-) But anyway, seeing the US-comics-action-funny version first is really a spoiler. Some moments from Japan series are really hard-to-forget... like "shared vision of testing", "sudden death of mother of the little boy" or "we are running out of time"... ghosts on every corner... well, that I call HORROR. Not those "who is the strange boy with chainsaw", no, I really don't like cheap tricks...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological horror at its best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read numerous opinions concerning the subject of Ringu versus the U.S. remake. Since I have not yet seen the Hollywood interpretation of Ringu I won't comment on it, yet I find it hard to believe that it could be more terrifying than this. I've also noticed that people seem to either love or hate this movie, much like The Blair Witch Project, which some people seemed to loathe for whatever reason. As for myself, I have grown to love both Ringu and the first Blair Witch Project. My theory is as follows; how much you enjoy/dislike these kind of movies all have to do with how much you embrace the atmosphere of the movie, how much you try to picture yourself in the characters situation, sort of speaking. In the Blair Witch case, for example, I think we would all be scared half to death if we were in the situation that was portrayed in that movie. Unless, of course, you have a steady supply of valium and horse tranquilisers. If you can't picture yourself in the protagonist(s) situation, of course you're going to think that the movie is boring. Sorry for the rant, but the conclusion is: same goes for Ringu. I might have a slightly unorthodox take on this, but for me, a good eerie atmosphere that you can picture yourself in is absolutely paramount in any horror flick. Without that, you have nothing as far as I'm concerned. These kind of horror movies are supposed to get your imagination going, and sad to say many people don't seem to have much of an imagination to move in the first place.Ringu was one of those movies I sat down and watched without having heard anything about it beforehand, except that it was some sort of a Japanese horror flick. I began to watch it with little hope of this being a good movie, but when it was over I was left sitting on the sofa with my fist stuck between my teeth in an attempt to cope with my `post-horror stress disorder'. I also think I might have swallowed large portions of the pillow I used to shield my tender eyes with during the more terrorizing portions of the movie, as well as choking on the popcorn. The director Hideo Nakata (kudos to him, by the way) has really achieved a perfect atmosphere of psychological horror-suspense here, not so much relying on `BOOH!'-effects (though there are a few of those around, for sure) but rather constructing a more and more unpleasant and ghastly mood as the movie progresses, and this is all done in a highly impressive and skillful way with thankfully little use of special effects. In the beginning of the movie I thought that this was probably some sort of dull Japanese take on Scream with dumbfounded teenagers running around getting butchered, and even though some vague parallels with Scream might exist, it was something I quickly forgave Ringu for. I will certainly not post any spoilers, but after an hour or so into the movie you really start to feel the uneasy mood start to creep up on you, and I have to say that the subtitles didn't bother me at all. Good acting, a superb score, a terrifying story and excellent directing are all combined in Ringu. Needless to say, I highly recommend this movie. watch it on a rainy night with the lights turned down and let the atmosphere embrace you.In my personal opinion, this is one of the very best horror movies of the 90's together with The Blair Witch Project. Ring(u) really re-established my faith in this genre which has recently been plagued by far too many crappy additions. Next to the old master Dario Argento, I dare to say that Hideo Nakata is one of my favourite horror directors of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the prime examples of why horror should be taken out of the hands of America. its creepy, touching and downright frightening, without having to rely on the "In-your-face" tactics of the remake.Unlike "The Ring", in Ringu, the girl in the video, Sadoke, is an almost completely anonymous threat. other than the brief glimpses in the video and the psychic contact in the one flashback, you hardly see or hear her at all until the final scenes. again, the sequences where the video is watched, which get longer each time they are viewed,are far more effective than the similar scenes in the remake, which just ran straight through.an excellent horror, that redefined parts of the urban-legend genre. accept no substitutions.</fullReview>

However, you should keep in the back of your mind that this (original) japanese version consists of THREE movies so I'd say those arguments are not in place in those reviews. The remake got its material from the entire japanese trilogy.If you can stand subtitles and want something else than moronproof US movies where every single thing needs to be explained, this version is highly recommended:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview> When i say the story of the movie was weak, I'm not refering to the whole series. In fact, I find the story behind it so interesting that I have to go out and buy the other movies. But it's just the theme of it being nothing more than a chain letter. It was very anti-climatic. But that didn't stop the rest of the movie from being very scary and creepy. It didn't have to reduce itself to blood and gore either, something which I don't find very scary. The film sequence was the best part because it seemed aged and choppy as if it were in deed someone's thoughts. In the remake, you could tell it was computerized and it was nothing special. This movie is something special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the remake on every level...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hideo Nakata's 'The Ring' (or Ringu, as people have falsely labeled it) is the first installment of the most epic, complex and terrifying horror story ever committed to film. Gore Verbinski's American remake was essentially "Ring for Dummies" - an incompetent mish-mash of elements from the entire trilogy (Ring, Ring 2 &amp; Ring 0), chock full of silly plot points, cheap scares and spoon-fed mystery.The Japanese have arguably perfected horror and now have it down to a science, and nothing proves it more than 'The Ring.' Devoid of all flash and FX, Nakata's version relies completely on plot, realistic characters and atmosphere. The story will send your imagination in horrifying directions, the sound is unlike anything you've ever heard, and every shot is just downright creepy. It's a film that demands the intelligence of it's audience and gives much greater rewards.If you have a short attention span and enjoy having everything spelled out for you, by all means, pick up the American remake. If you're looking for real horror and great story-telling, look no further than the Japanese 'Ring' trilogy. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imaginative thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the original Japanese film that was remade here in America and called "The Ring" also. This story sets up the viewer right at the start with a young girl telling her friend how she and some others viewed a strange video tape and heard a story that after its watched the phone rings and tells you that you have one week to live. The young girl and her friends die under weird circumstances and her aunt Reiko (Nanako Matsushima) decides to investigate. She goes to the same cabin and finds a video and watches it. Its the same tape and she gets the call (The Ring!) so now she has one week to live. She gets her ex-husband Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada) to view a copy she made and he decides to help. He's a professor at a university but he also has ESP. One night Reiko wakes up and finds her son watching the tape so now the three of them are playing beat the clock. They trace the tape back to an area that had volcano trouble and years earlier a woman had been known to make strange predictions. *****SPOILER ALERT***** The film continues with them finding out that the strange woman had died years earlier but that her daughter was the one that had the real powers. She had very strong powers and it was learned that the girls father murdered her and dumped her into a well at the location where the cabin is. They go there to try and find the body and hope the evil curse of the tape will be over. This is a well made thriller that was based on a Japanese novel and the script seems to be well adapted. Your never really lost while viewing this film although your never sure whats going to happen next. Its never confusing but it does a good job of keeping you guessing. The film is shown in increments of days but if you think its because its counting down until Reiko's time is up, your wrong. The film ends with Reiko figuring out that if you make a copy of the tape after you view it you will be saved. So the film is actually showing you the date in a never ending cycle. Film sets a good pace and never goes over the top as far as the material is concerned. Film ends with a question that is simple enough to answer but it makes you realize that its a cycle that can't be broken. Good creepy thriller that never bores its viewer because of the pace it sets. Even if you don't like foreign films you might want to check this one out. Now that I have seen this, I can see the American version!</fullReview>

Indeed the content didn't have to be solved, but one had to copy the video and share it with another in order to avoid horrible death. The content and material of the story was treated very intelligently and very well by the director. It is a very entertaining film to watch along with the sequels and prequel.</fullReview>

However: I haven't seen the american version, which most other seem to have done before they watched this one. I wonder if them knowing the plot and the end could have anything to do with them thinking the first one they watched being scarier? ;)Ringu is truly a movie that kept me awake at night, not because of the effects or the tempo but because it's terrible stillness and stilistic feeling of everyday life. Also the massive silence throughout the film gives a feeling of sheer terror when you finally hear the sound of fingernails...brrrr! See this film. It's well worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, saw the Ring (US) and found it to be very scary. So when I heard the original (Japanese) was even more frightening, I had to see it!! It took me a few hours to work up the courage (home alone), but I finally turned out the lights and hit play. Wow, was this boRING!! ****POSSIBLE SPOILER*** The only scene that was somewhat scary is when the woman is in the well and she grabs the long black hair. Let's face it, you just can't mess that scenario up, however you do it. Of course, it's only scary for a second and then you remember the woman can't act.A few other things I have to get in: 1)The child shows no emotion which takes you right out of the film 2)What Ring? They never explain any "ring" 3)Taking the (nonexistant) scary factor out, it's not even a decent drama The Blair Witch project was much, much better and we all know how WAY overhyped that one was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly disappointed after such good things had been promised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading such rave reviews both on and off this site, I have to say I was wholly disappointed when I finally got round to seeing this film so much so that I felt the need to sign up and chip in with my two cents.The aforementioned reviews claimed this was going to be an atmospheric, petrifying, grab your seat, creepy fest the likes of which I have never seen; something on the same par as Ju-On or Steven Kings 'IT' perhaps. It turns out it's actually a mystery/thriller with a supernatural element and a not particularly thrilling one at that. The vast majority of the storyline is going from place to place tracking down information on the curse that an evil video tape has bestowed upon them, sounds like it's gonna get creepy up in here right? Wrong. The conversations are short and don't explain much, the characters develop both the ability to see flash backs and read peoples minds with more or less no explanation on how or why and the pace of the investigation doesn't leave you clinging onto the edge of your seat waiting for the next clue or revelation but doing so because you're dying for something, anything, to happen.Regarding the horror element of it, the film contains but one (two at best) scary moments and they're jammed right at the end just to hack you off, much in the way some places will lock the doors to prevent you leaving a movie before it's said its piece. Now this I can forgive if a movie has put in the hard work to make the atmosphere so thick you can feel the pressure pushing against your skin like the head horror honcho is but feet behind you but alas no pressure, no atmo, no chills. The (spoiler) part of the film where she finds the corpse of the girl 'could' be considered creepy as it grabs her wrist and rises from the water but as far as I picked up that part was not intended to be scary, in fact quite the opposite, the joy that the girl was finally free from her watery prison and at rest (or so they thought) seemed more appropriate an interpretation of the moment. Even the lead heroin didn't seem that spooked. The final horror moment where the watery layabout finally gets off her backside to do some scary, was fairly garden variety, girl climbs out of TV, girl stares at bloke, freeze-frame and bloke is assumed to be dead. End.To summarise, Ringu is a mediocre thriller/kinda horror movie that fails to scare or surprise the viewer and leaves one constantly in anticipation for something interesting to happen. Certainly did not live up to my expectations, which may in part have been my fault for trusting too much in the reviews of others (go watch and see for yourself by the way!) but I did feel it could have had a lot more to offer and it was a shame that it's creators didn't push it to be more than it was.</fullReview>

Terrifying? Say what?! Has anybody out there seen any horror movies made prior to 'Scream'?? Give me a break! If you think this is the most frightening movie you've ever seen then you must have a really scary time getting up in the middle of the night for a glass of milk! Whooooo! Better watch out!The initial premise regarding a strange TV broadcast that kills those who see it bears some similarity to Cronenberg's 'Videodrome', a much more original, intelligent and genuinely disturbing movie. After that 'Ringu' goes in a completely different (supernatural) direction. And it goes in that direction at a snail's pace! Dull, dull, dull! I fail to see anything spooky about this boring and incoherent crap. Tension? Really? And the "explanation" for the events is downright silly and makes NO SENSE!'The Blair Witch Project', though a box office hit, was scoffed at by many discerning horror buffs as over-hyped and not very effective. I myself thought it was uneven with only a few good moments and a lame climax, but compared to 'Ringu' it is a MASTERPIECE of terror. This movie sucks in any language!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>actually quite boring, aside from the video itself &amp; epic ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ring has been on my informal watchlist for over a decade and I had high expectations which were deflated during the first snail-paced hour.The film features Hiroyuki Sanada in the main role, playing the exact same man we've seen him be in Sunshine, Lost, Helix and the rest: more frustratingly vague than mysterious. The female character is forgettable.And the horror? Back in 1998 the meme of ghostly Asian girl in a white dress was fairly new, so we can forgive its use here. The ending scene is terrific, really sent some chills down my spine. And before that we see the contents of the actual video which are quite trippy &amp; beguiling. There's also a nicely-done scene in a well.But to get to these good parts you will have to sit through an hour or so of interminably dull build-up. If you can prepare yourself for that, then you'll probably enjoy the final scenes.Recommended if you enjoy slow-burning Asian horror. Otherwise you may find yourself tempted to give up before the hour mark, or at least skipping forward (a terrible sin reserved only for the worst films, of which this isn't one).</fullReview>

The acting, well, I think you have to know a little bit more of the japanese culture to know if their acting was good or bad. For me it was absolutely superflous, BUT I don't know anything about asian people so I can't compare against reality. The tv sequence is immensely superior in the new one. Yeah, the girl shouldn't have spoken. The horses thing was creative and creepy. Horses in northamerican culture are spiritual animals and they were a nice addition to the story line. And those negative shots on the original one. C'mon! Godzilla being electrocuted, anyone??? About the suspense, I'm not sure. The new version was really suspenseful for me because it was something "new" to me. When I saw the original, the suspense was gone because I knew what was coming. Instead of suspense I got a real laugh when I saw the final scene with the girl's eye (the upside down shot of the upturned eyes was hilarious.. oops, was is supposed to be shocking?). But yes, I agree that the new version over-explains things that would have been much better left out, but I grew up watching american movies and I'm used to overlook this assumption that people (US Americans) are stupid. (Thank God I'm in Canada! lol). So, the Ring, the american version is (for me) much better than the japanese one. And I'm the only person that has to like it (for me).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** spoilers follow ***Maybe the problem was I saw The Ring prior to Ringu so I kind of knew what was going to happen. Maybe I'm just desensitized to all the gory crap horror movies that come out of Hollywood and near-Hollywood movie studios these days. I don't know, but Ringu just didn't quite cut it for me. It was creepy and almost frightening in spots and the final scene actually does seem a bit spookier than The Ring's version in some regard (a real life person standing in front of you versus a video image would actually be scarier). The lack of nails on the hands of the girl was not emphasized in The Ring, but was so in Ringu, so I liked that detail. The creepy sounds and weird camera angles were actually nicer in this movie than The Ring, but The Ring just felt a lot scarier, especially in the pulse-pounding climactic scene and the little frightful face looks along the way. I do give it major points for being the inspiration for the Hollywood version. It's a great original story and urban legend. Had I seen this movie prior to The Ring, I still wouldn't think it too scary. The one huge problem I had with the Hollywood version was the girl was a cheap knockoff of Reagan from The Exorcist. Reagan could eat The Ring girl for breakfast.</fullReview>

The writers didn't want to spend the time writing, when they could just say, "Well, the guy is a psychic, so anytime a problem arises he just knows the answer." This really detracted from the story. That's why I think the American version worked much better, there was always that uncertainty, you never knew if they would find the answer to the riddle. It added suspense. Also. WHAT IS SO SHOCKING ABOUT A PERSON WITH HIS/HER MOUTH HANGING OPEN? Every time a body was found the people would say "I've never seen anything like that." It got alot of unintentional laughter from the people watching the movie with me. At least in the U.S. version they actually looked inhuman. The only thing that I wish the American version used that this film had was the last 30 seconds. Maybe they've found a way to stop the whole thing, but grandpa has to sacrifice himself. That was a cool twist. Oh well, maybe next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the American version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just watched Ringu and the Ring back to back it's easy to see which film is superior. While both are very good, Ringu doesn't have the sense of urgency or foreboding that it's American counterpart has. It just kind of meanders along to it's conclusion. The heroine Reiko (Nanako Matsushima) is not a strong a character as Naomi Watts is in the remake. The American version has some truly chilling scenes and seems to flesh out the characters more. It looks like the filmmakers saw the problems with the first one and were able to fix it. Overall this is a good movie though and should be watched by any horror fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ringu did scare me a few times. I found the first hour genuinely unnerving and the climax was worth the buildup. The final unveiling of Sada almost made the boring/sappy faux-ending seem okay to me, but that's just an indication of how little I care for horror - I guess the sentimental misdirection into Touched by an Angel territory is probably entirely normal in the pop-horror genre. It didn't seemed to make many people hate the Sixth Sense, so I guess it's okay in pop horror to get saccharine for a scene or two.What I found interesting in the first hour was the vague dread of technology. There is almost always some sort of socket on the wall center screen or the characters have their noses buried in video, newspapers, records or logs. Sada seems to exist in a timeless ether - leaving clues pulsing over wires, hidden in the back pages of papers and ominous glimpses on video. The more you play by her rules, learn tricks like the Polaroids or happen to have ESP, the more you can you learn about her. For the first hour of the film, I thought the director really succeeded in suggesting there was something sinister throughout the everyday world of his film that we could almost see.Then I got bored until the end. Though the storm personifies Sada, it's perfectly obvious that it can't kill them because it's too soon, the characters are too important, and it has nothing to do with the tape - so all the loud music and big deal made about how dangerous the storm was felt very dull. Emptying the well went on for entirely too long. Maybe I've just seen too many Scooby Doo episodes to take monster origin scenes seriously anymore. Etc? Also, all versions of this story probably suffer from having way too much plot exposition handled by having characters explain what's happening to each other.Anyway, American version - fx/makeup didn't scare me, it has even more clumsy expository dialogue, lotsa lame dialogue like `everyone will suffer' (well, duh, and revealing Samura's face ? she looked like a handsome woman in rough makeup, not a something evil whose whole existence is being trapped in a well), an irritating cute/wise kid, and far less interesting music. I found it very ordinary. I think it's going too far to say the American film dumbed-down a good film (as far as I can see Ringu is a popcorn flick), but it definitely made it louder and more obvious.Then again, with films like the Ring, whatever scares you is the right one. IMO it's not in the same league with Carnival of Souls, Cure, or The Shining. It's more like the Sixth Sense, Poltergeist or the Blair Witch. Light, gotcha!, but well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TOO LATE SUCKAS !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have already seen the American remake of this film, then please don't watch this movie. Its already too late. "The Ring" has ruined any chance that you might enjoy "Ringu". In my mind there is no doubt that Ringu is the superior film, but for those who has seen "The Ring", your knowledge of the plot and characters will ruin the element of mystery, thus ruining the movie as well. All you can do now is note the subtleness and taste with which the first film was handled versus the MTV style of the remake. Another factor to further corrupt your experience is your own expectations. Surely now most people seeking out this little movie has already seen and enjoyed the remake or have heard about how scary it is. So now you are thinking this is got to be a really really creepy movie. Well no movie can meet your expectations with this kind of hype. So the lesson is, go watch the good movies with subtitles before the remake ruins it for you. ie: Spoorloos before the Vanishing, Wages of Fear before Sorcerer, and Ikiru before the sure to be monkey ass remake coming soon to a theater near you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nifty supernatural thriller, but not as scary as its reputation has it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nifty, effective supernatural thriller that was a huge box-office hit in Japan and became a much-praised but little-seen cult movie everywhere else. Based on a successful novel by writer Roji Suzuki, it can be seen as the oriental version of Kevin Williamson's post-modern horror thrillers, only without the irony; the film even starts with the by-now compulsory prologue where two teenagers scare each other with an urban legend, this time about the "curse video" - anyone who sees this strange tape gets a phone call immediately afterwards, prophesying death in a week's time. The urban legend, though, turns out to be true, as an intrigued TV reporter finds out when she researches the subject and grabs hold of the tape, leaving her with only seven days to solve its deadly mystery. Unlike most of the American genre entries, director Hideo Nakada builds this one from the mood up; its eerie atmosphere, cleverly created among perfectly normal and banal surroundings, is central to amplifying and solving the puzzle at the film's heart and the director steadfastly avoids the usual shock tactics of Western genre filmmaking, going instead for a disquieting, elegant ambiance where anything can happen. However, I must say that, as clever as it is, this is not as scary as its growing reputation would have it, although with a superb premise, a sly media critique (all bad things come from or happen on TV) and a few truly inspired moments (especially in the last half hour), it's a very intriguing and enjoyable thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing but disappointing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been an avid horrorfan all my life it gets harder and harder to find movies that truly scare you. The last time I was scared was while watching Roman Polanski´s The Tenant, but that was like five years ago. So when I heard about Ringu, and that it was supposed to be a real scare-fest, I bought it on DVD. First and foremost I must say it was a pretty slowmoving and dull movie in general. The only time it got interesting was during the movie's finale. That was basically the only time it got scary. I must however admit that due to the sound and the music, the story, that is incomprehensible at best, moves on rather well. The sound and music alone prevents this movie from being a very effective sleeping pill. Furthermore, the plot itself is really messy and the plot points that makes the story interesting is never explained. So my final judgement of Ringu is that it is a rather dull and disappointing film, but due to the sound and music and a cool finale it is worth checking out. It can recommend for those who also finds this movie interesting but unrewarding to check out Ringu 2 (basically the same as the first with only one scary scene) and Ringu 0 (really good since it explains the former movies and has a creepy ending).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, But Not Especially Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard a lot about this movie around the time the American remake was about to be released, and mostly what I heard was how it was the scariest movie you'd ever see and that people were known to have passed out watching it, and other such nonsense.It's never been released theatrically or on video here in the U.S., so I didn't think I'd get the chance to see it until I found a VCD copy on an online auction website. So of course I bid a ridiculously high offer and won the auction, and about two weeks letter I had a copy in my eager little hands.Well let me tell you, I was disappointed.Probably just a case of too much hype, and also probably because the English subtitles were so badly translated every character spoke like Jar Jar Binks. But I really couldn't see what all the fuss was about, and on top of that I had trouble following the story (again probably the fault of the subtitles).The plot is basically about a pretty reporter named Reiko on the trail of an urban legend about a cursed videotape that kills its viewers exactly seven days after they watch it. She is drawn into the investigation by the death of her cousin, who apparently watched the video and paid the price. Reiko doesn't believe in the curse until she finds the videotape and watches it herself, and realizes she has seven days to figure out how to break the curse or die.The film does have its moments, and it builds suspense fairly well for a while, but eventually you realize nothing much is happening. The initial scariness of recognizing that Reiko may very well be sealing her own doom eventually evaporates. The last two thirds of the film is a rather slow-moving detective story as she tries to track down the origins of the tape and figure out how to keep from dying. But there is at least a shocking ending that makes the wait worthwhile.All in all it's still worth seeking out a copy if you can find it (but don't make my mistake and pay too much for it!)</fullReview>

I understand why this movie got all the buzz from critics, and was re-made american style. I gave this film a 6/10 just to due to story. It was so scary and somewhat original that it had me on the edge of my seat just to get to the end, which is well worth the wait. The lead actress was not convincing to me at all, she just seemed to whine a little here and there. The main characters ex-husband did a wonderful acting job and saved the movie from being even worse, he actually seemed frightened.

What's great about this film is the tense atmosphere created by a very simple story about a mysterious videotape which has a supernatural power to destroy anyone who has viewed it. Nice to see a Japanese flick which shows real landscapes instead of all the computer generated imagery that we are use to seeing. I would recommend this to any self respecting horror fan. Especially the subtitled version because it keeps the original dialogue in place etc. Worth watching! 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i refused to go see the american remake...at least until i saw the original. so, i borrowed a copy (of the movie) from my friend. i must "say" that not knowing what was going on made the movie more intriguing (and creepier). i "say" this because the version i viewed only had chinese subtitles. my japanese is not great and my chinese is horrible, so watching this and trying to piece it all together through just the images (and what little japanese i could effectively translate) made the movie all the more compelling.i agree that this is not a "horror" movie. that genre has turned into blood-and-guts. this is a psychological movie (psychological "thriller" maybe) because the images from the movie (and the actual tape) stay with you after watching it. i still have the images of Sadako -- the hands, the hair, the eye, as well as the noises from the tape running through my head...***possible SPOILER***...and just the whole way the lead actor's demise was played out actually gave me chills. as i watched the movie, i kept noticing that it appeared that on the video tape, something was coming out of the well (right before it cut to static). when finally, that "something" comes out, it just gave me chills. i don't know why. the slow, "angry" jerking of Sadako was also effective.as someone pointed out, a lot of the images and themes in the movie are probably missed by non-japanese. movies of this nature often play on cultural themes that can touch the audience. for people who connect something to the well (or the ocean, or hair-brushing or any other image from the tape) -- whether good or bad -- i am sure it hits them harder than others. the only example i can give from my own experience is Pet Semetary, because i had a cat that looked just like Church.overall, a good, effective movie. i believe you have to understand where it is coming from (and the target audience) to actually appreciate. slasher-horror, it is not. psychological-thriller...indeed</fullReview>

Rumour is they watched a small movie and got a weird phonecall after that. All 4 died exactly one week after watching the movie.One of the girls confesses she watched the same movie a day later, but both girls just make fun of it. Suddenly the phone rings....the 2 become very scared, but decide to pick up the phone anyway. It's the mother of one of the girls. Relieved they split up, one of the girls goes to the Bathroom, and the other is getting something to eat. Suddenly the TV turns on. The girl sees the same images she saw a week earlier. She hears something behind her, turns around and.......The news of the new dead spreads around, a female reporter decides to check it out, and interviews a bunch of kids who tell about the rumor of the movie.She eventually finds a copy of the movie on tape, and plays it. afterward she also get's the weird phonecall. Becoming very scared she turns to her ex-husband, and gives the tape to him to watch. Ofcourse the same happens to him.Realizing the danger they are now in, they decide to find out who made the tape, and then the movie really starts!!!I won't spoil the rest of the movie, but personally i found it very good, never really scary, but it has some creepy scenes, especially towards the end, when the reporter's deadline comes closer and closer. This movie gave me the Chills!!!on a scale of 1-10 i'd give it a 9.I would have given it a 10 if it contained a few more Shock scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those of you who weren't scared missed out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, "Ringu" falls into the same category as David Lynch's film "Lost Highway" in that it cannot be fully appreciated for it's terrifying elements without a proper setup. Persay, a nice sized TV, surround sound, and watching the film alone in total darkness.SPOILERS AHEAD!!For example, the sequence where the top of the well is lifted off, you simply see it being lifted off. However, in surround sound, as soon as it's lifted, a barrage of disconnected ghostly moans and groans permeate the soundscape, replete with subtle ambience and deep bass. With a combination of dark lighting, carefully executed tracking shots that encircle the well ring as one the characters descends down into the well, and an increase in the amount of voices that come out of the well without breaking into the loud level, this makes for a truly frightening scene, one of unease and tension.Consider several other sequences that use subtle minimal sound and cinematography as it's technique. The videotape itself has these strange little scratching sounds and whimpers, which are also heard over the phone, and when the videotape is first spotted by the lead protagonist, it shifts to a grainy extreme close-up of the videotape with Bernard Hermann'esque strings and a bizarre, distorted roar of some sort in the soundtrack. The weirdly blurred photographs of the children after seeing the video, and the surveillance videotape of the children dead with the horrified look about their faces played in slow motion with a slurred growling sound in the soundtrack creates an unforgettably frightening image. The sequence with the little girl slowly rising from the well in the final videotape, with a minimal amount of scratching sounds, and the way she clumsily walks toward the camera zombielike with her hair donned in front of her face before coming through the TV and only revealing in an extreme close-up a single eye glaring down at the victim may be only of the most simplistic yet most terrifying climaxes in film history. The Japanese film horror approach is grandiose in it's vision, yet minimal in it's approach and delivery. Much isn't used in this film, and it works to it's advantage. There are no giant special effects, and it doesn't need them."Ringu" is a rare horror film that is scary after repeated viewings as opposed to one-timers. It works not simply because of the implications of the story about the videotape which will kill you in 7 days after watching it, but because through lighting, sound, cinematography and execution of the combined elements, there is an air of dread and fear so thick that it will shake even the most jaded horror fans to the very core of their being. I will agree with most comments that "Ringu" is not a disturbing film, but it's a truly frightening film, one with genuine fear. Most horror films depends on blood-and-guts gore and cheap shots to startle their audience rather than actually make them afraid of what they're seeing. Most horror films will scare you as you watch the film, and you leave the theater completely relieved and are able to forget about it. Some will say that this is because you're supposed to be relieved after seeing them, while in actuality, the horror film being seen is inferior because it only knows how to scare for a short period of time. "Ringu" is a film that knows how to scare and leave truly frightening images imbedded in your mind. It's the only horror film I have seen that has lasted with me for days on end, whereas most horror films are quickly dismissed and even forgotten.Sadly, most people will miss out on this due to a lack of a proper setup as I had mentioned above. People say it doesn't matter, but sound design and picture quality is just as important an element in film as any. And, most people are desensitized by Wes Craven shockers such as "Scream" or Kevin Williamson teen-horror flicks such as "I Know What You Did Last Summer". By shocker, that doesn't mean that it contains images that will shock you to the very core of your being. Rather, it means that it will make you jump or startle you, but never create an atmosphere that you feel uneasy about walking around in. However, if you have an open mind and understand the dramatic process and can appreciate what is being done through sound and imagery, "Ringu" is an atmospheric horror film that will scare the hell out of you.</fullReview>

Though the story is rather simple, this one catches you from the first to the last minute - for the simple reason that it IS really scary. And - since this was the tagline - yes, I do think it's not only better, but also more scary than THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. As I said before, REALLY scary. And - no, it's not a rip-off of that teenie movie mentioned above. I saw a subtitled DVD from the UK, which appeared to be uncut (since the movie is not gory, I doubt that any censorship board elsewhere will demand any cuts). And don't worry about language - RING isn't too talky, so this shouldn't be a problem even if you're not used to subtitled versions. Believe the hype. And... don't watch it alone ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Japanese horror film is hugely popular in its homeland, spawning a sequel, TV series and even a line of toys. It has also been causing quite a stir in the West, being heralded as the sign of a revolution in the genre, returning to a more calculating horror rather than the cheap shock tactics of slasher flicks.The story begins with Reiko, a reporter investigating the mysterious deaths of several high school students, including her niece, and the urban myth that is spreading through the country concerning a cursed videotape. The rumour goes that if you see this tape you have only one week left to live and after tracking down a copy and watching it, Reiko becomes convinced that she too has given herself a death sentence.In this way the story is not too far removed from the 50's horror classic 'Night of the Demon', with an initially sceptical investigator becoming increasingly more fearful of their fate and racing to try and lift the curse. It also is not wholly unlike the slasher films which have reduced the genre to self-parody in that it has it's origins firmly in the whispers of school halls and spectre of urban legends. What does mark it our however is the ancient folklore underlying the modern myth which makes it more 'Candyman' than 'Scream'.The beginning is very promising and really draws you in to the mystery surrounding the dead teenagers. However the story then begins to lose its way a little through the middle section as it turns out Reiko's ex-husband is conveniently psychic and they run from place to place trying to solve the puzzle of the videotape. The tape itself is genuinely unnerving, with grainy footage of writhing shapes accompanied by some unpleasant sound effects, but like the rest of the film never resorts to gore or shocks, instead content to establish, and for the most part maintain, an overriding sense of creepiness.Then, just as the whole thing seems to be getting a little silly with tales of unnatural powers and the fury of the dead, just as it looks like everything is okay and everyone is going home to bed for a quiet drink of milk and some biscuits, you realise that there is still five minutes of the film left. And what follows is one of the most delightfully understated twist endings I have seen, which really does feel like someone has taken their filth encrusted fingernails and dragged them screeching down your spinal cord. In the face of this simple but effective exercise in fear the ridiculousness of the rest is forgotten and like the best films of it's kind, 'Ring' doesn't go away when you turn off the TV. In fact, you'll want to throw your telly out of the window just to be on the safe side.</fullReview>

(SPOILER:certainly the out of the TV scene is better here. END SPOILER) Ultimately this is an over rated film who's power comes not from the images and storytelling but rather from the fact that we are all potential victims of a tape that kills after viewing. I suppose that years ago the story would have been of a book that kills.This isn't to say that its a bad film, its not.

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly, not as good as the US version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, when a film is remade, the original is much better. That's particularly the case when the original is foreign and the remake is Hollywood. Not the case here.The original Japanese version is good. That is certainly true. It just isn't as creepy as the American remake. The American movie's curse tape is longer and a bit creepier, in my opinion. Also, everything is neatly explained in the Japanese version, whereas the American version leaves much unanswered (I consider leaving things unanswered to be a good thing).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but the remake is far better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing The Ring I just had to see Ringu thinking that originals are always better than a remake but I was wrong, Ringu is a good movie and could've been better if you haven't seen The Ring yet because your expectations are not as high. Ringu was a good movie and had some great visual style as far as locations and such but the scary effects just don't satisfy. It's more funny than scary when you see the victims with just having their mouths open when they were scared to death and the final scene was spooky but failed to really grasp you like The Ring did. I will say however that the explanation behind the girl was better than The Ring because it was easier to understand and not as shady as The Ring, I also liked the idea of the kid not having too much airtime like The Ring where it comes to a point where it's too similar to The Sixth Sense, he is an important part in the plot but it did get annoying in The Ring, but lets get back to Ringu, good movie but had much more potential as a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American adaptation is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being thoroughly blown away by the American adaptation of Ringu in the theater, I was determined to see this original Japanese edition. So I was very disappointed when it turned out that the original didn't have the storyline depth or intense creepiness of the American remake.One of the most creepy aspects of The Ring was the video itself. The images on it were surreal, abstract, yet meaningful. In Ringu, the video was much, much shorter - and far less creepy. Because it was a shorter video, it had much less clues to the curse - and became part of the reason it was a shorter movie.As a matter of fact, if I had watched the two versions of the film back to back with no previous knowledge of which was made first, I would have guessed the American version was the original. The American version had much more depth concerning the history of Samara. These type of details (which I felt added to the American version) were left out of the Japanese version - so the original seemed like an edited version of the American version. It actually felt like a shorter remake of The Ring.I really was hoping for Ringu to blow me away even further than The Ring had. Instead, I hold this as one of the prime examples that Hollywood can indeed improve upon a foreign movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Even Half as Good As American Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And it's not even close. The Japanese version seems amateurish and not only wasn't scary, it wasn't even interesting. The American version leaves you with a sense of dread and makes you feel uncomfortable. I wouldn't necessarily say that's its scary but it's very difficult for me to be scared by a movie.THe ending of the Japanese version was so silly that it seemed like they ran out of money and ideas; Oddly enough, it is the Japanese version that tries to find a clean ending, ultimately failing though. The American ending leaves you with a sense of revulsion and impending doom.I remember a friend of mine checking out the Japanese version over a year ago when they were showing it at a theatre in nyc and he thought it was boring tripe.I understand his feelings and agree. Certainly not a movie to recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the american version of The Ring, and I decided to rent the original japanese one, the supposedly much better and scarier version. The idea was nice, a very good and original plot, but nothing about this movie was frightening enough for me to keep me up at night. The sounds and music were scary at some times, but i was expecting more gruesome and horrible images. Ringu seemed short and predictable too me but that was probably because the american version added lots more stuff to it that this movie didn't have. Anyways, i would give Ringu 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is so terrible...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, i've heard so many people talk about how the new version of "The Ring" sucks and how it's all big-budget hollywood and that "Ringu" is so much better because it's scarrier than hell without using a lot of special effects and whatnot to makeit good. Yeah, this movie is god-awful. Seriously, anyone who says this movie is better than the new one has some serious problems.Please, allow me to explain why.1) WORST ACTING EVER. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with acting this bad. the way the people die is SO STUPID. Hey here's a good idea: let's just fall to the floor like an idiot and open our mouths like a shmuck and look like a moron after the screen turns my face into a negative picture in a HORRIBLE attempt at creating something scary.2) THE VIDEO IS SO STUPID. Oh my God, that video was honestly, and I'm not exagerating, I've never laughed so hard in my entire life until I saw that video. That guy standing there pointing at nothing? Yeah, he's really stupid. Good thing he had that towel over his head. I wouldn't wanna be seen in that movie either if I were him.3) IT MADE NO SENSE AT ALL. Self explanitory. It's a good thing Gore Verbinsky got it or else I would have never understood it at all.4) People praise this movie for being scary without the special effects of the new one. First of all, the new one didn't have many special effects, AND YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T! The reason the new version was so amazing was because it did just that: it put more focus on the visual effects rather than gore and slash 'em up crap.The short story: this movie is trash. I think it should seriously take the palce of "Plan 9 From Outer Space" as the WORST MOVIE EVER MADE.</fullReview>

Maybe I was "fooled" by all the stuff said like "..the scariest movie since Exorcist.." , "..it puts B.W.Project in the shoe..", bla, bla and I expected a really great movie...I was deceived!! I was almost shocked to see where these people get their ideas..... Don't waste any time on this one.....the acting is poor, the whole idea of the movie is good but not by far fullfilled and a couple suspence moments where i thought that why am I opening my mouth of tedium? The sound is one of the two things I found great in this movie; the soundtrack can be scary in some moments but it doesn't help much if you don't have the right images... ; and the second one was the final generic...

		<fullReview>As I finished watching this film, my phone rang! It was lucky it did because I'd fallen asleep the film was so boring. I'd read the hype - 'A genuinely scary experience' etc - and was looking forward to be frightened. I set the scene perfectly - lights off, volume up, girlfriend under my arm, but the scary moments just never came. An hour into the film, my girlfriend turned to me and pointed out that there had not been one scary scene so far. We perservered anyway, holding out for a triumphant climax that we hadn't seen coming and would ensure sleeping with the lights on for a week, but alas, it never came. Shame really, as the premise of the film is very promising. I think it would have worked better if they had taken it from the point of view of the college students to whom the video was simply a myth.Scary film? Well, it doesn't ring a bell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky and quietly discomforting......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the original first and being creeped out by it back in high school, I didn't think there would be any new surprises in the original. But one thing I was expecting was it to be better than the original considering Hollywood usually over exagerrates a lot of things with remakes and aren't used to subtlety.But Ringu really makes it worth your while because while it is the same story as the American remake, remember this is where it originally started from.I won't get into the plot as you probably all know what it is but I will talk about what makes this worth while viewing even if you've seen the original. Firstly, minimal use of visual effects actually adds more to the atmosphere - it feels a lot more authentic. Hideo Nakata uses sounds a lot more to deliver the atmosphere and scares and it works very well. There is a quite dread of discomfort surrounding the film that makes you feel that someone else is watching wherever you are. The look at Japanese culture and insights is also interesting.The video itself is shorter than the remake and actually feels more like a ghost sort of video since it looks less digital like than the US one did. The ending also leaves you with a sort of lesson you learn about the need to stay alive and what you will do regardless to stay so.I can't complain about either versions. They both pull off the story and concept very well and it really depends on what you're in the mood for. Hence I don't think you could say either versions is necessarily better as their styles are both unique and both create that sense of dread and atmosphere that can scare different audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I actually thought The Ring was much better than Ringu.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I did see the American remake first, but contrary to what most seem to believe, seeing the remake of a movie first absolutely does not spoil the original for me in any way, personally, and I just thought The Ring was a much better movie all around. The thing with Ringu is it was just way too bland for my tastes. The performances were fine, but I guess I am one who loves a lot more material than I was given, like they gave in The Ring. I am not a CGI junkie, nor do I care for "quick scares" throughout the movie, even though The Ring did have both of those things in a bigger quantity than Ringu, but I was expecting more than I got in terms of story and revelation. It really was just a mellow movie to watch unfold, for me, and at times I was wondering if it would ever give me any real shock or sense of greatness.I primarily liked The Ring better because the cast was incredible and while I absolutely loved the sets and realism in Ringu, those were the aspects I enjoyed most about it, it just as a movie itself did not deliver for me. Everyone goes on about how it is so scary, so I sat down ready to be frightened to death, because I figure if any country can scare you it is certainly Japan, and was ultimately disappointed. Here again though, I have never been frightened by any movie, ever. Still, I do not hate Ringu. It was entertaining and though I did cut it off at one point out of boredom to watch something else, I told myself if I cut it off now I probably will never finish it and went back to the spot I was at, because maybe it would pick up. A lot of the scenes seem very real, like I mentioned, which is what I liked most about it and therefore the climax is ultimately better executed, in my opinion, but I was just not very satisfied with it.Maybe I expected too much after seeing the remake, but I was disappointed. It's okay at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The terror of the tape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The old idea of a book that kills everyone who reads it is re-invented in Hideo Nakata's film 'Ring', but with a modern twist: this time, the medium is videotape (death by text message is perhaps only round the corner). In its conclusion, 'Ring' then adds an interesting twist: you can save yourself by copying the tape. But the film doesn't actually dwell on the mechanisms of this viral curse. Nor does it really convince in exploring the psychology of belief or the imminence of death - cursed individuals supposedly have one week before they die, yet the heroes behave quite calmly for most of this interval (as if they did not believe it), only to periodically shout "We have only three days left!" in a panic stricken voice. Indeed, the film works more as a thriller than a horror movie, as the heroes try to track down the cause of the curse in the manner of a detective story. In the manner of the best thrillers, the enemy is always out of sight, a power undefined, and this is a smart choice, as it means that the film does not have to make specific the metaphysics of its alternative world. But it's a bit hard to construct a detective story where the breakthroughs seem to come from ESP flashes, rather than from the investigations carried out. If you were to try and summarise the plot of this film, "because" and "therefore" would not be words you could use very often: the film is more a collection of images than a wholly coherent story.The portrait of modern Japan (and its rather British climate) is something I like, but I'm not sure that the acting is actually that good (or that Japanese women are really that submissive in manner - one can sense that this film is directed by a man). There are a few genuinely chilling moments, but the film works hard to provide them; the low key, naturalistic style disguises a creaking plot. Overall, I find it hard to understand why this film was such a hit; its sequel, 'Ring 2', went further into the metaphysics of the curse and made even less sense. A peculiar film; and sadly in this case, that does not mean good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying I did see 'The Ring' a few years before I watched Ringu so I knew quite a bit about the movie from the get go. Also, subtitles are not my favorite thing as I don't see many movies with them and they were a bit of a distraction for me. Some of them were simply laughable as something was lost in the translation.Overall, I enjoyed this film quite a bit. I was amazed at how closely 'The Ring' followed Ringu, which was not nearly as frightening as The Ring. The best word I can think of to describe it is creepy, especially the last third or so. The acting is decent and the story-line is alright, although certainly not the greatest story ever told. ***Spoilers***The one thing which bothered me about the movie was the ringing phone, or, to put it more accurately, lack of a ringing phone. After the main character watches the tape, the phone rings right away to signal her pending doom in one week. She then shows it to her ex-husband at her home. After he watches it, the phone never rings. I was left thinking, 'Hmmm. It didn't work for him.' But, later, he says to his ex-wife, 'I only have one more day than you,' meaning the phone must have rang but they just didn't show it. I found that very odd. Same thing occurs after their little boy watches it. The phone does not ring but we are led to believe the boy is also in danger.Good movie and my first taste of Japanese horror outside of Godzilla (not really horror I know). I did enjoy "The Ring" more but this story interests me enough to where I would definitely like to see the next Japanese Ringu movie if I can get my hands on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woah. Boy. Glad to see I'm not the only one who was being lulled into sleep while watching this this dull, ill-paced Japanese original. A few chilling scenes shot in black-and-white do not make up for the slow incoherence of the narrative (if you enjoy watching people sit and watch videos and read books, you'll be treated to several long scenes of that here), the ignorantly sparse use of a musical score, the faint lighting and drab colors (which, by the way, don't heighten the atmosphere one bit), and weak characterizations. The use of subtitles, which I'd usually applaud, wound up a distraction--as sloppy as dubbing sometimes is, it might've kept me more engaged in the "plot." Of course, my decision to rent "Ringu" came from the through-the-roof hype surrounding it--that, and I wasn't really a fan of the U.S. remake--but now I feel more tempted to give "The Ring" another look--the atmosphere and lush colors (yes, COLORS) alone are reason enough to take it over this version, even if the tension lags in the last act.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MAT CONTAIN SPOILERS*So there I was, still terrified a day later after seeing The Ring, and I was looking up as much info on it as I could. I clicked on the trivia section at IMDB.com and what do I see?"A remake?" I said to myself. "I just saw a remake? The original is better you say? Hmmm.... .. intriguing. Maybe I'll try to get a hold of it. Wait, what's this? It's japanese? I'm sketchy, but I will go on. I must see it!"About a week later (haha a week (get it?)) i get the DVD. Oh, i was so excited, I sit down and watch it, because this day so happens to be a day that I am sick, so I have nothing better to do.From the first scene I had already noticed the similarities of the two movies. A lot them being the camera angles. But the difference about this movie was, well to be quite literal, it was a piece of sh*t! The characters seemed almost always emotionless, and when they were forced to show any kind of it, that's exactly what it seemed like, forced emotion. There totally uneeded supernatural elements (ESP, in almost all of the characters, what the f*ck is that?!) The little boy (Yoshino) might have just been dead from the start, i felt absolutely no sympathy for him.The cheesy black and white fade when one dies and sees the ring (which I don't believe was explained in the movie, nor was the reason for dying in seven days explained.) was something I would expect from an eighties teen slasher. The film itself went by so fast, I couldn't wait for it to end either. Oh, and that cheap sound effect they used when Sadako was knocked out by her father, Jesus, i thought i was watching a goddamn cartoon! I am a huge film buff, be they foreign or American, I usually stick up for the underdogs, but this was just awful. Everyone complained about the American version because of it's "cheap" use of sound, but Ringu had similar jump off of your seat audio as well.I can't get over how little emotion there was. Now some of you may be saying, "well that's Japanese cinema for ya." Not a chance in hell, I've seen excellent films come out of Japan, but this, this was a disgrace. The only plus to this movie was it's explanation on how the curse was put into video format. But the American Version was still far more superior, better actors, better cinematography, better plot (they do differ, better evrything. I was able to sleep almost instantly after seeing Ringu, but the Ring kept me up for half of the night.Some of you may still argue that fear is different in one place than it is another. You be the judge, I done dissecting this B- film, if that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really quite crap. You spend the whole thing watching two journalists telling each other a very old story and watching a video tape over and over again. Why the filmmaker didn't just tell the story directly, I'll never know (apparently they do in Ringu 0: The Prequel). There are about 15 minutes near the end when these characters literally empty a well with two buckets--and the filmmaker thinks we need to see them lift every single bucket out of the well.The narrative inconsistencies are obvious and glaring throughout; elements that actually do provoke a reaction, like the actual ring, are underused and not consistent enough to make this tired genre film work. There is an import of culture here but it's just the Japanese embracing the American screen trade with a little Antonioni thrown in for good measure.Best not to get too excited about it, then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Emporer's New Scare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to add a dissenting voice here, and state that 'Ring' is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the poorest excuses for a horror film I've ever had the displeasure of seeing.Slow, meandering, lacking wholly in suspense of terror, this amateurish effort smacks of being rushed to completion before anyone had a chance to take a long hard look at the structure and say "er, no".That it has been lauded so highly by critics and non-genre audiences alerts us to two things. That critics are desperate to get their names on posters for the next underground hit and that audiences should see more horror films. The idea is nice, though the urban myth angle strains against the blatant techno-supernatural guff of a "cursed video tape". However, the hour and a half of plodding investigation into Sadako's origins just irritates, largely due to an unlikeable cast and hopeless dialogue. The fact that it's so badly lit (having no lights is not "artistic" or "moody", it's just unwatchable) and poorly filmed (editing? pacing? hello?) doesn't help either. Better suited to a format like a mid-season X-Files episode, here the format is stretched to breaking over the running time. When the two protagonists find the well and try to empty it with small buckets, all sympathy drains and you just want them dead as soon as possible for their contrived stupidity.The fact that the film has a much talked-about "big scare" is nothing but another "urban myth". Poorly staged, the sequence involving Sadako's crawling from the TV set is hokey, laughable and a great big fat let-down. The film also betrays it's desperation when the 'ghost' of one of the main characters reappears, with a bag on his head no less, to *point* to the final plot twist. "Just get it the hell over with" he seems to be saying. The audience I saw this with agreed with him.Can Japanese cinema do anything except recreate moments from Western successes? Not going by what's on offer here. See 'Videodrome', 'Candyman' and, since it's been mentioned heavily in the advertising, 'Blair Witch'- all of which deliver. 'Ring' doesn't. Doesn't even come close. To hell with it, and 'Ring 2'. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>entertaining but not SCARY!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film of my age of 10 and I enjoyed it but I only bought it because total film said it was the decond scariest horror film ever made. I watched with my cousin and he thought it looked stupid because it was in japennese. He had already seen the remake. The storyline makes it sound scary but watch it you be happy your not wetting the bed. I was really looking forward to the bit where samada(the girl in the television)comes out the television to kill the man who had watched the video tape. It was a disapoinment, all you saw was a wet girl coming out a television and crawling on the floor. Her nails have been pulled off her finger and blood is coming out her eyes. Surpizingly I was laughing because I found it so ridiculas.IN SHORT: I watched the ring, it was good but not scary. if your looking for a horror film, don't buy this. If looking for a thriller,drama buy ring</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I saw the American version first, and that I feel that it was far superior.I also need to point out that my review is mostly a rant of confusion inspired by my disappointment after reading the rave reviews (including those who recommended watching this film even though I saw the American version first, claiming this one is "sooo much better"). As a result MY REVIEW SPOILS JUST ABOUT THE ENTIRETY OF BOTH VERSIONS.With that said, I'm trying to be objective with my evaluation of the original. I do believe that had I not seen the American version first I would have liked this one better.So doing my best to put the American version out of my mind, where did the original fall flat ? For me the male character all of a sudden having psychic abilities half-way through the movie had me seriously considering turning the movie off. It was extremely poor script writing and pretty much killed the entire film for me. Then there were the visions seen by the female character that started around the same time.So I'm giving the movie 5/10 as my "objective" review. The psychic abilities made this movie a "cheese fest" for me. Still entertaining but really not scary, and actually rather lame. If I consider all of the changes that the American version made that worked for me I would give it a 1 or 2.What were those changes ? For starters, when the existence of the child is revealed, you know that there's something "not quite right" about her, but it's also suggested that she's a victim. The fact that she's kept in a barn with nothing but a TV makes you feel like she's being abused, and you sympathize with her. You don't know who to feel sorry for. Her mother, who's she's driving insane, or her. You wonder if maybe she can't help what she's doing to those around her, and is being treated unfairly. But you also ask yourself "how would I deal with such a child?" The insane asylum scenes worked beautifully for me. I read some of the other reviews and I can appreciate how some people preferred the silent ghost in the original. But when Samara was asked by the doctor "You don't want to hurt people do you ?" and she answers "but I do and I'm SORRY" that just sent chills down my spine. I think I enjoyed the thrill from that one line more than "THE SCENE" at the end (not to downplay that climactic scene, I just loved that one line from Samara so much).Which brings me to the "well scene". Some people in their reviews said they felt that Ringu had a better well scene. I disagree. For the sole reason that in the original they CHOSE to descend the well! (talk about killing the entire scene) In the remake Naomi Watts character was pushed into the well and she had no means of escape. That created an extremely helpless situation for her character that really scared the crap out of me. I could picture myself wetting my pants if I was trapped down there. It was very claustrophobic and terrifying, for the sole reason that the situation was involuntary. I was also disappointed that the Japanese version had the ghost's arm reach out from the water and grab the character. It felt very cliché. I was expecting that in the American version and was very relieved that they didn't do that (and very creeped out by what they did do!) Also, in the American version they didn't go to the cabin with the intention of digging for a dead body. They were searching for clues and happened to find the well, which succeeded in creating a much creepier atmosphere for me.I also felt that "the video" in the remake was way creepier. The fly, the mother diving off of the cliff, the finger nail breaking in the well, the ladder and, well THE RING! But I guess that's also a testament to the added story in the remake which created a much richer atmosphere and more compelling story that didn't need to use cheesy psychic abilities to explain everything away in a single scene or two and instead slowly reveal what was going on in a far more suspenseful and plausible manner (I know a ghost story isn't going for "realism" but I guess when everyone's got supernatural powers the evil bad guy just isn't as scary because it is no longer "supernatural" to have powers, it's "natural" in the universe of the story. So I felt like I was watching something like X-Men, not a horror movie). So really, I felt that the American version was far less cheesier, more plausible (with regards to the characters motivations), had a much richer story-line and because Samara was a complete enigma (i.e: she was adopted and her mother didn't have "powers") Samara was far more terrifying for me and became my all time favourite horror villain. I just didn't like the ghost in the original. In fact, there was nothing really to like or dislike. No sympathy for her or her parents. No asking myself how I would act if I were her parents. No feeling bad that she was murdered (in fact, the fact that it was pretty much conclusive that she had murdered someone else kind of justified her murder which was yet another disappointment). The original was simply psychic-power cliché cheese (she's got powers because her mother has powers only hers are slightly more ... "powerful"). Not an absolutely horrible movie when judged on it's own (without considering the awesome superiority of the remake), but extremely overrated none-the-less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a waste *slight spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>while watching this film i was reminded of scooby doo, the series. it would always start off so well, the monster would be on the loose, we'd have no idea what is going on and it would all be scares and frights. and then they'd explain away the whole thing and pull old mr jenkins rubber monster mask off, game over. it always bugged the hell out of me as a kid, and it still bugs me now. *slight spoilers* so yes, it was the ghost of a long dead psychic who now wants vengence. or does she? what does she really want, what was the point? this was the main problem with the film, it tried to explain away so much, and then left the gaping plot holes for viewers who like to think about their films to fall into. what begin as a seriously creepy film, it detoriated violently into a dumb psychological thriller which seemed to have any truly horrific aspects tacked onto it just to make it barely watchable. the only truly scary thing about this film was the sound effects and sadako's video, but they had their welcome worn out after we had heard the shame effect and seen the video for the 17th million time. just a pointless waste which could have been truly brilliant if the film makers had the guts to leave it open and not explain it away. by explaining away, they took away any chance they had of leaving us trembling in our seats and crawling for more. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the US version? No!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure why whenever I mention that I loved 'The Ring', I am told that the original version (Ringu) was so much more intense. Compared the the American version, Ringu is like a pleasant dream. I say this because the American version had loud, shocking sounds and various camera techniques to really impact the viewer when something bad was happening. In Ringu, this is gone completely. The actors (primarily toward the end) apparantly have no emotions as they don't even gasp or jump when something freaky happens. Its like they are in another world. I give this movie a C-, just because without it the American one wouldn't be here. But I will also say, watch the US version BEFORE watching Ringu, or you will not enjoy the US version.</fullReview>

What movie where these people watching? Do these people have a night-light and sleep with the covers over their heads? I was really psyched to see this film because usually when America remakes foreign films the films that are chosen are usually great (le Femme Nikita, Seventh Samurai, la Jetée, Insomnia, etc...) and most of the time we end up ruining them (Point of No Return, the Vanishing...) so I thought watching the original would be a great idea... Damn was I wrong... Hype can be a bad thing (Abre Los Ojos (Vanilla Sky)was bad too...) and this is a perfect example of it. Not only was this dull, but it was corny, hokey and down-right cheesey. It reminded me of a "Tales From the Darkside" or "Tales From the Crypt" episode. So someone watches this video (a "creeeeepy" video! Ewwww!!!) and they die a week later. Uhuh. How do they die? Well I can't say (spoiler)it would ruin the chills!!! :-B The premise is laughable and it's conclusion was even more ridiculous. Now some might think "he doesn't like these kind of movies!" I love to be creeped out and scared just as much as the next goose-pimpled geek. This was such a HUGE disappointment. Maybe the remake might be better...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay but not the great horror film everyone is talking about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw RINGU on a very dark DVD transfer. I can't say how good the cinematography was because the transfer was bad. The film itself was okay but nothing earth-shattering which makes me wonder why or who created such a massive buzz around it. The concept is cool (reminded me of VIDEODROME) but it is unnecessarily padded and the film was at times dull or flat. The main problem with the story though is that once someone views the tape, they have 7 days before they die. So, the film starts with someone viewing the tape and the bulk of the movie is about the people trying to figure out how to stop this curse from killing the people who viewed the tape. In other words, nothing much happens between the beginning and the end.Horror or stories about the supernatural should never really have to make 100% sense but there were some moments in RINGU that were totally improbable, like when the couple received these flashbacks moments when they touch the person. I mean, come on! It wasn't very convincing. There were several such "eye rolling" moments in RINGU. The cast itself was totally forgettable. Like I've said, RINGU is okay I guess but except for the ending there's nothing really memorable about it.</fullReview>

Why would I want to see a remake of a below average movie? How can anyone think that this film is superior to the remake? The scripts are somewhat different, but I don't care which most closely follows the original printed story on which they were based, since I'll probably never read it anyway.I think anyone who rates this movie over the remake is probably doing so because they think the original has be better, simply because it's the original. I can't be that pretentious in my opinions. I have to be honest. This one's a snoozer. I would give this movie a 2 or 3 out of 10. I would give the remake an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pushing the Luddite Agenda and Product Placement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a horror aficionado, as I may have confessed elsewhere here in these reviews. I did intentionally want to see this film rather than the American remake, as it just seems like the right thing to do. But this ended up being a "eh" for me.I had seen the trailers of the US Ring with the well and the odd movements of the long-haired lass and found that mesmerizing. And in this film that scene as well as the entire video meme and other sorts of 'Dead Zone' shocks of sight were enjoyable to watch. I could have used more of such scenes and certainly more explication of the powers of certain characters in the past and present.However honestly, twice I fell asleep while watching this. I think some of the language gets lost in translation, as well as the harrowing horror of the stink-eye faces of death (isn't this something from Japanese art of old)? Americans tend to go for the physical detaching of limbs in horror, where in Japanese film it looks like it is the fear felt during the detaching of life which is so frightening. (And probably a more realistic fear for the every man).There were other elements I enjoyed about this film, the sea village life and the ocean claiming its annual sacrificial victims. The idea of the video as a virus (I'm sure someone on here has already mentioned the actual name of the video that was making kids nauseous in Japan...I cannot recall it.)Hard to pass up on the Luddite justification, i.e. not only is a VCR deadly but it must be coupled with a telephone as well.... The undertheme of sexual activity among teenagers, at least in the early deaths, linked to horror always a classic.The pace of the film was different, (or were they stretching the story out)...but more moments of actors/actresses just gazing was different, if not perhaps a little too soporific.Culture wise, something as simple as the houses being so sparsely decorated was something else I noticed. Overall, not enough to warrant this as a must-rent...one last comment, especially when juxtaposed against the majority of drab decor...the opening scene with the prominent product placement of an American peanut jar and a cracker box stood out...I'm afraid to wager that these were airbrushed in for the US release... The omnipresent commercial, now that's scary...5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Horror with Technology-Inclined Plot Becomes Instant Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally, now is a hard time for the genre of horror movie, as advanced technology fills in our daily lives and excludes supernatural phenomena. Under that circumstance, Ringu is an audacious attempt to take technology into a horror flick, using videotape as a storytelling tool, and probably thanks to that, it has become an instant classic. (Though, those who are familiar with the videotaping technology may want a more logical explanation on how the supernatural power contrived in the film works to make a video recording.) The production is small but overall decently done, while several flaws are out there. Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada) shouldn't have an ESP; the plot would be more thrilling and the audience might be more identified with him, if an ordinary person got involved and struggled. Towards the end, the scene of draining water from the well is dull without building a right tension as a climax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is weirdly bad. It's boring most of the time until the last 10 minutes, and you'd have to have a lot of patience to watch it for that long.Also, the "scary" parts are when the characters see some random item and freak out. The sound effects are gay and the acting for all of them sucked. I'm not sure how they made Sadako move towards the guy person (I don't get Japanese names), but that part was definitely creepier than the same part in "The Ring". But overall, "The Ring" is a much better movie and really keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. "The Ring 2" isn't as good as the first, but you should still see it.I personally don't know how they based "The Ring" on "Ringu". Don't watch this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the hype I'd heard about this film it was a great disappointment. I thought that watching the Japanese original might be better than the Hollywood remake (as they often destroy classics) but there was very little suspense, in fact there was only one bit which was remotely spooky. The story was slow and plodding and the Japanese style added nothing. The initial premise seems promising but was implemented as only a moderately interesting plot, nothing more. The characters were rather cardboard and even at the end of the film I didn't really care if they all got toasted or not. I don't know if I was meant to be scared to death or just bored to death?! Perhaps oddly, I found myself having a lot of sympathy with the 'monster'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RING (Ringu) Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Dolby StereoA TV journalist (Nanako Matsushima) joins forces with her ex-husband (Hiroyuki Sanada) to trace the source of a strange videotape which brings death to anyone who watches it...Hugely successful on its home turf, Hideo Nakata's cult favorite (based on a novel by Kôji Suzuki) ignited a worldwide interest in supernatural horror movies (consolidated a year later by the international success of THE SIXTH SENSE) and spawned a wave of sequels and spin-offs, many of which have since been optioned and/or remade by US studios. On its own terms, however, RING is a huge disappointment. Things get off to a bad start with the opening teaser, a slow-burning 'scare' scene which builds toward nothing more than a lacklustre freeze-frame, ruining the intended effect, and the subsequent narrative relies too heavily on mood to be truly effective. Nakata generates tension through a gradual accumulation of details, as Matsushima and Sanada follow a series of clues to a remote island where they uncover the identity of a 'character' in the cursed video, whose restless spirit seeks vengeance for a past transgression. The movie closes on a scene of stunning, visceral horror (impressionable viewers are warned that this sequence is *profoundly* frightening), but it's the only highlight of an otherwise mediocre movie. Nakata has since built a career on such material (CHAOS, DARK WATER, etc.). Followed by RING 2 (1999) and the tangentially-related THE SPIRAL (1998).(Japanese dialogue)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard that this was the film that saved modern horror, and for years I have wanted to see it. Even after the American version (THE RING) came along I put that one off, because I was very adamant about seeing the Asian version FIRST. My friend owns both versions on DVD, and he and a few others said the American one was superior, but I decided to do this "right". So I went with RINGU.Point is, RINGU was quite a letdown for me. I really hope the U.S. one is better like I've (mostly) heard. I always love a modern horror movie that takes itself seriously and this one surely does, but it's also very uneventful and talky, even for me. Furthermore, I just didn't think it made much sense even though I could see there was a VERY intriguing premise lurking in there somewhere.I just didn't understand how these two people were able to unravel this "mystery" and how all the pieces fell so easily into place. And when you start to count the seconds on the DVD counter, that's not a good sign. Things perked up a little at the end, including the chilling demise of the hero... but this film failed to impress me overall. I will be checking out the American Version in the weeks ahead, so I'll give that one a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ringu has inspired sequels and threequels in Hollywood cinema and horror films of the same element in Asian cinema. I can only assume American remade this version (though I haven't seen it yet) to make it better because and I know I'm the minority looking at the audience reviews on this website but I thought this was awful. It was all in Japanese though that didn't bother me as I thought the acting was pretty good, the idea of the story with the videotape where if you watch it you receive a phone call saying you will die in a week unless you pass a copy onto someone else is interesting and the music was creepy. The atmosphere I could tell the director was trying to create suspense and scare but it just didn't. It was more like a murder mystery than a horror but even then it wasn't interesting and why wouldn't the characters just destroy the damn videotape? They don't even discuss it which makes this film and them dumb. Nothing really remotely creepy or scary happens and as a result I just got bored out of my mind. This is one "horror" film I won't be losing any sleep over. I found Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire more scary than this rubbish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And depends on the point of view , and of the preferences of the person perceiving or experiencing something, and is questionable in terms of validity, blah, blah, blah ... and IMDb reviews are an excellent example . RINGU got some great reviews . Great plot, suspense , atmosphere, scary , made me wet my pants , blah blah blah again ... OK , we're all entitled to have an opinion. So, here is mine opinion about having these opinions about ANY horror movie in general - and later on about the infamous RINGU .To all the good people who either claim that this movie is full or devoid of suspense and cite this as an advantage or disadvantage : it's neither , actually. Or both - it's relative . Horror is not just suspense , there are different types of horror : the horror of being tortured , the horror of going crazy , the horror of watching your daughter being raped and so on . Therefore , there are different types of horror movies , and to expect all of them to conform to what you like is not realistic . I found RINGU almost devoid of any suspense , except for the first 20 minutes or so , and even that was partially because of everything I heard about it before ( that it's VEEEEERY scary ) . But that's not the problem .Some say the story is good . OK . What story ? That ancient cliché about curse , ghost and a video cassette mambo - jumbo that reminds me of childish threats scribbled ( and in the era of e -mail , typed ) in chain letters ? If you don't pass it someone else , you'll die ? No kidding . Now I'm terrified . And amazed at the originality of this idea to cash in on a million - times - seen - and - used concept . OK , nothing new can be invented in 21st century , but at least you can come up with some relatively fresh combination of old elements. Or maybe not .What is scary is subjective . Someone is afraid of spiders - someone is not . I wasn't afraid of RINGU. Mildly creepy at the beginning - expectations - but nevertheless , for the most part not interesting.For me , the worst thing about this movie is the fashion in horror genre it spawned : that video cassette from the RINGU is getting distributed alright, but in the real world. Horror movies are plagued with repetition. THAT is curse .2 out of 10 .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly have to say that I wasn't very much impressed by Ringu and that I expected more...but I have to blame myself for that. I saw the American remake first, and I have to say they did a good job by that for once. You're more involved in the Gore Verbinski version and there's a lot more feeling with the characters. But I do reckon that this Japanese version deserves all the respect and the praising for its originality ! Especially the last 5 years, there are some clever minds active in Japanese cinema. They breath the fresh air that the genre of horror desperately needed. The story of Ringu is fascinating, frightening and intense... The story about the mysterious videotape and its origin keeps you close to the screen for a good half an hour and you find yourself investigating along with the main characters. A good suspense film should have that effect, so in that point of view, Ringu certainly succeeded. I can't judge Japanese actors very well, but I guess they did a good job...They always look a bit less dedicated than American actors in my eyes but maybe that's just me. The female leads sure looks good enough to me.According to many opinions, Ringu belongs to the greatest horror / thrillers ever made and certainly the best film in this genre in the last ten years. Well, with all do respect, I wouldn't go so far to call it that. Like I said, I praise its originality and ideas but that's it. You should see it, though. And if it's possible, see it before the American remake from 2002. Otherwise you'll be thinking stuff like " what's all the hype about ??"Please check my comment on Gore Verbinski's "The Ring" for a deeper going comparison...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thing is i don't know what everyone are talking about or the reviewers who gave this movie at least good have only watched Japanese movies and no others. The Ring US remake is far better then this original version and no offense i'm Asian and i don't think japan makes any good movies that i can remember. They have good ideas and stories but are poorly executed. Their movies are generally draggy and not entertaining at all.Ringu was very boring and i wasn't even scared at all. Hideo Nakata is no way near gore verbinski as proved when he did US the Ring 2 remake. THat was terrible compare to the Ring.My advice is don't bother with any other Ring movies except for the Ring US remake. The first one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a boring movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching The Ring with my girlfriend and I think she's a bit upset with me for coming up with this movie. The movie starts slow and low and from there on crawls slowly down the slope. Confused story, with the guy getting ideas without us seeing where he gets them from, just to push the movie onwards, I guess the story writer didn't have any ideas.There was also hardly any suspense, and no I am not looking for gore stuff either, but there were only 3 or 4 minutes that were a bit interesting. I really don't see why people rate this movie so high. Go out and watch the sunset, that's way more exciting!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"ringu" is, at best, boring. just plain boring.from what i heard, and since i loved the American remake, i had to watch "ringu". what a waste of my time. i mean... people say that, in comparison, ringu is better than the remake. don't make me laugh, please. the remake has better acting, directing, casting... and it creeped me out! for ringu... i fell asleep watching it.... 3/10, don't give 1 because it was the film who inspired "the ring". trust me, don't waste your time. if you want j-horror, see "shutter" or "a missed call", instead of this.what a disappointment</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ringu" is a good and original movie. The story is really good and creepy. The storytelling of the movie is even better, which makes this movie not just a good horror movie but also a good character movie.The movie doesn't really has 'scare' moments and perhaps because of this it has some missed opportunities in it but instead the movie has a creepy feeling and atmosphere throughout the movie, which compensates for this. Also the mysterious story adds to the tension and atmosphere of the movie.The acting isn't exactly mind blowing but it never really becomes disturbingly bad.It's too bad that the movie has some cheap looking effects, with a bigger budget this movie could had really become an even better one.And then the eternal question which movie is the better one; "Ringu" or "The Ring". The answer is quite easy, whatever movie you've seen first will be your favorite. Both movies have their own charm and different good things and less successful elements. From a movie technical point of view "The Ring" is however a better movie. It has an overall better look and has way better special effects and make-up.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant, gripping &amp; absorbing creepy horror film that relies on good storytelling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ringu starts with a young Japanese girl named Tomoko (Yuko Takeuchi) &amp; her friend telling each other scary stories about a people dying exactly one week after watching a mysterious videotape. Tomoko claims that she has seen the video in question, precisely a week ago. Before the night is over Tomoko is dead. Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) is a typical nosey reporter trying to find a good story when she becomes involved in Tomoko's mysterious death. Reiko decides to investigate the story deeper &amp; after some detective work finds the videotape. Reiko makes the mistake of watching the tape, moments after it's over the phone rings. Reiko is cursed &amp; has seven days to try &amp; save herself which becomes even more desperate when her young son Yoichi (Rikiya Otaka) also watches the tape. Together with her ex-husband &amp; Yoichi's Father Ryuji Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada) she tries to solve the clues &amp; lift the curse that will it seems, inevitability lead to her death!Directed by Hideo Nakata I thought Ringu was an excellent horror film. The script by Hiroshi Takahashi based on the novels by Koji Suzuki is gripping throughout. Not much on screen action takes place, there is no blood or gore, but I was absolutely glued to my seat! The story is both fascinating &amp; absorbing from beginning to end. Director Nakata creates some truly creepy &amp; chilling moments throughout, you would never think something as simple as a phone ringing could be unnerving! The power of the film lies in the story which is revealed as the film progresses, make sure you go into Ringu knowing as little about it as possible. Ringu has a very unfussy, almost documentary look to the photography &amp; production design. Don't expect any flashy camera tricks or expensive overblown sets. This approach, keeping it in the 'real' world, works brilliantly &amp; makes Ringu even more creepy. Everything about this film just works, the only reservation I have is that the final revelation isn't quite as drastic as I'd like &amp; Ringu has no re-watch value whatsoever as once you know how it ends the film will lose two of the things that makes it so great, unpredictability &amp; originality. Oh, and don't be put off by the fact that this is a Japanese film &amp; has subtitles, Ringu is an extremely rewarding film to watch. See it as soon as you can!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent but inferior film to Verbinski's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first became enraptured by The Ring, I wanted to know everything about it. I wanted to know it's origins, I wanted to know how it came to fruition, I wanted to know everything. So I began looking for the Japanese version at local Japanese video stores. None of them had it. And then I found out that Dreamworks had bought the rights to this version as well and weren't releasing it until they put their version on video and DVD. So off to the Internet I went where I finally found someone who had all three films on DVD. So I bought Ringu, Ringu 2 and the prequel on DVD from some guy in Texas for a small sum of about $100.00 U.S. I didn't care, I had to see the film and find out if all the hype is as justified.Now keep in mind, I not only hold The Ring in such lofty enough company as to say it is one of the best horror films every made, I hold it high enough to say that it is one of the best films ever made. So for me to like the Japanese version is a feat unto itself. Having said that, I will say that although Ringu is a good film, it pales in comparison to the better Hollywood effort. While it is a good film in it's own right, there is no comparing the raw emotion and primal fear that is invoked in you when viewing The Ring. But this is not a comparison piece, it should be a review unto itself so let's go forward shall we?Ringu shares the same basic premise as The Ring does. A reporter is investigating a videotape that apparently gives you one week to live after your view it. After her niece dies ostensibly from viewing the tape, she and her husband investigate it frame by frame and try to dissect the mystery.There is an element of supernatural forces in this film and Sadako, the young girl, is rumoured to have psychic and telekinetic abilities of some sort. This adds a different dimension to the film and it also makes the viewer a little uneasy, not knowing what could possibly happen next. What bothered me about the film, and perhaps why I didn't enjoy it or like it nearly as much as the American version is there is too much talk and not enough horror. The story builds, and builds and then there is no real pay off the way there was in the other version. Sure, Sadako does her thing with the TV and that must have scared the crap out of everyone when they first saw the film but there is just very little to be frightened about beyond that one scene. Many accuse Hollywood of bastardizing films that they get a hold of but it is not true in this case. Hollywood has spiced up a rather bland film given it life in every way possible. While The Ring is one of the scariest films I have ever seen, Ringu is good, but just not great. While not a nostrum the way many other horror films appear to be, it is also not the great horror film that many pimped it up to be. If you want to be scared and tense and on edge, watch Verbinski's version. If you want to see the roots of where the idea came from see this one. It's not a bad film, it's just not a great one either.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Frightening as a "Scooby Doo" episode!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever finds "The Ring" (or "Ringu") scary obviously has NEVER seen a horror film before. The average made for TV thriller that runs on the Lifetime channel is more suspenseful than this. I LOVE horror films &amp; I scare easily, but there is just nothing to this. I thought perhaps I saw an edited DVD version but friends who are fans swear that what I saw is the directors cut. Sorry but there's just nothing even remotely scary, suspenseful, creepy or atmospheric about this film. The cinematography &amp; editing are amateur &amp; the music &amp; sound effects are straight out of a Charles Band/Full Moon cheapie circa 1989. Mabey the American remake is better but I doubt it since the basic story is not only dopey but has been done before with better results ("Videodrome" &amp; "Shock"). Don't believe the hype like I did &amp; spend a lot of time hunting this down. If you think that "Poltergeist" is the scariest horror film ever then perhaps this is for you. If you have actually seen a good horror film before--like "Carnival of Souls", "Texas Chaninsaw Massacre", "Frailty", "Silence of the Lambs", Halloween","Exorcist", "Re-animator", the "Evil Dead" series or "Dagon"--then don't waste your time or money on this lightweight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hype, hype, hype. For the first 45 minutes, my girlfriend and I were at the edges of our seats, waiting to be terrified. The rave reviews, online discussion forums, comparisons to legendary films - events conspired against "Ring", building up our expectations to the nth degree. All we got was a good laugh, and a sese of relief that it was actually a DVD I borrowed from a friend rather than forked out any money for.And don't get me wrong. I am a huge fan of the understated, the slow build-ups of those greater films that this tripe has been unjustly compared to. But this is just silly. The logical lapses, the poorly drawn characters, the non-sensical "storyline" - a true shame, since I suspect that the actual story itself could have ben converted into a really good movie.But seriously: don't see it. Life is too short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From all the hype that I've heard about Ringu I thought it was going to be an amazing movie. When I actually saw it I was glad I hadn't paid to buy an import of the movie because it was horrible. The tape is very tame compared to the American version as is the rest of the movie. It wasn't much of a horror movie in my opinion. For example: the faces made when the people died by seeing the girl were just stupid and made me laugh. The plot is basically the same as the American version but a lot is insinuated in the Japanese version and the result is there is less of a puzzle for the viewers to think about. I couldn't wait for this movie to end! A 1 in my book. (Would have given it less but couldn't.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ringu (1998) *** (out of 4) I had previously seen the American version so I wasn't sure if that would hurt this viewing or not but it didn't. I can't really say which version I enjoyed more because I thought both worked perfectly well for the horror genre. I'd say this one here featured better direction and performances. I thought the two lead performers here gave really good performances as well. What I find most different in these Japanese and their American remakes is that the foreign films go for a calmer scare factor. It seems the American version of this and Ju-On: The Grudge went for a lot of scares by using loud sound effects that would make anyone jump. It seems the American films go for a money shot while the Japanese films go for a slower scare factor. It doesn't really feel like the film is working but then you notice that you're all curled up on the couch totally caught up in the film. I thought the ending here in the well worked incredibly well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It`s Very Difficult To Comment On This ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.... simply because I saw the Hollywood version a couple of weeks ago and it`s still fresh in my mind . I hadn`t noticed this until I saw RINGU but what director Gore Verbinski and screenwriter Ethren Kruger have done with the remake is copy it almost scene for scene and in the process made a bit of mess with it . The original as expected is superior simply because the ending is explained clearly just by a simple line of dialouge that clears everything up .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should say firstly that I saw the Hollywood remake and was pretty freaked out by it, so I had no idea what I would think of the original Japanese version. Basically after the death of her cousin Tomoko Oishi (Yuko Takeuchi), reporter Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) hears stories of a "cursed" video tape that will kill anyone who watches it in seven days. It is when she finds it and watches it herself that she really believes she will suffer the same fate as many others. So with the help of her ex-husband Ryuji Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada) she is following all he clues to investigate where and how the video was made, to save not only herself, but her son Yoichi Asakawa (Rikiya Otaka) who watched it too. Of course, Reiko does save herself, but Ryuji suffers his fate when they long-haired monster girl with no fingernails from the well comes towards the television screen, climbs out, and kills him just from sight. In the end, Reiko knows the only way to save everybody's life is to show people who have already seen the video the copy, or something like that. Also starring Miki Nakatani as Mai Takano, Hitomi Sato as Masami Kurahashi, Yoichi Numata as Takashi Yamamura, Yutaka Matsushige as Yoshino, Katsumi Muramatsu as Koichi Asakawa, Rie Inou as Sadako Yamamura and Masako as Shizuko Yamamura. I admit I did know most of what was going to happen, but obviously it isn't exactly the same, and it is much more interesting to see the original. It was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not bad but the American version is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I RARELY prefer remakes and usually prefer Japanese movies over most Hollywood pictures, this original was only a slightly better than average horror-suspense movie. The problem was that although the basis for a good movie was indeed there, so often there were lulls in the picture and this was not as big an issue in the remake. However, the acting was pretty good and the story was rather original, so I applaud the movie because of these factors.By the way, one important difference between the pictures is that in the Japanese version, the single mom often leaves her 6 year-old home alone for long, long periods of time. In the US, she would have been arrested on child neglect charges had she been caught!</fullReview>
