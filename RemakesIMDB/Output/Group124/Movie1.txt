		<shortDescription>This remake is largely inoffensive - which is probably its biggest problem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has been running out of ideas for years ? remakes, sequels, prequels and reboots now seem to be the order of the day. What's hard to imagine is why anyone thought a remake of Endless Love was necessary in the first place. The 1981 film of the same name ? based on a pulpy, albeit well-regarded, novel by Scott Spencer ? wasn't even that good to begin with. At least that version of the story had the distinction of starring a young, nubile Brooke Shields, not to mention a title song that became more famous than the movie itself. This remake manages to be both extremely bland and painfully melodramatic, bled of almost any hint of controversy or genuine complexity and darkness.Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) is the quintessential poor little rich girl: a beautiful, blonde ice princess who has shut herself in with her parents, Hugh (Bruce Greenwood) and Anne (Joely Richardson), after the untimely death of her brother Chris. David (Alex Pettyfer) is a kid from the poorer side of town who has nursed a crush on her throughout high school. She's college-bound, he just wants to work in his dad's (Robert Patrick) workshop. When they finally connect, sparks fly and Jade starts to re-think the safe, perfect future she's planned with Hugh.It's all very cookie-cutter high-school romantic melodrama. Nothing about this film feels particularly fresh or smart, although it does start out a little better than you'd expect. But, after the initial meet-cute between Jade and a thoroughly smitten David, Endless Love quickly descends into trashy predictability: Hugh does everything within his power to get rid of David, but the spark of love and lust between the star-crossed couple burns so hot and bright that nothing will stand in their way.What's frustrating is that the film has almost completely excised anything even remotely complex about its plot and characters. The 1981 movie may have been faintly terrible and soapy, but it at least made a stab at psychological darkness, suggesting that the 'endless love' of the title bordered more on creepy, damaging obsession than sweet, romantic love. There's no such suggestion here: David is troubled but ultimately noble; Jade is purely, truly in love; and it's the curmudgeonly Hugh who must realise the errors of his ways.The cast is watchable but not really memorable. Pettyfer broods as if he knows he's meant for better things. Wilde is effortlessly, often stunningly beautiful, but doesn't have much to offer beyond that. Greenwood has the most scenery to chew ? he practically twirls an invisible moustache and cackles at some points ? but it's Richardson who walks away with the film's few affecting moments (even though her character loses much of its shock value in morphing into the archetypal loyal, loving housewife).You would imagine that, in a cinematic landscape overrun by remakes, these films would ? at the minimum ? have something interesting to say about the times in which we live now. They can make a case for their existence, perhaps, by being a little edgier than the original films: explaining why there's a need to tell this old story again. Endless Love doesn't really manage that. Instead, by forgoing depth and darkness for schmaltz and sentiment, it ends up being even safer and sweeter than a movie shot over thirty years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for what it was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is basically a good romantic movie. If you are hoping for more depth, more story or more anything you will be disappointed. But for what it was, I enjoyed it.The acting was solid, I really liked Gabriella Wildes performance. She was fresh faced and innocent. I was really not interested in Alex Pettyfer's performance prior to watching it, but he proved me wrong and was believable and you found yourself with a vested interest in their relationship.If you are after an escape into a good romantic movie, I think this one is worth the effort...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, Cute Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I actually liked this movie, regardless of the annoying people sitting behind me laughing the entire movie and the people sitting beside me who were crying the whole entire time for god knows what reason. This movie was not a serious movie, but one of puppy love. Its similar to movies such as The Last Song, Letters to Juliet, Dear John, the Vow and the Lucky One. While these movies aren't all that serious and have a lot of depth, they're a good light happy movie that you'll walk away feeling happy from. I actually thought the acting was very good, and the movie was actually pleasant, and something I would definitely see again. I mean what do people expect when they go to watch a movie called 'Endless Love', honestly of course its going to be a cheesy love story about a girl and a guy falling in love. I mean thats what the whole story is about, so if you don't like a good old fashioned love story than this isn't for you. I will say that it is more of a girls type of movie than a guys movie, but thats not to say that a guy would not like it to. I rate this movie about a 7/10. It is a good movie, not great, but it is a cute love story that was a good pick for me and my girlfriends to see on valentines Day. Happy Watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though "Endless Love" feels like a rehash of "The Notebook" (as if one were needed), it's actually a remake of a long-forgotten film from 1980, starring Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt, based on the novel by Scott Spencer. In fact, if that film is remembered at all, it's probably as much for the drippy, inexplicably popular title song (sung by Diana Ross and Lionel Ritchie) as for the movie itself (it also marked the screen debut of Tom Cruise, which gives it some historical significance).This is another of those dime-a-dozen romances between two kids from opposite sides of the tracks (as always, the adolescents are portrayed by actors long out of their teens). Jade is a poor-little-rich-kid who's just graduated high school and is about to embark on a promising career in medicine. David, on the other hand, is all ready to set up life as a mechanic in his dad's garage. The movie has to find a way to explain how the beautiful Jade, who would clearly be the most popular girl in any high school in the United States, just happens to be the least popular girl at this one. Turns out Jade's brother died of cancer a few years back and she's been isolating with her family ever since. "Endless Love" lines up its cast of stereotypes in dutiful fashion: the snooty rich folk, the jealous exes, the super-supportive mother and brother, the wisecracking sidekick, and the over-protective, elitist dad who fairly drips with disdain for the lower social orders, of whom David is a prime example, and who will stop at nothing to keep such a boy from marrying his daughter.Jade is such a dreamy-eyed dolt and David such a paragon of dime-novel romance that it becomes impossible for us to identify with either one of them as actual people. Even David's allegedly troubled background seems gussied-up and phony, a bit of back story tacked on to make him more relatable to the audience. It doesn't work. Riddled with cheesy dialogue and ridiculous plot points, especially in the melodramatic finale, this sappy, white-bread take on "Romeo and Juliet" (minus the poetry, of course) scrapes the bottom of the barrel as far as recent movie romances go. Though, come to think of it, at least they dropped that dreadful song. That's at least one point in the movie's favor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you remember "Safe Haven"? Yeah, that soppy romantic drama last year that ended with (SPOILER ALERT if anyone cares) Robin Scherbatsky's character being a ghost that wanted her former husband to find true love again.Safe Haven is several times better than Endless Love, and I hated Safe Haven.Endless Love is a movie so mind-bogglingly inept, so blissfully unaware, so morally empty, and so raucously confident that if it (God forbid) took the form of a human being, you would alternately want to weep for her, educate her, and bash in her skull with a bowling ball. This movie takes place in a world that is structurally unsound and is populated with aggressively stupid characters whose actions are unjustifiably opposed to sound logic and good morals. Yes, Endless Love is a film aimed at a very particular target audience with a very specific goal in mind, and therefore its flaws mean little to the filmmakers or to the numerous squealing 13-15 year old girls at my showing. However, that does not excuse it from following film rules that, when broken, force a viewer out of the entertainment experience and instead force them to put their head in their hands in disgust.1. You need a strong lead character. Jade Butterfield is the opposite of a strong lead character. She is a selfish, spoiled, and ignorant 17-year-old who falls head-over-heals for a stranger and then proceeds to give up everything (from body to future) to this reckless young man whose first impression on her is taking a client's car for a joyride and then assaulting the man. She treats her father awfully even before he turns into a dominating jerk and she says stupid things like, "Let's be young and dumb" and "I want to go sneak into a zoo and get high with people I don't know and I demand you go with me!" Okay, maybe I stretched that last one. Also, don't even try to consider the boyfriend as the main character: he is two-dimensional, un-complex, artificially constructed and a poor excuse for a human being, whose purpose is to make the target audience swoon and be severely disappointed with real men.2. You need convincing conflict. Jade's father is not convincing conflict. He seems like a genuinely good father whose good character traits seem to reflect his inner love nature and his negative traits are unconvincing and contrived in every sense. This is especially displayed in his affair, the provocation scene against Jade's lover, and the scene where he almost beats said lover with a baseball bat. These scenes are in direct contrast to scenes that describe a man who left his job to support his dying son, who constantly wants to help his daughter succeed, and is wary of a violent young man who hides with his daughter in closets during parties. To any logical viewer, it is much easier to side with a hurt father figure who only wants a bright future for his children (as opposed to a mother who only wants her children to find "true love" and to get "good at getting their hearts broken") and not a mindless 17-year-old caught up in a week-old infatuation and who is insisting that she found the love of her life. And don't even get me started on the living son and his girlfriend, whose characters are entirely irrelevant and whose sole purpose seems to be to force the audience to believe the dad is the bad guy.3. In a romance aimed at tweens and teens, you need some underlying morality or a subtle message to "do what is right". This movie knows what is right and what is smart, identifies it, and then promptly laughs in its face and grinds it into the dirt. It is NOT okay for a young girl to ignore the violent tendencies of her boyfriend before intending to give up her life for him. It is NOT okay for a mother to be jealous of the "love" between 2 teenagers that just met and be upset with the father when attempts to break it off. It is NOT okay to steal people's cars because they are jerks towards you. It is NOT okay to sneak into people's houses that don't like you and have sex with someone you hardly know. It is NOT okay to say "screw you" to internships and opportunities you have committed to when teenage love shows up: that's not how life works. It is NOT okay to say it is more important to seek out a lover before deciding what to do with your life. It is NOT okay to smoke weed in the elephant's exhibit. It is NOT okay to make out with an old boyfriend while you are in a relationship and then promise to run away to the other side of the world in the middle of college, with no money or plans or future. None of what this movies says is okay, is okay. There was so much wrong with Endless Love, but my space is quite limited so I touched upon my biggest gripes. As a college student soon to be engaged, this type of movie should appeal to my inner romantic at least on some primal level and instead, both my girlfriend and I left this movie embarrassed to have spent money in this film and laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of the film's messages and characters. As my girlfriend said, "I have never enjoyed the trailers before the movie more than I enjoyed the movie until I saw Endless Love". As a postscript: dear filmmakers, teenagers coming from a party that just got busted by the cops aren't going to go to a new party with adults and then play games that involve choreography and a boombox and then go home nicely when told to by the adults. Nice try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utter Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was one of the most disappointing I have seen in a long time. The plot is predictable, the characters the same washed-out figures from movies past, and the message is unrealistic and ridiculous. The movie itself contains a predictable array of Hollywood dramatics, ranging from a car crash and subsequent hospital visit, to a raging house fire to complete the "climactic" ending. The characters are disastrous- Jade simply a pretty face with little emotional depth and David a clichéd young man trying to escape from a dark past. The plot is a series of ludicrous, unrealistic twists and turns designed to pull at the emotions, which only made me laugh at how absurd the entire thing was. A complete waste of time &amp; money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To my surprise I actually really enjoyed this movie. I wasn't sure with all the P-G 13 romantic movies, I figured nothing would make this stand out and it would be another typical teenage romance.I was pleasantly surprised with the film and though it may be a bit clichéd, I was captivated by the tender acting of Gabrielle Wilde.The character of the tough, stubborn father of Gabrielle brings to perspective the reality of needing to let go of the past in order to allow in good of the present.There's really not much more to say. This film isn't very deep, or original, but it was nice to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the updating, this story is still dated. The disapproving father thing is just too clichéd. At least the story in this 2014 version isn't as depressing as the Brooke Shields version (for those who can remember) which was famous for the Diana Ross / Lionel Richie theme song.The predominantly British cast isn't quite right for the movie. Alex Pettyfer looks too old and rather slimy with his slick hair for the role. He has a 20 something playboy look that isn't right for a high school kid. Gabriella Wilde isn't a terribly expressive or convincing actress. She doesn't act in love. Brooke Shields did a better job.It's not even as good as an inferior Nicholas Sparks movie. This one is totally optional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film deserves no love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a decent range when it comes to film viewing, but I don't enjoy romance. Firstly, they're unrealistic and secondly, you can usually tell what will happen. So, Endless Love is a love story. Cue alarm bells. But it gets worse. The awful trailer makes it look like just another bland love story. Except it's not. This is a romance between Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde. Think of that and tremble. There are 2 big questions here: 1. The original Endless Love movie was apparently awful, so why remake it? 2. How can a film be called Endless Love, consist primarily of its 2 leads gazing into each other's eyes, be full of romantic montages and love scenes and have a script which is overloaded with romantic sayings yet feel less romantic, moving and emotional than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? To be fair, it is what you'd expect from a film like this and there is a bit of humour which is appreciated but aside from that this is a two dimensional and aggressively bland movie that is one of the worst in a strong year for films.The acting is laughably bad from the 2 leads. Alex Pettyfer is that bland kid who made Alex Rider (The super cool boy spy from the Alex Rider books) as bland as a shopping mannequin. Gabriella Wilde is that model who murdered the character of Sue Snell in last year's Carrie remake. Together, they have no chemistry and no emotional investment whatsoever. The direction is utterly nauseating as the film plays like an extended romantic music video and the script is utterly devoid of any kind of spark or charisma. Endless Love will appeal to its audience, but it is one of the blandest movies in recent memory and so full of clichés (I feel like I've seen all these things hundreds of times before and I don't watch this kind of film a lot) you'll forget in 24 hours. To add insult to injury, they actually put family issues and bereavement drama into this pathetic love story which feels out of place and irritating. Endless Love is so boring it passes too quickly to do any real harm, but you've seen the whole film just by watching the trailer.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is like sugar-free cake, the knock-off just isn't as good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that a small part of me is rating this movie poorly because I am not part of the target audience. But another reason is that the teen love stories from my adolescent years were way more intriguing. Movies like: A Walk to Remember, 10 Things I Hate About You, and even Cruel Intentions, were far more intense, had better dialogue, and were more memorable. It would be impractical for me to rate this flop higher than those prototypes. Also, no one can film a successful romance without chemistry between the lead actors. The female lead was bland! Clearly the director ignored her lack of expression for the sake of her pretty nose and lips. The male lead only had one expression, confusion. Even when he smiled, it seemed like he didn't get the joke. At one point, he knelt down to look at a fleck of dust when he was supposed to be distressed! The rest of the cast shouldn't have to carry the film because Juliet is monotonous and Romeo's open mouth is drooling. Anyway, who am I kidding? I guess the dull girl is supposed to end up with the confused guy; but my glass ball tells me they have some quiet dinner tables in their future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is unpredictable and then life will turn upside down when you meet you the right person and will feel like staying in safe haven with the person closest to you. Endless Drama is romantic?drama that has strong performances but is mowed by a weak script.Endless Love tells the story of a high-society yet shy and introvert girl who falls in love with charismatic boy who works in a garage with his father. The journey of their love begins but faces hurdles in form of their parents who disapproves of their relationship. Endless Love has everything going in its favor - enchanting chemistry between the screen couple, nice background score , beautiful location. However the fairy tale does not last long with never ending drama towards the climax and is saddened by a weak script which makes the movie a one-time watch. Alex Pettyfer gives a fine performance and giving admirable performance with each film. Gabriella Wilde is eye- candy but needs to have better expression. Bruce Greenwood, Robert Patrick are usual dependent.So, if you are looking for a nice romantic date with your partner, you might choose Endless Love for a perfect evening. Decent 2.75/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A more 'cheery' teen-friendly re-make of the 1981 Brooke Shields movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We watched the DVD from our public library. For comparison I re-watched the 1981 version of the same name and based (loosely) on the same book. Although the very basic premise of teens in love and a dad that will do almost anything to keep them apart is the same in both, each is developed quite differently and have quite different endings. The former one is darker, this one is more teen-friendly and has a more cheerful ending. It is interesting that British actors play 3 of the 4 key roles, as Americans, and they do such a good job with their "American" accents that it is never a distraction. But after the movie, when I looked them up, the boy is almost exactly 1 year younger than the girl, although he seemed to be 6 or 8 years older. Alex Pettyfer, about 23 during filming is the boy, David Elliot and Gabriella Wilde, about 24 during filming, is Jade Butterfield. Both are seniors in this Atlanta area school, but didn't really know each other with graduation day at hand. In this version Jade's brother had died a few years earlier and in her funk had pretty well stayed away from all teen activities and had essentially no friends, But she was a superior student bound for Brown University and medical school, to follow in the footsteps of her dad.David, in contrast, worked for his dad as a mechanic, seemed to like that, and had no plans to go to college. So when he and Jade became quick friends and seemed headed for more, the rude dad began to plant the seed that he was not worthy of someone like his daughter.Bruce Greenwood is an excellent villain as the doctor dad Hugh Butterfield, haunted by his own demons as he failed to save their sick and dying son. As a result he became overprotective and controlling, and couldn't deal with his daughter now getting a mind of her own.The mom is played sort of like Jade's mom in the 1981 version, happy to see that her daughter was breaking out of her funk and especially finding young love. She is played well by Joely Richardson as Anne Butterfield. Old faithful Robert Patrick is David's single dad, Harry Elliot.Jade is of course a bit older and quite different from the 1981 Jade, but still a young girl in love. David here is played quite different, as a nice, helpful, well-adjusted young man. In the end it is he who comforts Jade's dad who finally realized all his sins telling him it isn't too late to get things better.We enjoyed it as a "popcorn" movie, in spite of the fairly adult themes my wife and I both thought it was made for a teen audience. The actors are good-looking and the story has an upbeat, hopeful ending. After all, the title isn't "Endless Love" for no reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for a good romance movie. But man, this movie was just awful, to say the least. There was literally no romance between the two characters. Just mindless teenage sex. This movie is about two horny kids in high school who screw each other after they just met. There was no love, at all. She gave him her virginity on the first date. It just all happened so fast. People in the theater were like "wtf?". That was an extremely uncomfortable scene in the movie. It felt so wrong just watching it. But, if you're a pervert and not into romance, this movie is perfect for you.This is the entire movie: Him: Hi. Her: Hi. Her: Let's have sex. Him: Okay.The end. Fin.There was also a whole bunch of pointless drama between The father of the girl (Jade) and her one night stand. I mean, "lover". I don't know what to call him. I mean they weren't even dating.Towards the end of the movie, the father got a restraining order on the guy (David) so they can't see each other anymore and Jade went off to college and got a new boyfriend. David stayed in their home town and screwed his ex girlfriend while Jade was at college. Isn't that romantic? Yeah, I didn't so. So much for "love". Anyways, at the end of the movie, Jade comes home from college and David goes to the airport to see her and they meet in the middle of the airport. Then, she cheated on her boyfriend from collage and made out with David whom deflowered her.This movie teaches girls to have no morals, boundaries or standards. The movie made cheating seem okay and that losing your virginity to the first guy that gives you the time of day is normal.Aside of the lack of romance and terrible message, this movie was far too cliché. They meet each other with the obvious scene where the girl drops a book, the guy picks it up and they look into each other's eyes. Yeah, like I haven't seen THAT done before. There was no originality. There were no surprises. I predicted what was going to happen before it happened because it was too obvious. People in the theater couldn't even take this movie seriously. I heard people laughing at scenes that were supposed to be serious and dramatic. I suppose they were laughing at the stupidity of the film. This movie should be in the comedy category.The only positive side to this movie is Dayo Okeniyi's character cracking a couple jokes through out the film. He literally made this movie. He's the only reason I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1.I absolutely would not recommend this film to an intelligent friend. However, I would recommend this to someone with a low IQ score. Those seem to be the only people who actually liked this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: Endless Love (2014)/ www.nightfilmreviews.com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love lost and love found are some of the most rewarding narratives we have ever seen on the big screen. In David Elliot's (Alex Pettyfer) case, love lost, as his therapist tells him, is "like a book you read long ago", and those words could not be more true for Endless Love. Aside from being a remake of Brooke Sheilds' 1981 film of the same name, the film is also an exercise to see how Shakespeare's famous tragedy, written almost 420 years ago, could be modernized, interpreted and adapted for a Pinterest-driven, Instagram-obsessed generation of young people. But like the amaro, hudson and mayfair filters featured on the highly addictive mobile app, Endless Love is a sun kissed love story told through the lens of a writer/director that is beautiful to look at, and understands what it's audience wants, especially during one of the most forcefully romantic times of the year. No movie released on or around Valentine's Day should be judged on originality, because like the holiday itself, there is nothing original about roses, chocolates, and forced sentiment that is the driving force flooding people's minds. Instead, writer/director Shana Feste delivers an entertaining, nicely shot film of first love with many of the essential ingredients to make it a success amongst young people.One minute, hopping along the roofs of cars, the other, kissing the girl of your dreams, Endless Love is a soft and safe story of two lovers who find themselves on opposite ends of the tracks of life. David, who has been in love with Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) since tenth grade, uses their high school graduation as a chance to finally connect with her. The wonderfully innocent and vibrantly blonde Jade, who has spent the last two years of high school mourning the death of her older brother Chris Butterfield (Patrick Johnson), decides to spend most of her free time submerged in literature and within the tall gates of her family's large estate. Grieving from the loss of their child, Hugh and Anne Butterfield (Bruce Greenwood and Joely Richardson) are content with having their two remaining children sheltered at home. It isn't until Jade's graduation that the lives of the Butterfield's are completely sent topsy-turvy by David, a smart and sophisticated young man whose main concerns are his father and his attainment of true love.The 1981 version of the film is a dark and often times melodramatic adaptation of Scott Spencer's novel of the same name. David's character and the past that haunts him in the two earlier adaptations are much darker and convoluted, often times resulting in mental institution. But in Feste's interpretation, the real conflict in the film is the one between Jade's overprotective father Hugh, and David. This conflict in the film is the driving force for so many of the characters and is one that shows the intentions of a young and impressionable boy, against the expectations of a worrisome and overbearing father.Hugh, a cardiologist, after having his prized son pass away, looks to keep his family tradition alive through his to-be doctor daughter, especially since his middle son Keith (Rhys Wakefield of The Purge), is intent at keeping his father at arms length; falling in love and studying on his own terms. Greenwood's performance of Hugh is one that has many layers; on the one side, a protective father who keeps his daughter from making a decision that might jeopardized her life and future; and on the other side is a haughty, upper class elite who doesn't see David as able to provide the kind of lifestyle his daughter deserves. Greenwood becomes the essence of the film, showing that true love doesn't always reign supreme and providing the film with a conflicted character with realistic and somewhat expected mid-life crises.The truth remains, there is a big difference between true love and first love. David, who scores an impeccable SAT score and professes to finding happiness in simplicity, spends his days after high school helping his father Harry Elliot (Robert Patrick) around the auto shop he owns. Throughout Endless Love we are reminded just how smart and wise David is, yet the choices he makes, and a little bad luck, get the better of him. Showing very brief glimpses of anger that often finds his fist connecting with several people throughout the film, David gives merit to Hugh's concerns for his daughter. But, like any good cranky dad set amidst any love story, love reigns over logic. Decisions are made during the course of heart-wrenching monologues, and tempers escalate quickly, but not before any Valentine's Day film's centre motto is expressed, and that's letting the past go.Greenwood's character Hugh may be a bit manipulative, controlling and dramatic with his actions towards David, but there is no doubt that Hugh faces so many of the concerns of fathers whose daughters tread off the path they set for them. Endless Love is a very melodramatic yet manipulative descent into social classes and how it affects young people in love, but throughout the film, there are hints of truth and reality.Overall the film is a success thanks to it's talented actors in front of the camera. From Richardson, a mother who knows the power of love, to Wakefield who gives an accurate, rebellious truth to the neglected middle child, the performances in Endless Love are as good as can be. Dayo Okeniyi, who gives a reminiscent Derek Luke like performance in the film, gives the film much of its humour and heart, standing beside his best friend and star-crossed lover David. Aside from the lovers, the film is held together by it's patriarch Greenwood, on and off screen.Check out the full review at www.nightfilmreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gentle treatment gives it its magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many reviews criticise this title for being a cliché or being unoriginal or being too normal. And that is exactly what gave this movie it's magic. Sometimes being human and being in love is much less that finding some deeper insight and more about just struggling though circumstances as best we can. There is a movie for everyone and not all stories needs to be grossly intense and over engineered. The production value was of a good quality and I fail to see why so many reviews would give this movie such low scores ? maybe because they were not able to appreciate the simplicity of this film? It is in its lightness and simplicity that its ability to reach an audience lies. It is true to itself and though yes, it can be too soft at times, I suspect that is exactly what the viewer wants when (s)he takes a title like "endless love" off the DVD shelf. The story moves at a very good pace, the acting is placed just right and all the elements works together to make a very engaging experience. It is not quite a chick flick, neither is it a film that is going to race at the Tribeca Film Festival. But I think it was written with gentleness and care. It was directed and acted with a sense of maturity and the viewer do get the feeling that the film maker understood the subject very deeply and if merely by that he reached an audience and gave them a deeper insight into the issues they are dealing with in their own lives, it is a successful piece of work. There is absolutely NOTHING offensive about this movie and though I was not moved to tears, it did not fail to touch me none the less. I can say this many times ? not every time I watch a film, do I want to step away with the heavy emotional content of Schindler's List and neither do I want to start awarding Oscars for best performances. Some days all I want it to walk away and feel that I have seen a story worth watching, that was done with respect and that understands life. And that Endless Love surely does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awful wanna be 'Notebook' that shames all romances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was an array of ignorance portrayed by naive characters who seem to have no idea how the real world works. I went to see this yesterday with my friends who enjoyed it because their favorite types of films are shallow romances. The characters consistently made bad and mind- numbing decisions and there was no plot whatsoever. The supposed 'plot' ended by the delinquent boyfriend saving the father, who is supposed to be the antagonist, though he is only concerned about his children's welfare, from a fire that was caused by the father's black sheep son and overcoming a change of heart, allowing the toxic relationship between his daughter and this boyfriend to continue. The girl was just ignorant to life and it was frustrating to watch. Do not watch or purchase this film. It is the biggest waste of money and time ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endless Predictability</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The girl is really pretty, the boy looks much older than 18, and the plot is mushy, unrealistic, confusing and yet predictable. Not a single one of the actors playing the top 5 characters in this movie was even born in America (they come from England, Australia, and Canada), yet they play Americans. Lowly mechanic and valet "David's" accent betrays him at times. He's supposed to be 18, she's 17, and elder brother Keith around 19, yet the actors' ages at the time of shooting were closer to 24, 25, and 26, respectively...and it showed. I kept wondering when I would see the signs that the girl was a brilliant honors student bound for an ivy league pre-med program, but instead saw a wide-eyed child more at home drawing unicorns, shopping or making goo- goo eyes. I kept wondering what the father's motivation was for his visceral hatred of David. Did the writers really think people these days still act so class-conscious? Pretty in Pink is 30 years old, and even back then, the "rich tread on the poor" class-warfare theme was a stretch. For a kid (David) who apparently aced his SATs, chose to remain loyal to his jilted dad and his business, and who treated the girl (Jade) with a good deal of respect, the rich girl's dad could have done a lot worse. Yet he remained relentlessly hostile and even evil to David. Spoiler alert: The viewer has a feeling something's going to happen to change the dad's mind, and, courtesy of a neatly timed, drama-laden car wreck, house fire and clumsy rescue scene, his heart finally softens. "I tried to save him," he suddenly admits to David in a strange, non-sequitur moment, referring to his teenage son who had died from cancer, "but I couldn't." Wait...what? You're a cardiologist, not an oncologist, and what does your son's tragic death have to do with the unfaithful, jerk-like way you've been behaving? I lost track of the series of plans the kids make: first they're okay with the impending separation, then she's going to cancel a summer internship, then he's going to try to get into college too, then, then that goes awry, the dad files a restraining order to keep David away, and they're going to drop everything and run away together. By the end I don't know who was going where, or what ever happened to the dad's restraining order. Did he lose interest in what his daughter's education plans would be? I got confused, but that may have been my mind's predictable drifting, kind of like the plot. Rather than hurt your head, try this: if you have an ear for beauty, listen to the original theme song, and if you have an eye for beauty, watch a couple clips of the frolicking Gabriella Wilde. You'll get the same amount of pleasure but save 2 hours of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>it is definitely an improvement from the original movie but it isn't without it own flaws and shortcomings mostly due to poor editing and shoddy screenplay. The single greatest improvement is probably their decision not to cast an actress just based on her beauty as was shamelessly done with the original. Gabrielle Wilde's Jade can act unlike Brooke Shields who just stood there looking lost and pretty (I'll never understand why her mother said yes to the script, Shields was 14 at the time so it definitely was not her calling the shots on her career). The dad is established as a villain from the start where in the original film he had been made into one by the forbidden budding romance between his daughter and her lover who is this version is the same age as her unlike the age gap from the original. The whole left- over-60s- hippie-strung-over vibe has been replaced by tempered preppy Suburban life which fits better into this 21st century adaptation of the novel. The love did not seem based on looks or lust like the original film however neither film was able to successfully transition the friendship of Jade and David to love as it was portrayed in the book. All in all this one fairs better than the original in its attempt to show young love rather than lust, obsession and stupidity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland and toothless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Endless Love" movie was trashed by many critics for not being very faithful to Scott Spencer's acclaimed novel, but placed next to this (supposed) remake, it comes across as pretty provocative and daring. As you might have guessed by that last statement, this remake strips everything controversial out of the original story. For example, while the novel and the original movie concerned underaged teenagers in a forbidden romance, the youths in this remake have just graduated from high school - which kind of takes the "forbidden" out of the romance. The story has been heavily rewritten so that it's now instead another tired retelling of an uppercrust father who doesn't want his precious daughter hanging around with a working class youth - yes, you've seen it all before. Even the climax (involving a fire) is clichéd and predictable If you really want to see this old story again, you'll find that this is a professionally produced version. But the only fresh element to be found is the performance of Robert Patrick, who's pretty good in his supporting role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fighting for the true love against the resistance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The newer version of the '81 movie, which both of them were the adaptation of a book of the same name. This type of story is a kind of outdated, but this movie was updated according to the present time. So there's no doubt on convincing the teenagers and do like it. It was a mini version of the movie 'The Notebook', but everything happens in a very much soon, like in one summer and expands a bit in the last quarter. This movie got all the substance that teen romance theme should have like strong bond, emotions, resistance and a tragic.I don't know still how many Hollywood is going to make a teen love story about a rich or popular boy and a poor or nerd girl, sometimes vice versa comes together. Recently I saw 'The Spectacular Now' which was not too far from it, but anyway cast and the story varied distinctly. This was the story of David, on his high school graduation day he reveals his crush on a rich geek girl that he waited for this day. The opposite had attracted each other and she finds the same feeling about him in her. Now they got one whole summer in front of them before moving on a different path to higher education or taking a job. Like the father from 'Father of the Bride', the overprotective father oppose the idea. But it only makes the stronger the young relationship. Somehow it has to end when summer is over, so what happens after that is the remaining.''I found what you said inspiring. And inspiration has been in short supply these days.''The pair was good together, you can call it a fine chemistry. With the decent performances, music and cinematography, it looked a perfect movie to watch with your female (male) companion at the weekends. It was not, wow! sayable kind of movie, if you forget yourself, you will get into the movie's deep. Other than that probably you may not like it if you have already seen the '81 movie. I believe everyone had not seen that, so this movie is for those people.Gabriella Wilde was so beautiful like I saw her first time in 'The Three Musketers' with that classical European royal house costume. Perhaps a better movie for Alex Pettyfer so far in his career as a lead actor. Except these two, the father character played by Bruce Greenwood was great. Definitely not it is his greatest execution, but one of his for sure that helped the movie to shape well. Overall, the movie might not be close to the earlier version or the book, but certainly not a bad one. Since I have not watched the old and not read the book, I give a go for it for those who are looking romance movies.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The soundtrack are amazingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just for the soundtrack I could consider this a good movie, for a long time I haven't seen such movie with good OST(the other movie is 'The Lucky one',but the story is just much poor than this one). In my opinion love story should be all about romance ,with beautiful scenes and the roles are attractive and the performance should be good as well. Well this is the movie ~ About the plot, I think most of the love movies can't be like 'About Time' or 'Her' , There need to and have to be a normal story just talks about youth, innocent, first time, choice and love. I'm always attracted by love stories , there aren't many stories just talks about love anymore, people want something thrill, exciting. last year my favorite romance stories are 'Safe Haven'(story by Nicholas Sparks) 'her' and 'About Time'.. Her and 'About time' are really good ,through an unusual story telling us how to love or find the love around us(but as I said all the love stories can't be like this, or if they all like this you'll get bored too after hundreds of them...). 'Safe Haven' is really beautiful, the landscape is fascinating,characters are good looking ,music is good .... just love it. Then come to this movie,just good as well. If you're a romance fan you must see this movie.</fullReview>

There's something about this movie that hooks me in, and I just want to watch it over and over again. I've already watched it two times this weekend. The acting was good, and the characters go very well together. Yes, there wasn't many deep heart to heart talks between the two main characters, but you feel the chemistry between them. It was very well shot. I can't wait to see Gabriella in her next movie, she is an amazing actress. All in all, great movie. I definitely recommend this, and if you're a guy you might like this too.OH, I forgot to mention... This movie has a KILLER soundtrack. The music is just perfect in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stellar performances by all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched Endless Love ~10 now in the last two weeks, and I'm not particularly the romantic film guy. Each of the leading actors, or perhaps I should say significant actors, did a fantastic, professional job, with maybe Joely Richardson the most professional, though certainly not the star that shone the brightest. To me, that would be Gabriella Wilde. I'm a huge Alex Pettyfer fan but Gabriella's energy enlivened every scene. My first time seeing her, and I want more. She is a huge talent without a doubt, and I think she will prove that in future films. I don't know why this film didn't make a huge splash because it had all the components storyline wise. As the years go by, I've come to appreciate Bruce Greenwood's professionalism and he played his role here to the limit, making one grit one's teeth with anger. My only quibble was that A. Pettyfer's dialogue seemed stilted in the beginning. I wished I'd never seen Endless Love 2014 so I could watch it again for the first time. Kudos to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Romantic Film, in a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is about as good as I believe a cheesy romantic films gets. Sometimes you do just want to sit down and relax whilst watching a beautiful (not exactly reality filled) relationship develop. Now as a girl, I love these films once in a while and 'Endless Love' was perfect for me. Many will say the story lines are predictable, and they are, however isn't that was romantic Hollywood films are like? Overall I loved it, many won't and will say it's a stupid remake of the original, but having never seen the first one it doesn't bother me. Generally it was just a feel-good-film, with the typical boy meets girl, they fall in love, lots of unnecessary drama, but that's what these films are for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautifully filmed love story with something for everyone. Gabriella Wilde and Alex Pettyfer are the faces to watch this year. This is not a rehash of the older version, but an updated story for a new generation. The soundtrack was fresh and didn't overpower the dialogue. Shana Feste ( director and writer on Country Strong and The Greatest) is great at getting emotion out of young actors and makes her characters lovable.It was refreshing to see a light and lovely story with no murder or vampires involved.

		<shortDescription>cheesy romance done badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shy Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) is a social wallfower who graduates from high school with no close friends. David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) has admired her from afar. With encouragement from his father Harry (Robert Patrick) and best friend Mace, he tells her. David and Mace are country club valets. They go on a joy ride with Jade and promptly get fired. Jade asks her parents (Bruce Greenwood, Joely Richardson) for a party and invites the entire class. The Butterfields are wealthy while David's father owns the local garage. David tries to ingratiate himself with Jade's father but various issues drive him to oppose the relationship.Romances should not be this hard to make. This is a lot of romantic cheese. Gabriella Wilde is really beautiful and has the characteristics for the role. Alex Pettyfer has survived on his pretty boy looks for far too long. His character is not completely appealing and he doesn't make it better. The cheesiness can be made appealing if done correctly. This is not close to that.</fullReview>

The movie is lame, predictable, cheesy, and really pointless. What do you gain from watching it? Nothing. Zero. You get more by watching a washing machine finish its cycle. Honestly. Of course, if you are the kind that absolutely adores romantic comedies, and just likes to be dragged into the predictable twists and turns these type of movies offer then by all means watch it.

		<shortDescription>Endless drivel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a terrible remake of a (1981) movie that was, itself, a terrible adaptation of a good novel. It comes across as a very cynical attempt to cash in with a pretty, banal, inoffensive love-story (released on Valentine's Day) designed to appeal to undiscriminating teenage girls. When I saw that a newer version of "E.L." was going to be on TV I really wanted to watch it, thinking that it might be a more faithful adaptation of a book that I had enjoyed. I knew within the first 30 seconds that I wasn't going to like it. The film starts with David and Jade graduating from high school as virtual strangers. In the novel, David is 17 and Jade is 15 when they begin dating. The fact that she is only 15 years-old is what makes the intensity of their relationship so disturbing. This film version also throws in several "dramatic" elements not in the book; a Butterfield family tragedy, a juvie record for David, and a (different) car accident. The family dynamics that were so interesting in the novel and did so much to explain the motivations and actions of the characters have been completely revamped and simplified here. Instead of being the son of two middle-class, Jewish, communists, David lives with his single, mechanic, father. Instead of being the daughter of hippie-ish, pseudo-intellectual parents (who misguidedly allow her relationship with David to blossom out of control), Jade has typical bland, wealthy, patrician, teen-movie parents. The novel, by Scott Spencer, was a powerful, sad story of obsession. This adaptation has been reduced to a trite poor-little-rich-girl/poor boy romance with mean, wealthy daddy as the obstacle standing in the way of the young lovers. In the book, it is Jade herself who realizes that her relationship with David may not be appropriate and who requests a trial separation that drives him to desperation. Movie-Jade being 18 years-old kind of negates the whole Daddy-is-trying-to-keep-us-apart thing. I'm not quite sure how Hugh is able to file a restraining order to keep David away from Jade when she is legally an adult.The two main characters here are attractive, blank slates. We really never learn much about them except that they are instantly smitten and in looove. They don't seem to have any interests (other than each other), hobbies, or ideas. We're told that they're smart because she's going to med school and he has high test scores but they don't really do or say anything that demonstrates their above-average intelligence. Jade, who seems to have never had a boyfriend before (and would thus be a virgin), has sex with David on the 3rd day of their acquaintance, before they've even been on an actual date. He has dinner with her family and she invites him to return to her house later, when "all the lights are off", and blithely has sex with him in front of the fireplace as if it's something she's been doing her whole life. There's no nervousness, no hesitation, just an ecstatic smile on her face the whole time. I realize this is supposed to be the stuff of teenage fantasy but, um, birth control? STD prevention? The physical pain of a first sexual encounter? No, it's just easy, uncomplicated bliss. In the book, Jade swipes her mother's diaphragm (having no other means of contraception) for a painful first time that could possibly have gotten her pregnant. A little odd, perhaps, but a lot more realistic than completely glossing over these issues as if they don't exist. I recently learned that the teenage daughter of an acquaintance of mine was pregnant. I couldn't understand how such a seemingly bright girl could fall for a boy telling her that "it'll be okay" to have sex without using birth control. Maybe this book-smart but na?ve girl has watched too many of these lame, irresponsible movies? Just follow your heart! Don't worry about anything! Love conquers all! It'll all work out in the end! How negligent of the filmmakers to include a scene like the one mentioned above in a PG-13 film targeting impressionable tweens and teens. It's not the fact that there's a sex scene that bothers me, 13 year-olds know what sex is. It's the way it's presented, the casualness of the whole thing. Having sex with a guy you only met a few days ago is just fine and don't worry about the possible consequences because there aren't any. If you're really in love (with a guy you just met 5 minutes ago) you won't get pregnant or get a disease! Again, it's rated PG-13, not R. What else? There's the one-dimensional characters. There's the sappy montage of what Jade and David think will be their last 2 weeks together. There's the gag-worthy, pat, happy ending.In the closing narration Jade describes David as "my first love." That would seem to imply that he is not her last love which flies in the face of the previous 142 gushy minutes (not to mention the title)! Just go read the book, don't watch either film version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet escapism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of a 1980's Brooke Shields' romance film lives up to its title, Endless Love. Alex Petyffer and Gabriella Wilde make a very sweet, romantic, and above all believable young couple here, their chemistry is so undeniably real. The acting here wasn't cheesy like I expected it to be, it was believable and authentic. Joely Richardson and Bruce Greenwood are awesome additions to the cast too, they are dramatic and you can really see how the situations and different going on that happen throughout the film affect them, in both good and bad ways. Joely was actually one of my very favorite parts of the entire movie, she's just so great in her role, as she always is in her other movies. Bruce is very good too, he carries his intense scenes well and with great passion. This movie basically is cute romantic escapism entertainment, not a whole lot more than that, and that is not a bad thing, at least not in this film's case. The sex scene between Wilde and Petyffer is very well filmed, romantic, and delicate too, exactly how it should be. 8/10 for Endless Love!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Endless Love is one terrible romance movie directed by Shana Feste and starring Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde. Starting from the acting to camera-work this movie is so poorly done and so cliché that it's so hard to sit through. I personally like some of the Nichola Sparks adaptations to the big screen and going into this movie I thought that it would at the very least be bearable and a bit interesting but no,it is really boring mixed in with terrible acting and characters that are simply unlikable. I predicted the ending very early on and not just that but also predicted most of the "twits" that occurred.It also almost put me to sleep and I seriously wanted to stop watching a couple of times but I had to watch till the end to see if all the clichés are fulfilled and so they were. This is one terrible,boring,uninteresting and at the same time it has terrible cinematography plus really bad acting all along.Would not recommend watching this for any cost whatsoever so just stay away as much as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the first scene of this movie really made me predict that, I think it's gonna be another "The Perks of Being A Wallflower" but Charlie acts as Jade here. Or maybe it's even a new version of Romeo and Juliet, which in my opinion is pretty similar.I kinda tired watching movie with a similar conflict. That's why I tried to figure out something different by guessing that the boy Jade is talking to is her late brother. Yeah, who knows he is her imaginary friend because she can't take the death of his beloved brother? But then I realize that this is the remake of the same title in 1981. So, he's not a ghost. He's her other brother.For the cast itself,I like them all. Gabriella Wilde is so pretty and hot. But unfortunately this is the reason why I can't accept that she doesn't have any friend during her high school year. I know that she acts as a shy girl, but I know boys. They can't keep their mouth shut having a hot blonde like Jade around them. They're dying for her, trust me. But through the narration of David, Jade is a forgotten girl. However, I am convinced by Gabriella's expression that she's a shy girl. In the end of the movie, I remembered that she is the girl from Carrie, Sue Snell.One more thing that really bugs me. When David visits psychiatrist to talk about the problem of his love life. It's so weird. A boy like David will even consider that??? That type of guy will just be quiet, or at least talk to his father or his friend when he is asked.I love all the soundtracks, which, once again, reminds me of The Perks of Being A Wallflower. You know, it has cool soundtracks, too. Somehow, they're sound similar.</fullReview>

And i'm very glad to see Robert Patrick to a great role again because he hasn't been in a lot big movies or good ones since T2.

		<shortDescription>This cliché-ridden romance flick definitely isn't worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this remake of the 1981 romance film, Gabriella Wilde plays Jade Butterfield, a sweet teenage girl fresh out of high school, who meets a handsome young man named David Elliot (played by Alex Pettyfer) at a graduation party. The two quickly fall in love and develop a relationship. However, keeping each other together becomes a challenge when Jade's parents, her dad (played by Bruce Greenwood) in particular, disapprove of their relationship and tries keeping them apart. Now I really don't much problems about teen romance flicks, my girlfriend and I enjoy them, as long as they're good. This one is anything but good. What exactly is wrong with this movie? First off, the plot is very cheesy, poorly written, and soaks itself with countless romantic movie clichés. It revolves around a girl following in love with a guy and her dad becoming uncomfortable the situation, which is often plot we've seen thousands of times in other films as well as TV shows. So basically, the entire plot is just one big cliché. Secondly, the way the story moves just unbearable, mostly because of the characters. Jade follows in love with David so much to the point where she begins sneaking out of her house, and at one point, tries skipping out on her internship at the hospital. I found this to be pretty annoying to the point where I started rolling my eyes. The acting was okay in some parts, but it certainly was not enough to save this clichéd-ridden mess of a movie.Even if you are a fan of teen romance movies, I could not recommend this one. It is just far too original and torture to sit through. Please look elsewhere!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endless Love is about David and Jade's summer love being torn apart by Jade's father due to David's secret past.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Endless love is a really good movie and has an interesting plot. The movie hooked me in and made me want to know what happened in David's (Alex Pettyfer) past. Also, there are many shocking things that happen throughout the movie that further adds to the story, such as the car crash and the house on fire. During the fire, I started tearing up because I wasn't sure if David was going to survive or not. The only complaint I have is that Gabriella Wilde's (Jade) acting was not so great. Therefore, I have to give this movie an 8/10. On the other hand, all the other actors were pretty good, and I would definitely re-watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Love Story? Kinda......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rich girl Jade (Wilde), falls in love after HS graduation with David (Pettyfer) who comes from the other side of the tracks. Jade's surgeon father, Hugh Butterfield (Greenwood), puts up barriers to this romance because he has Jade's future all planned out. Add to this that Hugh's son Cristopher recently died of Cancer and Hugh is determined not to lose another child. For most of us life happens way after High School. Here life happens after HS graduation for Jade and David. Yes, it's kind of cute, warm and fuzzy for a while in the beginning, but some stupid things the director felt was necessary gave 7th graders pause to think some things were WAY cool: a joy ride in a customer's car; and a trip to the Zoo after hours when the former jealous girlfriend of David calls the cops about the Zoo break-in. Talk about bumps in the road caused by the very people we want to be together. Not good. The first half reminded many of us of our high school days (ah, those were the days), but someone left out the intensity to really pull the audience in. First of all Pettyfer was miscast as he was clearly much older than Wilde's Jade and he didn't seem too comfortable in this role. However because Wilde's Jade is very pretty we cast our lot with her and hoped for the best. (you always pull for the pretty ones)But the lack of intensity in the first half gives way to the story in the 2nd half about Hugh and his attempts to ruin this relationship. The 2nd half becomes his story. I hated to see Bruce Greenwood as Hugh in this role and felt uncomfortable every time he was on screen showing his distaste for things going on around him regarding Jade and David. Oh, he did good, but??? did I mention being uncomfortable? Later Hugh kind of relents, but when David discovers his secret, Hugh asks David to take a ride in his boat and here we are reminded of one of the Godfather movies when Fredo was asked to go fishing on the lake. Oh, oh!Notables: Robert Patrick as David's supportive father; and Joely Richardson as Anne Butterfield Jade's mother who is supportive of both Jade and David as they brought a sense of first love that she experienced back in the day. She was delightful. Could have been a very good love story, but the intensity factor just wasn't there and the 2nd half being all about Hugh kind of ruined the moment. Okay, moments. Still not bad. (7/10)Violence: Yes, not much Sex: Yes, but nothing is seen. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watered Down Version of the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this awhile back off HBO GO. The only reason I watched this was really just out of curiosity, to compare with the original 1981 film starring Martin Hewitt and a young Brooke Shields. This recent remake stars Gabriella Wilde (who starred in another recent remake, "Carrie") and Alex Pettyfur ("Magic Mike"), as well as one of my fav. character actors, Bruce Greenwood as the girl's dad. HE is the only good thing about this- his performance. Yes, he's an a**hole, but you can't help but empathize with him a bit-?? LOLOverall, this movie is just a sugar-coated/watered down remake. I had remembered the original being a bit edgier, and looked into it and found I was right. In fact, upon further research, found that the original book it was based on was even edgier than the first film. Why did they not base the new movie directly on THAT instead of this poor piece of work-?? And last, but not least- no Tom Cruise as the budding pyromaniac??? -now THAT is the main reason to stay away- VERY far away from this movie!!??? LOL</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Endless Love is a very heart warming love story. It is a classic boy love girl film where many obstacles are in the way. The protagonists in the film make a very believable couple, and I really bought into the pairs' love. The acting in this film was actually very good throughout, with many emotional scenes which tugged at my heart-strings. Although this film is fairly predictable, and cliché, it was very heart-warming. I would recommend this film to any rom-com lover unless you are looking to watch a brand new love story idea. Overall, a very good film and worth the watch as I was smiling throughout and really bought into the characters. Stuart McCaughey Northampton</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Endless Love (2014): Dir: Shana Feste / Cast: Alex Pettyfer, Gabriella Wilde, Bruce Greenwood, Joely Richardson, Robert Patrick: Title regards patience and persistence but it obviously does not refer to the patience of those sitting through its entire dull running time struggling to remain awake. It is a boring teen love story starring Alex Pettyfer who is fired from his valet job. His father is a mechanic and supportive of his son despite a nasty divorce. Gabriella Wilde plays a dimwitted blonde whose father is a surgeon and demands that his children follow the path he desires. His oldest son has passed away and his youngest son seems to be rebelling his wishes of preferred college pursuits. He prefers that Wilde go for a medical internship but resents this new boy he deems trouble. This becomes unbearable to sit through. Director Shana Feste previously made the overrated Country Strong and struggles to present anything outside this side of drivel. Pettyfer plays the standard misunderstood guy on the wrong side of the tracks who will predictably save the day. Wilde plays a rebellious brat who pops her cherry in her dad's house. Bruce Greenwood has the unfortunate role as father. He is a strict and over the top bully and hypocrite to the highest degree. Joely Richardson plays Wilde's understanding and sexually frustrated mother who has written a book in the past. Robert Patrick was once a great villain in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. With films like this he appears to be suffering greatly. The message is lost within all the romantic bullshit. In the end it only deserves an endless trip to the nearest trash bin.

		<shortDescription>True love can triumph...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Endless Love follows two young high school graduates and their quest for a love driven by passion, integrity and fierce loyalty.Pettyfer and Wilde both give convincing performances as the film captures the viewer from the start. Poetic narration from David in the opening scenes makes you fall in love with the character straight away only fueling the desire to see more. Wilde looks effortlessly flawless throughout, giving a performance which sees her character blossom from a child to a young adult willing to follow her heart until the end of the earth.The film throws the viewer at several points into this bubble which we do not want to burst. We are invested within the underlying plot; the struggle of a bereaved family and the difficulty of a young man trying to get his life back on track. Whilst constantly hoping for the couple to end up in each others arms.Overall the ending leaves us comforted with the idea that true love can triumph in the end- if only one is willing to fight for it.</fullReview>

On a more serious note: Does anyone really believe that a girl like Gabriella Wild would go almost completely unnoticed through her school year? Yeah didn't think so, even if blonde is not your favorite hair color (same goes for Mr. Pettyfer of course).Funnily enough there is also a sub story involving the father (that Pettyfers character discovers), that is almost completely dismissed by the end. Which sort of is OK, because the main focus lies on our two lovers (and the brothers of Wildes character in conjunction with family values and so on) ... I make it almost sound better than it actually is ... but if you don't mind the predictability of the story and everything that comes with it, you might like this</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In brief:Two High School teens discover each other at graduation and a romance begin. But their different backgrounds, makes it complicated. Now love has to prove, how strong it can be.Characters:The leading actor called David is played by Alex Pettyfer. In the movie David is bit of a shy guy, who haven't dared to talk to Jade (the leading actress) for all of High School. We feel his good looks interferes with the role he is playing. It would have benefited the story, if he had been more average looking to support his shy side.Otherwise his charm is convincing and he makes us believe in his infatuation with Jade.The leading actress called Jade is played by Gabriella Wilde. Jade is the good girl, who only spend time studying. We think that her role would have been better, if the good girl have been expressed more throughout the movie. She's a bit to quick to convince us at her innocence.However her "girl next door" appearance is working great for her role.The good:Their intense attraction to be together, is clearly shown throughout the movie. The bad:The storyline felt a bit week. Their shy guy/good girl personalities should have been more visible, to better complete the movie and the romantic story about them. Favorite lines:Jade: "My first love was everything all at once. The kind that you never fall back from. Never try to. Never want to. My love's so big. So strong. It never dies. Never fades. Never losses its electricity. The kind of love you fight for. The kind of boy you fight for."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my god. This movie... Was amazing. But not in the way you think. It's god damn insane and bad that it becomes an amazingly hilarious experience. I watched the because me and my girlfriend wanted to watch something, and I had downloaded it at some point. We both expected some super cheesy moments, but thought we should give it a go. At first, we seemed correct. It was cheesy, but kind of enjoyable. The characters seemed to have an initial physical chemistry which was good. It seemed like it could be fun. But soon enough, it got so out of control that it left me and my girlfriend rolling on the floor laughing (literally in her case). We had a running commentary with each other throughout the whole movie because there was so much to laugh about. I have never seen so much devastation in a love movie before. This film literally has cheating, death of a son by cancer, breaking and entering, theft, a car crash, sex within days of dating in front of a fire and in a living room where the parents are asleep upstairs, a punch in the face, an arrest, a restraining order, lost love and a DAMN HOUSE FIRE! Yes, a fire. Like literally, at the end, I couldn't believe it all had happened. It felt like some crazy fever dream that I totally had imagined. It's absolutely crazy. These people go through so much in such a short amount of time. So many thing makes absolutely no sense. I was so into this movie just because I could not believe how many insane things they were throwing at us. It started as a cheesy romance film and gets kicked into overdrive after 15 minutes in. I think over all the biggest issue is the lack of a love story. Most of the film is focused on crappy things happening. Also, the characters fall madly in love without barely having said a few sentences to each other. They don't know each other and they're having sex and saying they are in love. What the hell? This movie really needs to be seen to believed. Do not expect a good but kinda cheesy love film, because this is not it. It is absolutely crazy and bad... but I enjoyed every second. My rating is only as high as it is because its so bad that its good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is true Love... really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie expecting an epic love story full of drama, beauty, screams and cries; a modern "Romeo &amp; Juliet", the kind of story that makes you think "wow, love really is powerful". Let me tell you something, love is powerful but I didn't get that, watching this movie.The problem with "Endless Love" is that this love is not believable, there is no real connections between the two main characters. It all seem pretty naive, "I'm pretty, you're pretty so let's love each other till the end of times". True conversation between Jade and David just never happens; there is a lot of kissing, running together, watching fireworks but they never really talk to each other which would have make their relationship much deeper and so much more believable. It's all very superficial, and you wonder how can this love be so strong when there is nothing, no real links behind it.What saves it all is the good look of the two main actors, they are just gorgeous together, and it is always quite pleasant to see good looking people on screen. There acting is also good, nothing over the top, but the emotions are there.All in all, better enjoy "The Notebook" for the 1000th time than watch "Endless Love", it will be more worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully stereotypical and predictable love story that doesn't try very hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect from Endless Love. I have never seen the original and I sort of knew what to assume. When you're making this sort of "Nicholas Sparks-esque" "teen romance" there is absolutely a predictable recipe that should be followed to appease fans of the genre. You expect boy meets girl, you expect disapproving parents and young love and a disaster of some kind. Maybe we have just seen this too many times now. This is so by the book it was hard to watch. It reeks of someone ripping off every play from Nicholas Sparks handbook only Sparks has thus far still managed to be entertaining. The entire story just feels very juvenile, forced, poorly paced. The acting is okay, certainly not terrible, and the chemistry (an absolutely vital component to the romantic film) is good too. There is a fair bit of story here and it does feel very rushed. The two fall madly in love in a matter of minutes when somehow they've never managed to cross paths despite having been in High School together. His background is just barely touched upon, enough to establish him as the "tough boy" and nothing ever really takes off. Despite being juvenile and aimed for a young teen girl demographic the rather explicit (for a PG film) feels awkward and the almost nudity is inappropriate given the rating and how young the star looks.Gabriella Wilde is well over 20 but she looks very young. I'm sure they knew that when casting her and having a rather awkward sex scene in it. Wilde is decent enough but she certainly does nothing to go above and beyond in her role. Its a very cookie cutter role and you could practically dictate what will happen without ever seeing the film. This won't do anything for her career but she isn't bad in the role. Alex Pettyfer (younger than Wilde by a year if you can believe it) plays her one true love. Pettyfer is as good as Wilde is. He doesn't blow you away, he isn't terrible, he's decent. I think he could have been a far more interesting character had they established his background just a little bit more. He certainly has the look down for a romantic lead and the young girls will most certainly swoon over him. Their chemistry together is good. Bruce Greenwood in my opinion was the highlight performance of the film, although that isn't saying much. He the devoted father of Wilde and he plays the role well. He is heavy handed and definitely gives the most experienced performance amongst the cast. Robert Patrick is also good in a brutally small role that they don't elaborate nearly enough on.It doesn't surprise me in the least that writer and director Shana Feste has very little experience in the big budget world of Hollywood. She shows some talent in cinematography but she does absolutely nothing to make her own personal mark on this. This is truly Endless Love's nail in the coffin. It is cut and dry, nothing new, sub par character development, poor editing and just really something for very young girls minus the rather adult undertones of the entire thing. Under better direction, better writing and more time spent with the story this could have at least been fun to watch but it wasn't. It was yawn worthy and that's really unfortunate. There are WAY too many films in this genre that are exponentially better than this so it is unfortunately forgettable and not worth giving it too much thought. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much to say about this movie. To be honest, I haven't seen the movie yet, but I've read the description and viewed the trailer, and I can only say I will give it a chance once it's out in theaters, though, I won't be expecting too much as it will be pretty hard for Alex Pettyfer to shake of that image Ryan Gosling left in The Notebook. The actors (at least in the trailers) seemed lacking personality and charisma to make you want to fall in love with them. That's what romantic movies are all about: the drama, the love, the heart tearing moments sprinkled with tears of joy of sadness. (I think Rachel McAdams feels the same way). It's nearly impossible to not be tempted to think about The Notebook... I will come back with a vote after I see it, but from what the plot/actors look like, I would not give it more than a 6 or 7, tops. Until you get the chance to see this movie, there are other good movies I recommend to watch: About Time, Stuck in Love, Crazy Stupid Love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe CLUELESS would be a more appropriate title for this film. After years of extreme isolation, an absolutely gorgeous teen finds herself friendless and decides to throw a huge party inviting the whole class. Guess how many show up? Well, this represents the biggest suspense of the film and then it's paltry crumbs thereafter.Her long blonde shiny hair, I believe, is the star of the show and I anticipated each scene to uncover what new braid or bow would be shown next. You will not be disappointed in that regard. However, I was expecting something more substantial than cliché dialogue and characters which were remnants of the first version. The bizarre twists and bipolar behavior exhibited was fodder for deriding copious laughter. Perhaps dad should have had horns and fangs to complete the picture? What college application packet has a separate mailing for references btw? Perhaps the writers were hoping for an audience of high school dropouts for this mess with plot holes reduced to acceptable levels. I was expecting at the least, a plausible attraction between the two young loves. He appears too old and not very well lit to showcase his best angle, if there was one. I lower my standards when it comes to remakes of already known duds and was reduced to a profound focus on Joely's protruding proboscis.Hard to recommend this for a fan of any feather. However, if you are trying to get into college you might enjoy how easy it is to complete the application lol.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This edition of "Endless Love" is your typical, formulaic, rich girl/bad boy romance fueled by overactive hormones. Both David and Jade come from pretty dysfunctional families, hers extremely exaggerated, with the expected outcomes for nearly all involved. In fact everything about this movie feels exaggerated, most uncomfortable, the racial stereotyping and attempts to show how NON-prejudicial and enlightened the lead characters are.David does not come across as condescending, but on the other hand, is totally clueless about trying to at least be acceptable to Jade's dad. Button up your shirt at dinner! And throughout the film, despite baths and swimming etc., his hair looked clean only once.I sure the "goofs" category includes the observation about seat belt on/seat belt off, but it was VERY disturbing that seat belts were OFF most of the time with--SPOILER--expected results, although the injuries are never attributed to the lack of seat belts. This is AGAINST THE LAW, as well as stupid. The chemistry between the two teens is quite believable--the only thing that really rings true in this soap opera. But I was disturbed--SPOILER--that moments after ascertaining that Jade is only 17 (we find out a bit later that David is 18), they have sex (in a completely unbelievable setting), but why not make her 18, so there really isn't any question of age of consent/rape? Is it because Dad takes out a restraining order on David later and couldn't include Jade if she was 18? I can see where this film appeals to teens, and for most sets up SUCH an unrealistic view of life after High School. Balance your viewing with "Fruitvale Station."</fullReview>

This flick is like an after-school, sanitized, TV movie version of a ballsy story I once saw on a film channel which involved a bad boy burning down his girlfriend's mansion when her parents finally wised her up. In this dumbed-down remake, Alex Pettyfer's "David" is NOT a bad boy at heart--he's more like THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, constantly struggling to save the ADULTS around him from plunging over cliffs. When David's "Mr. Fix-it" can take a breather from that time-consuming duty, he fritters away his hours giving Gabriella Wilde's "Jade" remedial sex education tutoring, while instructing her that "all you really need is love" (and a couple cardboard boxes for spending those chilly winter nights on the sidewalks of Atlanta). I'm sure the sight of these two young hedonists glowing with first (and third) love as they panhandle would inspire their fellow Georgians to cough up enough coins to keep them in Krystal Burgers--at least until they turn 20.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A terrible film by Shana Feste, "Endless Love" sees a couple of rich, well educated parents hurling scorn and disapproval at their daughter (Gabriella Wilde), a young woman who dares throw away a career to be with a "lower class" slacker. How dare she! Packed with clichés, "Endless Love" ends with a hokey metaphor. Here a father saves his daughter's lover from the fire which decimates her childhood home, thereby symbolically coming to terms with his daughter's newfound independence. It's all very cringe-worthy. Romantics looking for a better film by Shana Feste are better off with 2010's "Country Strong". See too the more pessimistic romances of Nicole Holofcener. 2/10 ? Terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wild about Wilde, not Jaded by miss Butterfield</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm halfway with this movie, which actually means I've spent about three hours yesterday studying the first half (and, yes, perving over Gabriella Wilde, love those legs and the floaty red dress and the flaxen mane and the pretty eyes, note to self: stop drooling :)) and I will be watching the rest tonight. I've not read the book, but as an aspiring romance/intrigue/psychological thriller author myself, if I had the opportunity, I'd have taken a decent look at it, because almost everybody's quite enthralled by it. The reason I own this movie on DVD is actually because I made a mistake while searching for the Brooke Shields 1981 version. I didn't even know about a 2014 remake and it went into my cart on-line. Have now located the original, but it is almost four times the price. Anyway, I digress...I'm pretty sure this one is cinematographically superior to the 1981 version. And as I've not read the book or seen the original, I have nothing preceding it to compare it with, so no disappointment for me.The storyline is more than adequate, nicely filmed, and Gabriella Wilde is a pretty actress. I love her doing the tango* ** and going up the stairs and running away like a forest nymph with the hair cascading in the breeze and I'm still salivating, I know. Of course, if she wasn't in this movie, had it been some less attractive actress, I'd not have gamely accepted the switch-up I made during my on-line ordering...I would encourage the romantically-inclined to take a look at this one for a nice evening of entertainment. Good Valentine's Day choice.*how come bookish nerd 17 year old Jade who has been a most conscientious stay-at-homer for the past 4 years can just suddenly do those complicated dance maneuvers? Okay, reviewing movie again today, she does refer to a ballet recital in an earlier grade, but from ballet to tango would still take an instructor??? **in all three of the titles I have seen of Joely Richardson, LADY CHATTERLEY, NIP/TUCK and now this, tango appears. She is especially great at it in the NIP/TUCK episode! She seems to inspire script- writers/directors to include this totally amazing sexy fancy awe-inspiring dance!Addendum, later same day. Have now seen entire movie. Second half changes whole game. Just downloaded trailer, what were the detractors harping about? Movie looks fine! I now see it was a Valentine's Day release, didn't know that when I recommended it as such.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Endless Love is the second film adaptation of Stephen Spencer's novel of the same title.The first one was that of Franco Zeffirelli's 1981 film of the same title that starred Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt.In this film,the teen-age lovers - Jade Butterfield and David Elliot - are portrayed by Gabriella Wilde and Alex Pettyfer and the supporting cast includes Bruce Greenwood,Joely Richardson and Robert Patrick.Shana Feste co-wrote and directed the film that tells the story of a privilege girl in Jade that fell in love with a charismatic boy in Alex whose love affair turns serious and becomes reckless as Jade's father who is not in favor of the relationship tries to keep them apart.The film did a fantastic job of portraying what first love and falling in love for the first time was all about. Wilde and Pettyfer definitely were believable as Jade and David respectively.Their sense of passion and burning desire to be with one another was realistic.Also,Greenwood did a fantastic job as Jade's father who was against their relationship.While the movie did a marvelous job of portraying the love story of Jade and David,the screenplay somehow fell into the trap of going through the expected predictability and clichés that is expected from this type of the romantic film.Too bad that these plot elements somehow prevented the film from achieving greatness.The conclusion was also contributed a lot into becoming an average film especially with the resolution of the conflict between Jade's father and David as well as the reunion of the separated lovers.Nevertheless,it still managed to become a better version of the '81 film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing is better than experiencing first time love. This is the story of David and Jade who spend four year together in high school and have never really had the chance to talk to one another until now. David and Jade end up falling for each other and face many obstacles in their relationship particularly Jade's overprotective father played by Bruce Greenwood who lost his son Christopher two years earlier from cancer. I would have to say that Gabriella Wilde and Alex Pettifyer do have great chemistry between the two and overall a great story. I would have to say what made the film rather enjoyable for me was seeing that true love can really overcome all and fighting for something one believes in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sweet and Tender Take on All Our Desire to Love and to Be Loved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is perhaps impossible to make everybody happy... That is what comes across my mind whenever I read reviews for any given movie. So is the case of Endless Love (2014). While it is not a surprise that some find it cheesy, mindless, predictable and all, I left this movie simply warmhearted. As much as I enjoy other genres of films, I like romance stories in general. And yet, real good love stories are not as frequently found as their numbers produced. One of the 'default' shortcomings of romance stories may be their relatively simple plots and consequently predictable closure, which may in turn work in their favor at times. Another reason that people often find love stories predictable may be that almost all of us have been there and done that at least once in life, whereas very few of everyday people like us have lived a life as spies, mercenaries, and/or drug traffickers, just to name a few. Speaking of Endless Love, from the title itself, nothing more than 'love is all that matters' could be expected in the first place. Puppy love? Yes, but well, it was again sort of expected. Besides, it is a lighthearted Valentine's Day movie after all. I have not seen the previous production under the same title starring Brooke Shields, so I cannot tell which adaptation is closer interpretation to the original novel by Scott Spencer. All in all, this Endless Love of 2014 can be enjoyable depending on one's expectation. Although the visually stunning teen couple, David and Jade appear to be the center of attention, I personally believe that the main focus of this story in fact lies on two men's interior struggles - Jade's father, Hugh (Bruce Greenwood) and her new love interest, David - in manifesting *true* love in their own ways, and their respective journey to the healing from their past hurts due to the so-called love lost: Hugh's trophy eldest son gone in a tragic car crash and David's run-away mother. More to the point, Bruce Greenwood's performance overall adds value to the story - he did not let us down. For sure, this movie is all about love, but it seems to have managed to make itself accessible by a wider range of audiences than just teenage girls by showcasing different types of love as delicately as the director being female herself; between middle-aged married couple in crisis, between father and daughter, between father and son, between mother and her children, between friends and more. 'Love' cannot be identified in a certain number of modes, as its forms of manifestation are as numerous as the way people look. In this respect, I trust the filmmakers of Endless Love deserve credits. David is not only way too mature for his age but also a 'too-good-to-be- true' character that seems to exist only in either romance novels or on silver screen. For this reason, this character can likely be judged to be unrealistic, even a cliché. True that this all-round popular guy is all that women could hope for in their quest for *the one* of their own; i.e., who's got your back, who puts you first, who transforms you from being good to better; and who fights for you no matter what, and etc. - the kind that can be defined as a result of lots of thinking and a long soul-search for a man who's got what it takes to be able to commit for a lifetime: Simply a modern day prince-charming! Needless to say, I, being one of them, could personally relate to a lot of it. And yet, some lines we hear in David's voice even put some grin on my face as they sounded quite familiar - just like the excerpts from certain self-help literature discussing the finding of true love... Anyway... so what?! That's for what you have decided to invest two-hour of your life that you could never claim back, and that may be a kind of consolation in exchange for your precious bucks! Hollywood has long been dubbed a 'dream factory.' So... why not?! Any woman deserves to be 'lost' in such fantasy for as long as a movie's running time, and smart women can come back to their senses after the show, can't they...?! To this end, here is my little wish that there are still many of such young men out there in the real world who have found their core and made peace with their true selves; do not try to validate themselves through disguised 'love' being confused with momentary lust and 'checklists' in pursuit of material comforts only; and most importantly, whose emotions have come alive and who believe in the value of Love in our life as a whole... These men help to create healthy families, making good husbands and fathers, for a sound society on a greater scale. Unlike many of dark, violent, and technology-dependent movies acing in the box-offices nowadays, it was comforting to the eye to see bright and natural cinematography, and relaxing to nerves to be taking a mental stroll along a humanity-oriented story. Just few days before I see this movie, I happened to see Terence Malick's "To the Wonder," which also talks about love as life's existential question. It may be fair to say that love is a theme for all mankind and of all time. The two share the same theme but are expressed in quite a different way. Either mystical symbolism or straightforward storytelling does not make it better or worse than the other. In the end, what matters must be how it communicates to its audience. Therefore, Endless Love may not be the best love story ever made, but still it's got its own charm (guess what?! - it's even scoring higher than the acclaimed award-winning director's work above!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too innocent, why is this movie PG-13?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Endless Love, directed by Shana Feste, is a beautiful remake of 1981 Endless Love directed by Franco Zelffirelli. Gabriella Wilde stars as a beautiful, privileged Jade Butterfield who falls in love with a charismatic, less fortunate David Elliot, played by Alex Pettyfer. The only thing keeping them apart is Jade's disapproving father. The acting in this film was done extremely well. It was a perfect little love story released just in time for a Valentine's Day date. Although Endless Love was an enjoyable love story, filmed nicely, with solid acting, the MPAA rating should not have been kept at PG-13.Endless Love is rated PG-13 for sexual content, brief partial nudity, some language and teen partying. It is obvious that the film was kept conservative in order for it to be appropriate for a wider range of ages, but it left most of David and Jade's relationship up to the imagination. The attraction between the two is obvious, and when they are shown kissing partially nude, it leaves the viewer wanting more. Gabriella Wilde is shown in a sheer nightgown, where it is easy to see her silhouette. Later it shows the bare backs of both of them and even the side of Gabriella Wilde's breast; it was done in a very classy fashion. It was just not satisfying. Jade and David had "a love you would go to jail for, set a house on fire for, a love that requires a restraining order" (Lemire, 2014). That kind of love deserves an edgier approach than what Sheste took. I do not think anyone would be against seeing a little more of Alex Pettyfer either. The "teen partying" is referring to a graduation party at Jade's house. Her parents were present the entire time, and they played a dancing game. It is not a typical teen party. Let's be honest, would it even be called a party if your parents are there the whole time and the only game you played was to see who could come up with the best dance choreography? The whole story is about a young woman and young man falling in love and their relationship becoming reckless because of the father's disapproval. To appropriately show this reckless relationship, the movie should have shown more of the mischief the couple was involved in and more of their relationship aside from just kissing. It does not have to be raunchy, but it did not have to be so muted and bland. "Watching Endless Love, you long for it to be riskier, edgier, or at least more reflective of actual teenage experiences and emotions" (Lemire, 2014). The relationship would have been more believable with a riskier, more irresponsible love affair.The 1981 Endless Love was rated R for sex, nudity, profanity, alcohol, drugs, and smoking. The newer version obviously took a different approach to the love story, a more sanitized approach. Jade and David are seventeen years old, but their innocent behavior makes it seems as if they are even younger. Jade and David were made out to be a lot more innocent in the 2014 remake of the film. Rotten Tomatoes claims Endless Love is "Blander than the original Endless Love and even less faithful to the source material. This remake is clichéd and unintentionally silly" (2014). Sheste took a rated R movie and cleaned it up enough to make it appropriate for almost all ages. When she did this, it took away from the story and the excitement of the reckless teenage love affair. Lemire even made a remark that Sheste took out all the "crazy" (2014). I think the "crazy" would have spiced up the love story.While Endless Love is appropriate for most ages, it leaves most of the audience wanting more. The PG-13 MPAA rating is not appropriate for the story line. The story is meant to be a little less guiltless, and a little more edgy. Although, the 1981 Endless Love did not seem to receive very good reviews from critics, it at least showed more truthful teen behavior and a bit more scandalous love affair. Overall, Endless Love was a cute love story, but it could have been taken to a whole other level if they raised the MPAA rating to R and allowed their behavior to be shown; which would have led it to be more enjoyable for the more mature audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endless Love for Endless Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the original Endless Love, nor I have read the book that the 1981 film is based off of, but I have read summaries of both and they sound really depressing. I mean, I can recognize the beauty in a solidly-written tragic love story. I am a bit of a Romeo and Juliet junkie, to the point where I've already picked out the brownstone future me plans to live in on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights. But it is awards season, which means there are enough heavy movies out right now that sometimes you need to throw a good ole fashioned whimsical romance into the mix. Is that so awful? According to Peter Travers, yes. To me? Quite the contrary.The trailer tells you all you need to know about the movie: "She comes from a world of privilege and power, but she'll leave it all behind for him." Clichéd? A bit. Melodramatic? That's an understatement. But aren't all romance films to a degree? Hell, aren't ALL romances in general? I know every relationship I've ever been in has had its fair share of both ? doubly so in the melodramatic department. Plus, I never get sick of seeing the good girl meets "wrong side of the tracks" guy story play out because, as a notorious good girl, I can say with confidence that most of us do have a hidden desire to run off with a quote/unquote bad boy. Granted, I can also say with confidence that when that does happen, it more often than not ends the way the original Endless Love does. But that story is for a different day!Anyway, I'm not going to spend too much time on the plot because you've seen it rehashed a million times but Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) is a beautiful, teenage recluse whose spent her high school years locked up mourning the loss of her older brother. On the day of graduation, her classmate David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer), who has been eying her for years from afar, finally gets to make his move when the Butterfields show up for dinner where he valets. He invites her for a joyride in a Maserati he's parking, and in an instance of spontaneity she says yes (obviously while holed up at home she got the chance to watch Transformers and knew that 50 years from now, she'd want to say she had the guts to get in the car). Thus, the beginning of a glorious summer romance. The only issues are that her Dad is a total hardass/jackass who isn't into the fact that David's only aspiration in life is to work as a mechanic in his father's garage and that instead of a whole summer together ? they only have two weeks, because Jade's leaving for Brown early for an internship.The movie is chock full of darling love scenes and montages that will make you swoon (or make you really bitter? depending on your outlook on love this week), including an adorable moment where David calls the cops on a rival party going on so that all the kids there will come to Jade's graduation party, which was formerly a no-show bust. Pettyfer does this 911 call in his legitimate British accent by the way? which, given the fact that he and Wilde are both Brits, I just don't understand why they didn't set the film in the UK because that would have been too hot to handle. I know some had complaints about the pair's chemistry, but I am the self-proclaimed chemistry police and I didn't have any issue. Pettyfer, who I didn't care for in Magic Mike, was charming and I totally bought him as a hopeless romantic (or as Jade's father called him a "homeless romantic"). His attraction to Jade started as a mere infatuation but I saw where that transpired into actual love (post-grad party, when he is walking on the hoods of cars like a giddy boy who just discovered masturbation). I also enjoyed seeing Jade find herself, as she grew from a closeted girl to a spontaneous woman finally ready to enjoy life. Many critics had problems with the way Wilde constantly twirled and pranced around on camera, but I challenge all of those writers to go back to the first time they experienced love and try to claim that they didn't do the same. I mean, I remember when I got my first KISS I came home screaming and jumping up and down like a lunatic. My family rushed downstairs thinking something terrible happened. No, Gary, some guy named Alex with a car just kissed your 15 year-old daughter in your driveway. Go back to sleep.I am so used to romance movies ending SAD and unrequited lately, that I was petrified (pettyferfried?) this would end like the film/novel it set out to remake. When everything went up in flames at the end (literally), I couldn't help but let out a gasp and clasp my mouth in fear. But this film has a happy ending, and I was grateful for that. Endless Love is not life- changing, but it knows exactly the type of movie it is and it does it well ? incorporating romance, adventure, fireworks and all of the others things I ever want into a sappy, feel-good chick flick.http://thechickflickcritic.com @chickflikcritic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Too Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My teenage sister forced me to tag along with her to see this movie for her birthday. I heard so many reviews about this movie that lead me to believe that I was going to be in for 103 minutes of torture. However, when I exited the movie theater I found myself actually satisfied that I decided to attend this so called chick-flick. First and foremost, I am not big into romantic movies. I find them to be a bore to watch due to the fact that most of them are repetitive and utterly cheesy. With 'Endless Love' I found myself automatically connecting with the story due to the fact that both of the characters had just graduated high school and were close to the same age as me (I am currently 20). I found myself reminiscing about high school graduation and even empathizing with Jade because I myself didn't have too many friends due to the fact that I always made my schoolwork my top priority. Second, I really loved how David and Jade made each other better people. In the movie, David wasn't planning to attend college because he knew exactly what he wanted to do as an occupation, which was to work on cars just like his father. However, when he was in a relationship with Jade, David was inspired to go to college because she showed him what all he was capable of. David also made Jade a better person by introducing her to his friends and influencing her to become social and eventually accept her older brother's death. Third, I thought David and Jade's love story was beautiful from start to finish. I really found myself understanding how much they cared about the other. I thought the scenes where they spent the last few weeks together before Jade was suppose to leave for her internship portrayed this perfectly. To me, their love felt flawless and their love for each other never annoyed me like most romantic movies usually succeed in doing. Although I did enjoy this movie, there were a few things that I could have done without. First, I felt that the story had too many things happening at once. I don't really understand why the writers and director thought Jade's dad having an affair would be a great idea to add to the story. I thought the movie could have done without that. Also, I think the story could have done without Jade's car accident. I understand it was a way to introduce the restraining order, but overall I thought that the restraining order could have been introduced in a more creative approach. Second, I felt the character 'Mace' could have been improved. I loved his character at the beginning of the story. I was under the impression that he was a true best friend for David and would have done anything to see him happy due to the fact he tried desperately to introduce David to Jade at graduation and begged for Jade to get in the car with David at the country club valet. However, as the story continued, I felt that Mace did an unexpected 360 change in attitude. He started out as a funny best friend that wanted to see his friend get the girl he has been wanting since the beginning of high school and suddenly turned into just a friend who didn't really care about David or his love for Jade at all. Third, I didn't really like the fact David and Jade had sex less than a week after they really got to know each other. I felt the sex scene should have came after the scene where David confesses his love for Jade and Jade decides to back out of the internship. To me, the sex scene just felt rushed and not needed. It was as if the director and producers just threw the scene in there because it was expected in a movie of this genre. In conclusion, I would highly recommend to give this movie a chance at least once in your life. You will find yourself wrapped up in this flawless teen love story and maybe even shed a tear at the perfect ending. I think 'Endless Love' is the perfect description of a love that every girl has ever dreamed of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is AWFUL~</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last week, I thought it was okay (the characters having no personalities or likable qualities aside) but then I saw Endless Love (1981) tonight, the movie this is supposedly based on.I would just like to say to the writers: What the heck even is this drivel?!? These are two completely different movies! The only similarities between the original and this mess are the character's names but even then an important character (David's Mom) is missing and David's last name was changed. Why keep the character's names and then change a last name? in the original, there was no older brother dead from cancer, no internship, no "Jade needs to be a doctor!", there was no token black friend, there was no breaking into the zoo, going to a beach house, no wedding (of Jade's brother) and not even a graduation.Instead in the 1981 version there was a psych ward, emotion, love letters, an arson, Jade's father being run over by a taxi, separation of both David and Jade's parents, a liberal hippie mom, a realistic sex scene and a planetarium.Did the writer think that today's teens could not handle these things?I really liked the 1981 version and if you need other reasons to watch it they used Endless Love by Lionel Richie in the soundtrack, it does not appear in the 2014 version. Brooke Shields is also very young and beautiful. The kid who plays David is a looker too. Don't waste your time with this terrible excuse for a remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Idyll... Love at first sight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just finished watching this film...to be honest I am still speechless... This film is what most Teenagers who are single have been waiting for! We all want to find the one and this is truly love at first sight! The bond between the two teenagers "Jade" and "David" is similar to a spark. They simply belong together as if they were twins. The plot has so many twists and surprises that the viewer is hooked right until the end. I love the way Shana Feste finished the end, I understand that it is a bit cliché with the happy Hollywood ending but I must admit she did a great link back to the title of the movie..as a viewer I do feel the infinite love between the two characters and the actors reflect it immaculately. It is truly Endless! This film conjures up feelings in the viewer from devotion to commitment...from fury to sadness.. finally to happiness...Today, many people in our society choose to leave one another for someone else. Someone new, who ignites their feeling of love once again. At one point in the film we can sympathise with "Ms.Butterfield" (starred by Joely Richardson) who is the type of woman who bares pain and accepts the fact that his husband has an affair with another woman as we see when "David" (Starred by Alex Pettyfer) catches the husband in the basement kissing another woman.. the viewer understands that he no longer loves her.Moreover, this film is quite realistic...I am sure that most of you who are reading this post either have first hand experience or understand that sometimes our inner animal instincts in our own families are unleashed and we all fall out and become unstoppable. This can be seen right near the end of the film. The structure is well organized and follows through exactly the way it should.I highly recommend this film to my friends and colleagues.Great film if you are craving for some real juicy love!

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as people are saying, but still has problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to realize that the targeted audience for this movie is young teenage girls, but with that said, I'm a 19 year old girl, and I still found parts of this movie to be cheesy and cliché and predictable at times. But it's still a decent, enjoyable movie. It was beautifully filmed, and the actors did a great job. The problem I had with this movie was how quickly their romance began. It was only around 3 scenes into it when they started to "fall in love" and honestly it felt kind of rushed. And I hate how they make her Father out to be the bad guy, when I agree with him for the first half of the movie. I don't think any parent would like to see their daughter throw away a once in a lifetime internship opportunity for a stranger she barely knows who is a criminal and has had a violent past. Any parent would react the way he did, if not worse. I also don't like how they make it seem like it's such a horrible thing for her to spend her time reading books instead of "living", like she's a 17 year old girl, it's not a crime for her to stay in and not have sex and party.There are a couple scenes that made me cringe due to how cheesy they were, like when she walked into the café/restaurant and saw him sitting in the booth with that other girl, and of course she jumps to conclusions and thinks there is something going on, when clearly absolutely nothing was going on. It was very over dramatic, and during that scene they said the most cliché lines ever like "I'm just not good enough for you", and "You're a coward, you need to fight for love" and various things like that, and it just bothered me.Other then the cliché scenes and some predictability, it was still one of the better modern teen romance movies I've seen. Typically, modern teen romance movies these days are just horrific, but this one wasn't as bad as people are saying it is. But what I don't understand is people comparing this to The Notebook. The Notebook is the king of all romance movies, and it's offensive to compare the greatest love story of all time to a movie like this. Not to mention, I didn't get emotional once during this movie, which is rare because I'm an emotional person, so I found that odd.I would still recommend seeing it. It's a decent movie, and it's not as bad as the critics and everyone says it is. I just really wanted to love it, and I only liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Spoiler Alert*** I found this movie to be rather refreshing, Many of these reviews to be scathingly harsh. I thought who quickly the main characters fell for each other was brilliant. Most movies drag it on forever, where as this one it was rushed but it didn't feel rushed. You could tell there had been a backlog of feelings that were suppressed that once they came out they flourished. The movie also reminded me of just how dedicated true love could be, which was nice to see in a romantic genre movie. While cheesy and cliché have been tossed around, it was done rather well and exceeded my expectations. Yes, some moments were predictable but 99% of this genre is. I do think it would have benefited from slightly more action/drama added to the plot line. Overall B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6.0? You must be joking me! This film deserves a 10? It's not just a romantic chick flick, the amount of tension in this film makes you want to scream, there's parts that make you want to cry, there's also parts where you want to rip, jades dads' head off, but yeah, there is the amazing love between David and Jade, it's not the typical teenage love story, it truly is amazing, it looks at love from a completely different perspective. The adventures they go on, the things they do, it's lovely to watch. This film is incredibly made, the music matches every moment perfectly, the way they show everything is amazing. The build up to things is spot-on, I watched this at the cinema on valentines, and I am 100% going to buy in on DVD! I'm still debating going to see it at the cinema again. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film follows David (Alex Pettyfer) who has had a long-lasting crush on beautiful rich girl Jade (Gabriella Wilde). It is on the day of their high school graduation when their two worlds collide. As the poor city boy and the sheltered rich girl's love begin to grow, the disapproval of Jade's father (Bruce Greenwood) does as well. He will stop at nothing to keep the two young lovers apart, and it will test the limits of how strong David and Jade's love truly is. Endless Love definitely follows the footsteps of previous romance films, despite being a remake and an adaptation of a book of the same name. However, that doesn't prevent the film from being a powerful love story on its own. The characters are so lovable and more than anything you want their love to prevail and want everything to work out for them. We watch as they begin their cute encounters upon first meeting, and we gradually see their love grow more and more, and as the story goes on, we can literally feel the love between them despite the obstacles. It's definitely not a fresh love story, but anyone with a heart and has a strong belief in love can see so much deeper into his. Despite what critics and other reviews say, this is a powerful love story that shows how powerful love can be and how much we want to give that love to someone else.Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde have AMAZING chemistry, enough to where it really helps you believe this couple is in love. Not since Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams in The Notebook has one been able to literally feel the love and chemistry two actors have to display on screen. On their own, the two actors do just as an amazing job. Wilde provides a lot beauty and innocence to her role as the girl who wants to throw away her sheltered and rich life to be with the one she loves most. Pettyfer proves a strong performance as a guy who will stop at nothing to be with the one he loves. He displays his full range as an actor when it involves his character confronting his past demons and deeper emotions. Despite the harsh reviews that will come its way, Endless Love is a truly powerful love story that only people who are deeply in love, have deeply loved, or strongly believe in love will appreciate. It is only those like critics and those who haven't experienced love or really believe in it that will be blinded to the film's overall meaning. On top of that, we have the two solid performances by the leads to lift the film up to higher standards than most recent romantic dramas.My Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I went into the theater pretty reluctant since lately Hollywood seems that they have run out of ideas lol, nevertheless I have to say I really like this movie. I know this movie doesn't stay true to the novel, got it. In this time that we are living at times we want to see something refreshing as oppose to the original that seemed pretty depressing, its refreshing to believe that real love exists.. In my opinion this movie basically just let's us know what we are never too late for love, and that if it is real it can surpass anything, love conquers all. I really didn't enjoy the original as both of these movies the protagonists are victims of circumstance, meanwhile in the first movie it just seemed so sad that aka "David" no matter how much he tried he could never be with "Jade" yet again I felt in the original that it was more of an obsession rather than Love". It might have been like this in the novel, but in todays society why are we going to see a depressing movie? there is so much sadness in the world already. The movie varies quite differently in the original as oppose to this rendition. In the original we all know that "jade aka "Brooke Shields" was already the girlfriend of David" its that their love was soo toxic that couldn't get enough of each other, meanwhile in this rendition, David has always loved her from a far but they never had a relationship, so right there its a different plot. In this movie you see what is to love, not obsession just victims of love, as oppose to the original seemed more of an obsession. To be quite frank I always wondered in the original whether Jade's mom was in love with David? and in this rendition, she makes it clear, that she loves the way David loves her daughter. I am not into remakes but I make an exception for this one. ******SPOILER**************(The house doesn't burn down as oppose to the original and it happens under different circumstances. well that's just my opinion I was born in the 80's so I saw the original when I was older and I can compare that this movie is much better granted its not true to the novel but I am a Hopeless Romantic so why not.Review from The White Tall Green eye from Spain raised in The US :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Little Comparison To The Original "Which is Actually Good"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Endless Love", is about two young teenagers who fell madly in love with each other at first sight.The original "Endless Love", was an early 80's movie, which had a similar concept. This was a lot different than most reproductions of original movies, which is actually good, as the original "Endless Love", was nothing to write home about.I'm not even sure why they had to have any correlation to the original movie, as this was a totally different plot than the original. But, for some reason they used some of the original screen names, and there was a fire, and the young female was riding on the handle bars of a bicycle, being driven by her boyfriend.Both Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde give a pretty solid performance as the young couple. Pettyfer plays the sensitive boyfriend and he looked a lot more comfortable in this role than in his previous performance on "Magic Mike". Gabriella Wilde shows a lot of emotion, but she comes off as a little naive. I thought Robert Packer, who portrays David's Father, was the most convincing as a single parent that is very supportive of his son.Overall, I'm glad this was not a replica of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take it for what it is and you won't be disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've taken my time to browse through some of the reviews, and largely disagree with many of the negative ones. Complaints focus on too cliché, flat and predictable storyline and a lack of psychological depth,specifically in the ''pure goodness'' of certain characters that is upheld all throughout the movie. Dissatisfaction was also expressed with the level of obsession of the boy with the girl (as was apparently emphasized in the book).However, I don't think the movie was meant to head in that direction. Its a romantic movie- it omits most of the psychological drama, though still containing scenes with sad out turns. There is no denying that clichés are abundant to a point where they become superfluous, but it's what countless teen romance movies have done before. Those aggravated by the frequency simply can not take the movie for what it is and keep relating it back to the original or book (neither of which I have seen/read).The movie did, however, lack a certain realism. Everything happened very fast. Upon first meeting, David and Jade instantly fall in love. On the first family meeting, David talks ardently of true love while intently looking at Jade. It literally goes from 0-100 in 1 day.The cast is surprisingly good. I loved mostly everyone, and drama scenes were acted out very believably. Many were moderately touching and would have probably been regarded as more noteworthy if the movie wouldn't constantly go back to cliché-tinted reuniting of the two protagonists.In truth, a very heartwarming love story that builds upon old clichés, but nonetheless succeeds in grabbing our attention and slowly entangles us until we come to root for its characters. At times a little superficial and melodramatic, but definitely worth the watch supposing you don't have the false expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy, but solid. 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Endless Love" was a movie I went into expecting nothing more than sappy garbage. What I did find out though, is that this movie is well shot, and well acted. This film is a remake of the 1981 Brooke Shields movie of the same name, but this is a real step-up from that awful movie. This is one of the few cases in which the remake is far superior to the original. The movie stars the beautiful Gabriella Wilde(Carrie, The Three Musketeers), who delivers a stand up performance, and doesn't just come off as the usual romantic interest. The movie also stars Alex Pettyfer(Magic Mike, Beastly), who delivers his usual performance. The main flaw of the movie is the story itself, many times plot lines would be opened and not touched upon again. But the actors really hold the movie together. While this film may seem like the usual romantic schlock spat out of Hollywood, it does in fact deliver more than you'd expect walking in. "Endless Love" is not the next "Say Anything...", it is worth an hour and forty minutes of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect for Hopeless Romantics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i saw this movie only got a 5.8 out of 10, I was shocked. I tried to think of reasons why people could have been disappointed with it but came up with none. So I read through some of the reviews and completely disagreed with them. I've never seen the original movie so I cant say anything in comparison to it. However, what I do know is that this movie was truly amazing. Maybe its just because I am a hopeless romantic but this movie was different from other romance movies. It made me see things from a different perspective. David and Jude's love seemed so real and I found myself continuously getting caught up in the movie. When the movie ended I instantly wished for there to be a second movie. The movie seemed so short and there was no part in the movie that made me uninterested or bored. I would definitely recommend this movie and I would even go see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Is Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie yesterday and I must say that it was simply fantastic. It so well documented and the director makes sure that he ties up loose ends by the end of the movie. I do recommend this movie for teens and young adults since it strikes a younger audience rather then the older audience. This movie is full of joy and you are guaranteed to walk away with your money's worth. both guy and girl actors were very good at their roles and they did a splendid job on many of the more intimate scenes! When I first walked in I thought that the movie was just going to be another spin off of The Notebook or Dear John but I must admit that I was surprised and happy that my money went to such a good movie. I haven't seen a good movie in a long time so I am happy to give credit where it is due!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a really sweet movie. People are judging this movie way too harshly because they're comparing it to past films. However, we must remember that not everything has to be realistic and that this movie is just being modernized to today's technology. I am not a fan of these types of movies, but this one gets a thumbs up. The movie was so fantastic that I watched it twice in theaters. The movie also has a really good soundtrack! The actors and actresses in the movie aren't that well recognized which makes it more genuine than seeing the usual Hollywood faces. The movie has its humorous moments, so it's not completely serious. Yet, the movie is not completely wrapped around the couple's love story either. The movie also portrays the tremendous pain of losing a child and the guilt and agony it comes along with it. I repeat, great film, most definitely recommended.</fullReview>
