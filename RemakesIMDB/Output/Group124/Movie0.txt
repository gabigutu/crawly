		<shortDescription>Special memory for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has special meaning for me. I remember being 16 when I took the "love of my life" (who was 15) to see it. I had not seen it since...until tonight. For some reason, I had been thinking about this movie lately and looked on EBay and got it yesterday. I watched it tonight and cannot believe the memories it brought back. I was surprised to remember a lot of the scenes and lines throughout. It also made me terribly sad to remember that my "love" passed away in a car accident 3 years after we saw it together. The title song gets me every time. I cannot honestly say whether or not this is a "good" movie as far as "good" movies go. But I can say without a doubt that after watching this tonight for the first time in 25 years, this movie takes my heart to a place it hasn't been to since 1984 and made me remember an unforgettable night in 1981.I guess that's what certain movies do, be it "good" or "bad".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it weren't for the book....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film wouldn't seem so awful if the book hadn't been so moving and extraordinary. Zeffirelli said in an interview that he was changing it so the love of the two teens was mutual, and not one-sided, and that I believe was his mistake. The book is not about love at all, it's about obsession. Readers have complained that we don't meet Jade until halfway through the book and she hardly seems to merit all that fixation, but that's the point. It's all in David's head.In the book, when they reunite, he's trying to make them have sex exactly the way they did years ago. The opening pages show him looking through their window, feeling banished from this "wonderful perfect family," but he ignores all the clues that they are nothing of the kind: when he sets the fire, they can't cope because they are all on acid, in what the mother later describes as a last-ditch effort to bring the family together. The mother watches her daughter have sex in order to live vicariously, because her own marriage is falling apart. The father sneaks stimulants into his daughter's food because he believes in homeopathy. The brother, we later learn, brought David home as he brought other classmates home, mostly to impress them with how cool and hip the family is and then dump them when he gets bored (we learn later from an old classmate David meets on the plane that the brother did the same thing to him). David is obviously emotionally fragile to begin with, but these horrible poseurs are exactly the people he doesn't need to meet. They exploit him as an audience for their Coolness Quotient and then dump him without regard for what they might be doing to him. He's a psycho alright--but if he weren't, he might see through them, which he obviously hasn't done, even by the end of the book.Little of this was conveyed in the movie, which also did not keep Spencer's late-'60s setting, which would have made the Butterfields' boho weekend-hippie aspirations more understandable. A lot of suburban people were trying to prove how groovy they were back then: look at mainstream magazines like Ladies' Home Journal or Newsweek and you'll see articles on open marriages, the pill, and symbolic meanings of Beatles Album covers. The respective talents (or lack thereof) of Shields and Hewitt have been the subject of much debate and jeering, but I don't think much could be done with a script that jettisoned the essential unreliable narrator aspect of the book (i.e., what David *thinks* he's telling us about the Butterfields and himself is not necessarily what we decide to believe after we've heard some of the details). All we have left is the star-crossed lover thing, and that has been done by Zeffirelli himself in R&amp;J, and modernized in West Side Story. Without Shakespeare's words or Bernstein's music, or any novel element or perspective, it's hard to justify doing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie gave me my first lesson in Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was just a young teenager when I snuck into the theater to see this one. This was the first "Love Story" I really ever watched, and I was touched. I was snatched away into the world of Jade and David, and seduced by the emotion and feelings. By the end, when the movie reaches it's climax, I was in tears. My heart was breaking for each of the charactors. Yes, I was young and emotional, but this movie made an impression on me and gave me my first lesson in Love. I snuck in two more times, just to feel those tears again. I Loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie again for the first time in almost 20 years. This was the greatest, it really touched me when i was a teenage. I saw it with my first love and still to this day I think of him when I see it or think about it. After reading the other comments on this movie it is hard for me to understand how some people dont love it. I think i love it so much because of when i first saw it, I was a teenage in 1981 and it was like nothing i ever saw before. People who are seeing it for the first time now might not get it the same way. My daughter is a teen now and I would like to watch it with her and see what she thinks. this movie will always have a special place in my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not a terrible movie, despite the wooden performances of the two lead actors. But this story of obsessive love and tragedy never becomes involving or interesting, and feels like it's much too long despite the relatively short running time.The film does have two redeeming factors: beautiful cinematography and the legendary title song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the praised novel of the same name, this film deals with the obessive love between two teenagers during a span of about 5 years. With all the talent behind this, including the director, Brooke Shields, and the source of the material you would think this would be a terrific movie, but don't be fooled. It is awful. The two leads are OK, but the rest of the cast just hams it up in a most embarrasing way, the script is really lumpy, the editing perfectly awful, and the direction nowhere near as good as the directors previous efforts (which include Romeo and Juliet and The Taming of the Shrew). Some people may find it good on a so bad its good level. Others beware. My rating: 3 out of 10. (because the title song is excellent)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember reading the book about 4 years ago and really liked it so if I forgot something from it I apologize. I understand that certain things in the movie must change from the book but sadly it you make changes the change has to make sense. This didn't happen.1. These two leads are terrible! I can honestly say that Edward and Bella had more things to say than this. They at least had a conversation about science together. David and Jade just like saying how much they love each other and how they couldn't be apart from one another. That's it. There is no character development from them and no reason for them to stay together. Plus no offense to the actors but there not good at playing these roles. Maybe it's the directors fault but it still is terrible. David is unpleasant to watch which was part of the book but they should have at least made him understanding enough for the audience which sadly he isn't and makes his role as leading male disturbing. Jade is just a whiny teenage girl that I've seen before.2. The side characters are obnoxious and eerie to watch. The dad is totally crazy, the mother is honestly one of the more frightening mother roles I've ever seen, the other characters are dull and the only one who deserves the one star I'm giving this movie is James Spader. He did a pretty good performance for what he was given.3. The story is just a mess of problems. Why didn't the dad throw David off his property since technically he was trespassing and refusing to leave? Why did the judge say he couldn't contact Jade yet David is seen sending her letters? Why didn't the dad do anything when he saw naked David in his daughters room and then she went in with only a towel on? Yeah, motivations in this movie are apparently just silly myths.This could've been a good movie. I could see potential behind it but sadly this movie fell flat on its face. The romance doesn't work, the characters don't work and sadly the story doesn't work. When those three things don't work in a romance movie you sadly have a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endless Love 1981 - Why is this not out on DVD?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of movies that were released in the 80's. I can't believe that this movie has not been released in the United States on DVD as of yet??? I have been searching for it and found out it has been released in other countries, but not here yet. I really enjoyed this movie when I was younger and know that even this generation would really enjoy it. I think it would be a great seller and rental. This movie was aired on television several times after it's release at the movie theaters and I know it was a big hit. I hope the production company considers releasing this great movie. I hope that maybe if enough people request it they will listen. This movie was a great coming of age movie that shows a great love story of two young people who have to fight to stay together. It reminds me of a modern Romeo &amp; Juliet. I know it was released on VHS, but never on DVD. It you come across it I recommend you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little clarification; and Martin is still gorgeous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, okay....just a little bit of clarification here for the nay-sayers who don't like this film (OBVIOUSLY folks who never had an intense first love in their teen years - and you DON'T need a burning house to have felt that....)1. WHY DID David BURN DOWN THE HOUSE? A lot of commenters have said they don't know why David "burned down the house." It was not his INTENTION to burn down the house. David's friend (played by Tom Cruise in his acting debut - which I thought would have made his lines more memorable to most folks!) explains how a friend (or it may have been his brother) wanted to get a girl's attention that had broken up with him. He lit some wet newspapers on her front porch which "smoked like hell" - NO FIRE. The friend (or brother) then yelled to everyone in the house that there was a fire and got everyone to "safety" - without there ever having been a real fire. This made him a hero in the eyes of the family. Problem was - the newspapers at Jade's house weren't wet enough, so the house actually caught fire.2. WHY DOES JADE'S MOTHER SIT ON THE STEPS AND SMILE AS HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER HAS SEX? If you've watched the movie up to this scene, you'll know why. Jade's mom is a complete hippie - all about free love, expressing yourself, living in the moment, etc. etc. It is blatantly obvious that she is not the typical "mom" who would scream in hysterics at the site of her daughter having sex. She finds it beautiful, she feels the love that David and Jade share and leaves them to their "free love." "Daddy" doesn't feel quite the same way, of course.3. FOR THOSE, LIKE ME, WHO THOUGHT MARTIN HEWITT WAS THE HOTTEST THING ON TWO LEGS - HE STILL IS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Endless Love is one of those movies I can watch over and over; it really is that good - that's my opinion, of course. David is someone I can identify with; he's an only child and that makes him selfish and needy. Evidently, David stands out as a student both academically and as a risk taker. He is very clever yet very foolish. As an only child myself, I sympathize with and understand (but not encourage or condone)his wacky misguided behavior. Some people think that Martin Hewitt was miscast; I strongly disagree. By most peoples' standards, Hewitt is a handsome guy; he'd have to be to attract Brook Shields. No problem there! The relationship is based on physical attraction; from Jade's viewpoint this is doubly true. No miscast. James Spader made his start here, and his portrayal of Keith no doubt is what propelled him to higher success. In my mind Sex, Lies and Video Tape was his best but this was a close second. Keith is all too real; he's the stud who leads David on and betrays him; his agenda is as speculative as Mrs. Robinson's! Nevertheless, Keith goes on doggedly to rectify what he personally sees as a huge mistake. Spader brilliantly imparts a sense of honor and responsibility to, in the hands of a lesser actor, what would seem like mindless cruelty. "Just because you're xing my sister ..." What a great line! When David finally fights back in the Vermont hotel, I was cheering! There are loose ends. How did the police determine David's guilt about the fire? Did David admit it? The movie should have made it clear because a) Keith shows guilt for knocking David unconscious and b)Hugh saves David (and no doubt he regrets it later). And then there's the unclear ending. If any movie needed a clear happy ending, it was Endless Love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misunderstood masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was misunderstood from the beginning because since early childhood we have been taught such nonsense as "beauty is only skin deep" , "don't judge a book by its cover," and "look for a soul mate with brains." Endless Love is about the overwhelming beauty of teenage Brooke Shields. Yes, she was and is a horrible actress, but in EL that didn't matter. It was about a boy obsessed with her unearthly beauty. This is a very hard theme to accept in a world where "everyone is beautiful in their own way" because everyone isn't beautiful to anything close to the degree that Brooke was at that age.Like Flaubert's Madame Bovary, the story was inspired by a more or less unresearched news clip about a similar incident (boy obsessed by girl burns her family home), but there was no attempt made to explore motivation other than the moth-in-flame attraction of Martin Hewitt. The movie can drive, therefore, straight to the psyche and skip the dull niceties of psychological inquiry. In its own way the film is simple and brutally honest. It explores a facet of the human existence that we often wish to ignore: the worship of pure physical beauty. This theme creates anger and derision in many people who simply feel that intellectually the human race has progressed beyond the point where Hewitt is at in the story. The reaction comes off as something like "grow up." But we have not totally grown up with regard to our attraction to physical beauty. It is just something we try to stifle intellectually, like the thing to do and think.The movie also recalls the later-in-life trials and tribulations of Leni Riefenstahl, her quest for 3rd Reich-like eugenics in the 1970s-80s among the physically stunning Nuba of Africa. Few people are aware that Riefenstahl was once again nearly blackballed (especially in Europe) for her cinematography with the Nuba. First it was beautiful people on mountains, then beautiful Nazis, finally beautiful naked African bodies.There is a direct relationship between Riefenstahl's eugenics and Endless Love. Both create a kind of poo-poo porn rejection in viewers who prefer repressing their non-intellectual magnetism to human aesthetics. As I said, our mothers taught us to "look at what's inside." A great part of our make-up does not always want to look there. In this way, EL is counter-cultural and even threatening. It is easier to call the acting bad (which it is) and the motivation flimsy (which it is not) than to confront this part of our human character.I rate the movie high for its daring theme, the beauty of its teenage actors (not just Shields, but look also at James Spader at that age)and its bold originality. Yes, it was a paen to Brooke, but she deserved one at that time. Nature did not produce many of her ilk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what everyone was talking about. This movie is great. I'm shocked at the low review and glad it didn't keep me from watching this movie, even though it almost did. I do agree that the performance left much to be desired, but they did have passion for each other. It was just the acting... Anyway, I didn't read the book and I think that was where the problem laid with a lot of people. It's rare that you will read the book and then watch the movie and be satisfied. Especially if it's a book you love. I'm glad I went into it not knowing much about it. I do have to say how teed off I am about the huge spoiler in the description which tells what David did to the house, like WTHeck?! That doesn't even happen until halfway into the movie,Jesus! Anyway, good watch. I will definitely watch it again and read the book. It was a beautiful tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I borrowed this movie at my local video store because I am a fan of Brooke Shields. I honestly don't see why people bag this film as much as they do these days. It is a sweet, even if a little cheesy film with great performances by all the cast (some better than others). One of it's bad points is that it's a little too 80's - which may explain why it hasn't aged that well. But I think this movie should not be put down as much as it has, and is worth viewing, especially if your a lover of romance. Another great point in this movie is it's title song and theme "Endless Love" by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross. This song is beautiful and the movie would not be the same without it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved this movie, but I'm a teenager(15 year-old). This maybe the difference... Older people would believe this film is horrible, stupid.Yes, it contains a history more similar to the teenagers life, which deal with these kinds of difficulties through this period. The passion that the couple lives together made me think that, who knows this still exists nowadays. A thing that really made me "angry" was the attitude of Jade's father,you can't give liberty and take it off all of a sudden, and talking about teenagers, it's even worse! Oh,the love theme is lovely,just perfect for the film...the only thing is that stays forever in your ears(I'm not sure if you get it..:P).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Endless Love (1981) is a romantic drama directed by Franco "Romeo and Juliet" Zeffirelli, starring Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt as the two young lovers Jade &amp; David who go through thick and thin just to be with each other. The problem is that Jade's free love parents Ann and Hugh allow the young lovers to spend too much time together initially and when they try to act like disciplinarian parents, the cow has left the barn and there's no way it's going back in. Now forbidden to see each other, their love now knows no bounds as it reaches to a point where only something drastic and dramatic lies awaiting.Based upon the novel "Endless Love" which was written by Scott Spencer and it's a much darker tale loosely based upon the writer's life. I found the movie to be a sweet and over-the-top melodramatic flick that's highly entertaining for all the wrong reasons. Brooke Shields demonstrates her acting abilities that were never quite truly harnessed to their fullest potential whilst director Franco Zeffirelli tries to recreate "Romeo and Juliet" all over again. Martin Hewitt is basically a cipher who goes through the motions, not horrible just there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic tale of "boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy burns down girl's house..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Endless Love" is one of those films that asks you to accept some rather inappropriate and bizarre behavior as normal, and to sympathize with an obsessed stalker. Throw in gratuitous nudity and it's hard not to see why this ruined Brooke Shields' movie career.The film basically demonstrates what happens when two teens, David and Jade, start dating and their parents let them do whatever they want. David's parents have the excuse of being oblivious but Jade's parents... oh wow... where to begin? They do drugs with their kids and throw wild parties. They condone David spending the night in Jade's room. Both parents catch them and while the father does get mad the mother calmly stands there and watches them have sex! Her father even sees David brazenly walking around naked in his daughter's room with the door wide open.It's only when an exhausted-from-constant-lovemaking Jade tries to swipe some sleeping pills and starts dozing off in class that common sense finally prevails and the father forbids David and Jade from seeing each other albeit temporarily. David protests and pleads his case, which is normal. What he does next, however, is not.An idiot friend of David's talks him into anonymously setting Jade's porch on fire with the intent that he would come back to rescue them. The big dummy actually does this, the fire gets out of control, and the house burns down. Gee, who could've seen THAT coming? David confesses and gets sent for psychiatric observation. While I applaud that they didn't gloss over the consequences of his actions, this is where the movie takes a really dark turn as David starts to become obsessed, and I mean "Fatal Attraction" obsessed.He does nothing but pine for Jade and write letters to her every day. He blows off therapy sessions and begs his parents repeatedly to get him out despite the fact that he refuses to get better. In addition, Jade's parents divorce and they move to New York. David's parents do likewise and I can't say I blame them.Finally, he gets released and what does he do? He goes to New York to track her down. The craziness only escalates as he finds Jade's mother only to have her hit on him but David's too obsessed to care. Jade comes to his hotel room to let him down easy only for him to shamelessly beg her to take him back and pretty much rape her. Since no one behaves like a real person in this movie, this wins her over. Then he has a contrived encounter with her father just so the idiot can be run over as he chases David across the street.This culminates in a scuffle in a hotel lobby when Jade's brother accuses David of killing their father and ends with David being arrested and likely sent back to the nut house which is where he sadly belongs. Jade, who still can't get the hint, has a heart-to-heart with her mother about taking him back and the movie closes on her coming to visit him while he's locked up. I think my heart skipped a beat. The film's biggest problem is that is treats David and Jade's relationship as one you're supposed to root for when, in reality, it's puppy love gone horribly wrong. We never see how they got together, they never fight, disagree, or have any kind of meaningful conversation, and they constantly have sex. Everything about the movie wants you believe this is true love: the writing, the acting, even the soundtrack. Sort of makes you wonder if anyone ever told Lionel Richie what the movie was really about before he wrote the classic title track. It doesn't help the film beats you over the head with the song either.The film also has pacing issues once David gets locked up. It says two years have passed but there's not much to indicate this and there's even less sense of time once David goes to New York. The movie shifts focus solely to David and Jade just drops off the face of the earth for forty-five minutes. What's especially weird is that two years would only make Jade seventeen and probably still in high school so how's she wandering around New York and making trips to David's hospital unsupervised? And you can definitely tell that Brooke Shields can not pass for seventeen or eighteen.The Razzies would have you believe that the main cast gave bad performances, but I have to disagree on this one. Shirley Knight puts in a believable performance for perhaps one of the worst mothers ever portrayed on film and Martin Hewitt does a respectable job playing essentially a crazy stalker. A young James Spader proves early on that he plays a great smug jerk. Brooke Shields does the best she can pretending to have sex when it's quite obvious she hasn't, although instead of pulling her toe couldn't someone have at least demonstrated the kind of faces a person makes when they're making love? And she's still nowhere near as bad as say, Jaden Smith in "After Earth" or Selena Gomez in "Getaway." It's the story that really fails them. It's one of those stories that the more effort the actors put in, the worse it looks. The movie wants you to believe it's true love when what's shown on screen is unhealthy obsession. Instead, it ends up a cautionary tale about mistaking lust for love and what can happen when parents don't set boundaries for their children and I really don't think that's what they were going for here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The darker version of the teen love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2014 the newest version of this story came out in movie form. Both are based on the same book, and the core story is the same, but overall the two are developed quite differently and end quite differently. I just watched the 2014 version, so I re-watched this one so that I could have a same-time comparison of the two.This one has a lower IMDb rating but in many respects it is a better movie. It was quite daring for the time, with a fairly graphic love affair between a high school senior boy and a 15-yr-old girl in Chicago. In fairness, the young actress used a body double for the most revealing scenes, but it was till pretty daring. As was the scene where the girl's mother discovers the two of them naked, making love in her home, and only watching. And even more daring, a few years later tries to seduce the young man, now in his early 20s, character-wise.Not at all new to controversial roles, playing a 12-yr-old prostitute in "Pretty Baby" and playing a stranded girl getting pregnant in "Blue Lagoon", Brooke Shields is the 15-yr-old love interest Jade Butterfield. Her family seems pretty normal, until she and the boy, Martin Hewitt as David Axelrod, begin getting very close. So close in fact that he begins to sleep in Jade's bedroom. Mom doesn't seem to mind, she is happy that Jade is finding love, but dad gets to the point where he will do almost anything to break them apart for good.This version, probably closer to the source book, is quite dark and the ending is more ambiguous. It also has a very young Tom Cruise in a very small, but very important role.SPOILERS FOLLOW: As David and Jade get too close for comfort, and David is asked to stay away, one night he applied an idea he got from the Cruise character, he lit some newspapers on Jade's family's porch, started a fire that burned down their house. He received a suspended sentence if he would go into a mental hospital for therapy. He got out after two years and Jade's family had moved out east, and her parents had split up. When David went to NYC and the dad saw him, was hit and killed by a car while chasing David. Then he and a brother got into a fight, David ended up back in the prison hospital because he broke parole. The movie ends with him looking out a window with bars, as Jade walks in the direction of his building. As the title says, "endless love."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The purpose of this film, I felt was to exploit Brooke Shields' beauty and youth. I was sifting through the trivia and goofs sections for this film when I came across a few things that pretty much summed up how I felt after watching this crappy adaptation of a decent novel:Brooke Shields' mother and manager Teri Shields nearly turned down the film after first reading the script, as she felt the role of Jade Butterfield had no substance. She said "It was just going to be Brooke standing around looking beautiful." Well, Brooke Shields' mother (God rest your soul) you we right because that is all your D-grade actress daughter did in this film. If beauty has ever served a moderately talented actress well in Hollywood, it's Brooke Shields."Shirley Knight begged director Franco Zeffirelli to cast Rosanna Arquette, Linda Blair, Bo Derek, Carrie Fisher, Jodie Foster, Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kristy McNichol, Michelle Pfeiffer or Debra Winger for the role of Jade Butterfield, as she felt that 14-year- old Brooke Shields did not have the right talent for the role." Ding, ding, ding! Another one who was right but unfortunately ignored and the rest as they say is history. Thankfully, young Tom Cruise in his two-minute-role was brilliant as was young James Spader who was a force to be reckoned with as Jade's older brother, Keith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brooke shields a pop culture icon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Endless Love is the most talked about romantic film of all time . Brooke Shields has reshaped our thoughts and notions about the girl next door . i was really touched by the film and till this day i think of how deep it was . people who didn't like it were taken by how clichéd Brooke shields and romance films genre were reviewed in the media . they need to watch it again with objectivity. it gives a great message for all the teens out there who are just about to fall in love.it brings me back to the times where films were an event for people to discuss their feelings and ideas with honesty .i recommend this film on a nice rainy day with a glass of red wine and a warm blanket.thank you .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cross star-gazer, in love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My viewing companion, Calico Cat, and I both saw this film in the 80s. I remembered the astronomical models hanging from the ceilings of our hero and heroine better than any of the characters. Cat remembered Brooke Shields was in it, but wondered if there might also be a blue lagoon? Looking at the film now, it is surprising we did not remember it more. For a start, there is the weird costume Jade wears when we first see her. She isn't just wearing a lacy white dress, she actually has her hair pinned up with white roses, exactly as a bride would do. Despite her mother's eccentric sartorial taste, the party is clearly not a fancy dress one. So, what is going on with that? Why is Jade's father cuddling her like that? What on Earth is up with Jade's mother's voyeuristic tendencies? Cat and I even failed to remember that James Spader is in this (as Jade's older brother, Keith). His acting is good. Oddly, in the light of his subsequent career, none of the strange sexual undercurrents involve Keith. Spader does, however, embark on his habit of getting his shirt off even when the script does not require him to be topless! What did we dislike about the film? Certainly, I did not like the duck shooting scene. It made me feel highly unsympathetic to the three characters involved, and I am not sure that was the intended effect. I considered deducting a star or two from the rating I gave the film, but could not be sure if an actual duck had been shot. We hear a noise resembling a gun. We see something in the distance falling from the sky. I couldn't be sure if it was a real duck.However, our real problem is with "starcrossed" lovers David and Jade. I see why someone would love Jade. She is very sweet, and it is quite refreshing to see a female film star with thick eyebrows. It is also pleasing to see her name listed before that of her male co-star, as so many romance films list the male lead first.However, David (Martin Hewitt) just seems like a cross-star gazer. (He's into astronomy, hence the ceiling models.) Endless love? I wouldn't have stayed in love with him for the duration of the theme song (which certainly seems endless, and goes on beyond the end credits, accompanying a blank screen)! David even whines endlessly about the sentence he is given for arson. Come off it! Five years in a benign, if dreary, institution is lenient! It is only one year for each of the five lives he endangered. It is even worse that he committed arson because he didn't want to stay away from Jade for a paltry 30 days, during her exams.Hewitt is neither ugly nor a bad actor, but he has an impossible task trying to portray a whiny and reckless character as lovable or even likable. I found myself wishing there was a blue lagoon so that a creature would crawl out of it and eat him! There are things that make this worth watching, even though many of them are inanimate and dangle from ceilings. Oh, and we think Spader looks good in tight jeans.</fullReview>

The first thing that came to my mind were the first pictures of the movie and the FEELING &lt;- all with capital letters because this movie is not about the highest level of film-making but it did show emotions in their fullness - and it could have been the goal and I think this very movie did reach its goal.

		<fullReview>I can't believe this movie got made. It's so awful, and it's not awful in the typical way. It's just messed up. It's not messed up because the family is hippie-ish and whatnot, it's messed up because the characters in it do not act in any rational way whatsoever. The mother watches her fifteen year old daughter have sex and she enjoys it, the boyfriend lights the family house on fire after seeing the girl hold hands with another person, the mother comes onto the daughter's boyfriend, the father has this bizarre over-attachment to his daughter (he seems jealous about the daughter having a boyfriend). It's sick, twisted, and wrong.It may have been based on a good book, but you can't tell from watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a classic I'd recommend this film to all parents and all 15 &amp; 17 years old. All actors are great. Brooke and Martin are fantastic. Music is super. Franco Zeffirelli proves that is one of best directors. Story is original. Don Murry is very convincing as negative role of father. I hope that no one will try to make a remake because this one is one of a kind. They don't make such good love movies any more. Regarding the end of the movie part two would be very interesting, but it's a little to late or maybe not. I wonder if there is a new release of film on a DVD. VHS copies are probably in very bad condition so it would be nice to have a fresh copy on a DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too creepy to be a love story. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Endless Love' may seem like the usual story of teenage romance, carrying on a little too far and too much in that way that teenagers might when they first fall in love. But, this surpasses a tale of romance and instead is the story of young love and desire turned into a psychotic fixation.Brooke Sheilds plays Jade, the impressionable fifteen year old who's parents forbid her from seeing her boyfriend, David. Only destined to defy her parents, David accidentally burns down the family's house (oh yeah, that's going to go over smoothly with her folks), and is put in a psychiatric hospital. Years pass, and once he is released, David goes looking for Jade, trying to pick up exactly where they left off years ago. But, he is not merely a character who lost his love, but instead, turns things into an unhealthy fixation that borders on the psychotic, gradually making this a very creepy "love story." For me, this was terrible 80s material, and will most likely pique the interest of those who wish to see it merely because of the cast of young familiar 80s favorites (James Spader, Ian Ziering, Tom Cruise, Jami Gertz, etc.).</fullReview>

At least you can get drunk and laugh at Plan 9 from Outer Space. After Endless Love you just want to shoot whomever suggested it (yourself included).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rip-off of "Splendor in the Grass" (SPOILERS! And How!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Try to imagine a contemporary version of "Splendor in the Grass," updated for the early 1980's, with the genders reversed(i.e., the young man becomes the victim), and the young romantic couple fulfilling their sexual desires, and that pretty much describes this movie. If the theme song didn't nauseate you, the movie itself certainly will.Let me put it another way; Boy meets girl, girl meets boy, and it's love at first sight. They love each other so much that they have sex, something that Deanie Loomis &amp; Bud Stamper never got a chance to do(Hey, they both have liberal parents, who are rich too.). But society hates them for it, especially the girl's evil brother, played by James Spader, who spent the 1980's looking like Dave Hemmings in "Blow-Up," and the most of the decade playing young villains. So they talk the girl into breaking up with him. Then our hero/martyr cracks up, and is shipped off to a mental institution, which never would've happened if they were allowed to stay together. Eventually, the boy is judged "fit to enter society"(with conditions, of course), and they let him out. Neither one of them are happy, and his love cannot be denied. Learning that she's in New York City, he tries to reunite with her, despite those conditions, The evil brother learns that he's in town, tells her Dad, and when he sees him across a busy street, goes ballistic, only to be hit by a car, and killed. The boy tries to tell their family about this, the evil brother falsely accuses him of murder, and the N.Y.P.D. drag him off to prison. End of story. Now excuse me while I go barf.Since the late-1970's, critics have been slamming Hollywood for churning out sequels to movies whether they're good or bad. A movie like this is so bad, it may deserve a sequel. Perhaps one where D.N.A.-evidence, and common sense gives our hero a one way trip out of prison, and a chance to pay James Spader's character back for destroying their love-life, and his life altogether. I'm not holding out for such a movie though, and if it comes, I wouldn't bet on it being any good.</fullReview>

Her sometime boyfriend is apparently obsessive. We see the usual nebulous references to psychiatry, which was a prevalent plot twist during this time period. When a story plot could not gel, the psychiatric angle would be thrown in to the story (Think: "Prom Night", "Halloween" or "Lipstick").Don Murray as the ever concerned but clueless father, once again. Disjointed families, divorce and early 80's drama. Not the worst, but certainly could have been better.

		<fullReview>This movie is quite possibly the single most passionate, intense, thrilling film I've ever seen. Even the most badly love-burned person can start to believe in love again after seeing it. Martin Hewitt and Brooke Shields are definately candidates for the cinema's most memorable lovers, at least I think so. Anyone who likes drama and/or romance, will definately love this movie. Some people say the acting in this movie is bad. It is NOT bad at all unless you're looking for Shakespeare or something. The storyline is very original, away from the old cliche that is used over and over again in romance films. How many other romantic films feature the leading man attempting to set fire to his love's house, just because he loves her so much?? What a film. That is all I can say: what an amazing film. I'm waiting patiently for the DVD. I was lucky enough to get a copy of the VHS, which is a prized possession. To everyone, ignore ALL of the bad reviews. See this movie no matter what it takes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is ridiculous. I did not relate to the characters for one minute. I know how strong love can feel when you're young, but when a guy sets your house on fire, you're really still going to love him? And want to be with him? Also, that sentimental nonsense (showing how much they love each other) took way too long. I mean, really? 15 years old and you have sex in your parents' living room? (Maybe it's just that I'm too emancipated, but...) Don't have sex before age 17, kids! And NEVER in your parents' living room! And when you do, do it safe! Don't fall for this romantic crap. Almost half of the movie. At some point I just wanted to fast forward it. I did not "feel the love", which was probably partly to blame on the script and partly on the actors. Terrible movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was so much potential squandered by this film, it's a crime. Although I haven't read the book, I understand that considerable liberties were taken with the film; regardless, it is an illogical mess. How many mothers would admiringly watch their own high school aged daughters having sex in the living room, then pursue the teenage boyfriend?! How many idiots would think destroying their girlfriend's house via arson would be the way to win them over?!!!I am a HUGE fan of '80s movies and enjoy the distinctive look of films from this time. And I defy anyone to find a more beautiful creature than Brooke Shields in the '80s. But these are the only real bright spots, and can only overcome so much. The big appeal of this film to me is the idea of what it would have been like to have Brooke as your girlfriend back in high school (I'm not the only one!!), but unfortunately, you've got to endure her imbecile boyfriend who not only sets fire to her family home, but indirectly causes her father's death. By the midpoint of the movie, I was hoping SOMEONE would knock his lights out and that Brooke would leave him far, far behind. I'm sure any real family would feel the same way.Although I was a Brooke fan in the '80s and had seen Blue Lagoon, I never got around to seeing Endless Love for some reason. Nostalgia inspired me just last year to watch it for the first time. The only thing about this that has aged well is Brooke's timeless beauty and the beautiful theme song. The strength of these two things makes it worth watching, at least once....</fullReview>

Seriously, folks!Over the years, 1981's Endless Love has somehow turned into one of those ill-fated Teen/Tragedy/Love stories that gets itself royally trashed, time &amp; again.But regardless of its clichéd corniness, its peculiar character idiosyncrasies, and its emotional dysfunction overload, I found Endless Love to be a helluva lot better than I expected it to be. In fact, I had initially thought I was gonna hate this one, big-time, but that didn't turn out to be the case.Far from being the greatest love story ever told, Endless Love (a very bitter study of erotic obsession and the inability to let go) was generally entertaining but, at the same time, it was also a mighty hard pill to swallow, as well.*Trivia Notes* - Endless Love's title song (written by Lionel Richie and performed by Richie and Diana Ross) was an instant #1 hit on the record charts.In the part of "Billy", Tom Cruise, 19 at the time, made his feature-film debut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jade's mother watched them on the stairs making love because she herself was in love or had a crush on David. Remember when he went to see her in NYC and she tried to kiss him?? Just because Jade's family is eccentric doesn't make it hard to believe. He attempted to set wet papers on fire so he could look like the hero when he saved everyone in the house just like the story that Tom Cruise told. The impression in the end of the movie is that they will be together when he gets out. Brook's acting in this was sub par. I read somewhere that during the sex scenes the director would pinch her big toe so her face showed more emotion...? Who knows if that is true or not. The book is absolutely fabulous and much more involved story line than the movie. If you read the book you would understand how difficult it would be to adapt it to the screen. I thought the movie was good and got it's point across of young love and obsession but the book was sensational.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this Franco Zeffirelli??? Oh dear!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SEVERE SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!Franco Zeffirelli is one of my favorite directors. I have seen most of his movies and I must say they are "REAL CLASSICS" From his adaptation of Giusseppe Verdi's TRAVIATA (1982) through ROMEO AND JULIET (1968), THE CHAMP (1979) to his religious epics, like BROTHER SUN SISTER MOON (1972) and "Jesus of Nazareth" (1977). But this film is worse than any silly TV series about irresponsible love of two teenagers who want to show off to the world.The story itself is not worth considering. Love between a man and a woman is entirely different. It is not only sex but loyalty, understanding, and unity. Don't understand me wrong. I do think that sex IS important in a relationship but that is not something fundamental love is based on. A lot of examples of older marriages prove that. This movie, however, shows only sex. What is there if not Jade and David staring at each other and David making love to Jade on the floor while the mother of one is watching secretly. Come on!The cast are also not that great. Nothing special. Brooke is sexy as a young girl but that's all! I require something more from the movie than silly teenagers being lovesick. From the practical point of view, this film has nothing to say. This movie is a spoiler! Beautiful title "Endless Love" and the content ... Not worth a single attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Brooke Shields, but when mommy was running the career, it wasn't a good run. The movie is a little too intense for me and unrealistic. I never really knew why they loved each other. I spent most of the film psychoanalyzing it. David was obsessed with her because he had no love in his own family. In a sense, he attempted to make his own with Jade and her family. I love the "ENDLESS LOVE" theme song, but it does get a bit redundant as they play it ALL the time! I heard it in like 7 different melodies, and I think once in polka. Anywho, I didn't quite get the ending either. Are they still trying to make it work or aren't they? Is he still obsessed? I don't know, but I like absolution in films. It keeps me less annoyed with the film overall. It was such a typical 80's movie, what can I say? I'm not trashing it, but it could have been better. It was just too...I don't know...unrealistic is all I can grab at. I couldn't sympathize with their relation ship because you never saw the basis for why they loved each other. Then again, no one understands teenagers in movies. Everything they do appears stupid. I am one myself, and I'm offended that first love is taken so far. I don't see it ever working like that for most people. But, alas, these are the movies. Art rarely imitates life. What else can I say? The story is a little slow, but you get to see a young James (Jimmy) Spader act like a jerk (quelle suprise!) and Tom Cruise (who I figured out by voice, not by looks) acting a fool. It's funny to see who makes it in movies from back in the day. Who would've thought? Martin Hewitt went onto nothing and Tom Cruise, well, we know who he is. But, once again, I didn't feel the all-encompassing love they had for each other. You felt bad that their luck was so, well, unlucky, but maybe it's a sign. Anyway, give it a shot. The movie was very dark in lighting as well. People constantly popping up out of shadows, it was weird. Anywho, if you like Brooke, watch her having sex like she's usually doing in her teen movies. (By the by, it's probably not her you're seeing naked but a body double, cuz her face was turned and she was young when she did this movie.) Other than that, it'll leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Sorry all you fans.</fullReview>

If they actually took time to watch the film and pay attention to the juxtaposes that Zeffirelli lays out in the film they would discover that once again he laid the same type of groundwork that he did in Romeo and Juliet. How more emotional can you get than the story of young love, and children who don't quite understand what they are getting themselves into? The film drives you in, and you get caught up in the madness, and despite all the tragic events, you still find yourself feeling sorry for David. All the more throw in the hint of old school gothic romantic literature in which everything bad that can happen does too the extreme. How can you go wrong? I think one of the largest reasons that people despise movies (and literature) like that is simply because it is too involved and they just want something simple. If you like complicated emotional dramas, this film is a classic and some day will should be recognized as such....</fullReview>

Certainly an additional seat was needed to transport the immense ego of this overrated hack from Italy, who previously lucked out by making the one movie ,"Romeo and Juliet," that had a such a guaranteed audience it couldn't fail. I just hope Scott got a lot of money, 'cause seeing his fine novel turned into dung by this pretentious fraud must have been painful. Suffering through this poorly acted, horribly directed travesty has actually held me back from watching "Waking the Dead," which, while it my be a more respectful adaptation of a later Spencer novel does change some basic plot elements and eliminates several of the book's key characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess what stroke me the most is how far the film is from the actual book. A very bland and 'nice' version of it. All the essence and meaning of the book are lost into something soppy, superficial and totally commercial. Generally the story is horribly amputated of the core elements like the obsession and the passion. The worst are certainly the love scenes. I don't think I have seen love scenes so badly filmed and acted (what are these stupid smiles on Jade-Brooke Shields face when David is making love to her?). Also at some point in the film, when David goes to the Butterfield house after he's been banished, looking through the window, you can see Jade's dad snagging a young girl who looks like the age of Jade. This is barely noticeable but come on it just does not make sense with the rest of the story as it is presented in the film!! Curiously I can't say I absolutely disliked it. The cast is somehow good (even if the acting tends to be poor) and the film exudes nostalgia of the late 70's early 80's period. But that's all it is.Rated R for Nudity, Strong Adult Themes, Profanity and Sexual Situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to begin by saying that I have absolutely NO clue why people say this movie sucks. Everything about it is great! It has everything: the prettiest woman of all time, the most gorgeous man that ever lived, excellent as well as realistic acting, a beautiful theme song, and a plot that draws you in and keeps your eyes plastered to the screen until it sadly has to reach the end. I first saw this movie last February and have been collecting every last thing I can find on it ever since. The greatest thing about this movie is the fact that it stars Martin Hewitt. He is handsome beyond freakin' belief! The scene in the movie where Jade is slowly walking to where David stands on the stairs (as Susan sings "Endless Love") sends shivers up and down my spine. He looks so hot staring at her as she approaches the stairs. Everytime I watch the movie, I feel the need to keep rewinding that scene and the scene where David throws Jade on the bed because he can't bear to let her walk out of his life. They love each other so intensely! I know I'd be the happiest woman alive if Martin Hewitt loved me as much as his character, David, loves Jade. I adore this movie. I adore Martin Hewitt. Case closed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A horrible movie that you can't keep your eyes away from. It really deserves a treatment by Mystery Science Theater 3000. Franco Zefferelli! directs this bomb which has the debut of James Spader and Tom Cruise. It's actually fun to watch one more unbelievable plot point after another. The only quality aspects of production are the visuals and the song by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross but who cares, Shields seems to be naked the whole time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far so far from the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess what stroke me the most is how far the film is from the actual book. A very bland and 'nice' version of it. All the essence and meaning of the book are lost into something soppy, superficial and totally commercial. Generally the story is horribly amputated of the core elements like the obsession and the passion. The worst are certainly the love scenes. I don't think I have seen love scenes so badly filmed and acted (what are these stupid smiles on Jade-Brooke Shields face when David is making love to her?). Also at some point in the film, when David goes to the Butterfield house after he's been banished, looking through the window, you can see Jade's dad snogging a young girl who looks like the age of Jade. This is barely noticeable but come on it just does not make sense with the rest of the story as it is presented in the film!! Curiously I can't say I absolutely disliked it. The cast is somehow good (even if the acting tends to be poor) and the film exudes nostalgia of the late 70's early 80's period. But that's all it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We probably have a few of those we'd like to forget but I saw Endless Drivel when it first came out. I said then it was the "worst of all time" and nearly 25 years later, I still think the same. Every time I hear that godawful theme song I cringe. Actually, I haven't done too badly blocking it out and memory may have failed me to some extent, but there was a scene I think in New York when Brooke Shields' demented father just happens to run into lovesick Martin Hewitt in the Big Apple...I mean literally runs into him..deliberately running him down in his car.Also unforgettable, for all the wrong reasons, is when Brooke descends the stairs as that egregious song is playing and swooning into the waiting arms of Hewitt, while the jealous father seethes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endless Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rightly regarded as one of the worst films of all time, 'Endless Love' is the absurd story of two teenagers; Jane Butterfield and David Axelrod. If the names are any indication you know you're in for a bumpy ride. After being told he cannot see Jade anymore David decides to burn her parents house down, for reasons that are never really explained other than he's a bit nutty. Horribly directed and wonderfully overacted by all (especially Jade's father), the film doesn't know what it's supposed to be doing. The 'Endless Love' theme song resonates throughout the entire movie, even during scenes of Jade's mother flirting with David. No consistency, no logic, and no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The scene when Jade's dad gets hit by a car is unintentionally hilarious. no stars out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Besides the wooden performances, the horrible dialogue, and the endlessness stupidity of the characters is the debut of TOM CRUISE. I guess we all have to start somewhere. If your brain does not switch off in protest to this movie, then you may find some campy hilarity in this over the top film. When I watched it I did not laugh, but could not turn away from the horror of this film which is very much like a traffic accident on the highway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endless stupidity or O.J. junior in the making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw this film and it was LOUSY! It started sweetly enough with a couple of nice kids in love and their family approving it, nothing wrong with that but after the parents broke up the romance it became obvious that that David guy is a nut and yet the film tries to romanticize his obsession. He ain't in love he's obsessed. The first hint that this movie was going in the wrong direction was when the mother observed David boinking her 15 year old daughter and just smiled instead of throwing cold water at them. It turned out SHE wanted to do him. Not only that, after he got out of the sanitarium she helped him to get in contact with her daughter! Call the cops woman this nut tried to burn your family alive. Why didn't he get more intensive therapy after the sanitarium found out he was trying to contact Jade? THE JUDGE TOLD HIM NOT TO CONTACT JADE AND HER FAMILY, yet his parents took him out. The scene where he's raping her and crying out how much he loved her, man that was hilarious. Yet after he burned her family's house, caused her father's death, raped her, Jade still love this guy, Yikes! "Splendor in the grass"(1961) is similarly themed but better with a believable ending. I'd like to give this film a proper ending or epilogue: Jade feels David is suffocating her metaphorically and asks to go on vacation and the nut follows her so she breaks up with him, the following night she feels David is suffocating her Literally!! He's on top of her with a pillow on her face and she manages to get free and run out. He chased her down the street and a couple of cops sees them and plugged the SOB full of hollowpoint lead just as they should have done with the juice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-So Teenage Film about Love...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Axelrod (Martin Hewitt) and Jade Butterfield (Brooke Shields) are two teenage lovers. He is 17, she is only 15.One night the two, after a party held at the Butterfield house, have sex by the living room fire, witnessed by Jade's mom (Shirley Knight). What follows is a story of strong love and separation that follows David's life as he is banned from seeing the one that he so badly loves.This film is no way a fantastic film, but it also isn't terrible. Brooke Shields is absolutely stunning in this film (her acting on the other hand...) and her co-star Hewitt does a reasonable job as the lead. Although the film does have its faults and flaws, it is also a tender tale some can relate to... to some point.Shirley Knight is touching as the mother and Ian Zeiring and James Spader also star as Jade's brothers. Look out for a nerdy and quite irritating Tom Cruise (with a high pitched voice) in a small scene.I only rated it 10, because it doesn't deserve its 3.9 rating. I would give it a 6 or 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I strongly believe this is my most favorite movie of all times and it should be a great success. It's unfair to compare it to 'Love Story' Which i never really liked that much. Brooke Shields is divine and this girl if she didn't have her mother as agent stopping her from accepting great roles she would have made it to the Top. The story is awesome and even though there are people to believe that a Love like that doesn't exist, well i believe it does. Only the ones who fall for a person like that could understand that.I keep on watching this movie at least 3 times per year. I know the script &amp; every scene by heart. The Soundtrack is also legendary. It's a shame that the production cut the final scene with 'David's Dialogue In Prison'. The Good thing is that this dialog is available in the Soundtrack.Highly Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Forgettable Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Endless Love is about how two young people,15 year old Jade,played by Brooke Shields; and 17 year old David,played by Martin Hewitt;fall in love with each other. But their passion is too much for the parents of Jade.They decided to separate them from one another.But when this doesn't work,David burns down the house upon the suggestion of Billy,played by Tom Cruise in his first movie,and he is sent away. But this doesn't stop him from seeking Jade.In the end the passion for his first love is too strong and Jade has to leave or this love will harm them both.The film was somewhat over-the-top as it made David seemed not a lover with a lot of passion but someone who is mentally decapitated.I doubt that the film was sought realism in it.It only made a fool out of audiences.The acting was so-so for both Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt.The direction of Franco Zeffirelli seems lacking.While the screenplay of Judith Rascoe never really got into the depth of the characters particularly David.The only thing going for this movie is the classic love song,"Endless Love" by Lionel Richie.Overall,the movie is forgettable.If this movie isn't on DVD,that explains why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a classic love story. I saw it when i was a teen. they say that teens are very impressionable.. well this movie left a lasting impression on me. when i was in my 20 i met a girl and fell very deeply for her. It was a story book love. She was 16 and i was well ... older. There may have been a little difference in our ages but it was still amazing. I think of her always and wonder if she thinks of me. She is married now and lives far away but she will always be in my heart Although we both parted ways she was and always will be my Endless love. when i watch the movie i remember what it was like to truly be in love. Nothing since has match it. i've never fallen again like i did then. I love the movie. I wish that everyone could see it and be as moved as i was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I agree with "endless bore"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Endless Love" is a very aggravating film about two horny teenagers who were so obsessed with having sex with each other that they ruined a lot of people's lives, including (fortunately) their own. I think the audience was meant to feel they had true love, or something, but it really didn't come across like that, it seemed more like a study on lust and obsession. Although there were a couple of scenes showing briefly how the two got on, there were far more scenes of them having sex. It even made me feel as though the director was having a laugh as if to say how much he enjoyed spending days watching naked teenagers writhe around while pretending he were making a normal film and not child porn. Neither of the teenage characters were nice, because they were so obsessed with having sex with each other, and they didn't do much else. The male one was particularly bad and a creepy, stalker-like obsessed guy, and in the end he started doing stupid things to ruin everything for himself, instead of keeping his pants on for a few days. Nobody even wanted to seriously keep the stupid kids apart anyway, they just suggested that, when you're in high school, a bit of studying before your exams is probably a better thing to do than endless bonking. Our characters were too stupid to realise it and deserved all the misery they had, it's just a shame they made other characters miserable too - not to mention the audience. This was a short and empty storyline stretched out into a feature length film. However James Spader was quite good and Tom Cruise was fun in his short appearance as a pyromaniac.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Off-putting characters, corny ambiance, unsubtle direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Endless Love" begins with a party sequence at Brooke Shields' house, and as soon as mama Shirley Knight comes down the stairs with some kind of freaky-looking thing on her head, chattering up a storm, you can tell something is off-balanced in the handling. Director Franco Zefferelli poses his main actors prettily (check out Martin Hewitt resting his head on his hand on the banister), but the story and the supporting characters are almost immediately off-putting. Once the plot gets going and more hysterical adults are dragged in, things just get worse. Newcomer Hewitt has the bulk of the film resting on his inexperienced shoulders, and by the second-half he's down for the count; Shields has very little to do--and she's mediocre at even this (her scene with the letters is good but her next big moment, walking in the snow with Knight, is dreadful). The film certainly looks seductive--and features Tom Cruise in a small part!--but is otherwise dreck of the most annoying, illogical kind. These kids aren't hoping for sexual appeasement by being together, they hardly seem to know what sex is. Zefferelli wants ROMANCE, but only pre-teens may fall for it. * from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brooke Shields classic! Yes, it's that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreadful film of an obsessive love between two teenagers--David (Martin Hewitt) and Jade (Brooke Shields).The book is fantastic--very well written and honest. The movie is just utter crap. I remember very clearly when it came out in 1981--there was a huge controversy (back then) over the fact that it dealt with two teenagers having sex. Supposedly it was slapped with a X rating originally because of the sex scenes (My guess is that the studio made that up--they realized how hopeless the movie was and decided to make up a controversy to "sell" it). Anyways, it was "edited" and released with an R rating. I saw it opening night...the audience HATED the film! They were actually laughing at the sex scenes! The real howler was when the mother saw her daughter and boyfriend having sex...and SMILED and WATCHED!!!!It's really hard to believe Franco Zefferilli did this. Brooke Shields can't act (but that's a given). Martin Hewitt was drop dead gorgeous and actually gave a good performance as David. Also Shirley Knight was superb as Jade's mother--she ALMOST makes the film watchable. Also it's Tom Cruises film debut--another reason to hate the film. In his (thankfully brief) scene he proves that he's an even worse actor than Shields! James Spader does what he can as Jade's brother. Also the ending makes no sense at all.Listen--read the book. It's great. Avoid this movie at all costs. Easily one of the worst films of the 1980s. Good for laughs only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I member this movie, but vaguely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie my parents didn't want me to see, but I saw it anyways. I don't remember it very well, but I remember the name "Jade" from it and a guy on top of either Brooke Sheilds or a double of hers or whatever they did, through a good portion of the movie. I think that a lot of teens saw this movie anyways inspite of their parents forbidding it. Brooke Sheilds was one of the hottest female teen stars of our age, Jodi Foster been probably the other hottest female teen star at that time, only Jodi is still big in the movies as an adult, but Brooke's career seems to struggling as it has been for a long time now. I don't know Martin Hewitt's name today and never followed his career. Tom Cruise, however, even if his role was a small one in this movie and it was his debut, he's as hot as ever and I don't see that ceasing. Probably will still be selling movies when he's old and grey. I need to run now as my ex-husband is very angry at my being here in the first place and angry at my still being here very late at night and he wants to go to bed. Good night! Interesting how careers turn out. Orlando Bloom is probably today's closest equivalent to Tom Cruise. You may not see it, but I do. Good strong start early on that seems to be continuing and may probably stay that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>both over AND under hyped.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me be blunt, I dislike this movie. I had no idea WHAT the fuss was about back then and sstill don't. Almost ALL these characters are frustrating and the story becomes so twisted and tragic there's very little to it that's sweet or loving. I mean everyone hates each other. And the tale becomes full of bitterness and people doing bitter things-the title should have been endless bitterness.But on the other hand-bottom 100 on imdb? NO WAY! I don't think this was a BAD flick just not for everyone and overhyped to the point where you expect so much of coarse your gonna be let down. But with so much junk out there, I don't understand what this movie is doing in the bottom 100 on imdm-I mean I'm not a fan for the reasons listed above but I guess, objectively I can see why someone else would be and the sotry is more realsitic then some of the sugar coated romance tales out there(though I still don't like this and never will.)I wouldn't rate this a 1 or 2 as I think the worst of the worst deserve to be. Going by my own personal tastes it's a 4 or 5-in otherwords average or slightly less then average-and nothing I'd ever want to see again. But hardly really awful filmaking.Still, this was hyped so much and was such a sad and bitter movie that I could never find this appealing. I think the acting was fine though and it's now, after being shamelssly overhyped become to put upon as a movie. Talk about a turnaround!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complete Mess That's So Bad It's Almost Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Endless Love (1981) ** (out of 4)Insane love story about teenage lovers, the 15-year-old Jade (Brooke Shields) and the 17-year-old David (Martin Hewitt), who are forced apart by her father and soon the boys obsession turns to tragedy. I really, really, really wanted to like ENDLESS LOVE. In fact, this was at least my third viewing of wanting to love this movie but it's hopeless because sadly the movie is just a complete mess from start to finish. I've heard that the novel is something truly terrific but all of that has been lost in this feature that is so heavy-handed and at times so crazy that you can't help but wonder if director Franco Zeffirelli was wanting to create something bad. I'm really not sure where to start but I guess we can begin with the story, which just never makes any sense. The movie has one dumb sequence after another and it contains some of the dumbest and most unexplained characters that you're ever going to meet. So, daddy gives pot, alcohol and throws wild parties on school nights yet he flips out when he discovers that his daughter is in love? Her mother catches them having sex in front of the fireplace and decides to just sit there and watch? David decides to have a complete mental breakdown after accidentally burning his loved ones house down yet he doesn't seem to know what the big deal is. Then there's the ending, which I won't ruin or should I say the at least three endings that really don't close anything up. Oh yeah, and lets not forget the sex scenes, which are so incredibly laughable that you wonder what the director was thinking.ENDLESS LOVE should have been a good movie as the story of pain, losing the one you love and redemption are things that make for an interesting story. Everything here is just handled so poorly that you can't help but laugh at just about every scene. The movie never makes any real sense. It never explains why these two are so strongly connected. It never explains anything. As a fan of bad movies I can't help but have a certain fondness for this movie because it reaches of level of insanity to where it becomes so bad that it's good. The film contains weirdness unlike any other movie and the entire thing is just so heavy in regards to the "love" of these two people that it really kills the movie even more. Both Shields and Hewitt have a lot of problems with their performance as they never really pull them off or make them believable. Shirley Knight is good as the mother, Don Murray is over-the-top as the father and we even get James Spader and Tom Cruise in brief parts.The one scene that works is when the title song is first played and we see the two fall in love. This sequence is about the only thing that comes off as good and of course you've got the Lionel Richie and Diana Ross song to close things out. ENDLESS LOVE is a film that desperately needs to be remade.</fullReview>
