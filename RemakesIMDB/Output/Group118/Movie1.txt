		<shortDescription>A science fiction classic that beautifully melds the ordinary and the fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This science fiction classic is more relevant than ever, and I don't mean its silly message about peace. Yes, yes, we're all violent, silly, war-like humans, and we should all throw away our guns and atomic bombs posthaste if we know what's good for us. Thanks, Klaatu. We'll get right on that. Meanwhile, we'll enjoy the chance to watch your story on DVD because we live in an age ? yes, of war and cruelty and weapons of mass destruction ? but also of Jar Jar Binks and "Alien vs. Predator."Klaatu (Michael Rennie) is a gentlemanly outer-space alien who comes to earth in his flying saucer to send us Earthlings a very important message. Sadly, we shoot him on arrival and try to imprison him in a hospital room. He escapes, however, and goes out among us to find the basis for our "strange, unreasoning attitudes." He takes a room in a boarding house, where he meets the widowed Mrs. Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son (Billy Gray). The widow is being romanced by an insurance salesman (Hugh Marlowe), who later displays a lust for glory that endangers Klaatu ? and thus the rest of the world. Klaatu is in better hands when he reveals himself to Professor Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), a brilliant scientist and the best hope for the survival of Earth.It's funny, but I never think about this movie in terms of that plot outline. To me, this film is composed of small moments about people ? especially Mrs. Benson. Mention "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to me, and the first thing I think about is that moment where the strange new boarder tells her that he'd like to spend the day with her son. She hesitates a moment and says in a lowered voice, "Well, that's awfully nice of you to suggest it." It's a tiny moment about her concern for her son, her good manners and her intelligent ability to reply quickly and diplomatically. Patricia Neal, not Gort the robot, makes this movie come alive for me.The real reason this story is so fresh is because ? it's a good story. It's not an excuse to slap us senseless with fast-paced cutting or drown us in great globs of special effects. It has an engaging plot with warm, interesting characters. If we stupidly (and as you know, Klaatu, we humans can be so very stupid) limit ourselves to the New Releases section of the video store, we forget that some sci-fi thrillers put story before special effects.The trick work in this movie is excellent, though. I think the robot looks silly, but when Gort opens its visor and we hear that unnerving theremin music, we don't care that this supposedly metallic creature bends like Styrofoam at the knees. We know those laser beams eyes are about to scorch everything in their sight.Michael Rennie makes up for Gort's deficiencies. He gives what easily could have been a humorless, sanctimonious character a quiet, graceful authority. His slightly otherworldly looks add to the illusion; and Neal as Mrs. Benson completes it by reacting to him with obvious respect ? even when she fears him.Under Robert Wise's direction, every shot is strikingly composed and brings out the maximum dramatic potential of the story. The sense of rhythm and pacing is beautifully suspenseful. Bernard Herrmann, with the theremin as one of his instruments, gives the movie both a nervous tension and a sense of wonder. And the story is so perfectly constructed that it even gets away with a big speech for a climax.What's the heart of this movie? There's a bravura sequence where Billy Gray secretly follows Rennie from the boarding house to his spaceship. It's a simple, wordless scene where the entire team of filmmakers ? and that goes double for Herrmann ? meld the ordinary and the fantastic. You want a special effect? That's it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Science Fiction, that stands the test of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time i saw this movie, i was 10 yrs old. That was in 1974,it was on t.v. that night, and my father, let me stay up to watch it. Because many years earlier, he saw it at the movie theater as a teenager. He told me that The Day the Earth Stood Still, was the reason he became a sci-fi fan. Well, so did i that night! To this day despite all the fancy, special effect, movies that are out there, this movie stands above them all. The humanity in this movie is so moving, that alone makes it a classic.But much more than that,it's message still rings true today,and should never be forgotten. A masterpiece! 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the ten best Sci-Fi movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the first sci-fi movies I ever saw and one by which I gage all others. Before there was 'Star Wars' there was 'The Day The Earth Stood Still'. It brought together all that later sci-fi movies strive for. A solid story, believable characters and, for the day, great special FX. It was an examination of society at the time and the racial prejudice that permeated all levels of life. It studies mans fear of the unknown and the violent reaction it produces even today, and how the love of one person can change the course of events for the better. It's a movie that can still stand on its own even by today's standards and should never be remade.But that's just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple SF Tale with Profound Message...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is such a basic Science Fiction story that many first-time viewers have been stunned by the reverence in which it is held. An alien arrives on earth, is misunderstood and is nearly killed, passes a warning to mankind to not carry the weapons of potential nuclear war into space, or face annihilation, then leaves. The FX are minimal, there are no 'space battles' or 'monsters', even the score, by the legendary composer Bernard Herrmann, is simple, lacking the bombast of later 'epics'. Yet in it's very simplicity, director Robert Wise has created a tale more timeless and relevant than many other 'message'-driven SF blockbusters that followed.Based on Harry Bates' short story, "Farewell to the Master", which paints a far less friendly view of our galactic community (Gort, the enforcer robot, is revealed to be the true 'Master' of the story, not Klaatu, thus revealing that machines are controlling the Universe), 20th Century Fox and director Wise quickly butted heads on how the film should be presented. Fox envisioned Spencer Tracy as Klaatu, believing that the legendary star's well-established persona would make the SF elements more 'understandable' to audiences. Wise scoffed at the notion, arguing that no one would ever believe Tracy was an alien, and searched until he found relative newcomer Michael Rennie, a gaunt, sensitive British actor, whom he felt best suited the Christ-like quality Klaatu had to possess (even the name Klaatu adopted to mingle with humans was 'Carpenter'). For earth's greatest scientist (a thinly-disguised Albert Einstein), Wise cast screen veteran Sam Jaffe, which also brought a howl from the studio, as the actor was being investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee, in the midst of their infamous 'witch hunt' and blacklisting of Hollywood's supposed Communist sympathizers. Jaffe proved a perfect choice, however, displaying many of the qualities he would later bring to 'Dr. Zorba' on "Ben Casey".Rounding out the cast were popular actress Patricia Neal (still recovering from her failed relationship with Gary Cooper), Hugh Marlowe (fresh from the success of ALL ABOUT EVE), and Billy Gray (who would go on to great success in "Father Knows Best"). The true casting coup, however, was finding 7-foot Hollywood doorman Lock Martin to portray the robot, Gort. Encased in foam rubber 'armor' and 'lifts', to bring his height to nearly eight feet (he actually wore two different outfits, as the seam was impossible to hide, and would always have to be on the opposite side to the camera), Martin, who, Wise acknowledged, was not a physically strong man, would occasionally faint from heat exhaustion (if you watch him carefully, during the film, you can actually see moments when he would start to tilt over). The scene where he carries Neal on board the spacecraft was a major achievement for the easily tired giant, and the actress, who was afraid, justifiably, that she might be dropped!The filming was, by and large, an enjoyable experience for the cast and crew (although Patricia Neal, in later interviews, said that it was nearly impossible for her to say the film's famous 'tag' phrase, "Klaatu Barrada Nikto", without breaking into giggles). Everyone knew the end result would be special; Michael Rennie, ten years later, would call the role the most "important" of his career (NBC would even bring him in to host the network premiere of the film, on "Saturday Night at the Movies").With it's anti-war stand, the film was the direct counterpart of the year's other 'classic' SF production, THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, the first of Hollywood's 'alien invasion' films. In THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, 'Mankind' is the true monster, toying with nuclear weapons, constantly fighting, and willing to kill a peaceful emissary, without allowing him to deliver his message or offer his gifts to the world. "Man must grow up, or be destroyed" was a powerful message, in 1951, particularly when Wise panned his camera over Arlington Cemetery, with it's thousands of headstones, as Klaatu/Carpenter viewed, sadly, the end result of our fixation with warfare.The message is even more relevant, today, which is why THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL remains a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Join us and live in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's odd to think that fifty years from now there may only be a handful of movies released in 2004 that will be remembered at all. I don't care to venture any guesses as to what they may be, but it's easy to see why The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of the ones from 1951 that remains a classic, while so many others sank into obscurity. The movie deals with a theme that was at the forefront of so many peoples' minds in the early 1950s, in America and the rest of the world, and that is the conflicts between many different nations, and more generally the tendency for humans to fight each other. It was released at the time of the Red Scare and so soon after World War II that international tensions were still high. Also odd is that if you switch the last two words in the title, why, it's not very frightening at all!Okay, that made no sense, but I couldn't resist. My respect for the movie dimmed sharply when I saw that the alien was not only a man, but a good looking man who spoke perfect English, but then won back my respect completely when it took the time to explain that his culture had learned about humans through intercepting radio transmissions over many years. Unlikely, but it's an explanation, which is more than most science fiction films provide. Granted, not much time should be wasted on the science of science fiction, but in this case something had to be said. The alien didn't give may details as to his physical condition, but scientists hypothesized that since he so closely resembles a human, he must have a similar environment to our own on his planet.Speaking of which, there is one thing about the science that I'm also curious about. At what stage were astronomical studies in the early 1950s? I'm wondering how far into space scientists were looking, because Carpenter, the alien, states with some grandeur that he has traveled 250 million miles to get to earth, which in astronomical terms is a tiny, tiny distance. Considering that the sun is 93 million miles from earth, this would mean that his planet is within our own solar system. And here's another little factoid ? Earth makes a complete revolution around the sun every year, as you know. Pluto, on the other hand, takes something like 248 years to revolve around the sun. That has nothing to do with the movie, but is an interesting digression, I should think.I found the political backdrop to be one of the most interesting things about the movie, and not only because of what the political landscape was like at the time. It was interesting to watch a movie about aliens that so quickly and completely dissolved into a close examination of volatile human relations, and without ever becoming preachy or devolving into peace propaganda (oxymoron intended). I actually think that a large part of what made up for the lack of aliens in this alien movie was the validity that its argument has.When Carpenter (who they stopped just short of simply naming Jesus) was greeted with the response that a meeting with all of the worlds leaders was impossible because of tensions between nations, he was genuinely surprised and saddened. He gives as his reason for visiting earth the fact that his civilization has noticed satellites being launched around the Earth's atmosphere and, since humans clearly are unable to get along, he was sent here to tell us to join them and live in peace or face our present course and face obliteration. Most importantly, if we chose the latter, they would be there to ensure that we would not export our violence to peaceful civilizations in space. The descending nature with which he speaks is truly revealing, it makes humans look childish because of our constant battling with one another.This is also where the movie coincides with some of the themes that Jonathan Swift presented in Utopia, his novel upon which several failed civilizations have been attempted. They have created robots, which we seen in the Iron Man, to prevent the rise of violence in their society. The robots have tremendous power, which cannot be revoked, and at the first sign of violence they react swiftly against the aggressor, which results in a peaceful society. I'm also reminded of Gulliver's Travels, also by Jonathan Swift, particularly the section where Gulliver lives among the Houynymns which, interestingly enough, are talking horses with a remarkable ability to live at peace. When at one point Gulliver describes lying, which does not exist to the Houynymns, one of them responds incredulously with something like, "Why on Earth would one say something that isn't so?" Carpenter displays exactly the same shocked surprise when he learns of some of the awful characteristics of human beings, which seems to suggest that before we look for other civilized worlds in the galaxy, maybe we should work a little more on civilizing our own world.The famous quote that I've quoted in my summary line is one of the many delights that this film presents, and Evil Dead fans will be thrilled to see the origins of those strange words that Ash had such a hard time speaking in Army of Darkness. The genre of science fiction has a much larger than average ratio of bad films to good ones, and I think the best ones are the ones that have a concrete connection to the real world, as The Day the Earth Stood Still obviously does. Given the political atmosphere here in the first month of 2005, it's obvious that humans have not taken much advice from this movie, but then again, as Arnold stated in Terminator 2, "It's in your nature to destroy yourselves."Scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember several years ago in my film appreciation class, we were learning about the 50's, our professor had mentioned how many sci-fi films were made with Russian villain undertones as well as the cold war. We watched some of The Day the Earth Stood Still and this film just jumped at me, it was so different than any other film I had seen. I thought it was going to be so cheesy and lame since it was a 50's film, but after watching a little bit of it, I didn't realize the strong message it held. I remember in Terminator 2 there was a line that I still hold true to this day "It's in your nature to destroy yourselves", that maybe it's not all technology that will destroy us, but we are our own worst enemies. The Day the Earth Stood was before The Terminator, just like Metropolis was before this film, but these are the best stories and it's like watching a history lesson on film about the time and feel of the 50's.An alien spaceship has landed in Washington, D.C., but it's not what you think with the "take us to your leader" type of thing, rather a human like alien comes out offering input on what is going on in the universe, but he is immediately attacked by the humans and taken hostage. His name is Klaatu, he tries to explain several times that he's not here to hurt anyone, but the humans don't trust him. He escapes and goes to a family, since no one knows what he looks like, they think that he's a regular man who just needs a place to stay. He stays with a family and they show him around, they think he's a little strange but very polite and nice, but when they learn of his true identity, he tells them of what his intentions are to mearly warn Planet Earth of it's impending doom.The Day the Earth Stood Still is a true classic, I know there are a lot of young people who complain about the ending, how it's so anti-climatic, but I feel that it's a perfect film and I am so ticked off that it's being re-made. But I guess we will have to see what the film will be like, who knows? It might be good... yeah, right, sorry, was just trying to be nice. But I highly recommend you watch this movie, it's a true classic that has a strong message, has great actors, and fun effects. It's fun to watch these films, I wonder if they realized while making this film back in 1951 that they were acting out their own culture and history.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My FIRST sci-fi movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie (on television circa 1957)I was just a young child four years of age. I remember sitting on my father's lap and watched the whole thing through my fingers as I held my hands over my eyes for protection (yeah...right!). Gort and Klaatu were magnificent space travelers...and with a message of peace during a time that the Soviets and U.S. were deep into the 'cold war'. Very timely! Very scary! It spooked me then and I still get a chill watching the movie today. But, it's one of the classics that will live on forever! It's message is as meaningful today as it was back in the 50's. Maybe we should all watch it again and take notes.........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting In Itself &amp; As A Reflection of Its Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting both in itself and as a reflection of its era, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" may seem unspectacular now to those who are used to the extravagant science fiction pictures of the present time, but it deserves its place as a cinema classic. The story is worthwhile in itself, and as soon as you set aside any preconceptions about what science fiction should involve, it also builds up some pretty good drama and suspense. Its perspective is also interesting to see as a reflection of the concerns of its era, which have such obvious similarities with those of the present.The story itself sometimes moves rather slowly, and the focus is really more on the reactions to Klaatu's arrival than on the action itself. As Klaatu, Michael Rennie stays pretty low-key, as does the rest of the cast much of the time. Although there are times when the movie might lack some energy as a result, in general it probably works better that way than it would have if there were too much forced emphasis on the urgency of Klaatu's mission, which is more than able to speak for itself. The ideas behind the story are fairly simple, but they are, of course, just as significant now (or in practically any other era) as they were in the 1950's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Peaceful Message in One of the Brightest Science-Fiction Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A flying saucer lands in Washington, and a man, Klaatu (Michael Rennie), brings the preoccupation of other planets with the use of atomic energy and development of spacecraft by people on Earth planet. Further, he brings a message and also a threaten against the danger Earth could cause to other planets: the planet could be destroyed if the people does not live in peace. Any menace to other planets would cause the destruction of the entire planet. This classic is one of the best science-fiction movies I have ever seen. The story is very simple, but the message is wonderful. When this film was made, World War II had finished six years ago only, there was the Cold War and the paranoia of the Americans at that time was against the communists. The special effects are excellent for a 1951 movie. In Brazil, this classic movie was not released on VHS or DVD. It is a shame! I have a VHS, having a version dubbed in Portuguese, full of commercial and with a terrible quality of image that I recorded from TV many years ago. Yesterday I watched this video again, and it is really an outstanding movie. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'O Dia Em Que a Terra Parou' ('The Day Which the Earth Stopped')Obs: 01 March 2006 - Fox do Brasil finally released this DVD in 2005. After so many years, I was able to see one of my favorite sci-fi in the original language and restored image.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this yesterday for the first time and boy do I feel stupid! Its not my fault though, its rarely on television, but was it worth the wait!The plot is fairly simple and direct. Visitor from another planet has come to warn us that we are aggressive, paranoid and dangerous to ourselves and the other planets if we continue with atomic bombs. Klaatu does not care if we kill each other, but cannot tolerate what atomic bombs can do to the other planets. Naturally he is not welcomed with open arms, but in our defense, he was not exactly invited. The most disturbing part is that this movie is more timely than ever right now. When Klaatu mentions, 'levelling New York', I got a chill. One or two moments were slightly puzzling - why does Klaatu allow himself to be interviewed on television, when he knows he is being tracked down? Why is he being pursued at the end so vigorously when he was scheduled to address the world? And why did Patricia Neal have to be brought onto the spaceship at the end? It seems to serve no purpose.No matter, this is still a great movie that I would be thrilled to see again. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (4 outta 5 stars) Wow... a classic science fiction movie that I had never seen until now! Sure, some of the acting and stuff may look a little hokey to jaded modern audiences... but this movie is still extremely well-done... like a movie-length episode of "The Twilight Zone" (one of the better ones). A spaceship lands in Washington and a traveler steps forth... before he even has a chance to get a word out, the US Army takes a shot at him... causing his robot companion to destroy some military hardware. The alien, Klaatu (Michael Rennie) tries to reason with the US government but, of course, gets nowhere. So he escapes and travels among humankind to try and get a handle on why people are so suspicious and untrusting. He gets a room in a boarding house and makes friends with a pretty widow (Patricia Neal) and her young son. Mankind has just come upon the means of using atomic energy as a weapon and Klaatu is here to make sure that humans won't pose a threat to other worlds... or else! Well-written, suspenseful and thought-provoking... even today! (Amazing how so little has changed in 54 years.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gort Klatu Barata Nicto</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:More proof that Robert Wise suffered a massive stroke before making the Motionless Picture. The movie has a truly Noir scene in it when Klatu comes first into the family's room enveloped in shadows. Watch the terror of the family: The stranger. This was the Cold War can you tell? The movie is a masterpiece of standing outside of ourselves and looking inward. It was made during the height of the Cold War and you will see many disparities with today's zeitgeist. Notice, like Earth Versus The Flying Saucers, how quickly they attack him. We do not see Bill Pullman in Independence Day still trying to cut a deal after half of the planet was wiped out. This is the difference between ascendant and decadent cultures. Ascendent cultures believe in their values; here it is lock and load not, gee, how do we talk to them? The highlight of the movie is Bobby taking Carpenter around our reality which now appears alien to us when we see it through his eyes. Other than Lincoln, Carpenter is not impressed. Especially when the radio journalist does what all journalists do best: whip up hysteria. Carpenter looks at him disdainfully and contemptuously and begins to try to calm him down; that is enough the journalist moves on quickly.The movie must be viewed within the decade it was made in: the 1950s. It is a wish picture; a fantasy that somebody up there would come down here and stop the insanity. Robert Wise, the younger years, was a great director. Watch for the use of camera angles when Patricia Neal has to relay Klatu's message. As she stumbles, watch the lighting and how we are looking up at Gort from the ground to make it even more terrifying. As she stumbles over the words, in her fear, everyone's living room is yelling at her say the words. Again, in this scene, there is a Noir use of lighting and shadows. The photography is the hidden star of this movie. Again, in the elevator with Neal and Klatu watch for the shadows. Wise made my favorite movie, a few years later, The Sand Pebbles. Here he is at the top of his form. Those of us who loved his work would just as soon forget about The Motionless Picture. The finale is evocative of the aforementioned wish fulfillment and strikes us, within our present zeitgeist, as naive. You had to live when everyone was sure that nuclear annihilation was going to take place any minute. The endless civil defense drills, that we later discovered were useless, were also designed like this movie, to allay fear. The hope that somewhere out in space someone would come and help us not wipe each other out. Rennie was always a fantastic actor. He is very skilled with his body language and facial expressions. Do not believe me? Watch Keanu Reeves do a very bad impression of him in the awful remake. Marlowe was a great film noir actor; he adds good acting support with Neal. The effects, while dated, are still interesting especially Gort. This Gort is well done and quite creepy. It really was the archetypal science fiction of the 1950s that captured forever the terror that generation had of sudden extinction. It also is the first true stepping outside of our culture and looking in with Klatu. A Masterpiece</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic with surprising (for the time) pacifist message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a space ship lands in the middle of a playing field in Washington, the military respond with an immediate shut down of the area. The inhabitant of the space ship exits bearing a gift, but is shot by soldiers mistaking it for a weapon. Seconds after the shot a large robot exits and destroys all the weapons. The alien, Klaatu, is taken to a hospital and asks for an audience with all the world leaders. When he is refused, he escapes the hospital and takes a room in a small guest home incognito. The man hunt starts as Klaatu seeks to deliver his message to earth and avert disaster.In a sea of 1950's sci-fi this film easily stands out as a classic that gave so much to popular culture ? the score alone has been aped (or lifted in the Simpson's case) in many other films. The plot is very different to the others of the period as it is a peaceful message it sends, rather than a `beware the red menace' message of fear and hate. In fact one character even says she thinks the `alien' is from earth (ie Russia) only to be hushed! The film lacks action but makes up for it with a solemn mood and genuine thoughtfulness as Klaatu learns more about humans and tries to reconcile what he sees with what he sees in the wider world as a whole.In recent hindsight it is impossible not to look at Klaatu's warning of `disarm or we'll remove your threat by destroying you' in the same light. Isn't this the same warning and actions that Bush and Blair made recently? I'll leave you with that thought but I found it difficult to understand Klaatu's pre-emptive strike, while holding a critical view of Bush's.That aside the film's production is very polished. The score is excellent and really gives the film an alien feel to it. The direction makes use of ordinary sets to good effect ? the very idea of the space ship landing in Washington is obvious, but to have it land on a baseball field is a clever way to show it striking (sorry ? accidental pun) at the heart of ordinary America. The cast do well and mostly rise above the clichés set by the genre. Rennie does good work as Klaatu and Neal is more than just a screamer as Helen. Of course we have to have a wide-eyed all American boy (Bobby, but it could easily be Johnny or Jimmy) to see the whole thing, but he does OK.Overall this is a classic of the genre that has passed on so much to modern audiences. The pacifist message is refreshing when viewed along side so many other of the period which used the aliens to warn against the spread of communism, but the ease with which you now accept Klaatu's threat of a pre-emptive strike will depend on your political views over the past few months.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie changed my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. Maybe that's dramatic, but it's true. I'm not nearly as old as this film and the first time I saw it, I was a young child and impressionable as only young children are. I can honestly say that every alien encounter I've experienced through movies, t.v. shows and literature has been measured against The Day The Earth Stood Still, and most have come up short. I credit the film's depiction of human/alien interactions with my present-day feelings about how people should treat each other - within communities and groups and how we often fail in our dealings with outsiders. I think the movie made the young girl I was think about issues that would otherwise have gone unexamined for many years to come, and in those years I would have become a different person. The effect was deeply profound, and remains so even 30 years after my first screening. That said, it is still entertaining, a joy to revisit. There are no expensive, hi-tech special effects that look great in teasers, but do nothing for the plot. It's very straight forward, honest, pure. It's emotional and intellectual instead of the typical shoot-em-up space battle films that are today's norm. And while I enjoy a good explosion now and then, the change of pace is refreshing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still is directed by Robert Wise and adapted to screenplay by Edmund H. North from the story Farewell to the Master written by Harry Bates. It stars Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe, Sam Jaffe, Billy Gray and Frances Bavier. Music is by Bernard Herrmann and cinematography by Leo Tover. Classic sci-fi is right here as director Robert Wise gives a beautifully steady hand to Harry Bate's short story. Peace for the world or else is the message and I don't see anything wrong with that because it stands up to relevant scrutiny today and unfortunately many days ahead in the future. Debates about the allegorical worth of the film still persist today, but the core message is not up for argument. Wise shows his influences from the time when he worked with Orson Welles and Val Lewton, where here, aided by Tover's beautiful photography, he blends the feel of semi-documentary starkness with film noir visuality. Whether it's scenes of Klaatu (Rennie) trawling the wet night streets, or the interiors of the spaceship and boarding house, the visual imagery by way of low-key lighting compositions is often striking for mood accentuation. All the cast are spot on in their respective performances, with Neal refreshingly given a female role that doesn't resort to her being token sex appeal or a shrieking harpy. Herrmann's understated score is dynamite, and pretty much imitated wholesale from this point onwards, and the film is laced with poignant and frightening scenes that keep the viewer firmly glued to the tale unfolding. The demonstration of the visitors power gives the film its title and it's a glorious slice of celluloid, and in Gort the robot (Lock Martin) we have one of the biggest icons in sci-fi cinema. Once viewed one can never forget The Day The Earth Stood Still, its message, its structured precision and its technical smarts ensure you will remember this film always. One of the most important science fiction movies of all time, a game changer in the critical year for the sci-fi genre. All told it's magic cinema still standing the test of time. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hermes's Silvery Guise Heeds a Message from The Gods! Take Warning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the short story by Harry Bates, "Farewell to the Master", this is not your typical science-fiction movie. This is an arrival of master intellectual awareness, which has been deliberately made to seem that the threat of mass human self-destruction is far more imminent and more than probable if the Human Race continues on the path that it blindly chooses, and will be so ever harder to turn back from. As an adversary of the wanton and narrow thinking of the Leaders of the World and its peoples', and with his Hermeneutist duties, he is sent by other Worlds, to place an ultimatum. If this ultimatum goes unheeded, planet Earth will be destroyed.Filmed around the era of the beginning of the nuclear age and the early stages of Cold War paranoia, The Day The Earth Stood Still exploits these traits very well, jumping on the bandwagon of suburban middle-class American values, and their misguided mistrust of anything that does not support, and conform to, the American Dream and all that it represents. Set in an affluent part of Washington D.C., we see the by-product of societies propaganda machine and its mindset that it has blindly come to except. You can have any colour you like, as long as it's not Red.With these mature and realistic outlines, The Day The Earth Stood Still progresses to make the viewer conscious of the fact that the all impending doom caused by the petty squabbling of politicians, and their lack of vision will not only harm their own planet but transcend this childish war like nature to the outer planets. Even to the point of ignoring the Messengers warnings, and then having to be shown a demonstration of the seriousness of this Hermes type visitor, do we come to terms of his threat. We are being told to re-educate ourselves, to learn that to play a game of dangerous consequence will only lead to, ironically, our own destruction, not by any man made tool, but from a far greater Power.As this is science-fiction, it was then, and is very much so now, a wonderful and historical piece of movie making, not a theme of Space and Travel, but a theme of morals and the peoples fundamental need to live in harmony, brought to us by the superior intelligence of another planets science and technology. With its boyish charm to woo the child in us all, Stood Still... can adapt very easily to a wider audience than most other science-fiction movies have. This movie can be seen through many angles, the young boy, Bobby, and his over excitement and inquisitive mind that asks the questions for us, his protective worldly mother, played by Patricia Neal. Her greedy and shallow, short sighted fiancée and the slightly mistrusting, but nice I'm sure, old landlady, as well as the paranoid sheep that congregates on every street corner, watching, listening, judging and waiting. There is enough character development here for most to relate to. The acting here is impeccable, the delivery is at a pace that is not in a rush to squash in too much too soon. Stood Still... is not an action movie but a movie of the subconscious and its lack of understanding of the significance of our actions. Stood Still... acts as its own errand boy, who wants you to digest the Message and the Messenger, for as is the power of his message that it cannot be ignored as rhetoric, rhetoric that the populace has been brought up to know and know only. His message does bear true, as his demonstration will testify.Bernard Herrmann has an exceptionally gifted talent for combining both suspense and atmosphere, giving the viewer the feeling of transition between the World that is ours and the impending doom of the unknown World that has landed on our doorstep.With a history that started with him working on the background score to Citizen Kane, the beautiful classic The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, then the "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" theme tune from the 1950's television series. Also, Journey to the Centre of the Earth, The fantastic 1963 movie Jason and The Argonauts, 1976's Taxi Driver and Twelve Monkeys from 1995. To also include countless other movies, as well as working on Alfred Hitchcock's The Trouble with Harry, The Man Who Knew Too Much and The Wrong Man, both from 1956, Vertigo and performing on the classic Psycho. He was to win the one Oscar, for, The Devil and Daniel Webster, 1941. Bernard Herrmann passed away on December 24th, 1975, from a heart attack.The late Robert Wise died on the 14th September 2005; his legacy leaves us with movies as The Curse of the Cat People, The Desert Rats, with Richard Burton. Then he worked with Paul Newman on Somebody Up There Likes Me, West Side Story, The Sound of Music, working with Steve McQueen in The Sand Pebbles, also having the honour of directing the first Star Trek movie, Star Trek: The Motion Picture.Winning two Oscars in his career, as well as countless other Awards and nominations that the movie industry gives, he was most certainly an accomplished and respected movie-maker indeed.What makes The Day The Earth Stood Still so remarkable is its ability to pass through time with a seamless perpetual consistency to not age with its counterparts that have stood still with their own stereotypes. The Day The Earth Stood Still is an individually singular movie, one of the most original concepts, that is still, sadly, very prominent today as the first time it was aired during 1951. We should be watching the skies; we should be waiting for our own Hermes. We should be learning to pronounce the only words that could save us all from our own early extinction, "Klaatu barada nikto"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Classic of Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start this review saying that while many people won't recognize his name, director Robert Wise was probably among the most creative directors of history, and among the most important; with a resume that includes not only this 50s classic, but also The Body Snatcher (1945), West Side Story (1961), The Sound of Music (1965) and Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979); his legacy is highly influential and surely will last forever.With that said, let's start with "The Day the Earth Stood Still", a movie that quickly gained a place among the classics of the Sci-Fi genre. The plot is very simple, but it is the way it is developed what is very moving, thought-provoking and also, quite scary. On a normal day, an alien space ship lands on Washington creating panic, when the mysterious visitor appears, he is suddenly attacked by the army. Surviving the attack, the alien explains that his purposes are pacific, and that he has an important message for the world. The U.S. government, immersed in its international intrigues, wants to have the message for themselves, but the alien, Klaatu(Michael Rennie) won't give it to them only, as it is a message important for all the creatures on earth.The movie works at many levels, but at its core, it is an anti-war movie. Written in protest against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, it reflects the fears of the society in the 50s and the fear of nuclear holocaust. While Klaatu's ultimate solution may seem like a bigger threat, it was indeed toned down, since in the source story it was the robot, Gort, who was the real master. It is a powerful message, and it is handled perfectly by Wise, in scenes when Klaatu in disguise, explores human nature guided by a boy.Unlike most of the sci-Fi movies, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" has not dated badly, in fact, its message remains as powerful and valid as the day it was released. The wars, the intrigues and complexities of our society make almost impossible the dream of world peace, and Klaatu's perfect society seems unreachable for us.The superb work of Robert Wise would not be the same if it wasn't for his SFX team, who did amazing things with very little. Also, the cast is superb, and while the dialogs may sound corny now, it is a very good script. Sure, it may have its share of plot holes, but the movie carries the message well and the overall product is near perfect.The acting is a bit typical of the 50s, nevertheless, it is worth to mention the superb performances of Michael Rennie as Klaatu, Sam Jaffe as the lead scientist and Billy Gray as the kid, Bobby Benson, who shows Klaatu the human world.The movie makes many points, and has various interpretations, from religious allegory to political critic, the story is timeless indeed. Many words could be written about this movie as it is one classic of cinema history that must be seen at least once in a life time. While we are probably too far from Klaatu's perfect world, and the fear of a ultimate war is still present, we can hope that one day peace will be achieved.10/10. Magnificent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent - Deeper Than You Think!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great Sci Fi flick from 1951 that carries a very deep message. Granted the props are hokie compared to today's standard, and the space suits pretty amateurish, but the script is excellent, and the theme contemporary. I am not a religious nut, nor do I prescribe to the fundamentalist assault on our civil liberties, but this movie certainly carries a theocratic religious message which should be universally accepted. War and fighting among earth's nations will surely cause havoc among the planets of the universe and man must stop its mad race to destruction or leaders of the universe will do it for you.Michael Rennie plays the role of a messenger from another world who gently, and with humbleness, attempts to convince the scientists of the world they must become active to carry the message to the world leaders of impending doom unless they change world policy on armament and war. The character portrayed by Rennie is tall, gentle, intelligent, soothing, yet firm. Who does he represent? Why Christ of course.His speech, nature, demeanor, and message are all symbolic of a greater power coming back to earth to warn the people what might befall them unless they change their mad march toward destruction. This character is named appropriately, Mr. "Carpenter" (get the message) and even gets killed by soldiers bent on destroying this evil force from outer space. Mr Carpenter will even rise from the dead with assistance from his beloved robot assistant. A great movie that will only get more popular with age. Certainly one of the best Sci Fi classics of all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best science fiction movies ever made, bar none, and its message is still pertinent over 50 years later. This movie is my all-time favorite film of any genre, and no other science fiction movie has ever moved me like this one has. It is intelligently written, it's premise is unique for the early 50's..that an alien is benevolent and more evolved socially and technically and is not 'the monster of the week' or out to harm us..and the casting of Michael Rennie in the role of Klaatu was inspired. With his tall, thin, angular look, he looks as if he might be from another world, yet he is handsome as well to make him appealing. His accent, too, makes him seem just a bit different. All in all, I have never been affected so deeply by a movie in my life, and it was (fittingly) the first VHS movie I ever bought back in 1979. Today, I have the DVD version as well. I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough, both for the quality of the production and story and for the message of international peace and cooperation which is still relevant today. We have not learned a great deal about getting along with each other in the more than 50 years since this film was released, and it still packs a punch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still is a movie that through a seemingly regular flying saucer movie cloak has an important center. The movie starts out when a flying saucer flying on a field in Washington DC. In it, is a man named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) and his robot Gort (Lock Martin). When Klaatu exits his saucer, his hand holds a device that would help the humans, but is mistaken for a weapon and is shot by a nervous solider. Gort then proceeds to makes all the weapons of the army disintegrate. Afterwards, Klaatu is captured and held, but escapes to a family of a widow dating, Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her son, Bobby (Billy Gray). Klaatu, unsuccessful in planning to have the world leaders meet to tell of his climatic message, turns to the world's brightest leaders instead. The movie builds up to its final climax which is a threat to the world to stop being hostile. What built it up were the actions between Klaatu coming and leaving the Earth. The movie shows the part of human nature that causes humans to have wars and be belligerent. There were major examples of why war is inevitable with human beings. One, for example, is when Ms. Benson's boyfriend betrays the trust of knowing Mr. Carpenter's secret. He says, 'I don't care about the world,' which is an example of how people are selfish and think of their own needs, even when other's needs would be more productive. The movie seems not to only relate to that period in time, but this period of time as well. To become peaceful, all, that means every single one, has to not be hostile.I liked the movie because the lesson in it was taught well. Examples were scattered throughout the entire movie to support the ending speech. It was not 'another flying saucer movie' but it was a movie that shows the imperfections that the human race has, and what other way is better than teaching through entertainment?</fullReview>

In the Post-9/11 Days (which, I assure you, will be how it's referred to in the history books of the future). This movie is the best way to remind you that this ISN'T utopia; no matter how much you want it to be. If you want utopia, you must do as Klatuu suggests. The religious undertones, admittedly, are slightly irritating, as though they were forcing it down your throats; BUT, the message remains constant, one of hope, peace, and respect.

		<shortDescription>revolutionary and classic, a product from the age when true motion pictures were made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the old black-and-white science-fiction classics are often remembered for a particularly grand element they have to them. Sometimes, it's for their groundbreaking special effects, like the original King Kong (1933) or The War of the Worlds (1953). Sometimes it's because they have a particularly interesting character or villain like Frankenstein (1931) and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958). And sometimes it's because they feature a creature that absolutely frightens or haunts you like Count Orlok in Nosferatu (1922). But there's only a handful of classics out there that get their recognition because of a moral message they carry. One such example is the original, Japanese version of Godzilla (1954). Another is the 1951 revolutionary classic The Day the Earth Stood Still.This memorable motion picture, recently remade with Keanu Reeves, and based on a story by Harry Bates, tells the fictional tale of an event in history when a flying saucer landed in Washington D.C. Two extra terrestrial beings emerged from its mysterious form. A humanlike messenger named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) and an eight-foot-tall, invulnerable robot called Gort (Lock Martin). These two beings arrive upon the era where mankind had began to strongly develop atomic energy and increase the violent and catastrophic potential of its warfare. The extra terrestrials arrive with a warning for all of mankind. By harnessing such horrible power and using it to create weapons, mankind was creating an intergalactic threat as well as endangering its own existence on Earth. Klaatu's warning was simple: cut off the production of nuclear weapons and live in peace, or be destroyed as a threat to other worlds in the universe.Like many other popular science-fiction films, The Day the Earth Stood Still features impressive visual effects. Even the robot, Gort, which is nothing more than a man in a flexible costume, looks like a machine made from foreign-world material. The scenes where the UFO lands in Washington D.C. and where a death ray sprays into a tank and dissolves it in a flash of white light still spellbind to this day. But its more notable elements were created by the characters and by the screenwriters.The extra-terrestrial, Klaatu looks remarkably human. He doesn't have antenna, or three eyes, or tentacles, and his physical form is not a disguise. Oddly enough, this is more convincing than the present standards for aliens, which have to look like animals, particularly invertebrates, to be believable. And because he looks human, Klaatu is more relatable as a being instead of a creature. And he has morals, again, relatable and more compelling a buggy-eyed, other-planet nihilist bent on enslavement and destruction. And besides, they way I see it, if there are other beings out in the world, they wouldn't be much different than us. Physically or morally.Another noteworthy element is its symbolism, which like Godzilla (1954) stands out against nuclear war and the destruction of the environment. While it does not carry its message as vividly and horrifyingly, director Robert Wise wisely influences this message several times to keep it fresh in our minds. And while a movie cannot change the world, it is comforting to know that there were, and still are good people who realize these nightmarish elements of our world and feel compelled enough to communicate a message to us.The Day the Earth Stood Still has aged a bit since its debut in 1951, but this does in no way, take away from its influence. It has deservedly earned his place in the long list of classics from the age when true motion pictures were made instead of the standard, hackneyed projects that seem to attract audience members today in the 21st century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I was around back in 1951 when this film came out, I don't recall ever seeing even part of it. And, I didn't really know anything about it when the DVD of the restored film came out recently. But I bought my own copy anyway for two reasons - first it seems like a great addition to my DVD collection and second, it was only $9.99 which is quite a bargain. I watched it today, and I am not disappointed. It is historical, it has a good script with good acting, and it is the kind of movie that you can notice different things each time you view it. The black and white image is superb, with hardly any defects, and it has interesting extras, including a special THX Optimode extra which allows you to adjust your TV for the best B&amp;W picture.some SPOILERS follow, please don't read any further if you have not seen the movie yet and want to be totally surprised.Klaatu and his robot arrive in a flying saucer and land on the Washington, DC mall. He comes out, announces that he comes in peace, and is promptly shot by a nervous military man. He looks mid-30s, is actually 78 years old, and his wound heals in a day, obviously from an advanced race some 250 million miles away. His planet has been monitoring Earth, they are a peaceful people who built robots to monitor them and destroy any signs of aggression. They sent Klaatu to Earth to warn us, if we don't solve our multi-nation conflicts, they would destroy Earth. After WW II and the atomic bomb, they have become concerned that an Earth nation would eventually threaten their civilization and peace.Of course there had to be a demonstration that Klaatu and his robot could really do this, so he did this at noon the next day, all over the Earth electricity was "neutralized" for exactly one half hour. Even batteries did not work, so cars and motorcycles or lawnmowers wouldn't run, no phone, elevators, assembly line, etc. All except planes in the air and hospitals.To appreciate this film you have to realize WW II with the atomic bomb had ended only a few years earlier. The "cold war" was in full swing, with world-wide fear of the spread of Communism. So this was really a film with a message, to make a statement, that our nations need to figure out a way to live in peace or our Earth may be destroyed.It is curious watching the film's message today, only a month after President Bush gave Saddam Hussein of Iraq essentially the same message that Klaatu gave in the movie - disarm or we'll destroy you. That's the most eerie part of this movie.</fullReview>

And, the message is just as true today, maybe even more so, as it was in 1951, at the beginning of the cold war, when only 2 countries had the Bomb. Now at least 10 have it, some with crazy, deranged leaders who care nothing of the rest of the world.

		<fullReview>Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, brilliant special effects and an eerie, powerful musical score carry this film. The story is timeless, though some characterizations and specific details are dated. In 1950, for instance, "the scientists" had some political influence. Like the U.N., the scientific community is an international organization, and people hoped they might be both wise and "above politics" -- a little like Klaatu is supposed to be in this film. The Red Scare was underway; people lived in fear of atomic warfare, and it seemed there would never be peace on earth. These concerns are on display in every frame of The Day the Earth Stood Still, and it was a timely film in 1951. Klaatu does America the honor of landing in Washington, D.C. When Klaatu refuses to divulge his message to America alone, viewers are surprised and maybe a little insulted. But Klaatu's really can't entrust his message to any one nation -- that would reek of favoritism and jeopardize the success of his mission. If The Day the Earth Stood Still were remade, Klaatu would probably still land in Washington (after all, it's an American film), but people's reactions would be depicted a little differently. Jerry Falwell might demand to know whether Klaatu is Christian. Liberals would brand him a menace to individual freedom. Conservatives would denounce his "cultural relativism." There would be UFO cults and groupies all over the Mall, and TV crews on 24 hour watch. Klaatu would still be above all the controversy, still impatient with stupidity and fear. Putting aside its "message," The Day the Earth Stood Still is probably the most suspenseful and credible of all science fiction films wherein a humanoid robot shoots deadly beams of light from his head. Gort's presence helps to make this a classic SF film. Without Gort, the film would teeter dangerously close to religious allegory, with undue emphasis placed on Klaatu's status as a messenger from heaven. Seeing is believing, and Gort is a very impressive sight. And Klaatu is seen as just a guy from outer space, with something very important to tell us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dissenting opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still is often called one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. More truthfully, though, all it has really done is achieved cult status despite notable shortcomings.First and foremost are the storytelling techniques. Classic dramatic techniques such as foreshadowing are virtually absent. Robert Wise's direction lacks any semblance of suspense. Instead, he uses the same plodding pace that doomed Star Trek - The Motion Picture 28 years later. The cinematography is unimaginative, even by the standards of the '50s. It often feels like nothing so much as a filmed stage play given the dominance of flat, medium shots. Repetitive scenes like group after group of pensive people clustered about radios weren't considered good film-making even back then, and it's downright boring today. Bernard Herrmann's theremin-laced score was peculiarly devoid of mood.The main characters were thinly drawn, and some -- including Bobby and Tom -- disappear without a trace before the climax, leaving absolutely no closure. Michael Rennie did a passable job as Klaatu, but Patricia Neal simply could not redeem the cardboard cutout of Helen. Sam Jaffe is straight out of Central Casting as the wild-haired, pipe-smoking, Einsteinoid scientific genius. The military men couldn't have been any more stereotypical. The generals were all gung ho and the soldiers were too stupid to open fire on Gort when he first started disintegrating artillery and later when he escaped the block of plastic; they were simply cannon fodder. The wardrobe department must have had an easy time on this shoot. Every man is wearing either a suit and tie or a uniform, no matter if he's supping at home or working for the office. Maybe this was wishful thinking even in that era, that men should be nattily attired at all times. Today, it's merely preposterous.The story had its share of major blunders. Some were based on outdated science, like the statement that Venus could support humanoid life. Others were just plain silly. Klaatu, having already been shot early in the movie, still tries to run from armed soldiers. He could freeze the Earth in its tracks, but has nothing for remote communication with Gort or his ship, needing instead a flashlight. It was never followed up on that since Klaatu was perfectly human, was there some relation between his race and humanity. And there was far too much exposition -- we're told too much rather than shown.Should this film be remade? Certainly the effects could be improved. War of the Worlds and Forbidden Planet, released two and five years later, respectively, showcased what was the true state of the art for the '50s. Today's digital effects could easily add so much more to the story than Fred Sersen's optical effects of a half century ago, for instance a truly frightening Gort. But effects alone don't make a good movie, as the 1998 dud Godzilla proved.A new multiracial cast would be an improvement on the sanitized and idealized whitebread cast that the pre-civil rights times necessitated. Not only should minorities be represented -- for Klaatu's warning affects them, too -- but so should women in roles greater than homemaker and secretary.The script would have to be rewritten from the ground up, for the main premise is fatally flawed. Klaatu threatens the extinction of mankind -- indeed, of all life on Earth, including the innocent animals who have no knowledge of our sins nor power to stop them -- if any aggression were visited upon our interplanetary neighbors. The 'barbaric' leading societies of Earth had forsworn the use of genocide as a form of warfare decades before this movie was made. Even the thought of targeting unarmed civilians as retribution for aggression is morally repulsive to rational citizens of the modern world. Nuking Serbia for the actions of Slobodan Milosevic is unthinkable. How could a supposedly more advanced "civilization" justify such a sweeping atrocity? The concept of collateral damage is already falling out of favor with the American public. A contemporary script might have Klaatu realizing the error of his ways after being suitably chastised on his apparent lack of humanity, humility and compassion by the female lead. Never mind how our primitive weapons could have threatened their technologically superior civilizations. His single ship had the power to neutralize our entire planet and was impervious to any force the Army could muster. Gort himself was said to be able to singlehandedly reduce Earth to a smoking cinder. Surely at the first sign of attack, either could effortlessly dispose of a few pitiful nuclear missiles. Thereafter, it would have been child's play to interdict all future spaceflight until the human race matured or capitulated, especially when backed by the might of a fleet of ships and Gorts. All without the loss of a single life, human or otherwise. Compare it with Forbidden Planet, made only six years later. That, too, had the message that man was inherently flawed and could not be trusted with immense power. But it never took the heavyhanded approach of threatening total destruction. It just had a single genius who simply said man was not ready for the tremendous knowledge of the Krell. That is much more accurate and true to life. We aren't and may never be worthy of such power. But how realistic is it to turn us against each other, trying to keep any rogue nation or terrorists from inciting the wrath of Gort? Couldn't that run the risk of creating more conflict here on Earth just to protect Klaatu's people? If a group thinks themselves martyrs and believes they will be elevated to heaven after death anyway, how could you stop them from bringing death upon all of us, short of killing every last one of them?The thinking man's science fiction movie? Hardly. For now, that honor falls to Contact, starring Jodie Foster, a much deeper look into humanity and the human condition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"There must be security for all or no one is secure."- Klaatu, to the world's leaders at the conclusion of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Here is the ne plus ultra for sci-fi movies. It does not pander to the child in us like E.T. It does not befuddle with dazzling images like 2001. Though it does present a threat from outer space, it does not take the form of a drooling, acid-for-blood whatsis with razor fangs and a hunger for human flesh. Instead, it proposes that there are indeed humanoid lifeforms in existence off the Earth with, dare I write it, powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men (though Klaatu can't fly and is in no way bulletproof). THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is intelligent, engrossing and damn scary. Director Robert Wise (yup, he directed WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC and, unfortunately, the first STAR TREK movie), with the invaluable aid of Edmund H. North's fine script, utilizes a spare, noirish style to deliver a powerful statement about man's capacity for self-destruction. Only 92 minutes long, the film says volumes without sermonizing about a serious topic. And it does so most entertainingly. It makes the fantastic seem not only plausible but very likely. Bernard Herrmann creates a persistent mood of uneasiness with the vibrating eeriness of his Therimin-driven music. Michael Rennie's urbane spaceman radiates a barely contained bemusement and contempt for the violence prone humans he faces. In this early role, Patricia Neal displays how gifted she was at conveying subtle emotional shifts. Through the eyes of Billy Gray we see wonder, puzzlement and terror as only a child can experience them but without condescension. Lastly, in all the annals of sci-fi moviedom few can match the unstoppable power of Gort. Klaatu barada nikto..... (And please don't waste your time with the utter failure that is the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake; just revel in the enduring excellence of the original).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put, this is one of the greatest SF Films ever created. From beginning to end it is intelligent, exciting, thought provoking and has for the time, excellent SFX. The cast, led by Michael Rennie (in what is his best performance) is simply superb. This movie also boasts one of the most interesting (and for the time) amazing storylines ever. At a time when Aliens were thought to be BEM's and wanted only to invade and grab earths women, here was an alien giving us a choice; be as violent as we wanted to one another, but leave our violence here on earth - or else. Simply a great movie. I'm very disappointed that it's not out on DVD yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The anti-war theme of the movie at a time when the U.S. was involved in the anti-communist hearings in Washington and the Korean conflict, caused many problems for this movie to be made. The Army wouldn't let them use any of their vehicles in the movie, so all of the tanks and military vehicles used were from the Natinal Guard. The similarity of the space vistor and Jesus is interesting. Besides his use of the name Carpenter, he was executed then resurrected. But a compromised had to be made in the resurrection scene. It had to be stated that it was only temporary and not permanent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that helped shape attitudes toward the Cold War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film in theatrical release as, I guess, a second-run flick at a local theater when I was eight or nine, which would have been in 1953 or 1954, right at the heart of the McCarthy era.It was a significant experience for me at the time. Much sci-fi in the Fifties, both written and onscreen, was antiwar, anti-nuke (think "Them," with its allegorical mutated ants, the "Godzilla" films, much more). But "Day" did it so much better than amost anything else; maybe "Forbidden Planet," particularly with its much more expensive Fx, was in the same league, but most everything else was not. It had first-rank actors in Rennie and Neal, and they turned in sterling performances. It didn't waste its time with technobabble (no "warp drives" or "dilithium crystals" or "feedback loops in the transporter circuits" [hey, I'm a "Star Trek" fan, but the made-up techno explanations get tedious]), but took the advanced technology for granted (which makes that aspect of it still work fine almost fifty years after the movie's release) and got to the business of making it clear to a still-unsure public just what was at stake regarding nuclear weapons -- the survival of the human race, or at least of civilization. It delivered a message that even a child could comprehend, so clearly was it stated and so rivetingly was it presented.One can go on and on about the metaphors (Gort as the human will; Klaatu as a sort of Christ figure -- although that one doesn't work real well, actually; the scientific gathering as conscience and the Army as the id, etc., etc.) but that gets pretty much away from the central point: this is a movie that was deliberately intended as a cautionary tale, and worked startlingly well.A couple of other points. I've read many of the reviews, and seem to note a generational divide. Those over about 35 - 40 have a different take on the film than do those under that age range. I think that maybe in order to understand the nuances of the film, one needed to grow up in the Fifties or maybe Sixties, or at least to have studied attitudes in those times very closely. In addition, there's a pantheon of films dealing with this general subject matter from the Fifties, some of which I've mentioned above. A couple of others would be "The Boy With Green Hair," a superb little fantasy/allegory about the need for tolerance, and "This Island Earth," another cautionary tale about the need to avoid the use of unbridled force. I know there are many others, and may work on putting together a little piece about that aspect of Fifties films; probably it's been done at least in some unreadable Ph.D. dissertation somewhere, but a little pop version might be fun.See this movie. Buy it on tape, and keep it, and make your kids watch it with you sometime, and discuss the nearness of nuclear annihilation felt by the advanced cultures at least in the Fifties and Sixties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is my very favorite film of all time and I feel that it is the greatest sci-fi film in the history of Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has never been a motion picture that has captivated my interest more than The Day The Earth Stood Still. I first saw the film on tv when I was about six years old. I am now forty-three and it still remains my favorite film and what I regard as the best sci-fi film in the history of Hollywood. Firstly, the opening eerie theme musical score by the legendary Bernard Herrmann is unparalelled. The use of the Theremin created the eerie ambience of the otherworldly. That captivating score immediately set the stage for a realistic, believable, and tantalizing film. Michael Rennie's portrayal as "Klaatu" was totally convincing, coupled by his charismatic voice...one of the most memorable in Hollywood. The serious storyline, characterizations, and incredibly realistic special effects even as far back as 1951 - one of the first feature sci-fi films - still fascinates me today, far more than today's so-called sophisticated special effects which look more like the computer-matted sfx images that they are. In a nutshell, between the opening score, Rennie as Klaatu, Herrmann's incidental music throughout the film, the special effects, and undoubtedly Klaatu's mesmerizing closing monologue - which I have personally memorized verbatim and recite during acting monologue auditions - a monologue which still holds merit even today - gives The Day The Earth Stood Still a top-notch quality unmatched by any other sci-fi film. It stands all by itself. An absolute masterpiece with excellent direction by Robert Wise. I established this film as my favorite when I was a young boy, as I feel now, and as I shall as long as I live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farewell To the Master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still, loosely adapted from the Harry Bates story Farewell, To the Master, was the first truly adult science fiction movie. It casts its spell even today. With the credits imposed over the vast expanse of space, and its moody black and white photography, it is now more than fifty years later still a brilliant tour de force for director Robert Wise, screenwriter Edmund North, cinematographer Leo Tover, composer Bernard Herrmann and art director Lyle Wheeler. I can think of no better film in the genre.This is the straightforward tale of a spaceship that lands in Washington, D.C., and its inhabitant, Klaatu, who is shot within seconds after leaving the ship, then taken to a military hospital, from which he escapes. He arrives in disguise at a boardinghouse, where he befriends a boy and his mother, and soon meets up with a famous Einstein-like scientist, whom he helps with a math problem. As things develop, Klaatu executes a plan, which is to stop all machines and electricity in the world (hospitals and airplanes excepted) so as to drive home the awesome power of the interstellar federation of which he is a representative. His message is quite simple: mankind, in the nuclear age, has become too powerful for its own good. When man waged war and guns and spears that was his business, but now, with new atomic weaponry, the inhabitants of earth have become a threat to the rest of the universe. Unless mankind can learn to live peacefully, as the inhabitants of other planets do, they will be destroyed. Klaatu's message is one of peace, not war. The screenplay is by no means perfect, and many have complained that Klaatu's message is essentially fascist. Perhaps so. The human side of the story, while not horrible, is not brilliant, either. As is so often the case with science fiction, the ideas are better than the drama. In this case the acting is superior as well. As Klaatu, Michael Rennie's odd unworldliness for once suits his role, and he is perfect. Patricia Neal's very human sensuality is a perfect contrast to Rennie's remoteness. Sam Jaffe's Dr. Barnard is a fine, low-key performance. I like this movie very much. Unlike many later "adult" sci-fi films, this one has heart and soul. Special effects are minimal. The setting, lower-middle class and yet very white collar, is perfectly realized; and we learn some interesting things about America in 1951, such as the fact most people were still getting their news from the radio. There are subtle, only lightly emphasized parallels between Klaatu and Christ. This is by no means a religious film, though it is in many ways a spiritual one, as we can see how the spectre of nuclear war was driving many people into extreme positions, political, religious and military, which are all nicely outlined in this film. Its message is not a democratic one, and certainly not egalitarian, as its vision of the universe is that it is inhabited by vastly superior beings, appalled by mankind's violent behavior, and quite willing to lay down the law to us. Given the way people behave, in real life no less than in this movie, can one really blame them?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the two best science fiction movies of the 1950s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, along with Forbidden Planet, is one of the two best science fiction movies of the 1950s. The Day the Earth Stood Still, which uses an alien that looks no different from any human, is not the typical 1950s monster sci-fi movie for kids, but is a thoughtful presentation on the human condition, both admirable and less so.The alien looked so much like us that he could take a room in a boarding house and meet and talk with a cross-section of people who did not know who he was. The people in the boarding house included those who react and those who think, those who fear the unknown and those who to view the unknown with awe and wonder, etc. It is their debates, with an occasional comment by the alien, that summarizes the human condition.The theme is also of the forbearing superior intelligence that can no longer forbear humanity's potential for destruction and destructive behavior. That intelligence expresses itself not by destroying the earth or one of its cities, but by warning the earth through the withholding of modern communications and transportation in a manner that would not endanger any humans (e.g.., cars stopped, but airplanes did not fall out of the sky, offices lost power, but hospitals did not). Although this power could have destroyed New York City as a warning, it did not.Fifty-some years after its making, this movie is still worth watching</fullReview>

In some ways I am surprised they even allowed this movie to be made during the Red scare era of the 50's...it's basically an anti-war movie with a kick ass robot and a super budget space ship.I am so happy this movie has been released on DVD.

		<shortDescription>Comments based on the Blu-Ray DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this it was on a fuzzy black and white TV, so it was a treat to see it on the pristine Blu-Ray DVD issued in 2008, although I doubt much additional resolution has been obtained over a regular DVD. Given that the original was released over sixty years ago, I was surprised by how this story about Klaatu, an extraterrestrial visiting Earth to deliver a message, still engaged me. The story is not only good science fiction, it is simply a good story; it convinces me that a good story can trump special effects. In addition to being an engaging tale, the acting and filming are first rate. Lovers of black and white will appreciate this, independently from the story, since the filming takes full advantage of the medium, using high contrast and shadows to great effect.Just about every opinion that can be had about this movie has been aired: great acting vs. poor acting, realistic vs. phony, horribly dated vs. still relevant, fantastic Bernard Hermann score vs. irritating soundtrack, trite vs. powerful message, left-wing vs. fascist political stance, best sci-fi of all time vs. grossly overrated, inspired cinematography vs. pedestrian, and so on.If you stop to analyze the plot, much of what takes place is hardly believable. Klaatu knew of the earth's belligerent tendencies (after all he went a bit out his way to address that issue), so why did he come out of the space ship unprotected? How did the robot Gort (great name!) know when to zap weapons sometimes and not others? Would the Army leave the ship manned by only two soldiers? Even in a more trusting time, would Bobby's mother leave him in the care of Klaatu--a stranger and a strange man. And so on. But the magic of the film is that while I was watching it, it seemed realistic. There is some sharp social commentary. For example, when an interviewer is making the rounds of people gathered at the site of the ship he comes to Klaatu and asks him, "I suppose you're just as scared as the rest of us?" To which Klaatu responds, "In a different way perhaps. I become fearful when I see people substitute fear for reason. In fact I ..." At that point the interviewer cuts him off and says, "Thank you Mr. Carpenter."While this can be interpreted as a retelling of the Jesus story (person with unusual powers appears with a strong message, is betrayed and killed, only to be resurrected) Klaatu's message of "stop with your threatening violence or you will be burnt to a cinder" is more reminiscent of Old Testament justice than the message of love and understanding offered by Jesus. Also, it's a pessimistic message about the nature of social interactions among intelligent beings--the chosen way to control aggressive behavior was to cede enforcement to robots. Doubtful that could ever be implemented on Earth, even under the threat of extinction.There are about a dozen bonus features on the disc: a full-feature director's commentary, a full-feature commentary on the score, shorts on the Theremin, a "making of" feature, interviews, and more. I found most of the extras to be less than captivating. The interview with Billy Gray (excellent as Bobby in the movie) was interesting--the last memories I have of him are from this film and from his appearances in the 1950s sitcom "Father Knows Best."</fullReview>

I noticed while I was seeing this film, that almost all other movies or TV series withing the same genre has in some way been influenced by this one. it is a movie about xenophobia, fear for the unknown, and like most Sci-Fi of today this was among the first to literally say that the human race should not consider itself civil and advanced. like the remake of the film the alien Klaatu sees the primitive tendencies of humanity but also see the good in it, and decides to help them grow and hopefully eventually life in peace with each-other.The effects aren't much compared to today, but hey!it was made in 1951. the effects where groundbreaking by they're standards and that should be taken in consideration. Also the acting is not be overlooked. Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal and especially Billy Gray also gave us strong performances.So i give it a 10/10 and advice all Sci-Fi fans to watch this film immediately. If you like the themes of modern Sci-Fi films and TV you'd be delighted to see one its major inspirations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that we've had the awful remake with Keanue Reeves inflicted upon us, this seems like a good time to praise the original for its greatness.The original was in a way Christian allegory when you think about it. A visitor comes down from Heaven with an important message. He takes on the identity of Mr. Carpenter. (Who else was a carpenter?) He learns more about us, through the innocence of a child. ("Suffer the children to come unto me.") He is betrayed and killed, but rises from the dead. Then he delivers his important message of the need for salvation through improving our behavior before he ascends back into heaven.Yup, Klaatu was Jesus.It is interesting to compare and contrast movie styles. There is no need to hit the viewer over the head with the message. In 1951, the message was clear. We had just completed the most devastating war in human history (WWII) and were now developing new weapons that not only could bring the complete destruction of humanity, but gave us the potential to bring our destructive potential to other worlds. We needed a space-age Jesus to tell us to get our heads straight. But Wise told his story with subtly that the 2008 version (the new original sin being global warming) lacks.A final note. It was soon after this movie came out that an interesting movement known as the 'contactees' began. These were people who claimed to have met with human-like beings in flying saucers. Just as "Close Encounters" spurred a wave of people seeing little "gray" aliens, this movie spurred a series of people seeing angelic human like flying saucer pilots.</fullReview>

If you haven't seen it yet, please do so shortly, but nothing i write here can do it true justice.I was a star wars fanatic, and I couldn't stop talking about the matrix either, oh and by the way.. if you know of a door to narnia or middle-earth, i'd be interested in hearing more ha ha ha! What I'm saying is that these stories brought a refreshing realm of higher understanding into thought. The Day The Earth Stood Still is a story that does this as well.It's set on Earth and in a city. The main character has a message, and is an excellent role model, polite and patient, kind and wise. However, he is being hampered by the fear and prejudices of man. So instead, he devises his own way to deliver a message. The supporting characters who know him try to help him in his task.It's an excellent message, and you'll have to see what for yourself, but you can watch assured that The Day the Earth Stood Still is a very excellent movie!</fullReview>

It has everything that makes the genre work: novel ideas, interesting characters, an alien visitor, a robot, a spaceship, special effects, a love interest, misguided military power, cold war paranoia, a creepy but very memorable Bernard Herrmann soundtrack, and some of the coolest quotes of any sci-fi film; check out IMDb's Memorable Quotes link. Sure, some of the effects seem dated after more than 55 years, but that's already true of Star Wars Ep. IV after 30 years.The movie has a wonderful cast: Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Billy Gray, Hugh Marlowe, Frances Bavier and Sam Jaffe. It features a superb Edmund North screenplay, and is directed by Robert Wise (The Sound of Music, West Side Story, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, The Andromeda Strain, Curse of the Cat People, etc.) If you enjoy the movie, search for "Farewell to the Master" by Harry Bates, the short story on which the movie was based; it's significantly different, a great read, and easy to find on-line. There's also a Lux Radio Theatre adaptation worth listening to from 1954.</fullReview>

Director Robert Wise's "The Day The Earth Stood Still" was adapted from a short story by Harry Bates entitled "Farewell To The Master". Released in 1951, it is a classic, iconic early science fiction film. The image of the tall, strong and steel-made robot Gort has remained in the minds of science fiction lovers for generations. Versatile, dramatic actor Michael Rennie stars as Klaatu, a human male inhabitant of another planet, seemingly perfect and free of war. A spaceship lands in Washington D.C. and stirs the fears of the entire nation. Klaatu poses as a resident of the capital, Mr. Carpenter and befriends Bobby (Billy Gray), the son of a single working mother Helen Benson (Patricia Neal). But Helen's boyfriend, Tom (Hugh Marlowe) mistrusts the new stranger and believes he is the alien enemy. But Klaatu is far from hostile, he comes from a peaceful planet after all. His message to the human population of earth: cease production of nuclear weapons made for destruction and war. At the time of this film, there was a huge scare in America: the Communist threat and nuclear war. While Communist threat is no longer an issue, nuclear weapons or "weapons of mass destruction" is still very much an issue in our world today. The situation in Korea with the dictator Kim Jong-il for example and President Bush's quest to find weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. This film is not just science fiction. At one level it is composed of the classic, campy, science fiction of 50's comic books that feature giant robots with destructive powers, the threat of an invasion from aliens and so forth. But at another level it's a social commentary on the insecurities and anxities Americans had because of Communism and the fear of nuclear war. In Hollywood, several film makers were blacklisted as Communists during the McArthy Era which was the time of this film. This is exactly why Klaatu is for the most part in the role of "Mr. Carpenter" a friendly but strange newcomer in America, almost suggestive of an immigrant from a country that is a socialist/Communist Utopia. Audiences must have been quick to see the message because the film does not follow conventional science fiction movie film plots. There are no heroes or villains, just a message. The ending is a huge disappointment as there is no real resolution to the film nor much action. Klaatu warns the humans of earth to cease the making of nuclear arms and then returns home on his spaceship with Kort the killer robot. This must be seen as a film of its time and not judged by today's science fiction. The acting is also very much in following with the melodramatic, almost radio drama type of material. Patricia Neal as Helen, for example, is a character straight out of radio drama. It's interesting to note how she is not a housefrau, but a single working mother and she even refuses to marry Tom when he decides to report Klaatu to the authorities, this at a time of famous 50's housewives. There are other nice touches. For instance, the musical score by Bernard Hermann. It is a very eerie music and suited to science fiction of this time. This is a short, enjoyable film and a must see for science fiction buffs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Klaatu, barrada, nikto."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time just a few years ago, and it immediately became one of my top ten films of all time. I would have to say that's in good part due to the way Michael Rennie portrays the alien Klaatu, entirely disciplined and intent on completing his mission on his terms. Never once does he get riled or become argumentative with those who oppose him, his is a carefully reasoned approach, best stated in his conversation with Professor Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe) - "I'm impatient with stupidity, my people have learned to live without it." One of my favorite scenes has to do with the way Klaatu improves the Professor's math formula, and then reveals how it was good enough to allow travel between planets, very cleverly done.Having Klaatu integrate into human society by way of the boarding house was an effective way to demonstrate his willingness to learn and understand human behavior. It's not surprising that his closest ally would become young Bobby Benson (Billy Gray), still uncontaminated by the shortcomings of being an adult. Their relationship allows Bobby to call him a screwball without disapproval, but I'll admit that line catches me off guard each time I hear it.I have to say, upon repeat viewings the robot Gort leaves something to be desired in the way of costuming. Other sci-fi films of the era did a much better job in the way of special effects, notably 1953's "War Of The Worlds". Still, the emphasis wasn't so much on Gort, even in his role as protector of planets. Fortunately, he had Klaatu's discipline to render weapons harmless instead of destroying humans.The movie employs what I like to refer to as the 'Twilight Zone' look in it's presentation; there's something about it that set that series apart from other black and white shows of the day. In it's way, the movie is a bit like an expanded episode of "The Twilight Zone", only without a twist ending. In that regard, the film allows the viewer to come to his own conclusion, although based on what I've come to understand about human nature, "The Day The Earth Stood Still" would never have a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My two cents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born in 1957, 6 years after this film came out. It was the first film I bought on VHS, and the first DVD I ever bought.I can agree that the acting in this film does not compare the acting in say "Gone With the Wind", the filmography is sub par when compared with "The Wizard of Oz." The special effects have nothing in common with "Encounters of the 4th Kind", or even a story line is not as intriguing as "To Sir, With Love." (And yes I have seen all of these great films. Actually I could,'t sit through "Gone With the Wind".} Having been only 6 when President John Kennedy was assassinated on public television, having watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon, and watching as Viet Nam was broadcast for all to see, I can say with some conviction that this movie was at the time one of the most poignant films there was. It had a message that anyone not of that age can only understand when comparing it to history.But for all of this movies faults, the stiff acting (and yes I agree Michael Rinnie was a little stiff, you would be too if you were suffering from a head cold during most of the filming.) I also agree that Patricia Neil was by far the best actress in the movie, even Billy Grey was less than perfect. But when you look at the movie and the message, it is wonderful as a whole. Anything you want to take apart and bash bit by little bit will fail to hold together.To put it simply, as long as this movie exists it will remain in my library to be viewed when I need something to remind me of where I came from, which this move does. And in the time that this movie was, it was far ahead of it's time. And to compare it to the productions of today there is no comparison. If they ever attempted to remake this film, or even to colorize it I for one would never see it.Remember Michael Rennie's space suit was red.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A giant from the golden age of sci-fi films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many sci-fi movies came out of 1950's with flying saucers and threatening visitors to earth from outer space. Few were good. Most were fun because they were so campy. Earthlings were always the heroes. This film that helped usher in the 50's decade of sci-fi was so unlike the films that would follow. This is intelligent and inventive with a great story. There was a believable realism to this that made it touching yet sinister. It also addresses the politics of the Cold War era. Director Robert Wise had a couple good films in the 40's but most were forgettable in his directorial career until The Day The Earth Stood Still. He of course would go on to make a variety many fine films including West Side Story and The Sound of Music as well as The Sand Pebbles, The Haunting and his return to science fiction with The Andromeda Strain and the first Star Trek movie. Michael Rennie is perfect in the role the alien Klaatu who assimilates into human society as the sophisticatedly charming Mr. Carpenter. Patricia Neal is his human love interest Helen and Hugh Marlow as her boyfriend Tom. Sam Jaffe is wonderful as Prof. Barnhardt who is presumably the smartest guy on Earth in kind of a Albert Einstein character. Jaffe would become familiar to TV viewers in the 60's as Dr. Zorba on Ben Casey. rounding out the cast are a couple of other actors who would become familiar to TV viewers, Bill Gray who would go on to star as Bud in Father Knows Best is the son of the Patricia Neal character and Francis Bavier who would play Aunt Bea on the Andy Griffith show is Mrs. Barley from the rooming house. I would see this on TV at least once a year while I was growing up and always looked forward to seeing it and that same feeling and love for this movie stayed with me in my adult years. I have no idea how many times I've seen this but it's probably as many as a couple dozen times or more. I've never seen it on the big screen though. I would give this a 10 out of 10 and highly recommend it.</fullReview>

At the end of the movie, I still want to see Patricia Neal get in the space ship, and go away with Klaatu.The password given by Klaatu (to Helen Benson) for Gort to fetch his body in the event that something happens to him (Gort: "Klaatu Verada Nikto"), is used in the film ARMY OF DARKNESS. Too bad the hero of this film could not remember the last word - Nikto.This is the #1 film of my 66 years.Goof: How could it be daytime all around the world at noon in Washington, DC???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to give it to Mr. Robert Wise, his name says it all. The Day The Earth Stood Still is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. For those who have yet to see it (Shame on you), I will not give any information, only that this was excellent storytelling. Mr. Wise also directed The Haunting and Audrey Rose, as well as West Side Story and The Sound Of Music, so diversity should be his middle name. I was overcome with certain emotions when I saw this movie again and I remembered just how great it was. I think Plan 9 From Outer Space was written similarly, but even Mr. Turkey himself, Mr Edward Wood, couldn't do what Mr. Wise did. Kudos to Mr Robert Wise, one of my new favorite directors. And thank you Sir, for bringing us some very classy storytelling and fulfilling the Science Fiction genre with great roots to grow with for the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood StillThis fabulous movie starts off with the military tracking a spaceship which ultimately lands in the mall of downtown Washington, D.C. Panic incurs to all witnesses, but they do seem to gather around the ship with an intense sense of curiosity. After a few confusing moments, the ship opens, and Klaatu appears in his glittery spaceman suit. The next few minutes appear to be a stalemate because no one knows how to act. After all, this being is very 'out of this world.' Finally, Klaatu begins to approach the group without saying anything, and one of the surrounding military men fires his gun as Klaatu is trying to present a gift. This is where the story begins.Klaatu has come to save the earth. He does not want to save us from another planet but, rather, from ourselves. It is because we have finally discovered nuclear power sources that he must do this. The other planets, which form an inter-planetary alliance, feel that we are too aggressive and worry about their own safety now. All of these other planets live in peace.There is no war or aggression. If there is aggression on the part of one party, then the robots they built to police themselves act quickly and viciously. These robots have no emotions like humans, so there is no chance to explain anything to them. They certainly keep all of the other planets in line.Klaatu is visiting our planet trying to help us, so it makes sense that he would interact with other humans. He takes the name of Mr. Carpenter and lives at a boarding house. There he meets Mrs. Benson and her son Bobby, who both play great supporting roles in the movie. The entire movie is based on human characteristics: how we love shown through Mrs. Benson and Bobby, hatred is shown through the other nations who refuse to meet as one to speak about this global issue, and paranoia, which is time appropriate for the 1950s, considering the relationships between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Mr. Carpenter comes in contact with everyone from the world's leading scientists to Mrs. Benson's greedy suitor, Tom. This just emphasizes the need for the world to change and be less aggressive, no matter what the demography of the area or person may be. The movie is true to the style of a 1950 scientific fiction movie. There are special effects that seem quite inferior to today's technology, and the movie is done with black and white film. I personally think that these attributes only helped me to focus more on the movie; they certainly did not draw anything away from the experience.There is no flashy coloring to distract you, so, in turn, you think more closely about what the writers are trying to convey in the way of thoughts and ideas.So the question is, if a being from another more advanced planet is trying to tell us what we are doing wrong, why wouldn't we listen to him? Well, the fact is that most humans are stubborn. We have ideas implanted in our heads that we cannot see past to judge the real situation. This movie still is very applicable to our own society today. We are yet to maintain world peace, look past different racial or ethnic backgrounds, and live in a more united society where we all care about one another. None of this can be accomplished because humans are greedy. The movie exhibits a perfect example of this through Mr. Tom Stevens. When the entire world is going into turmoil, the only thing he can think about are the diamonds which he obtained through Mr. Carpenter. He wants to gain fame and wealth, and that is all he cares about. But, when you think about it, isn't our society still telling us that is what is most important today?This movie is a perfect example of how a film from the 1950s can translate precisely into the society in which we live today. The fact that the plot is thrilling but the special affects are not overbearing allows you to focus completely on what the writers are trying to tell us. This movie is about how humans live and interact with others. It shows our greatest strengths in love and our weakest points of greed and being self-serving. This film is a sci-fi gem and will live on, not only in our present society, but in any society which contains the characteristics of human beings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Day the Earth Stood Still" Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I enjoyed the movie 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'. It is not a very dated film, it was unpredictable, and was and still is relevant in society. It is done very well and carries an important message. Although there is a political point involved, it is not a boring movie and it is fun to watch.Despite the fact that the movie was written and filmed more than half a century ago, many of the events that occur in it are ageless. For instance, when the spaceship lands there is an intense curiosity from everyone in the world, and everyone wants to know who or what is inside and where they come from. A huge crowd gathers around the ship and every radio and television station across the world is busy trying to get the latest scoop from the government about what is happening. Many viewers scoff at the foolishness of the crowd thoughtlessly gathering around a potentially dangerous area, even though if the same situation occurred in the present day the very same viewers who laughed at the people gathered around the spaceship would be in the same type of group avidly awaiting a sign of life from the shuttle. When the space shuttle comes speeding around the world and finally stops in Washington D.C., the viewer does not know what would step out or if anything is going to happen. And when the alien escapes from the hospital and goes wandering around the city, it is not apparent what he wanted or where he was going. When Klaatu dies, the viewer does not know whether it was the end of the story, and it is hard to guess what Ms. Benson saying the words to Gort will do. I also like the fact that the ending is not obvious from the beginning. When the alien flies off in his space ship he leaves the world with a serious choice, 'stop fighting or be obliterated'. This is not a decision that can be put off or ignored. The ending does not clarify which choice the world will make and the end is a cliffhanger of sorts. The political significance of this movie was relevant when it was made and is still applicable today. The movie portrays a very important idea, the concept of a world in which there were no weapons, wars, or acts of aggression. The idea is still relevant today, but it is hard to fathom. The idea of the whole world staying peaceful forever is very idealistic, but still a good idea. It would weed out the superpower countries that lead by fear and the threat of violence, and those that lead by setting a strong example and helping other countries would become more powerful. It would be hard to realize that dream, even if the whole world began working very hard towards that purpose. Every country would want the other to destroy their weapons before they would, and no country would ever volunteer to go first. Also, a conflict between countries would eventually arise. Then the world would have to find another way to resolve its issues, which would undoubtedly be a problem, because it seems to be the only quick and effective way the many leaders of the world have come up with to solve problems permanently so far. 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' is a great science fiction movie today, even after many years of existence. The events that occurred in the movie were unrealistic, yet still portrayed in a believable fashion. The actions of the people in the movie were not dated and still what people would do today, the plot is not a generic plot like many movies made today, and the points and ideas expressed in the movie, although pertaining to politics that happened at that time, are still pertinent today. The film was well thought out and enjoyable to watch. Even when the viewer is enjoying watching, the important messages are still being put forth, leading the viewer to think instead of just lazily watching the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can be enjoyed on both levels at once - an accomplishment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A social/political satire of the Cold War masquerading as a drive-in sci-fi flick. What's great about The Day the Earth Stood Still is that it can be first enjoyed as a really fun 50's space man-flying saucer flick, but then be wonderfully evocative. There's just so much in here. Everything has a potential double meaning, in a good way. For people who know a little about the Cold War there are plenty of fun little in-jokes, which are not so deep that someone who only knows that there was a political/ideological and occasionally military loggerhead between the USSR and the USA, can't get them.Film-noir cinematography, an iconic sci-fi soundtrack, spot-on direction by Robert Wise, a well-written script that doesn't mess around - gets us right into the action and cleverly elucidates all the possible comments on the cold war from the spaceman scenario, in a very natural way.It deals an admirable amount of social criticism without ruining the movie for those who're only there to see a straight space-man flick. And for this, if not just for the fact that its a damn good movie, damn well made, and lots of fun, i give it 5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Wise gets to direct one of the most powerful science fiction movies of the 1950's..."The Day The Earth Stood Still". A man from another planet comes to warn the Earth that if they carry their destructive ways into outer space, it'll mean the destruction of the Earth via a huge robot by the name of Gort. Klaatu devices a way to draw the Earth's attention to his mission by shorting out all the electricity across the globe. All through the movie, Klaatu is perceived as being "evil" &amp; "hostile" due to the over-suspicious nature of mankind during "The Red Scare" era. However, as everyone soon learns, you can't judge a book by its cover. Great special effects. Powerful message. Look for Francis Bavier (Aunt Bea from The Andy Griffith Show) in this movie.</fullReview>

Sam Jaffe (Prof. Jacob Barnhardt),"Ben Casey"'61 TV series acted liked an Einstein and needed Klaatu to figure out his Math problems.

Considering that this was filmed back in 1951 in the days before cgi that's impressive.The film was released at the height of the cold war and is all about fear and distrust of the unknown. Klaatu arrives on the planet to warn mankind that it must stop it's insatiable desire for war. This inevitably leads him to get killed and Gort is stopped from destroying the world in the nick of time.

		<fullReview>**spoilers ahead**Robert Wise directed two and a half great science fiction films; this one, 'The Andromeda Strain' and 'Star Trek - The Movie' which is the half one. TDTESS is is a simple story of a visitor to the earth with a simple message: if you begin to threaten other planets with your belligerence and petty sqabblings you are in trouble. It is not a comforting message.It is brought by Klaatu, diffidently but effectively played by Michael Rennie, who appears to be a Christ-like figure. He comes among the people, he dies, he rises again, he ascends upwards. His assumed name while staying in a lodging house is Carpenter. He does not bring salvation however, he brings judgement. His angel is not Gabriel but a robot called Gort, and this angel acts independently of the creator. As the flying saucer takes off at the end of the film the feeling is one of disquiet.Apart from the myriad of meanings, social and political as well as religious, that could be put on the film, it is well made and keeps one's attention. The supporting actors are well chosen. Mention should be made of Sam Jaffe, always watchable, and Patricia Neal who brings her usual intelligence to her role. The special effects are OK but are not the centre of interest anyway. It is filmed like a film noir giving it a fascinating atmosphere, unlike similar 1950s sci-fi. The scene in the dark lift with Klaatu and Helen, bars of light and dark falling on them, is classic film noir, but it is not a killer she is trapped in a lift with but someone who could destroy her planet. Much of the film is set after dark.An excellent film on all counts. It is a real work of art, much more than those films with a huge sense of their own importance but don't bear viewing more than once. TDTESS can be seen again and again.</fullReview>

It is the epitome of the 1950s sci-fi genre, complete with giant robot, flying saucer and a sliver-suited space visitor. Despite that, its message is so relevant today it mad me sad. Nothing about the lack of peace-on-earth has changed in the half-century that has elapsed since this film was made. We remain a small-minded warlike little planet. In the film the United Nations can't even get it's act together to meet the space visitor. Sound familiar? No wonder the alien looks down his nose at us. Extraterrestrials in the real universe probably do to. that's the most compelling argument why UFO stories are phony.

		<fullReview>Michael Rennie was born to play Klaatu, an alien emissary sent to Earth to warn mankind that space is patrolled by an automated police force of indestructible robots who will fry the Earth if we show any signs of military aggression outside our own planet. Patricia Neal and Hugh Marlowe give fine supporting performances, and Sam Jaffe looks more like Einstein than Einstein himself.Small but memorable roles during the scene at the breakfast table went to Francis Bavier ("The Andy Griffith Show") and Olan Soule ("Captain Midnight"). The rigorous job of wearing the rubberized Gort suit designed by art directors Lyle Wheeler and Addison Hehr was assigned to Lock Martin, a 7' 7" former doorman at Grauman's Chinese Theater. Martin later played one of the Martians in "Invaders from Mars". Billy Gray ("Father Knows Best") got to play the luckiest kid in the world, the only person in the story who chats with an alien about life back home (even though the viewer hears little of their conversations). Listen for a brief scene in which Klaatu tutors Billy in math.This was America's first good look at a well-done science fiction movie which featured (a) an alien, (b) an alien spaceship, (c) a robot, and (d) an honest-to-goodness death ray. Obviously America liked what it saw, because "The Day the Earth Stood Still" set the standard in science fiction movies for decades to come. Bernard Herrmann's incredible music score is still the personal favorite of several million sci-fi buffs -- especially after it was released on CD. Amazingly the score was originally recorded by Fox in STEREO -- so the CD sounds great without any trick enhancements. Amazing.Trivia note -- The equations on Professor Barnhardt's blackboard are not just gibberish; they really are a problem in celestial mechanics, provided by the film's technical advisor, Dr. Samuel Herrick of UCLA.In the mid-1960s the film was shown on NBC's "Saturday Night at the Movies", and whole new generation became fans of this sci-fi classic (including yours truly).Unfortunately, after this great start, Hollywood rarely came close to duplicating the quality of their original inspiration. "The Day the Earth Stood Still" has a special aura which puts it in a class by itself, and even today the film is a vintage classic instead of a dated antique. Rumors of a remake stirred much interest in 1982, but nothing came of it.In my humble opinion, the only other 1950s film that succeeds in invoking the same awe and wonder as this one is Jack Arnold's seldom-seen classic, "The Space Children" in 1958. The two films have a great deal in common.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a genre that today more often relies on head spinning special effects and action to grab attention. This one had awesome special effects for the time, but the classic sci-fi story line which works on many levels carries the film. Patricia Neal said she often had to stifle giggles to get her lines out, but you'd never know it from her wonderful performance. Sam Jaffe's character role was delicious too. 51 years later, Gort still scares the stuffing out of me! To this day, the only sci-fi film that compares with it is Blade Runner. This one is a shrine to the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was browsing the comments for angles I hadn't picked up on and noticed a few people expressing their hopes for a remake. It would never be as good. Part of the charm of this film is its naivety. Any way, for some expansion on the helpful alien theme you could do worse than check out "Friendship's Death" a Peter Wollen film starring Tilda Swinton well before she appeared in "Orlando". "Friendship's Death", although a more sophisticated film, like TDTESS is restrained in its use of special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mothership of all outer space sci-fi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Day the Earth Stood Still" was released in 1951 right at the beginning of the McCarthy 'Red Scare' and (wink-wink) little bits of 'Cold War' propaganda (both pro and con actually) can be detected throughout this modest little thriller hinting at the nature and attitudes of edgy, red-blooded Americans at the time this witch's brew was stirring. But, just as significantly, this movie became a milestone in a much different, much more entertaining manner - Hollywood was introducing us to a whole new exciting pastime, SCIENCE FICTION movies! The $64,000 question at the Saturday matinee was, "Is there life on Mars?" It was the big, big "what if.......?" The Hollywood "science age" had officially begun. For grownups, telescopes became the newest and coolest adult toy. For us kids, laser guns, instead of Colt .45s, became our favorite weapons to take down the neighborhood pals. It was a great innocent time to be young."The Day the Earth Stood Still" was perfect fodder, not only for the young but the old as well. It not only stimulated social and political reasoning, it dazzled us with galvanized, impervious robots and flying saucers that kept us glued to the edge of our seats. Eloquent, saturnine, gaunt-faced Michael Rennie was the ideal choice to play the sophisticated representative from outer space who issues fair warning to out-of-control planet Earth that it was time we looked at the destruction we were doing to ourselves and others. At the time I thought Rennie the spaceman was more powerful than God! He had such an awesome, imposing countenance, with deep, penetrating eyes and a sturdy, upright, almost regal stance. It remains his most identifiable role. And Patricia Neal...well, she became the neatest mom when the alien allowed her in on THE BIG SECRET. But she won the "Mother of the Year" medal when she got to utter the immortal command "Klaatu, barada, nikto," was carried away by the robot to the inside of the flying saucer, and helped save alien Rennie's life. Yep, Mom's don't come any cooler than that! In fact, I remember wishing she would just chuck the bland, boring, snitch of a boyfriend (Hugh Marlowe, who else?), marry the handsome spaceman, and live happily ever after in outer space! As for little Billy Gray (later 'Bud' on "Father Knows Best"), he got to live the fantasy of every tyke on my block as the boy who first suspects that the new boarder upstairs isn't the 'average Joe' he makes himself out to be, then gets to sneak out at night and play detective while witnessing robots vaporize security guards. Now, that's material just made for "show and tell" on Mondays.The 50s sci-fis that followed were hardly inspiring. But, every now and then, Hollywood DID get it right (1953's "War of the Worlds," for one). For the most part, however, the schlock dished out was disappointing, bordering on the silly, one-eyed-monster tripe. Very little insight; even less imagination.Ah well, like the movie here aptly pointed out, we ARE a weak. vulnerable species - prone to paranoia and prone to violence. Michael Rennie's spaceman, in his big, climactic universal speech, offered us a valuable life's lesson and we didn't listen. Instead, aliens became just another enemy, a new version of the Commies. Another race and breed to distrust and annihilate. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see the sad irony in that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Closer Look at the Serious Subtext</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably, this is the most allegorical sci-fi movie of the decade. I'd like to zero in on not only some of those thought-provoking elements, but also on their unusual nature for the conformist decade of the 1950's.The subtext amounts to a clear commentary on the Cold War then gaining popular steam. Klaatu (Rennie) is on an inter-planetary peace mission, declaring that the Earth's nuclear war potential jeopardizes inter-planetary peace, a clear reference to Soviet-American rivalry. Surprisingly, he draws no distinctions about which side is at fault in the rivalry. Ordinarily, we would expect a Hollywood screenplay to blame Soviet aggression in some fashion. However, the technologically superior Klaatu refuses to be drawn into what he calls our "petty squabbles".What Klaatu represents can be considered a United Nations of planets, which has found ways of settling disputes in a peaceful manner, enforced, so to speak, by super-human robots like the formidable Gort. The fact that a Gort-like "police" force is present even in this advanced political arrangement raises interesting questions, but ones that lie outside the movie's scope. All in all, I think the screenplay amounts to a subtextual plea for a stronger peace organization like the then newish United Nations in order to avert nuclear war and settle disputes here on Earth.On a related point, note how it's not the politicians that can be expected to respond to Klaatu's plea, even after Gort's impressive use of a disintegrator beam. The president's representative Harley (Conroy) observes that no international meeting is possible since each side wants to be in charge. In short, national priorities take precedence over all else for the heads of state. Consequently, Klaatu turns to the scientific community represented by Prof. Barnhardt (Jaffe) for support. That's a logical choice since science's ideal of objective truth transcends national rivalries. Note, however, that even for this international brain trust, the crucial matter of joining a supra-national peace organization remains unsettled at movie's end. Clearly, the screenplay leaves the crucial matter in audience hands.What's really unusual for the time is the role of the US military in the scenario. This may be the only film of the '50's to portray our military as part of the problem, if you will, rather than the solution. Klaatu's biggest concern is the army's aggressiveness toward him and his one-man army, the robot Gort, who's capable apparently of destroying the entire Earth should anything happen to his master. This puts the audience in an odd position of looking at the military as a danger instead of a remedy. No need to point out how this departs from Hollywood conventions of the period.All in all, the movie's subtext is decidedly opposed to right-wing (though not necessarily patriotic) assumptions of the day. Firstly, the burgeoning Cold War is put into a larger framework whose practical upshot is that of boosting peace organizations such as the United Nations. Secondly, the military is shown as not always being the wisest course of action when dealing with the unfamiliar (contrast with The Thing {1951}). And thirdly, intellectuals (scientists) are portrayed as better suited to grasping great challenges than the national security state (politicians and generals). This was really pretty daring liberal stuff for the Age of McCarthy.The movie itself remains a classic of entertainment, subtext or no. The producers' real coup was getting the relatively unknown Rennie for the pivotal part of the alien. With his tall, angular features, he projects both intelligence and the unfamiliar. I love that shot of him standing in scary shadow as he first enters Helen's livingroom. It shook me up as a kid and still does. Then too, director Wise makes astute use of noirish shadows in that key elevator scene between Klaatu and HelenAlso, note how the movie has Klaatu and the wonderful little Bobby (Gray) visiting our national landmarks and expressing admiration for icons like Lincoln and Jefferson. This allows the film to imply that while the screenplay may be anti-right wing, it's not anti-American, an important consideration for a commercial product, even a daring one.Anyway, it appears that once again a science fiction format is being used to get across allegorical points that would be less acceptable in a more literal format. But however you slice it, the movie's still worth a look-see, even 60-years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing how a 1950's movie can reproduce modern times. Imagine now if a spaceship lands in the front lawn of the white house, the alien emerging voicing no harm, and extends a gift - what would we modern, intelligent Americans do? That's right -we shoot the bastard, and refuse to listen to him because it would be too difficult. Same is true today. I love this movie, even though it is a thinly disguised "Bobby" movie that my parents got to watch in school teaching them about dating, hygiene, and how a textbook over your head can save you from a nuclear attack. Besides the 50's special effects I always love to watch, my favorite part is when the doctors are lamenting about their recently discovered lack of medical knowledge and the inability to live to 135 years, while chain smoking Marlboro's. It was also kind of fun watchin "Aunt Bea" as the nasty ol' lady who thinks that only the good ol' US of A can save the world. This is a movie that is fun to roll out every now and then to get a good laugh at ourselves, knowing nobody has the guts to attempt a similar commentary in this day and age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Klaatu, an alien from beyond the stars arrives with his robot companion, Gort, to preach a message of peace to Earth's inhabitants. When his first plan doesn't work as well as hoped, he escapes and moves in as a border with an Earth family, taking the surname of Carpenter. Of course with human nature to fear what is not known, he has trouble getting his message across. In addition not telling any singular nation alone his plan further hinders him. What makes this film intriguing is that it seems politically neutral as both the right and left wings can grab onto certain elements of the movie and run with them. It's always a joy to find a piece of cinema that doesn't spell everything out to the audience, thus reducing the intelligence of said movie dramatically. This is a huge problem of more recent cinema outings. And that's part of the reason why this film had not only stood the test of time, but strived to become one of the top echelon of science fiction films of all time.My Grade: B+ DVD Extras: Commentary by director Robert Wise and Nicolas Meyer; Movietone Newsreel footage from 1951; and Theatrical trailer on Side A. 80 and a half minute "Making The Earth Stand Still" documentary; Restoration comparison; Stills galleries; Shooting script; and Trailers for "One Million Years, BC", &amp; "Journey To The Center Of The Earth" on Side B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "B" Movie with "A+" Ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a nifty little science fiction film from 1951, low-budget and starkly designed, that I'm sure was not meant to be anything major when released, but has since become to be considered one of the greatest of its genre. Directed with a spare, documentary-like style by Robert Wise (who would go on to direct such major motion pictures as "The Sound of Music" and "West Side Story"), the film tells the story of a lone visitor (with his robot Gort) to Earth, who comes to warn the inhabitants of this planet against the irresponsible use of atomic power. This movie should be required viewing today, especially by members of our own government, as U.S. policy seems to be shifting ever more toward doing whatever the hell we want and the effects of our actions on world relations be damned. Sadly, the earthlings in the film behave all too predictably (and realistically), instantly assuming the visitors have come to inflict harm and dealing with the situation through excessive military force. Sound familiar?It's a quick 90-minute film that smartly keeps its plot basic; it knows not to overstretch its modest bounds. Michael Rennie is appropriately otherworldly as Klaatu, the humanoid alien, and Patricia Neal appears in an early role as one of the only level-headed people in Washington D.C. A terrific and thoughtful movie.Trivia: Patricia Neal's character is instructed late in the film to say the words "Klaatu, Barada, Nikto" to Gort to prevent him from going on a destructive rampage. George Lucas borrowed these three words and gave them as names to three of Jabba the Hutt's henchman in "Return of the Jedi." A case of one sci-fi film offering homage to another.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not so unrealistic. Consider this: 1) We are using an atomic rocket to get to Saturn in 2007 2) 250 million miles is somewhere near Jupiter or possibly Europa where NASA believes there is life. 3) A workable laser weapon wasn't invented until May 1960. So how did Harry Bates design one for Gort to have in 1951? 4) NASA is is designing robots as astronauts today. They are marketing one at Best Buy stores now for you to get the feel of how AI and robots in space will work. 5) If you thought Harry wrote in a Jesus Christ angle for Rennie as Klaatu you were right! They made Edmund North rewrite the resurecction scene you NEVER saw. The original scene had a very sacrireligous and blasphemous message about ressurection and everlasting life from Klaatu to Patricia Neal after comes back to life. It is in some can somewhere in a Hollywood vault. 6) There was no 'hidden' Cold War message about Russians being the hidden true enemy aliens. They mentioned the Russians in the movie openly and the Cold War. Atomic Energy is the 'Genie In the Bottle' that Klaatu and any sane person would want abolished as it is just too dangerous for mere humans (i.e. 3 Mile Island, Chernoble, etc.). Einstien, Oppenhiemer and others where against Atomic Energy in the end. The evil late Mr. Teller was not however. Now we have X-Ray bombs, dangerous atomic rockets, beam weapons, etc.Wow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Trojan Horse of 1950's filmmaking...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writer of "Everybody Comes To Rick's" (which would later be the basis for "Casablanca") said during an interview for the most recent video version of "Casablanca": "True yesterday, true today, true tomorrow. That's my definition of a classic." By that very definition, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is still the supreme science fiction classic of the 1950's. Like most good films during the '50s, it is a subversive film, using the classic UFO, spaceman outfit, and giant robot designs to slip a timeless message (perhaps more important than ever now that Cold War has brought up the threat of loose nukes) of peace and man's disposition towards war and destruction. The threat of what might happen to our planet and ourselves if we continue to pursue our war-like ways is made entirely without malice (name me any other alien races in science fiction filmmaking that's done this); it is stated matter-of-fact, with the ultimate goal being peace, one or another. Just the same, they don't want to do that to Earth without giving us a chance (proof of a superior intelligience right there); Klaatu's race was once, no doubt, just as war-like and they see no reason why humans can't outgrow that decidedly immature phase as they did.Michael Rennie is the film's center, effortlessly mesmerizing as a peaceful alien visitor who is trying to keep the Earthlings from being destroyed when (not if, but when) they take to the stars. Perhaps my favorite bit happens to be when he is speaking in his native tongue and making it sound as natural as ordering a Big Mac. The Christ parable of what happens to him is a bit obvious when one thinks about it, but it is telling that he himself denies any such divinity. In matters of life and death, he is no different than any other inhabitant on the globe; the day must come to pass when he too must die. Here's hoping Earth gets its act together before he does though, eh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential piece of classic science-fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a parable of Cold War paranoia and tension, The Day the Earth Stood Still has few rivals, most notably Planet of the Apes (the 1968 original, of course) and TV show The Twilight Zone (both, not surprisingly, written by Rod Serling), with Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove standing out as a comedic reaction to those times (although it doesn't really qualify as sci-fi, unlike the others). The other virtue of Robert Wise's seminal film is that, much like most episodes of The Twilight Zone, it doesn't contain that many things to suggest otherworldly stuff is going on. What counts is the good, old, nail-biting suspense.As such, the beginning of the movie, with a spaceship landing in Washington, D.C., relies on editing and music (by none other than Bernard Herrmann, who also scored The Twilight Zone) rather than visual effects: the ship lands, and doesn't move for the rest of the film. An alien emerges, but he's in human form (Michael Rennie). He has a robotic bodyguard, Gort (Lock Martin), but it doesn't do much beside guarding the ship. The important thing is Klaatu's message to the world, one that must be heard by all of mankind. Unfortunately, only a single mother (Patricia Neal) and a scientist (Sam Jaffe) are willing to listen to him without shooting first.The great thing about The Day the Earth Stood Still is it doesn't shove its message (a subtle critique on nuclear energy) in the audience's face, save for a somewhat preachy closing monologue (but hey, it was the '50s - they could get away with it): it's the moments that lead up to that point which make the movie a classic. Be it the smart and sometimes humorous dialogue, Rennie's "alien" performance or the fact that the film's major set-piece (Klaatu demonstrating his power) is pulled off in the simplest fashion (but a very effective one nonetheless), Wise's first sci-fi feature can boast real soul and intelligence to go with the more outlandish props (the interior of the ship especially).Plus, and this is what genre geeks tend to love the most: how many serious science-fiction films, which have even be said to have religious subtexts, can brag about inspiring the funniest scene in Sam Raimi's deliriously entertaining Army of Darkness?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the greatest sci-fi movies over half a century later...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Day the Earth Stood Still" is still one of the greatest sci-fi movies over half a century after its release. I wasn't even alive in 1951, so I did not have the honor to appreciate this film when it was most relevant (of course, it still is in 2008). One could call this film liberal, peace-loving hogwash, but to do so is to miss the point entirely. It doesn't matter whether you're conservative or liberal; we're all human beings and we must share this planet together, or face obliteration, which is the dilemma facing spaceman Klaatu (the great British actor Michael Rennie), who has come to Earth with a message for all the world's leaders to hear. But Cold War tensions make such a meeting impossible. In the haste of his arrival in Washington, D.C., overzealous soldiers wound Klaatu and only his commands keep his massive robot companion Gort (Lock Martin) from destroying all that stands in his master's way. Klaatu soon escapes the hospital he's sent to, and takes up residence in a boarding house, under the name "Mr. Carpenter," where he befriends a widow (Patricia Neal) and her son (Billy Gray). "Mr. Carpenter" takes it upon himself to locate a renowned professor (Sam Jaffe) in an effort to bring the scientific community's greatest minds together to hear his message of world peace or face annihilation. Meanwhile, a city-wide search is organized by the police and military to find the spaceman, who has been immediately perceived as a threat. The late, great director Robert Wise took on the task of bringing this cinematic adaptation of the Harry Bates short story "Farewell to the Master" to the screen all those years ago. This is one of my all-time favorite sci-fi movies, though it does not appear on my list of top-10 sci-fi films; I have, however, given it an "honorary" place on my list, based solely on message and content alone. The acting is perfect from the cast, especially Michael Rennie, whose gentlemanly spaceman is one of the great characters in science fiction, and a great departure from other screen spacemen who were simply played for laughs. I have no doubts that this film would later serve as a key inspiration on filmmaker James Cameron's similar-themed anti-war sci-fi picture "The Abyss" (1989), which is also amongst one of my favorite sci-fi pictures of all time.This is a film for the ages and should be required viewing for all true fans of the science fiction genre.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Cold War Sci Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 1950s, science fiction writers rarely directly stuck their necks out to directly engage the dangerous ground of world politics. On the Beach, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and a few others, are exceptions, and the results, though decidedly situated in the intellectual climate of the growing ideological conflicts of post-nuclear capitalism and communism, bear timeless messages.Harry Bates' classic short story about earth's first contact with an advanced, interplanetary alliance is perhaps one of the most profound, unsettling and mature anti-war films ever made. Klaatu, the protagonist, is an ambassador sent to Earth to warn all of our planet's leaders that their actions will have dire consequences if they do not change their ways.The only aspects of life on earth that Klaatu (Michael Rennie) and his seemingly omnipotent robotic companion, Gort (Lock Martin), are not prepared for are our overwhelming capacity for self-delusion, bureaucracy and self-destructive behavior. Deciding that he must more fully comprehend earth culture, Klaatu decides to impersonate a human until he is able to contact people who maybe more receptive to his message than the military personnel and politicians he is first exposed to. He learns about jealousy, masculo-centrism and other sexual disorders by befriending a widow (Helen Benson, well played by Patricia Neal), but finds some hope in an astrophysicist almost certainly modeled after Richard P. Feynman (Professor Barnhardt - Sam Jaffe). But the question remains - what are Klaatu and Gort really up to and if their story is true, can they really save the earth from extraterrestial destruction or, perhaps, from itself? The Day the Earth Stood Still is perfectly cast - Rennie outdoes himself as Klaatu - his remarkable stature, build, and oddly subtle expressions greatly enhance the character. Neal, always good, makes Helen an entirely sympathetic character. And the supporting cast does yeoman's work as well.The film takes a theme which could have been overwhelmed by high-minded dialog, and distills it to its most profound and simplest elements through excellent Teo Tovar cinematography, editing, and screen adaptation (by Edmund North, who would later write Patton, and many lesser films). Fred Sersen's special effects are great - never hokey or overbearing. It is also one of the great Robert Wise's earliest major successes, and it is as much a tribute to his talent that this film remains a landmark in modern sci fi as it is a testament to the story's excellent ethical points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic sci-fi story tempered with a stilted (but still worthwhile) message of peace on Earth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL seems to be the quintessential example of early science fiction films imbued with thoughtful social and political commentary. It was written, shot, and exhibited during a time of extreme political tension: the beginning of the Cold War, when the second wave of anti-Communist paranoia was back in full swing. On the surface, this bit of history may seem irrelevant to the subject matter and the message of the film, but having an understanding of the state of the world at the time it was made will allow you to appreciate its content that much more.In THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, the people of Earth are alarmed when a flying saucer lands in Washington, D.C. As the otherworldly spacecraft descends onto the lawn of the Mall, the army and the police force have their weapons at ready. "Every eye, every weapon is trained on that ship," says a news anchor, seconds before the door to the ship slowly draws open and a benevolent life form named Klaatu emerges. Klaatu states his intentions of "peace and goodwill" and cautiously approaches the crowd, then produces an unknown object from his spacesuit. Without hesitation, one of the trigger-happy guardsmen fires. Klaatu, having committed no crime other than looking suspicious, then lay on the ground injured with hundreds of weapons still aimed at him, ready to be fired. This provocative image sets the tone for the rest of the movie.What I found most interesting about this film was that it focused more on the human populace's reactions to an alien's arrival on Earth, rather than on the arrival itself. There are a few exciting moments of special effects and out-of-this-world technology that we have all come to expect from science fiction movies, but a great deal of it concentrates on Klaatu's concealment of his identity as a "spaceman" as he interacts with a typical suburban family. From the conversations he has with these well-meaning but ignorant people, we are introduced to the hysterical and destructive nature of the American middle-class, and for all intents and purposes, the rest of the world. In one memorable scene, a discussion over dinner (with the disguised Klaatu present) reveals that some people, including one of the family members, are suggesting that the fugitive "spaceman" be destroyed because he is actually a Communist spy!As the story progresses, we learn of Klaatu's intentions for arriving on the planet Earth: to prevent our usage of newly acquired atomic weaponry from destroying neighboring, inhabited planets. After organizing a summit for "the world's greatest thinkers" (that is, high-level scientists from every field), Klaatu presents an interesting, albeit flawed, ultimatum: disarm your atomic weapons and live in peace, or else suffer complete annihilation. What had previously been a completely anti-violent movie was now tripping over its own logic. The good intentions of this "peaceful" race of "more advanced" life forms were now marred with a very primitive, humanlike flaw: the threat of violence to solve problems. Perhaps this was writer Edmund H. North's way of saying that violence, no matter how despicable, is also inevitable, perhaps even a necessary evil? Whatever the intent, I was fascinated (but quite honestly, disappointed) at Klaatu's conflicting messages about violence and destruction. However, even though these themes put a damper on what would have been the perfect anti-war story, it does force its viewers to think about humans' (and by extension, perhaps even aliens') predilection towards justifying violent behavior, and the backwards idea many of us have that by threatening violence, we will somehow prevent more violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to make 'Top Commenter' on this film. Still, I wanted to get my 2 cents-worth in anyway because it's one of my all-time favorite movies (aside from the original 1965 'Flight of the Phoenix' with Jimmy Stewart and Hardy Kruger). Even in my youth I suspected there was more within this 'TDTESS' SciFi projection than projected. In fact, now, after having viewed it in my adult life over a half-dozen times I'm convinced it's not a SciFi film at all. BUT, still a worthy and terrific commentary wrapped in SciFi cellophane. And, not only in the genre of our fears at the time, but one who's theme still niggles-at-the-back-of-our-primitive-minds. We 'fear' because it's in our genetic/protective nature to FEAR. We dismiss that 'first-call-chemical-reaction from brains/bodies when we 'learn' of that which initially scares us. That's what the film is all about. The modal of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL continually reminds us we need to keep an open mind/heart of all that troubles us regardless of the fight-or-flight syndrome: overcome 'initial fear' by using what we've 'learned' over the last 10,000 years of what we call 'civilization.' Greet a new-comer, find a heart. Can be summarily dismissed if not found living-up to our code.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect time capsule of post-WWII paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) stands as a monument to classic post WWII paranoia, with Red Scare Ruskies under every street lamp and hiding in every shadow. The movie reflects its 1951 roots in terms of approach: It starts slowly, naively, with typical twists and turns and a beautiful women nearby. Humans don't come off well in this movie for the most part...and they're by far the scariest characters. The ludicrous idea of the military pointing their guns at the spaceship... it's the same idiocy that had the FAA banning nail clippers right after 9/11. Back to the movie: It's like an extended big-budget Twilight Zone episode with all its moralisms intact. One should mention that terrific music provided by Bernard Herrmann (scary Sci-Fi music that sounds like its from outer space). One side comment. I was surprised at the lack of scientific knowledge employed in making this movie given what many astronomers knew at the time. Spaceships traveling at 4,000 MPH? That's way slow for an orbiting object. and the spaceship coming from 250 million miles away? That's way way too small a number...more like 250 trillion miles or perhaps light years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Piece of Cold War Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the 2008 remake: this classic piece of Cold War science fiction still has the power to disturb today. A cult film at the time of release (patrons were known to shout the famous line "Klaatu barada nikto!" at one another as a sign that they had seen it), it provides a chilling comment on the fraught political situation at that time, in which communism was perceived as a genuine threat to world peace. Robert Wise's tautly directed piece vividly captures the atmosphere of paranoia prevailing in the United States at that time, where governments and the media were always suspicious of people's motives and assumed that everyone not conforming to the prevailing ideology was automatically a communist. The power of the media is also stressed, with several scenes of broadcasters communicating half-truths and outright lies to groups of credulous viewers also/or listeners. It seems that they had the power to manipulate public opinion in precisely the way they wished. Michael Rennie cuts an imposing presence as Klaatu - even when faced with the entire might of the US Army, we know that he will emerge unscathed. The special effects are rudimentary by today's standards, but in thematic terms Gort - the robot - is there to show the importance of people looking after one another. If you hurt one person (Klaatu), then you have the robot to deal with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It didn't bring the sci-fi genre to a standstill, it finally gave it life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably considered one of the greatest classics in the science fiction genre (and therefore already marred by one lousy, needless remake), this movie was an early entry into the canon of Fifties' Sci-Fi flicks (the decade in which this genre finally came into its own, thanks to the contribution of numerous social factors, including the space race, the birth of the Atomic Age and the UFO craze), but remains one of the most wonderfully constructed and emotionally compelling examples of the bunch. It first and foremost serves as a warning against mass anxiety (e.g., the Red Scare), baseless fear of the unknown and prejudice against those that don't conform to the limited dominant social norms, but does so without ever getting overly preachy, despite its fair share of religious overtones, some subtle, others less so. A gripping narrative guides the modern viewer through this fabulous tale of Fifties' 'Zeitgeist' notions, delivered in the form of true spaceman suspense.When a flying saucer lands in the middle of Washington D.C., the population of Earth swiftly shudders to think of the ramifications. Is it foreboding an alien invasion? Does it carry unspeakable weapons to eradicate mankind? Is it a Russian ruse? It soon appears none of these, but simply a benign gesture of goodwill from the interstellar community, as heralded by the sole occupant of the spacecraft, an apparently humanoid figure named Klaatu (a formidable Michael Rennie). Despite his good intentions, he's accidentally gunned down and rushed to a hospital for both his recovery and medical study paired with the expected military scrutiny. Nevertheless, not before he shows a taste of the superhuman strength his technology has achieved, in the form of a hugely intimidating, unfathomable giant robot called Gort, who efficiently deals with the human weaponry and afterwards guards his vessel in his absence (and has death rays coming out of his eyes!), seemingly controlled by simple unintelligible words like 'Klaatu Barada Nikto'. Klaatu, soon fed up with the endless questioning, escapes his captors and soon settles quietly in a boarding house to explore the human society, its hopes and dreams, its fears and folly. Though he enjoys the company of a free-spirited woman and her son, he generally does not like what he finds, as us humans prove mischievous and suspicious, a danger to our own and possibly other worlds as well. The only voice of reason comes from the expansive and accepting mind of the scientific community, but will it be enough to allow mankind to exist further? Or does he need Gort to wreak havoc on this backward little planet driven by petty bickering? As he finds himself increasingly hunted by government agents, it seems only a demonstration of extraterrestrial power will suffice to get humanity in line. And thus he moves to the act of making the Earth stand still (just not as literally as many people would have it from the title), a show of force that will cost him everything.The Day the Earth Stood Still tells the classic tale of the outsider looking in on ourselves, to investigate the human condition (if there ever was a time to do so, it was the Fifties!). Thanks to his charming British gentleman persona, Rennie proves the perfect choice for portraying the sympathetic alien being who feels both joyful surprise and disgust at the hands of human behavior. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Klaatu wants to believe in the good nature of mankind, as he is ultimately willing to make that greatest of sacrifices to both protect it and remind it there are greater powers than its own out there, thus completing the connotations to the typical Christ figure this movie is laced with, without ever going so far as to alienate spectators beholden to other religious beliefs (or none at all). Rennie is joined by a solid supporting cast to play off against, including Patricia Neal as a caring and understanding young woman who accepts, and even embraces, the unknown for the wonders it brings, as well as Sam Jaffe as the old scientist who shows humanity's capacity to listen to reason instead of only responding to fear and terror. Excellent writing and performances are joined by a fantastic score (courtesy of the legendary Bernard Herrmann) and wonderful production design that nowadays could only be described as thoroughly retro to the ears and eyes of the contemporary viewer, thanks to this movie's own part in setting the trend of sleek flying saucers and shiny robots, accompanied by the spooky, otherworldly humming of theremins, for decades to come. Some question marks can be placed around Klaatu's own government, an interplanetary community guarded by powerful robots like Gort as its inexorable law enforcers, not motivated by personal gain or spoiled by the flaws of emotion. It's ironic that The Day the Earth Stood Still provides this notion as a possible answer to all our problems, while many Sci-Fi classics to follow ? the likes of Colossus: The Forbin Project and I, Robot ? instead warned us against the cold, relentless rule by technology, in favor of letting our emotions guide us for the greater good. Apparently in this dark decade, every method of dissuading mankind to have at itself with atomic bombs was worth exploring.The Day the Earth Stood Still still stands strong as one of the finest science fiction films of all time, and inspired many directors to follow to craft equally thoughtful and engaged movies in the same genre. Not to mention many a nerd in naming a blog after the film's ingenious title. 'Klaatu Barada Nikto', the exact meaning of the phrase ever a mystery, naturally became a popular mantra among Sci-Fi aficionados.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sci-fi Epics Of The 50's Begin... Magically.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being the first, and cited as one of the best movies to come out of the 1950's science-fiction boom. "The Day The Earth Stood Still" is a very entertaining classic, that carries a clear anti-war message without being forced or too outlandish (Considering it's a movie about an alien descending to earth).Sadly, a younger generation of people will now dismiss this movie for its effects and the 2008 remake. But in a sense, effects is not what this movie has ever been about, and it's carried along with such a charm I don't know how it has managed to age this well. The acting is wonderful with Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal doing there part very well, and to say "GORT" the robot was believable would be pretty far-fetched. However it is a very interesting plot device, and even though it is rarely seen throughout the picture it is more than enough to be seen as a Sci-Fi icon.Aside from the last 15 minutes where the conclusion felt pretty rushed (But nevertheless entertaining), this film is wonderful. Personally ignoring the whole Jesus Christ analogy, the message can still be used for todays standards. A remake never really needed to exist, and personally this film demands a re-release because as time goes on the message seems to become much more relevant.Final Verdict : A timeless classic every Sci-Fi fan should see. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The father of all Sci-fi films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still is arguably one of the most interesting and enjoyable Sci-fi films out there even 60 years after it's release. The originality, the basic and direct plot added to very good FX and tricks made this film one of the best in the story of the genre.I'm not denying that it don't has any flaws. In fact, if wasn't for it's peculiar flaws, it wouldn't be the same film at all. It would lose even his charm, i must say. Although, i'm inclined to say that these 'flaws' were caused most probably due to a certain ingenuity of the writer than because of a deliberated lazy script. The screenwriter founds trouble mainly in depicting the federal police in a convincing way. I mean, only two guards keeping a object with immeasurable importance as an alien spaceship? That's crazy.And don't start thinking that just because this film is from 1951 that it is a cheap film, due to the obviously limitations of the time. Of course, it has limitations, but actually, the film uses it at his own favor. Just look at, for example, how the black-and-white factor in the film does a make-up in the special effects of the film. In fact, the black and white choice was very smart.Highly recommended. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Wise directed this landmark science fiction film that stars Michael Rennie as Klaatu, an alien ambassador who arrives in Washington in a spaceship to warn the world powers that their aggressive and warlike culture will no longer be tolerated in future, since the developing of atomic energy has made the universe aware of them. In order to better understand humans, he goes undercover in the city, where he befriends a woman and her son(played by Patricia Neal &amp; Billy Gray) though her suitor(played by Hugh Marlowe) is suspicious. Klaatu wants to meets a noted scientist(played by Sam Jaffe) in order to better explain the situation, but the authorities intervene, forcing Gort the Robot(played by towering actor Lock Martin) into action. Many iconic images, fine F/X, and memorable score distinguish this film, with an interesting message, though the civilization Klaatu represents is only sketchily portrayed, and viewer may wonder how righteous they truly are, or if there could indeed be a sinister ulterior motive?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Klaatu barada nikto!" When it comes to the Sci-Fi sub-genre of "Alien Visitation" flicks, I honestly don't think that they get much more intelligent and thought-provoking as this sparkling gem from 1951.If there are other such "Alien Visitation" flicks out there that do promote this satisfying level of genuine intelligence in their stories, then I would sure like to hear about them. (Please feel free to message me with their titles) Impressively directed by Robert Wise, The Day The Earth Stood Still (TDTESS) actually did manage to deliver quite a seamless and evocative blend of the ordinary melded very nicely with the fantastic.This is the sort of motion picture that really gives the viewer the pleasant opportunity of actually getting to know (and, maybe, even like) its characters.Even the 10 year-old kid, Bobby Benson, was a likable sort. And, believe me, I usually loathe kids in movies. They almost never fail to be totally irksome and nothing but spoiled, little, snot-nosed brats.Yet, here in TDTESS, the young Billy Gray's portrayal of Bobby was very much like a literal breath of fresh air. This youthful, wide-eyed actor really seemed to understand his character and make him interesting.Anyways - Traveling at warp-speed (that's 4000 mph.) and taking a 5-month, 250 million mile journey to get here, TDTESS's story has Klaatu, the very distinguished and cool-headed alien, arriving in Washington, DC in order to deliver his dire, top-priority message to all of us naughty-naughty Earthlings.After being observed for many years by other outer-planetary civilizations, it has been determined that (through the discovery of atomic power) we Earthlings, with our unbridled destructiveness, have become a very-very serious threat to the overall peace and security of the other planets which exist in this endlessly vast universe.Klaatu must now address all nations of the Earth and somehow convince one and all to cease with these violent ways, or else face some mighty devastating consequences.You can bet that if Klaatu's firm words of warning can't induce us Earthlings to reconsider our ways, then, believe me, Gort, the all-powerful robot, definitely has his own special brand of persuasion that doesn't take "No" for an answer.Trust me - In spite of its flaws, TDTESS is, without question, a classic Sci-Fi/Thriller that's really worth its weight in gold.And "Klaatu barada nikto!" to you, too! P.S. - This film's 2008 remake was an absolutely despicable desecration of the highest order.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a science fiction lover, I forced myself to see this movie. Fact remains that in our time, such movie can not carry our imagination away anymore... but it's interesting to think that in those years (1950's) it probably did! When seeing it now, I get bored and often thought "clichee", but the reason for that is that this was probably a trend setting movie for many SF stories later on. Also, I was wondering the link between how "the world/society/politics" would act in the real world vs in the movie; and how that has changed over time. IN the movie I often got irritated by thinking "damn, how stupid can they (the world) be to act in such foolish way (shooting an a friendly and innocent alien), it seems so logic that that is not the right thing to do now, but back then... it was maybe different (that's just one example). Anyway. I gave it a 7. It's always hard to judge an old movie. If today was 1955, then I would maybe have given it a 10?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Small Glimpse of Sci-Fi Potential That Future Generations Would Build On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science Fiction explores endless possibilities, in particular the future and advancement of mankind. During the 50s however, the genre was not given the credit it deserves. Works of cinematic science fiction lumped into the B-movie class and no one ever expected much of them. Back then, people had yet to realize the genre's full potential, which would later become evident in Star Trek and Star Wars. It wasn't until Robert Wise, indisputably one of films most accomplished directors made The Day the Earth Stood Still and delivered an approach like no other in science fiction that the genre achieved a whole new level of appreciation. As an avid fan of science fiction, I have been familiar with this movie for a long time, but I never understood just how impactful and revolutionary it was until now. In the movie, humanity was at the dawn of a new age. With the discovery of nuclear power, it was thought that mankind would soon be ready to explore the depths of outer space and discover that we are not alone in the universe. But the human race, given its fallible and conflicting nature, was not yet ready to take the next step without risking the annihilation of the human race. It falls to the humanoid extra-terrestrial being Klaatu (Michael Rennie) to warn the leaders of the planet Earth of the dangerous path they were on. Realizing that the leaders are unwilling to cooperate, Klaatu is forced to go into hiding. He takes refuge in a boarding house under the alias "Mr. Carpenter" and lives among a family that personifies the goodness of human nature. He realizes that someday soon, humans may be ready for the great beyond.Some of the effects, although crude by today's standards, are very appealing, but Robert Wise's film is not about how spectacular special effects can be, nor does it adhere to the conventional formula of human heroes triumphing over villainous aliens. The brilliance is in the many themes that Wise develops in a world at a time of warfare and fear. One of my favorite moments involves Klaatu and the young Bobby (Billy Gray) as Klaatu and the rest of the viewers are given a glimpse of 50s lifestyle. Klaatu perfectly captures the essence of being a stranger in a strange land as alien to the human world as humans are to his own. Klaatu sees the world through the perspective of Bobby. Looking through the eyes of an innocent child is often the best way to view life. Backed up by a strong script and adrenaline pumping tension, the theme of human goodness and the need to emphasize the better side of human nature is expressed beautifully with Robert Wise's unique blend of irresistible charm and drama features. Robert Wise boldly went where no filmmaker had gone before with The Day the Earth Stood Still, giving us a science fiction movie that made people question the nature of mankind and the direction we are heading. In the post war/cold war era, a time of desperation and terror, Wise ushered a ray of hope and delivered a small glimpse of Sci-fi potential that future generations would build on. People would never look at the genre the same way again and for that Mr. Wise has my everlasting gratitude.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a spaceship lands in Washington DC it is surrounded by an army fearing it may be dangerous. After a couple of hours it opens and a man in a strange space suit emerges; as he approaches the soldiers with his hand outstretched a solder thinks he is preparing to fire a weapon so shoots him. After this a giant robot comes out and fires a beam that destroys the weapons aimed at it. The man, named Klaatu, is taken to hospital and after he is treated he says he must talk to all world leaders to deliver a message; the problem is the world it too divided for leaders to agree to such a demand. Klaatu is told he must stay in the hospital but he escapes creating a panic as everybody wonders where the dangerous spaceman has gone? he has taken up residence with a local family where he rents a room under the name of Carpenter. He makes friends with the young boy of the family and from him learns the identity of the leading scientist so pays him a visit. He agrees to arrange a meeting of world scientists but by now people are starting to get suspicious of him and, as he warns, if he dies the robot could destroy everything on Earth.This film is rightfully considered a classic; many things we see here would be repeated in films for decades to come? what alien invasion film these days doesn't feature reaction shots from people around the world? It makes a refreshing change that the 'invader' is not really part of an invasion force; he is just there to warn the world that more powerful planets see Earth's development of rockets and nuclear weapons as a threat that will be eliminated if necessary. The film nicely captures the paranoia of the cold war as almost everybody fears Klaatu. Klaatu himself provides the voice of reason as he tries to persuade people of the importance of his message; some people listen of course but not those that matter and his demonstration of power just makes the authorities more determined to kill him.If you are a fan of science fiction this is a must see; obviously some aspects are slightly dated but it is far less dated than one might expect from as sixty year old black and white film; I'm sure that sixty years from now people will be watching this not the recent remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science Fiction with a Moral Centre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise's Day the Earth Stood Still remains a landmark of science fiction cinema. Standing out from the countless B-grade pulp science fiction films produced in the United States throughout the 1950s, its beautiful, subversive message remains as pertinent as ever.A stunning critique of the military and imperialism, it subverts the threat of the alien outsider, making him the truly benevolent one, whilst the earthlings are the dangerous threat, seeking to hunt him down and only too eager to preserve their power through the use of guns.The film truly conforms to theorist Darko Suvin's notion of science fiction being about cognitive estrangement: the audience looks at their own humanity through the eyes of Klaatu, the alien outsider, and sees all that is wrong as he sees it. We condemn ourselves.The opening scene establishes this theme by depicting a military base. The first humans to track Klaatu's spaceship are, by their nature, murderous aggressors.Next, in one of the film's most famous scenes, when he lands and emerges, his attempt to offer a gift is met with more brutal violence at the hands of a soldier who guns him down.At the hospital, he sees the futility of trying to deal with a world of political opponents whose rivalry is such that they cannot even agree on a meeting place. As a visitor who has traveled across space to this tiny planet, he sees the futility of their squabbling as do we through his eyes.His escape leads to his chance encounter with a child and it is here, through the innocent eyes of the youth, along with the eccentric, misunderstood scientist, that the only real hope for humanity is found.Besides being an outsider, there are clear Christ parallels in the figure of Klaatu. He adopts the pseudonym "Mr Carpenter" and is murdered by the military authority only to be resurrected at the film's end before ascending to the heavens. He offers a compassion world-view, far larger than that the earthlings can grasp yet he also sits in judgment of the world and its empires.Ultimately, it is a pessimistic film. Klaatu feels humanity cannot become pacifist of its own accord and thus leaves behind the robot policeman Gort as a threat over the heads of men as a way to force peace and as an indictment of humanity's total depravity.Wise's direction is stunning throughout. The black and white cinematography is excellent. One memorable scene is that of Klaatu/Carpenter's first appearance at the boarding house, shrouded in ominous shadows, only for his absolute normality and compassion face to emerge as he steps forward into the light. This thereby develops the notion that the outsider should not be instinctively feared.Though the cast is small, Wise conveys the global impact of Klaatu's landing, the feud between politicians and the impact of the power cuts.In one of the few cases of electronic music being used effectively, the film's score remains a classic and evokes a mysterious atmosphere.Michael Rennie is perfectly cast as the compassionate outsider/Christ figure who is far more humane than the humans he meets.Ultimately, this remains one of the great pacifist films of all time and one of the few great science fiction films to emerge from Hollywood. It is a wonderful, albeit pessimistic tale that condemns the militarisation of the globe and all forms of state-sanctioned violence. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic sci-fi with a bold anti-war message which works both as polemic and entertainment. It starts off as a conventional "it came from outer space" adventure and while there is excitement in the narrative, there's equal interest in the human (or should that be alien?) drama as well as the pacifist viewpoint which picks up force as the film progresses. Michael Rennie is very good as the phlegmatic outsider from beyond the stars, looking remarkably human for all that, Patricia Neal is likewise impressive as the single parent whose young son befriends the alien and who herself is charged by Rennie's Klaatu with averting disaster if he should be killed while I've always liked Sam Jaffe in supporting roles and he doesn't let me down this time either as a sympathetic scientist specially sought out by Klatu. As everyone, right down to the child actor playing Neal's son, appears to be aware, the way to sell such an out of this world story is to play it dead straight. The special effects are very good for the times, particularly the interior and exterior of the spaceship as well as Gort the robot's death ray. In fact the only let down on this score is Gort him/it-self, looking more like the Michelin Man than a would-be destroyer of worlds. The story moves along convincingly and naturally, with some interesting twists along the way. I liked the way too that location photography was integrated into the plot, with frequent insertions of national monuments, most of them of course potent anti-war symbols, like Arlington Cemetery, the Capitol Building and Lincoln Memorial. The actual moment "the earth stood still" is effectively conveyed, director Wise and his crew no doubt getting up very early to catch the city before the traffic rush got under way. And one last word in praise of Bernard Herrman's spacy/scary soundtrack, which only added to the atmosphere. In summary, an intelligently written, directed and acted science fiction story with an ever-topical message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi landmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When The Day the Earth Stood Still was released back in 1951 it was a landmark in sci-fi. Not only did it tell a new and interesting science fiction story, it was an incredibly culturally and politically relevant film that had a clear and important message to the world. The film is about the alien Klaatu and his giant robot, Gort. They arrive on Earth in Washington DC with peaceful intentions, but Klaatu is immediately fired upon and he is rushed to a hospital. His message to Earth is a sinister, yet important one. He wants them to know that if the human race continues on like it currently is, his planet will have no choice but to destroy them. This message couldn't be any more relevant than in the political atmosphere of the 1950's when threat of nuclear annihilation hung over the heads of all mankind. Science was being used for evil and the developments of nuclear bombs threatened the entire human race. In the movie it is Klaatu's job to stop this. The movie isn't subtle about its message at all. It is blatant and sincere, sending a sure fire message to the world that they had to stop before it was too late.This is just one of those really smart sci-fi films. It doesn't blow things out of proportion and it keeps itself at bay to convey clearly its message. The script is really smart, was well as the pacing. There isn't a wasted line in this film and it seems that every bit of dialouge bears some sort of importance. It can be as blatant as Klaatu's final monolouge to the human race, or as subtle and brief as Klaatu's mentioning that atomic power can be used for things like ship fuel, rather than bombs. The film flows really well and keeps at a consistent level of intelligence as well as urgency. Robert Wise employs the use of these slow montages that are really neat. There will be a series of shots from various locations around the world that show different nations reactions to the events occurring in Washington DC. It all plays very well into the title of the of the film, which is The Day the EARTH Stood Still.In spite of everything we can't forget that this film was made back when science fiction in film was a very small idea, and thus the budgets for these kinds of films weren't as gracious as they are today. Because of this there is a little bit of cheese when it comes to the alien design. And yet at the same time there is consistency. Everything has a very simplistic design to it. The exterior of the spaceship has almost no detail to it. The interior is pretty much the same except for some funny looking lights and consoles. Gort the robot is a very simple robot without anything incredible or flashy about him. This isn't really a problem though, because it allows more attention to be drawn to the films message than the sci-fi design. In a way the visual simplicity of this film adds an extra layer of intrigue to it as a whole.The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of the most politically and socially relevant sci-fi films of its day, and even modern day when the threat of annihilation still looms over mankind's head. It isn't as threatening as it was back in the cold war era, but it is still there and it still impacts the relationships of this world today. This film is a landmark in sci-fi and while it may not be the most incredible or most gripping science fiction film in my eyes, there is zero denying its importance and relevance.</fullReview>

The exposition of the idea was conveyed with disarming subtlety. A visitor from Outer Space comes out of the sky inviting us to be part of a larger community who study and reason about Life on Other Planets. Klaatu comes in peace, but the Armed Forces sequestered in our nation's capital aren't having any of that. There is nothing like the scene of our Space Voyager sitting up in a hospital bed after his initial encounter with the denizens of Earth. A Washington diplomat comes to visit Klaatu to find out more about his mission and to gently and sympathetically explain to him the facts of life on the planet. When the diplomat is leaving we see Klaatu turning his profile towards the camera in a three-quarter silhouette and realize as he does that monitoring the radio broadcasts of Earth have not prepared him to understand the true nature of Earthlings.That is when our wounded hero decides to improvise and reconnoiter in the field to gather whatever data he may need to successfully cobble together and deliver his message to the peoples of Earth. He silently escapes from the hospital and wanders the streets of D.C. anonymously in the borrowed suit of a Major Carpenter. You can do what you want with the name Carpenter, but I am sure you will not stray far from an obvious conclusion. Looking for temporary lodging, he happens upon a family that has rooms for rent. This chance encounter gives him an opportunity to study humans at arms length when they have no guns in their hands and, as he later finds out, within a family context.The desire to study further in order to achieve a fuller understanding of the beings he is dealing with is a trait that stands out with Klaatu. He strikes up a friendship with the son of a single mother in the house, Bobby Benson, played by Billy Gray, who becomes his informal tour guide around Washington D.C. Helen Benson, played by Patricia Neal, looks like one of those beautiful heroines drawn by Jack Kirby for Marvel Comics. Michael Rennie, whom we find playing the lead character of Klaatu, manages in scenes at the Lincoln Memorial, Arlington Cemetery, and particularly at the office of a leading scientist,(Professor Barnhardt as sagely played by Sam Jaffee), to convey in his demeanor and behavior the qualities of Abraham Lincoln, Sherlock Holmes and Jesus Christ. This is all suggested with a subtlety that isn't immediately apparent. It is a masterly example of iconic manipulation that makes Klaatu in my mind the number one Science Fiction hero in film of all time. I believe it is Rennie's physical resemblance to all three of these heroes of World History as represented in photographs, paintings and drawings that makes him perfect for this role. Similar to the way that Charleton Heston's resemblance to Michelangleo's Moses made DeMille tap him for that part. I have read that Claude Rains and Spencer Tracy were also considered for the role of Klaatu, but I think the above statement explains why I feel neither one of them would have had the mythic impact of Rennie.During one point in the film, Bobby takes Klaatu to Arlington Cemetery where his father, who died in World War II, is interred as one of the fallen from the Battle of Anzio. The resulting exchange in the cemetery will lead you straight to Ghandi-KLAATU: Did all these people die in wars?BOBBY: (Somewhat surprised) Sure. Didn't you ever hear of ArlingtonCemetery?KLAATU: No-- I'm afraid not.BOOBY: (Very serious) Mr. Carpenter, you don't seem to know about anything.KLAATU: (Amused) I'll tell you, Bobby-- I've been away for a longtime. Very far away.BOBBY: Is it different where you've been? Don't they have places like this?KLAATU: (Slowly) They have cemeteries. But not like this one... Yousee, they don't have any wars.BOBBY: (Puzzled and flashing a startled grin) Gee-- that's a good idea!This is the core of the movie on the dawn of the Cold War. How to convince a seemingly warlike species that their violence has escalated to the point where they pose a real menace to even the rest of Cosmos. The supporting characters are all first-rate, this includes Hugh Marlowe as the suitor to Bobby's mother and Frances Bavier as the lovable aunt, among others.Patricia Neal, as Bobby's mother, gets to deliver one of the great all time lines in Sci-Fi films, and in the process proves she has The Right Stuff.Because Robert Wise chose to direct the film in black and white, many of the shots of people in the crowd scenes look like photographs out of LIFE magazine. Even the extras seems like fully rounded people of dignity and character filled with gravitas. There is also a wholesome sense of Family and Community that cannot be duplicated or would simply be fodder for parody in today's fast-paced World of the Internet.Judged by today's standards of state-of-the-art technology, one can list the inaccuracies and logical inconsistencies involving Space Travel, the Robot GORT, the manhunt for Klaatu, but as a morality tale set in Sci-Fi demonstrating the triumph of human values over a technology of destruction it has no peers.Warmest Regards,Eligah Boykin Jr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold War sci-fi nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not all aliens from outer space are bug-eyed monsters bent on global destruction; who's to say our first close encounter wouldn't be with a cultured, urbane gentleman on an errand of mercy? Unfortunately for Klaatu (Michael Rennie), his reception on Earth is pretty much the same: mass hysteria, suspicion, and a warm welcome from the military. Showing more perspective than was fashionable in 1951, this sci-fi classic suggested that peace among the nations of Earth is essential to our continuing evolution as a species. After 50 years the message is more worthwhile than ever, not just for its ever timely warning against nuclear aggression, but also because of a certain nostalgic yearning for those halcyon days when spacemen and their robot deputies flew exclusively by flying saucer, accompanied by the electronic music of the spheres, provided here by Bernard Herman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine sci-fi film-don't bother with the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of years ago they remade The Day The Earth Stood Still with Keanu Reeves in the role of Klaatu. It was panned by critics, so I've never bothered with it. I have fond memories of seeing this when I was young and so instead of watching a bad remake I decided to revisit the original.The film wastes no time in bringing the alien visitor to Earth. Special effects back in the 50's weren't great and the scenes of the craft landing are pretty dire when you compare it to today's effects, but it adds to the film's magic. Klaatu's attempts at getting his message out there are thwarted and he places himself among the residents of Washington D.C. where his human appearance helps matters no end. Events move quickly and Klaatu shows Earth exactly what he's capable of, causing fear throughout the population. Eventually rescued by his trusty robot Gort and with help of some humans he is able to tell Earth the problem it faces, before he zooms back into space.The film hasn't aged that well, but the message that humanity needs to stop risking it's future is still relevant today. There are many aspects that frustrated me; that Klaatu looks human is never explained, or the bending of Gort's joints, despite his alleged solid build or the lack of security that surrounds the spacecraft are all examples. But despite this the film delivers, that it was made in a pre internet era makes the event more exciting and fascinating with the fear and interest of the public and the public's opinion being broadcast via radio. I have fond memories of being amazed by Klaatu bringing the world to a standstill and this time round it still works brilliantly and there are some great shots of world cities at a complete stop.It is one the finest sci-fi films made in that era and despite it's flaws it still has the ability to play out well even in our CGI 3-D saturated world we now live in.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best science fiction movie of all times, and in my list one of the top three sci-fi movie of the '50s. Other two being the Forbidden Planet, and War of the Worlds.The invasion that came from space in this movie is benevolent. Klaatu is actually testing the sanity of man kind. There aren't as many wild action in this movie as you see in more recent sci-fi, and there're very little violence in the entire story. In the end, humanity didn't pass the test with flying colors and begs the question what people back in Klaatu's world have thought about the reports he made when he got back.The story is actually very well constructed and the alien Klaatu is portrayed in an intelligent way. He is civilized, kind, and friendly in a non-condescending way which makes this movie one of the best sci-fi movie ever made.Michael Lenny was perfect as the visitor from outer space. He really carried the story, and made this a great movie. I'm glad that the original choice for his role Claude Ranes couldn't make it due to prior engagement with a theater play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Sci-fi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has but one clear message to the viewers, war is destroying the whole world which is so true and we need to stop it instantly, we need world peace. As we watch we could visualize how Klaatu's planet differs from Earth. And we could see how stupid people are on Earth, sorry to mention that but right from the start of the film the people were so paranoid about this new thing, even though Klaatu stated that he meant no harm, we were still so suspicious. We don't listen, instead we act without thinking, that's why war is created. This message was shown to us not realistic enough but it was more understandable in science-fiction, I could not imagine any better explanation than this. This film works in every aspects of humanity. The effects were limited back then so in 2008 the remake was born, there were so many changes in the new film and it didn't work as the original did. Keanu Reeves could not replace Michael Rennie's calm but perfect performance as Klaatu. And to top it all, Bernard Herrmann's out of the world haunting score match the theme of the film. We don't need stunningly beautiful visuals to spread this kind of message. The simpler one would suffice. Simply classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Stick Diplomacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic science fiction flick in which aliens come to earth with a message for humanity: stop all violence and cease using atomic weapons!"The Day The Earth Stood Still" was made after the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan (and at the start of the Cold War) and so reflected the anxieties of a global populace who lived in the fear of Soviet and American missiles blazing across the skies. Interestingly, the film was well received in Europe but was initially ignored in the United States, possibly because US citizens were secure in the knowledge that their nukes trumped everyone else's. Hard to be anxious when you're the cause of anxieties.Nevertheless, the film encourages the disarmament of atomic weapons and portrays a race of advanced aliens who "live in harmony" within a chain of "united planets". The implication here is that Earth's post war countries should band together in the formation of the United Nations (founded 5 years before the film was released).The film was re-made in 2008, this time with all the Cold War themes being replaced with ecological ones. IE- the planet is now threatened by human pollution, rather than nuclear missiles and Soviet Russia. In other words "EVERYONE" and "NO ONE" are simultaneously our enemies, a totalitarian viewpoint which the system secretly desires.These eco themes were present in a slew of films (WALL-E, The Day The Earth Stood Still, Avatar, Into The Wild, The Happening, An Inconvenient Truth, Grizzly Man, Happy Feet, 2012, Dreamland, The Day After Tomorrow etc) between 2006 and 2010 and is likely to represent a major shift in how we view villains. The enemy is no longer an Other. We are he and he is always right.Ironically, in both versions of "The Day The Earth Stood Still", the supposedly "peace loving aliens" threaten to destroy our planet if we don't heed their warnings. Big stick diplomacy - negotiating peace whilst simultaneously threatening violence - seems to exist on other planets as well. But isn't this always the case with superpowers? 8/10 - Everyman director Robert Wise made a better science fiction film with "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", but this film is perhaps more influential. It's a heavy handed film, but it's artfully done and has a worthwhile moral message. James Cameron would rip it off for the conclusion of "The Abyss".Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first science-fiction film with a very clear message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not unfair initially to dismiss "The Day the Earth Stood Still" as sci-fi pulp from an era full of it, but the film's anti-war message given the Cold War context it was released in makes it nothing short of a classic. Its commercial exterior featuring posters with Gort the space robot pales in comparison to the social/diplomatic values it preaches at its core. Sure, it's not all that suspenseful or riveting for science-fiction, but it represents one of the first pop culture films to reflect important moral values.Borrowing from the lucrative UFO alien movies before it, TDTESS begins with a flying saucer landing in the Washington mall and producing an alien with a human appearance named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) and his robot protector Gort, a goofy-looking man in a shiny suit with the ability to disintegrate anything with a beam from his eye. For starters, Klaatu is greeted by military bullets that destroy a gift he intended for the president that would give us the ability to study life on other planets. That's the example of the strict satirical tone taken by writer Edmund H. North (based on the short story by Harry Bates).Despite humorous special effects and the cheesy running and screaming you see in pulp alien invasion movies, TDTESS manages to expose many of our flaws including our fear of the unknown and our propensity to resort to violence. It warns of the dangers of nuclear energy and outwardly scorns war. In the beginning years of the Cold War, such a message getting out to the public is an accomplishment that must be lauded.TDTESS isn't only good for its messages, though it certainly is what makes the film stand out. Rennie is a terrific Klaatu. He's intriguing, friendly but also very frank, winning our sympathies but still convincing us of his other-worldly nature. The relationship he develops with the young Bobby Benson (Billy Gray) is the film's most interesting subplot next to Klaatu helping a scientist out with an equation that will lead to interplanetary travel.Rarely does a film become a classic solely because of its message, but TDTESS certainly does. It's so frank, but speaks such an undeniable truth that in the form of cheaply made science- fiction, resonates in a way that straighter films can't. That's the beauty of the genre and why TDTESS is its first classic. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day My Heart Stood Still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)Robert Wise directed The Day the Earth Stood Still a decade before his legendary West Side Story and yet he was already a seasoned director here. And it shows. Yes, things play out a little simply, and the effects are dated. The clichés are in place, and the theme itself is well worn by our standards.But it still works! A few terrific threads keep it together. First, I think, is that moment when everything stops. It's chilling even now (made me freeze in fear when I saw it decades ago). Second, though you might not realize it right away, is the score, by the brilliant Bernard Hermann. And third, the acting, as strained as it might seem at times, is mostly right on. It fits into a sweet, innocent, very American believability that we all either recognize or at least wish for. And the most compelling of these is the spaceman, with his "New England" accent, along with Patricia Neal's key role as an open minded, reasonable woman who of course saves the day.This is all possible thanks to Wise, a smart director often saddled with limitations (like budget) and making the most of them. The limited effects might in fact have made the movie better, because he was forced to rely on basics like the people and how they interact. Compare this to the new version? Hardly fair, but go ahead. It might reveal more about what the viewer likes in movies (sensation, polish, speed, anyone?) than what really works in one or the other.On a serious side, this is not so much a terrific early sci-fi film, but a smart and dramatic anti-nuke film. It comes in the wake of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and with a handful of other post-war, more ponderous movies like Cloak and Dagger (1946), it makes its case alongside a growing public sentiment against nuclear holocaust. If only we could say "klaatu barada nikto" and make things happen, like the end of violence everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although rather na?ve today, it is hands-down the best sci-fi drama of the 1950s...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Robert Wise takes a clichéd thematic approach to this science-fiction drama about an outer space visitor who escapes military confines and goes to live amongst regular American citizens, to hopefully find out why we're so cynical a race and eventually spread his message of peace. This is the type of '50s non-rabble rouser which doesn't want to get too many noses out of joint (there's a dig at the Democrats, which is very funny even today). Wise begins the picture with shots of different newscasters from around the globe reporting the U.F.O. sighting in their native languages, all of them speaking into the same bulky microphone; this is followed by reams of newspaper print going through the press machines, and, inevitably, the melodramatic headlines. Such hoary clichés were commonly used by directors of this era as visual shorthand, yet the simplistic exposition can be overlooked in the wake of the compelling story, which is well-written and satisfying (if, finally, a bit soft). Michael Rennie is amazingly sensitive as the alien who insinuates himself in a Washington, D.C. boarding house, befriending single mom Patricia Neal and son Billy Gray (both terrific). I almost hated to see the mechanisms of the plot take over, which meant less of the human interaction, but Wise guides the picture through to a well-rounded climax. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci Fi comments theologically.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day The Earth Stood Still is a film that utilises science fiction as a method of conveying a theologically driven message. This is overt in the references to the character Klaatu, (Michael Rennie) the alien who takes on the Earth name Carpenter in reference to Christ. Klaatu's Crucifixion is in the form of a bullet which through a thoughtless knee-jerk-reactionary shooting kills him. Subsequently he is resurrected from the dead to convey his theological message before ascending to space (heavan).The theological message is in the vein of Victorian patronage. It illustrates the way the western world has been taught to accept the idea of 'truth' as fact from that of a higher authorities such as The Church or scientists, and thereby undermining the democracy of individual thought and opinions.Truth as in the authority of the alien Klaatu is the force that brings harmony and peace. In other words consensus must be forced on humans by appealing to their fear and ignorance of the unknown consequences. A lack of consensus leads to intransigence, which itself culminates in a conflict of ideals. Therefore a consensus must be reached by way of bureaucracy, here represented by the robot Gort.Scienctist Professor Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe) is patronised and undermined by Klaatu when he simplistically resolves the mathematical problem the former has been endeavouring to resolve for weeks. This is an ironic reference to Einstein, who was purportedly labelled as slow at school.Overall the film is a great masterpiece in terms of using science fiction to convey the idealistic message. But what it gives is the all too easy, singular resolution to human differences. These differences may cause disharmony, but they illustrate that we are individuals which is the essence of human nature. Consensus is the Utopian ideal, which if reached needs negotiation and arbitration, not threats of obliteration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enlightening, compelling film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic black and white sci-fi drama, starring Michael Rennie as an alien ambassador who lands in America to deliver an omnious warning to humanity.I thought there were truths in his message to mankind, and the acting, especially from Rennie as Klaatu was excellent. He, to me was totally convincing as an alien who wants to learn about our world and well as help us to ensure it's future survival.The score was particularly good, adding to that atmosphere of fear of the unknown. While the effects might be dated, his speech to the world's leaders is still relevant today, in my opinion.I didn't find it overlong and had me glued to the screen all the way through. I was frozen in shock during a memorable scene, that affects everywhere across the world with my mouth hanging open. The fact that in this, it took a being from another planet to tell the world to change was quite moving to me, and somewhat sad.Overall, it was brilliant, and a film with a difference - an alien invasion of sorts, that doesn't just concern the US but the whole world and it's future. This has stood the test of time and really had me entertained as well as being thought-provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking realistic account of what we might do...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 1/26/2008 - 9 out of 10(Dir-Robert Wise): Thought-provoking realistic account of what we might do if encountered with a being from another world who expects peace to be the norm. Michael Rennie is wonderful as Klaako, the being from another planet, who lands on earth with his policeman robot to warn the world about what they're doing. What they are doing, according to the alien, was putting the rest of the universe at risk by experimenting with using atomic power in spaceships. The alien's only purpose for being there was to protect the universe from his robot policeman reacting if aggression was done in their world. Of course, the humans were totally un-trusting and expected the worst from his influence. In the meantime, Klaako, escapes from the prison they put him in(a hospital) and takes residence with a local family, learning from the child and befriending him. The mother eventually becomes aware of who he is and his friendly intentions and becomes his partner. Of course, most do not trust him and seek out to kill him before he kills us. This movie is an engaging and thought-provoking journey into who we are and what maybe we should be as people compared to what we currently are. Despite it being made in 1951, it is very relevant in today's world and I personally wish all leaders of all countries would watch this movie and learn from it as far as how the other world handles themselves. Amazingly deep despite the time it was made and it's inability to have spectacular special effects. This movie is definitely less sci-fi and more social in nature than it appears on the surface.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply a sci-fi classic. Sure, it's quite dated. Sure, the special effects are pretty terrible. Sure, the kid has got to be the most annoying character in the history of film. But it's so incredibly influential that any fan of sci-fi must appreciate this film. One of the first alien 'invasion' films, it's not really about an invasion at all; unlike other alien flicks of the '50s, the extra-terrestrial is benign and unworthy of the typical antagonistic human response it generates. The anti-atomic message is a bit heavy-handed, but perfectly placed in history, and the political layers are obvious but still effective. The story it's based on, "Farewell to the Master", is better, if only because of the great twist ending that the filmmakers cowardly left out of the film; also, the rather silly acknowledgment of 'the almighty spirit' is so hopelessly conservative in a rather liberal film that it really sticks out. Still, it's a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timely, frightening and awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superior sci-fi thriller with awesome special effects abetted by a tinglingly atmospheric music score by Bernard Herrmann. Classy black-and-white photography by Leo Tover also makes a major contribution, as does Wise's skillful direction. Even more importantly, the movie has obviously been produced on a top budget.In addition to its monstrous robot and breathtaking space ship special effects, the film also boasts a screenplay that is sufficiently intriguing on its own account to sustain an all-absorbing level of tension and suspense. Believable characters find themselves enmeshed in a plot that takes some surprising twists before leading into a riveting climax.The players tend to be both outclassed and over-awed by their surroundings, though all, particularly Rennie, Neal and Marlowe, acquit themselves nobly. And Billy Gray makes a likable lad whose place in the story is, for once, both natural and unobtrusive.All the movie's publicity and advertising art prominently features Gort. Audiences were not disappointed. He is a genuinely frightening, terrifying figure, yet (like all the best of the monsters) highly sympathetic.Oddly, despite the movie's 2007 popularity and cult reputation, it was not all that highly successful on first release. It did make a small profit, but nothing to get excited about, and the critics were hardly over-enthusiastic. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times even penned a negative review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History repeats itself. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scenes from "The Day the Earth Stood Still" were filmed on location at Washington, DC. Watching the film at an outdoor screening on the National Mall facing not but about two blocks from the Capitol building, this is a film of ironies. Juxtasposed were not only filmed images of the Capitol building and other famous sites around Washington, DC with the actual buildings standing in the background of the screening, but it is a juxtaposition of "official" philosophies, public mood, and international events. The film, those both naive and idealistic in its message, is just as relevant today, even if the film itself appears so dated and, given some of the dialog, at times--fairly cheesy.Aired following another fairly simple story of domination and destruction: a Duck Dodgers cartoon, this story begins with aliens landing their aircraft on the National Mall. Immediately panicked, of course, they are met aggressively by their American bystanders. Klaatu (Michael Renier), the human-like spokesman for the aliens, comes with a warning for the people of Earth and, when hospitalized for the attack, requests that the Secretary to the President bring the world leaders together to simultaneously hear the message he has for them. Of course, in traveling millions of miles to Earth, the aliens seem either incapable or unwilling to devise some sort of system for either simultaneously broadcast of the message (through various methods) or multiple delivery of a fairly simple warning: that while humans may continue to be destructive among themselves, their development of nuclear power poses a threat to other planets and for that, they face destruction by those other planets who have made their own pacts of interplanetary peace for some reason, no one bothered to clue the people of Earth in on. As Klaatu explains: "I came here to give you these facts. It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet. But if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder." The straightforward Klaatu escapes from the hospital and hides among the humans who seek to find him, posing as a border named Mr. Carpenter. While there, he tries to find a renowned scientist as the academic leaders may be more willing to unite to receive Klaatu's warnings (although, the scientist rightly assures him that they have less credence than political leaders) and, inadvertently, he employs the help of one of the residents, a young woman who may be the only person willing to trust Klaatu (eventually) and the importance of his mission. Even with willing subordinates, the alien is rebuffed by the aggression and fears of the humans as well as one's eye for the promise of fame.It is, at its simplest, a portrait of the flaws of human nature and this self-destruction is pointed out in numerous references, including the then-relevant Cold War. But is a condition that the writers naively attempt to resolve with the idea that those who might preempt violence against others will be destroyed himself by a race of robots who police them. "There must be security for all, or no one is secure. This does not mean giving up any freedom, except the freedom to act irresponsibly." This is, of course, a ridiculous solution, as well-intentioned as it may be. (Robocop illustrates the problems of Man's flirtation with technology and in particular, the human development of the robots who may police them). And, more than fifty years later, in the face of seemingly increasing global conflict, the film's message is ever more relevant, but its proposed solution even more laughable.As I watched this, I wonder whether anyone could hear the amplified sound of the movie from the grounds of the Capitol. Of Klaatu's fear of fear being substituted for reason, of the stupidity of global aggression, and of the desire for world domination, and of global ignorance, something which the United States is not alone guilty of (this was the week of the bombing crisis in Israel and Lebanon, among other countries of the Middle East). For those so clouded by it, the film offers a sobering moment of self-awareness and also, a sad realization of how little we have been permitted (as a nation, anyway) to evolve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The origin of intelligent Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The early-fifties saw a huge amount of "flying saucer" pictures storming the US box office, most of which were hastily-made and primarily existed with the humble intention of providing an hour-and-half of cheap fun for film-goers. In 1951, director Robert Wise (best-known for directing 1961's WEST SIDE STORY and 1965's THE SOUND OF MUSIC) and screenwriter Edmund H. North (of 1934's ALL THE KING'S HORSES) created this fantastic film that follows many guidelines of the sub-genre, but digs much deeper than the average "alien invasion" film. The film is not only significantly more advanced in the film-making prowess than similar films from this era, but also in philosophy and social commentary. This film was nominally about an human-like alien and a giant robot, but, in a latent sense, it was about the then-current condition of the human race.Working from author Harry Bates' clever short story, Wise and North have created an imaginative parable on the dehumanizing Red Scare of the late-forties/early-fifties that is neither heavy handed, nor too abstract. I seriously doubt that the commentary on McCarthism will be lost on anyone who views this movie within the proper context, however, the views of the film-makers fortunately refrain from pounding the metaphor into our head (I think nearly everyone can agree McCarthism was unconstitutional, we don't need a movie to convince us of this). Wise and North simply use alien invader Carpenter as a mirror to reflect the hysterical actions of the majority of the public, with as little judgment as possible. The subtle approach not only makes the impact of the film's message even more effective, but it also keeps the picture from dating when viewed outside of it's original context.Further assets include the impressively high production values, which includes a convincing-looking spacecraft, and the imposing robot Gort (played by the very tall Lock Martin). Wise also draws out believable performances from the entire cast, especially handsome Michael Rennie, who tackles his then-unconventional role with intelligence and just the right touch of whimsy. The film also benefits immensely from downplaying the various supernatural occurrences; Wise basically films the picture as a straight drama for the most part, which lends an immeasurable aura of credibility to the fantastical proceedings. Over 55 years later, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL remains a benchmark in the science fiction film-making, and it served as crucial launching pad for many of the intelligent genre films that would follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A futuristic film in which Michael Rennie stars as Klaatu come to Earth to warn humans against taking nuclear weapons beyond their own planet. Gort is the robot. There is poignancy in watching a World War II army oppose advanced technology. The cast is chosen to give a sense of normal, hometown America. Billy Gray from television's Father Knows Best is the kid who befriends Klaatu. Patricia Neal is his mother. Frances Bavier, Aunt Bea from The Andy Griffith Show, adds to the general Mayberry atmosphere. On the other hand, there is Sam Jaffe as an Einstein-like scientist. The film's title derives from Klaatu's demonstration of his power by shutting down the planet's electricity. I recently toured Arlington Cemetery with my son. We see how relevant this anti-war piece remains. I wondered what turned Gort on. It is "Klaatu barada nikto."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aggression can never be used to fight peace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A world without war? It's as unconceivable now as it was then, but thinking about it, it sure would be swell. I'd say this movie is a classic if ever anyone asked me. A classic science fiction film with just the bare minimum of sci-fi elements that focuses more on human stories. Not just by making the space man a lot like us, but with a story about a man from space with a message for this world, who needs to understand the Earth's people and their actions before he can know how to best reach them. Would it be patriotic for us to say we love our planet? We know from living here that too many nations can't live without war, how could a foreigner, from another planet as well, appreciate this fact? Maybe there are things this movie doesn't show us or try to tell us about if this were to realistically happen. But it sure is able to cook up an interesting story to go with an ambitious idea.And right there you understand what the sci-fi genre is, a genre where the conflict inherent in making one is how does being human fit into a story about aliens? So if the alien is more like us, we're more likely to pay attention and buy into it. Science fiction, I'll admit, is not one of my favorite genres. It's nature is generally so advanced that it requires viewers to be on another wavelength to want to be taken to other worlds. But films like this really help us to see the benefits and virtues of this genre, to give a new sense to the quality of dramatization, and give us something completely unknown to try and relate to. Infiltrating our society draws out questions of character and makes us apply human characteristics to something that isn't human, not like we as humans are. And this creates the possibility for a greater understanding of things unknown.The greatest conflict in this story comes from, if this is a film where the main character wants to save Earth by giving us information, if the least we can't do is treat him with respect and trust him just a little, do we feel we deserve to be saved? If you take him at the actions he demonstrates, there's no reason not to trust him. But in this film, characters let hysteria and confusion get the better of them. Which is a very realistic and unfortunate way of portraying it. Though it shows you more of the strengths of the sci-fi genre, in a classic film such as this, you don't find the same sentiment as with war dramas or westerns that have the very same amount of humanity. Well, maybe it has the same idea at heart but the storytelling is focused on technical credibility, that it teaches viewers to be less wrapped up in emotionalism, which gets too sappy at times.So I really like the potential science fiction has to tell a different kind of story. But more often you see that what the genre is mostly comprised of are second-rate stories that are completely preoccupied with the fantasy of foreign things where you have to look for the qualities you have in common. You'll find sometimes these other programs beat you over the head with their message and leave nothing familiar to hold onto. This film tells it's story in a wonderful way that leaves for a lot of meaningful thought afterward. In the end, it all comes down to the question of war - is it necessary. We know why we use war to protect ourselves, but that doesn't mean we should ignore the idea that some societies can live without war and trust peace. That the idea of peace is never suppression of our instinct to protect ourselves. And that we can do just as much good by thinking than by showing aggression. We are humans after all, not animals.As for film quality, this is a movie that I'd like to walk around in. Washington D.C. seems like it used to be a wonderful place of culture and heritage, where you could walk around at night and really see something non-threatening. But then, wasn't all America like that at one point? The film's music score is very simple, and mostly understated, until several key moments where I recognize how many films were influenced by this film just in the music department. I viewed this movie for the first time only recently and this isn't the typical 'something strange is about us' score cues, but instead they suggest something very sinister is underneath the image of a spaceship and an indestructible robot. I guess there's something sinister about everything if you think about it, but I think the film must have consciously had this intention in mind to keep us guessing. For it's time, this film is revolutionary and one of a kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best 1950s Sci-Fi films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The are some movies that use special effects to carry a film. There are those that enhance a movie. There is another group that doesn't use many at all. "The Day The Earth Stood Still" falls into the latter category. It has an intelligent plot and outstanding acting(especially Michael Rennie, Patricia O'Neal, Hugh Marlowe and Billy Gray). The action is minimal but there are enough thrills and tight pacing to keep you interested. The flying saucer and robot are pretty realistic. This movie can also be viewed as a case of cold war paranoia that was prevalent during the 1950s. This belongs in any Sci-Fi fan's collection. Not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still is a sci-fi classic and still holds up today, more than 50 years after it was made in 1951.The Thing, The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Them and The Day the Earth Stood Still are the 1950's movies all fans of sci-fi should see.An alien lands his flying saucer in Washington DC and tells the people of the Earth they must learn to live peacefully. The alien Klaatu/Carpenter is played by Michael Rennie. He brings along a friend, the giant robot Gort. Klaatu befriends a young boy and his mother (Patricia Neal) and contacts Dr. Barnhardt, a world famous scientist (Sam Jaffe) to help him get his message to the leaders of earth.Robert Wise's (Star Trek) direction is solid, the black and white cinematography is spectacular, the interior of the space ship is interesting, and then there's Gort the robot, one of film's most enduring symbols. I've seen every sci-fi/monster film ever made, and this movie many times, but something about Gort's appearances and Bernard Herrman's music that accompanies him always gives me the major creeps.Klaatu Barada Nikto.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has anyone noticed the similarity between Klaatu and Mr. Spock? I would suggest that Spock is a direct descendant of Klaatu. A lot of people from outer space, (in the movies, I mean), attempt this all knowing, wry, being from another planet routine, and very few can pull it off. As an actor and director, I can assure you that in this instance, less is more. Notice how Klaatu watches the interaction of the humans at the breakfast table or while they are playing cards. Watch Klaatu's face when they are visiting Bobby's father's grave at Arlington Cemetery, and it begins to dawn on him that this is cemetery for people who have died in wars. Of course, Klaatu had a mission, and Mr Spock had his own problems, but the sheer directness of their ability to get to the root of Earth people's problem's is what makes us love them. They so easily point out logically what we are afraid to admit emotionally.</fullReview>

He moves into a boarding house and is befriended by Patricia Neal and her young son. Rennie learns about the people of Earth and the complexities of modern society and politics. This is a fine sci-fi film with an outstanding story, great acting, and an almost complete absence of fancy special effects.Rennie's mission is to warn the people of Earth against the extending of man's wars to outer space. Naturally, politics get in the way, and Rennie visits scientist Sam Jaffe (who gives a great performance) as a last resort. Tragedy and triumph then follow, shown in a number of memorable scenes.Incisive script was way ahead of its time, Wise's direction is masterful, and the robot Gort (played by Lock Martin) was very well done. My vote for the best 1950s sci-fi film, with the three alien words that will stick in your mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we go with such a classic movie. One of those whose stills are well recognized for the most of the population of this planet. Now that Spielberg is gonna blow out the box-offices all around the world with his own vision of "The War Of Worlds" is a good thing to watch one of the pioneers of the "sci-fi" genre.Early 50's, right in the middle of the Cold War between USA and URSS. A flying saucer arrives to Washington with a human look-a-like alien and his mighty robot Gort (capable of disintegrate anyone). They have come to bring us a clear message: stop messing' around with those nuclear weapons or the Earth will be destroyed. A nice pacifist manifesto dressed up as a science fiction tale well narrated by Robert Wise ("West Side Story", "Star Trek"), with such a firm pulse, with a touch of innocence (that's increased as the years have passed by), and with some hand-made special effects that may look a little funny but are not that bad. This is not a Z-series movie such as Ed Wood's. They didn't have a huge budget , but they did a so decent work. Now, let me warn you about one thing: you have to face this movie without the XXI skepticism inside of us all, you have to return to your childhood and let the movie amaze you (no matter if the unbreakable of Gort looks like foam rubber). Otherwise you better go and watch a Vin Diesel film.There are not real stars in the cast of "The day The Earth...", and I think it was a good choice to get Michael Reinne (the actor who plays Klaau, the alien) for the movie, just because that character it wouldn't have worked if performed by a superstar.That's all. Enjoy it! *My rate: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dat the Earth Stood Still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: Robert Wise, Script: Edmund H. North, Story, Harry Bates, Cast: Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe This is another standout film from the golden age of sci-fi from the period between 1950 and 1962. Much of post war 1950's sci-fi involved a certain paranoia that Americans were facing at the time. We had a fear of being taking over by communists and of a nuclear holocaust. This movie is one of the first alien visitor movies. This came out just after "The Thing From Another World.' In "The Thing," the alien is depicted as a monster,while in The Day the Earth Stood Still he came to earth in our likenessThe alien visitor arrives at Washington, D.C. because he wants to meet with all the world leaders to warn us against using nuclear arms. He comes in peace and offers a gift to the president but a soldier shoots him in fear. In response to this, Gort, Klaatu's robot, melts down all the tanks and weapons. Klaatu, the alien, is hospitalized but recovers in a short time, escapes and eventually finds a boarding house where he meets a widow and her son.The acting and direction in this film are both good. It has its share of suspense and drama. Klaatu befriends the young boy and through the boy, the mother(played by Patricia Neal) discovers that he is the alien visitor and not just a guest. She learns that he is here to deliver a message of peace and is not a threat. Klaatu meets up with a scientist from the Smithsonian because he is someone whose intellectual capacity is closest to his. He tells the scientist of his plan to stop all activity for a half hour to show prof of his power. His robot, Gort, has the ability to destroy the earth if the world leaders do not agree to meet. Klaatu is often compared to Jesus Christ as a messenger of peace.Most Sci-fi films deal with people from earth visiting other worlds but occasionally we get visited by other beings. One example is The Thing From Another World and another good example is Invasion of the Body Snatchers(One of the best sci-fi thrillers ever). This film is entertaining but it also but has a message to tell. This message is more true today than ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-Fi With a Real Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day The Earth Stood Still continues to rank as one of the most popular sci-fi "cult" films more than 50 years after its release, and with good reason: it reduces an important, timeless message for humanity to its essence.This film calls for much suspension of disbelief. For example, only two youthful, incompetent soldiers guard a giant UFO parked in Washington DC. The special effects aren't bad, but at times rank only slightly above the special effects that made Ed Wood infamous. However, it is easy to overlook the "cheese" in this film, thanks to a strong story and fine acting.This film is definitely worth watching because of Michael Rennie's magnificent portrayal of an alien (Klatu) trying to understand human behavior. Almost the entire story is told by Klatu's reactions to what he sees and hears. Only one speech, at the very end, articulates the film's message in words, and this is probably a good thing, lest even this valid message begin to sound like preaching.The music score, featuring one of the earliest uses of the spooky-sounding Theremin (made famous by the Star Trek theme), adds an essential character to the film. Without that music, the film's pacing would have been too slow. Combined with the music, however, the pacing is almost perfect.The special edition DVD is rather sparse on features, but they are some of the finest features I've seen on DVD. The 70-minute documentary and audio commentary with the original filmmakers actually focuses on how the film was made, rather than telling what a great guy the assistant grip was. Anyone interested in how films are actually made will thoroughly enjoy these special features, and learn a lot about film-making.Watching the film again in 2005, I'm made conscious of the fact that our political (and business) leaders still haven't gotten the message, while almost every other segment of society has evolved beyond medieval notions that violence is the answer to every problem. If Klatu landed in Washington DC today, I suspect a high-ranking member of our current government would shoot him first and probably never ask questions.And that is precisely why The Day The Earth Stood Still's message is still important today.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The underlying plot of this movie is about an alien who comes to earth because of the aggressive and ridiculous behavior that human beings are displaying. As I watched the film, I realized that it was not going to be your average sci-fi alien invasion film. It made perfect sense, which is kind of scary. Even though this movie was made in the 50's and the effects are out of date, it really didn't matter. The music and the black and white screen helped make the mood of a sci-fi thriller. This movie made you think that humans are really naive.On of the scariest things about this movie was that it could still apply today. One of the most important scenes in the movie, where Klaatu gives his final speech, says it all. In the moving speech, he talked about how humans are threatening the whole universe by carelessness. Klaatu presents the idea of joining the rest of the universe and be policed by robots. The robots would act at any form of violence. That means the world would have total peace, which in today's world is totally unimaginable. He gives of the option of joining them or to be eliminated. This is very scary because we are just as careless in today's world as we were in the 50's.One of the minor things that were very enjoyable to watch in the film was the creative ideas placed throughout the movie. One of the main ones was the technological improvements on the alien's home planet. Its made earth look like they used pre-historic equipment. From the medical improvements to the different types of metal, it was fun to watch. Also, another creative idea was to put in the idea that kids are really the only sensible people. They don't like violence and they are innocent. Klaatu really connects with Bobby because he was like Klaatu in a way.Overall, I believe this film is a must see film for everyone. It really opens up your eyes to some of the dumb things we do here. It also is fun to see humans as the bottom of the technological and medical race. Klaatu's people have much more than we do. Lastly, it is a must see film because it is important to watch things that makes you realize that we don't own the universe. I'm not saying there is anything out there somewhere, but if there is they got to be getting pretty angry about our attitudes here on earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Humanities teacher had our class watch 'The Day the Earth Stood Still.' At first, I wasn't sure if I would like it, because I wouldn't normally be interested in watching a movie with a title like that. Surprise, surprise; I loved it. I think it's a very good movie, and now it's officially one of my favorites. The special effects were very good for the 1950s, and did not look half bad at all, compared to the special effects of our time. (For once, I see a movie involving aliens that doesn't rely heavily on special effects.) Seeing things in black and white usually annoys me a lot, but I felt that the black and white made watching this movie so much better. I also enjoyed the score. I found it haunting, suspenseful, and well-composed. The message behind the film was also one that could apply, even to our own time. It's a movie that opposes war and violence greatly. Ultimately, violence will be our downfall (whether by aliens who are angry that we're so violent, or we'll be the cause of it). It's a movie that makes you think about all the bad things happening in the world, and it made me contemplate things I could do to change them. Even though there are aliens and robots in the movie, it's still very political.The characters were all very interesting, believable, and made a major contribution to the film. Klaatu was very well portrayed. Michael Rennie was probably the best person for the job. He was excellent. I was impressed with Billy Gray; for a young boy in that kind of film he performed very well. And, of course, the movie would not have been complete without Tom (played by Hugh Marlowe), the jealous boyfriend. He's one of those characters you just want to smack, because it's his fault that everything almost comes apart. Patricia Neal did wonderfully as well; Helen was a very core character in the film. Without her, Klaatu would have never been able to warn Earth of the imminent danger coming our way. All of the acting in this film was very well done and deserves a definite two thumbs up.In general, I found this film to be quite enjoyable. It was extremely suspenseful; it kept me wondering what would happen next, and there was never a dull moment. Whenever I can, I'm going to go buy this movie and watch it as often as I can. I'm surprised that I like it as much as I do. I think it's a film everyone should watch, if not because it's a really good movie, then at least for the anti-violence theme. I can't think of a reason why anyone wouldn't like this movie; it has just about everything, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just an overview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Day the Earth Stood Still' is a science-fiction movie made in the 1950's. The main characters include Klaatu and Ms. Benson. Mrs. Benson's fiancé, Tom, plays an active role in the plot to capture Klaatu. Klaatu is a being from outer space whose reason for visiting Earth is to warn the Earthlings that if they continue being a threat to the universe and themselves that they will be destroyed.In some respects, the character Klaatu can and may be referred to as being based on Jesus Christ. They have similarities which include a warning whose outcome is based on the choice of the people, and a 'boss' that has absolute power over him. Another specific similarity includes how some people were blinded by their prejudices, pre-beliefs, and misconceptions. As a result of this, some refused to hear the word of Jesus just like they refused to hear the word of Klaatu. For an old movie it had fair special effects, and for a movie of it's time it must have been one of the very best. Some scenes were a bit far-fetched, such as when the spaceship landed right in the middle of the baseball field. The fact that it was in black and white, however, added a sense of 'eerie-ness' back into the film. I think if it was in color, it wouldn't have been in the least bit scary. When the music came in sort of out-of-the-blue, it also added to the effect.In conclusion, I think that with the special effects and plot were very well presented and allowed for emotion and theme to play into the film. By doing this they made the film enjoyable 40 years later to a different generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Gort, you see. He's big, he's menacing. "There's no limit to what he could do; he could destroy the Earth," says Klaatu. Gort's a huge metal robot, made of some metal unknown to mankind and impenetrable. When he melts down tanks and howitzers, you know this is one guy you shouldn't mess with!Unfortunately, though, 1950's mores being what they were, it just wasn't going to be acceptable to show Gort's crotch. I suppose they thought, if the legs just came together with nothing there, it might imply a femininity that didn't go with "his" behavior. And, if masculinity was to be implied, you would need a pair of metal... but, no, that wouldn't do, either. Solution: put a big metal diaper on him. You have to wonder, what is that metal diaper hiding? And -- ooohh! -- that thing's gotta chafe something fierce.I love this movie, but I can't help laughing every time I see Gort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tremendous thought provoking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fortunately, I read that Imdb rated this as one of the greatest films of all time. I asked my Tivo to grab it for me a few weeks back and watched it last night. This is a very good film, that is tremendously thought-provoking which could have been even better.The opening scenes of the film - which set the premise (theme) of the story are poorly done - regardless of whether it was filmed in 1951 or 2001. While I do not want to get bogged down in a discussion of these scenes - I believe that they prevent the film from getting a higher rating that it has already received. Specifically I am referring to (for example) a scene where the spacecraft has landed and the American military surrounds the craft with a large group of civilians standing ten feet behind. Ridiculous!!Then, be patient as the film unwinds. You will find NOT a Science Fiction film, but a film that uses "science fiction" in a modest way to set the premise for a much deeper message. You will find a film that fundamentally is very well made in terms of its lighting, cinematography and acting.This film was made a scant six years after Hiroshima and is now and will be relevant for the remainder of our lifetimes and beyond, because of the issues of nuclear war and weapons of mass destruction.Truly moving films provoke tremendous thought, debate and discussion in their viewers. If you will take the time to read some of the Imdb Discussion Threads relating to this film, you will find that this movie has moved so very many of its viewers to bare their hearts and souls on the subject of violence and mass destruction.I know of few films as effective that evoke as much emotion or discussion as The Day the Earth Stood Still.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When less was so much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Limited resources force ingenuity from the creative artist often resulting in fine work. In the fifties, Robert Wise's work promised great things. His lean, sharp, economic style was used to great effect particularly in the superb "The Set-Up" and the now classic "Day The Earth Stood Still".By the mid sixties Hollywood lavished huge budgets on him which resulted in flabby, overblown bores such as "Sand Pebbles", "Star" and the saccharine drenched "Sound of Music". It's hard to believe that the same man was behind all these projects."The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a lesson in film making in all its aspects. The special effects often laughable in fifties sci-fi movies are simple yet startlingly credible. Scenes are shot with obvious care to camera angle and are enhanced by the just slightly menacing Bernard Herrmann score.The actors are well cast all turning in fine performances. There is a touch of the alien in Michael Rennie's bony, statuesque physique making him just right as Klaatu. Patricia Neal exudes both beauty and intelligence and thankfully child actor Billy Gray avoids the pitfalls that others of his ilk are so often prone to, with a refreshing naturalness in his acting.While the message tends to be labored, its as timely as it was in the early fifties. Not surprisingly this one made in IMDb's top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien ship lands on the mall in Washington. The spokes-alien escapes from military hospital and mingles with ordinary folk to get a sense of what mankind is really like. He seeks to deliver an important message to all the nations of the earth. Get it together quickly, resolve your differences, or be destroyed.This is a wonderful film, and a standout among similar works mainly because of the brand name personnel associated with it across the board. The message is profound and I thought of The Twilight Zone and how often Rod Serling uses the basic premise of this film in so many of his fine stories. If you're like me you avoid these campy 50s atomic scare movies like the plague, but take my advice and see this one. It is superior to all of them, and probably the only one they should have bothered releasing in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just think...filmed in BLACK AND WHITE, no special effects (so to speak), no violence, no pulsating score that blasts the soundtrack, with shades of film noir, this is indeed a chilling film. It takes a very simple premise (an alien tries to warn the world about impending doom) and there is enough suspense to keep the viewer involved and give him something to think about The film is just as relevant today as it was in 1951. The casting is excellent...Michael Rennie is suave, Patricia Neal vulnerable and Sam Jaffe is great as the scientist. They don't make movies like this anymore. Robert Wise did an excellent job as the director. I could watch this movie again and again and still be mesmerized by its message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a tremendous and well done science fiction film. This film still has an effect on viewers more than fifty years after its initial release. When a spaceship lands on earth for the first time, the earth's citizens are terrified. The 'alien' who has come to earth has a an important message for the leaders of the earth. This is relatively well paced and interesting to watch. "The Day the Earth Stood Still is bolstered by great performances from Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal and even Billy Gray. This movie also has an obvious message about the dangers of atomic weapons and the future of our planet. I give it 90/100 points. Don't miss it if you are a science fiction fan.

When he sees that he cannot get attention of the whole world, he decides to perform his skills and neutralizes all electricity all over the planet.The movie is perfectly scripted, steady-paced and has very good production values.

The cast includes a great performance from Michael Rennie as Klaatu and Patricia Neal is the main female lead in this. The music score is excellent and very haunting, thanks to the great Bernard Hermann, who went on to do several Ray Harryhausen movies.This is 1950's sci-fi at its very best and they certainly don't make 'em like this anymore.

		<shortDescription>Timeless Scifi Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nostalgia of days past when television was in its monochromatic infancy that I recollect my very first experience of this movie and the shroud of fear that reigned on me thereafter. Such is the innocence of childhood that my parents made me promise I never watched such movies until the right coming of age.Watching it for the second time years later it left an impression like no other such that today I own it on Blu-ray, forming part of a small collection of timeless classics of which I never tire. The Day the Earth Stood Still epitomises the true genre of science fiction where benign extraterrestrial intelligence as the centre point supplants the then notion of alien life forms with hostile intent.This film thrives on an excellent script brought to life through contrived direction and carefully chosen cast. There is little censure impinging upon it other than certain limitations on the special effects, but even so moments like the landing of the alien craft truly elevates it beyond latter efforts in other productions. Although in essence the story unfolds with the arrival of an emissary travelling the endless boundaries of the universe and landing in Washington to warn the leaders of all nations of impending doom should their warring differences threaten intergalactic peace and security, the focal point of the movie remains the bond that develops between Klatu and Bobby, whose innocence is never defaced by the erudite answers given him by the enigmatic stranger to questions posed.The climax finally adds to the paranoia of humanity upon request of proof born of scientific curiosity when the electricity throughout the planet is neutralised, enough to raise panic but benign not to cause major ruin. It is the simplicity with which this movie delivers a clear message that no remake is deserving of higher praise.This film is manifold boundless in every aspect and will never be matched through any contemporary standard. It is a masterpiece in its own right and place in time, and a revisit of the kind can only transcend through retrospection.Scott Derrickson and David Scarpa would have managed a worthy reproduction had they had the vision of Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If ever we needed Klaatu, its now in 2001!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strange film to have attained such classic status, one that grows with each passing decade. It is in the sum of its parts that it delivers such power, rather than any one contributing factor. Consider if you will: There is virtually no action throughout its 92 minute runtime, What fx there ARE, would hardly stir one to marvel at their awesome reality! It is so very dated in terms of visuals and characters. The script though literate, does not move one automatically to magnanimous praise. With the exception of Michael Rennie, himself barely "A" list at the time, there is no reason to watch the film for its star-power....so what IS it about it this movie that has drawn about it such hushed legend?The answer probably lies in the statement 'different things for different people' but THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL absolutely COMMANDS respect and the intimate attention of anyone who ever thought "What is happening to humanity?...Where Are WE GOING?..or more importantly.."Can we get back?""I see several aspects to this most thought-provoking screen gem that I at least, believe are part of the weave. Michael Rennie as Klaatu put forward such earnest compassion and dignity in the role of an extra-terrestrial, yet global saviour (who came to warn, not to judge), the Christ allegory was obvious from the outset. Jesus promised he would return - he made no mention of checking back into his stable in Bethlehem. He came the FIRST time with a request to follow his lead or else to expect judgment from a higher source. He provided miracles that others might witness...Klaatu shuts down the world's power. As before, there were those who listened and those who would condemn. Christ was crucified for his efforts - Klaatu, shot. If EITHER return this century what difference would it likely make? We have learned NOTHING!The other superlative role in this film is that played by veteran Sam Jaffe. As Professor Barnhardt leading US scientist (THE NASA head of his day) he comes to realise the truth of Klaatu's origins. He may be likened to Lucius, the doubting Centurian. His performance is at once touching and respectful.The giant robot Gort whose unimaginable power is always felt but not gratuitously displayed, is a key part also of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. As menacing and impenetrable a figure as anything ever put on screen, Gort represents the ultimate peacekeeper...the umpire you REALLY wouldn't want to mess with! It must also be remembered that the film was directed by Robert Wise who himself had dignity and vision. The director's influence is clearly a large part of the finished product and with this, Wise has carved for himself, a niche of immortality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>reading these viewer comments took me back to the 50's when we would look forward to seeing movies like TDTEST at our local theater. My brother had a friend down the street whose parents would go downtown and see these movies when they first came out, thus Ron would be in a position to preview them for us. Ron could really hype a movie! That thermine music convinced all of us, that the existence of higher intellengencies on far off planets, was a certainty. Other great things I liked about TDTEST.......the middle aged man running through traffic shouting: "the've landed, they,ve landed...on the mallaunt Bea at the breakfast table "shut that off, I,m trying to concentrate"...also referring cryptically to the Russians. actor Billy Gray's charming an slightly exaggerated performancethe inside of the spaceship.....John C. Keltonbeorne...Drew Pearson etc.Patricia Neal's using a coffee cup to accent her cheekbones {at the breakfast table}.by the way, if you're a real TDTEST fan, you might like to read what Betty White {of Golden Girls fame} has to say about her run-in with Michael Rennie, subsequent to her mentioning the movie, and his good looks, on the old Al Jarvis TV show, here in L.A. She writes about it in her autobiography. I can't remember the title.Fun to look back on those happy days!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Klaatu Barada Nikto</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the sci-fi classics of all time. The story revolves around the landing of a spacecraft and the emegence from it of Klaatu, played brilliantly by Michael Rennie. His mission is to keep the Earthlings from spreading their violence and war beyond the limits of our planet. It seems that we have been observed for a long time. As long as our war was confined to Earth, the aliens didn't care if we killed ourselves off. But now man is moving into outer space (this was filmed in the early 50's) and threatens to spread his wars to space as well. The aliens cannot allow that to happen. So Klaatu is accompanied by Gort, a robot that will destroy Earth's war-making machinery or the Earth itself if we continue. This was a very forward-thinking concept in 1951 and should still be thought-provoking today. Although most folks today would think it dated, it is highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film that Set the Pace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still was the film which galvanized me and determined that Sci-Fi would be my main focus for entertainment and for the testing of hypotheses. Our best and final warnings come from our artists and it's our artists who put what has been said by the prophets and philosophers into a format which we can use to think with. Klatuu spoke to us all and I listened spellbound.This film showed what can be done with a motion picture to the good of the human race. I pity those who look down on and nullify science fiction because they simply can't follow a premise through to its end. To speak bluntly, like Klatuu did at the end, those guys just can't think. Their tickers don't work.Science Fiction, such as the two "Days"-"Stood Still &amp; Independence Day", are wonderful entertainment, but more than that they exceed, perhaps, even the expectations of the artists who made them. Films like these help our species with our mental hardware. As a species we're outward bound and only the guys who can think are going that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get beyond the technology, and this film still works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have several younger friends, who...unfortunately...can't get beyond their heritage. THEIR heritage is Star Wars. If it doesn't have that "Star Wars" look, they just don't get it. Well, if you're like that, this film is going to be tremendously disappointing. The Day the Earth Stood Still is THE cautionary tale of those of us who grew up under fear of the Atomic Bomb (that's right, the baby-boomers). It only has a nodding acquaintance to Science Fiction, and only about ten minutes of actual special effects footage, mostly at the beginning and the end. Yet that ten minutes or so, is used to GREAT effect. When Gort comes alive, the hairs on the back of my neck STILL stand up; the inside shot of the spaceship is truely "otherwordly". And Michael Rennie absolutely OWNS his character. I simply can't imagine anyone else playing Klaatu. And all of it in "glorious black and white."!!! Sandwish between the two Sci-Fi slices, is the meat of the story. It doesn't picture we humans of the 1950's in quite the same light as "Happy Days," does it? We are seen as fearful, grasping and amazingly lacking in character. Only one woman and one boy stand out...and neither of them are perfect, either. Why does Klaatu even bother to TRY to save us? I think that this is the reason virtually everyone I know either loves or hates this film. It forces us to face some of the worst of our own nature, and it does it with a rough hand on the shoulder. It doesn't pussyfoot around when it says, "shape up or be destroyed." If you want to see a classic "Morality Play" put against a Sci Fi background, with great leading roles...then take in this movie. But if you can't take it with the spirit of those scary times, you simply won't get it! The 50's was like no other era in recent American History. If you don't understand that context, most of the ground-breaking movies of that era, won't make sense to you. But if you come to grips with the paranoia and commercialism of the times, then it'll start to all fit. A classic!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was made in 1951, starred Michael Rennie as a visitor to Earth from another galaxy and Patricia Neal as a resident of the house where he takes shelter until he's able to explain his reason in coming to Earth.It is a classic of the genre known as sci-fi, and presents this planet as being ready to cause its own destruction from outside sources, or being able to prevent its destruction if willing to work together, and all races being willing to generate a spirit of cooperation and peace.The lead performers play off each other quite well, with Neal finally accepting Rennie's out-of-space presence, and being willing to help him in his mission to bring the planet to the awareness of danger, or betterment. Sam Jaffe gives a pointed performance as the leading scientist who understands the seriousness of Klaatu's mission.Great musical score that adds an eerie presence and being photographed in B/W only adds to the sense of mystery and foreboding.

		<shortDescription>Good Aliens For a Change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps one of the best science fiction films to emerge out of the 50's, The Day the Earth Stood Still is a fine motion picture on so many different levels. It is a wonderful story of an alien that comes to our planet with Earth's interest at the very heart of his business. It is refreshing to see a film from the 50's that has a good alien, one that wants to help and cares for humanity, rather than one that wishes to destroy and use the people and resources of the planet selfishly. The lead is capably filled by Michael Rennie who brings an understanding and innocence to his role few actors could have pulled off. Rennie is the archetypal Christ figure bringing mankind truth, only to be killed for his goodness. Just like Christ, Rennie's character rises from death and ascends to the heavens. Philosophically, the film is a masterful look at human nature both good and evil. The story shows this alien, alike in form, wander the streets of Washington D.C. seeing the progress of man and the impediments to his further progress. Patricia Neal excels in her role as a mother with a son that befriends this stranger. The rest of the cast is also very good. Look for Frances Bavier(Aunt Bea) in a small role. Robert Wise, the director, whether intentionally or not, created a great film that not only tells a very convincing story of what our planet would be like if entertaining an alien presence, but also a telling allegory looking ahead to man's hope and future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive sci-fi!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the science fiction films that George Lucas would like to have a part of his trilogy. A movie almost fifty years old that has retained its freshness and cult status, and all without the mass use of special effects. It does not require much to keep our attention, it does not have a mass universal terminology which excludes entire audiences, and its intentions are entirely clear. Instead, without a huge handful of stars, Robert Wise directs at a slow pace which surprisingly enhances the film.The tides change at eventual rate and the black and white cinematography does not allow intrusion into an earlier age with different beliefs. With colour and a host of explosive special effects, it would not be able to retain its simplicity. The music haunts, and it poignantly reveals, with little effort, the sometimes damning and tragic sides of human nature.The characters of the film are not revealed in huge depths. Visitation to earth for Klaatu was merely a day trip, and with little effort, he delivers his word as what seems like a Christ type figure. The question remains, as for the audiences of its time, our time and even the characters, if we are to listen. This is like the "2001: A Space Odyssey" of the 1950s. While no one can doubt the superiority of Stanley Kubrick's vision over the originally humble black and white grand daddy of all sci-fi, it delivers for the thinking members of society all that is need to be said, more successfully than the other. Does it still work now, with all its powerful 1950s oriented symbolism? Does it remain a film for the modern audiences? The ingenuity of "The Day the Earth Stood Still" as a film for all the ages, need not be questioned.Klaatu is welcome to pay us a visit. For real. Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not too many black-and-white movies are still frequently quoted in other movies and on the Internet.This movie, like much of the science fiction of that Golden Age, had a slightly masked, simple and terrifying message in its cold-war day: straighten up or ship out. The movie took advantage of the fascination with 'flying saucers' to preach an anti-nuclear stance that took considerable nerve in the face of massive government build-ups.The robot Gort as a tool capable either of terrible destruction or helpful companionship prefigured the age of computers and artificial intelligence... a mysterious and powerful, silent figure, unlike the clown robots of later years (Lost in Space) and other movies (Forbidden Planet). Foreboding and yet strangely reassuring as he responds to "Klaatu barada nichto".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise's "The Day the Earth Stood Still", does justice for its' inspirer, "Farewell to the Master", written by Harry Bates. The movie, yet slightly different from the story, is a timeless classic.Although it was filmed in 1951, it possesses the quality of today's films about UFO hysteria. At the beginning of the movie the spacecraft lands on earth and creates an enormous frenzy. The portrayal of this scene in the movie is very accurate to our society norm of today.Another reason I find this movie enjoyable, is the fact that in this show the aliens come to earth to offer help. Klaatu arrives and wants to inform earthlings that space travel would not be advise if we want to keep intergalactic peace. The movie shows its 50's making at this point, since we now k ow space travel is possible; but over looking this detail isn't impossible either. He wants to meet with the leaders from around the world and give them his request. I also think the movie depicts perfectly how stubborn and egocentric our world is when the leaders decline because of petty differences; even when our world is at stake.Another plus to this movie is the correlation between Christianity and the image of Klaatu. Klaatu is brought down from the skies in order to save the world, as was Jesus, our savior. In addition, Klaatu goes by the name of Carpenter on earth. Meanwhile, Jesus himself was a carpenter.Despite the fact that "The Day the Earth Stood Still" was made forty-eight years ago, it is a terrific movie. And any changes in technology from then to now, can easily be overlooked in order to enjoy a great film like this.7 of 10 stars</fullReview>

Though I have seen "the Day the Earth Stood Still" at least four times, I rarely pass up an opportunity to see it yet again. It is as timely now as it was when it was made nearly 50 years ago.

		<fullReview>From the moment the viewer hears Bernard Herrmann's classic use of the theremin for the film's opening music set against the image of a wild galaxy, you know you're in for a treat. The movie continues this sense of awe and excitement through its subsequent use of fantastic special effects (set in the daytime, which makes the effects unnoticeably easy on the eyes)to set up the movie's main premise. The film's scenes move with a lightingly quick pace, though, and so the viewer is never allowed the chance for him/her to be bored with what turns out to be a film more concerned with morale than intergalactic carnage. The acting is appropriately right on in its earnestness, while the script always lends the feel of the film building up to its tremendous climax. It is here where the emotional wallop is felt, and Klaatu's ultimate intentions are brought forth. Nice touches throughout the movie include the exchange between the little boy and Klaatu concerning war, and the explanation of how and why Klaatu looks so human-like. It's anti-nuclear weapons message was very impactful back in the fifties, but the movie also works just as well now, in the late 90's. I guess this is why great science fiction movies such as this are great in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sci-Fi Aims to Enlighten But Essentially Entertains...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many fans of this classic film from the early 1950's look upon it as a Christ-like message picture with Klaatu, the Martian, delivering a message of possible armageddon or else. They have a point because it does more or less comment on the Cold War atmosphere and paranoia of America at the time. I look at it more as simple entertainment, an intelligent movie with cheesy effects and good performances.THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL has remained timeless and watchable because we don't see many effects, which consist mostly of the kitchen sink spaceship and a goofy-looking foam alien bodyguard made of "some of the toughest substance ever seen." Director Robert Wise shoots the film in glossy black and white, which adds an element of slight suspense and originality allowing you to overlook the silly prosthetics.Klaatu hooks up with Albert Einstein-like Professor Barnhardt and solve some celestial physics together. They must also conjure up a way to lower the chances of atomic annihilation amongst the rest of the world's "great" minds. The military is out for blood looking for the escaped alien and a page of WAR OF THE WORLDS has obviously been borrowed. Radio reports and TV broadcasters emulate doom over the airwaves sounding like Orson Welles in 1938. Modern day sci-fi like INDEPENDENCE DAY has borrowed from this with the military presence and sense of fright over the appearance of the visitors from outer space. Thankfully, it does not go over the top with ridiculous sci-fi jargon, which destroys the timelessness of so many inferior extra-terrestrial films.I felt like watching ED WOOD afterwards. This is the picture Edward D. Wood, Jr. probably dreamt of making. Tim Burton pays homage to DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL in MARS ATTACKS! with its dish-like saucers and stand off at the Capitol in Washington, D.C. Don't dismiss the message of peace which is draped all over the movie. I just felt it was more a science fiction story meant to give us a fluffy cinematic experience and I'm sure the picture was innovative in 1951.Listen for yet another fine Bernard Hermann score which has a familiar ghoulish sound evident in most sci-fi flicks of the era. He takes it a step further of course and provides a nice backdrop of dramatically stirring music. Robert Wise is obviously a man of many tastes and talents, directing pictures like WEST SIDE STORY, THE HAUNTING, and even the original STAR TREK movie (yuk!). This is without a doubt an American classic and has stood the test time.RATING: 8 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was based on a short story ("Farewell To The Master", by Harry Bates), which I read a long time ago. The movie was a lot like the story except that it left out the interesting twist revealed at the end. I have not heard of the Christian symbolism aspect mentioned here, but, I think the original story ending may also fit in with this symbolism -- if Klaatu represents Christ, then Gort (who is the actual threat of "be peaceful, or else") could represent God. The original ending fits this symbolism, I think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gentle, powerful sci-fi masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A literate, gentle allegory of a christlike alien threatening Earth with the big stick of intergalactic judgement if we don't cease our nasty warlike ways.In a way it's a wish-fulfilling response to the fearful power atomic weaponry suddenly delivered to the world. It's as if we wanted God's intervention to stop us immediately destroying ourselves with our disgusting new toys.I'd certainly welcome a Second Coming from Klaatu and Gort if they could only prevent a tenth of the senseless slaughter and political oppression currently blighting the globe.One minor niggling, quibbling doubt I have is that the flying saucer, having landed in the middle of a large city, would surely be surrounded by fascinated onlookers 24 hours a day - but the site is deserted overnight. But apart from that single (and extremely petty) implausibility, this film is a gentle, powerful sci-fi masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tables turn...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The unique thing about this film is that it reverses the roles of mankind and alienkind- Instead of portraying aliens as horrific, violent creatures that must be eliminated, the tables are turned so that people are the focus of degradation. The idea you may conjure when seeing this film is that humans are ignorant, stupid beings. Conceited, greedy, and unsympathetic, we shall eventually lead to our own demise. A wonderful and striking example of this concept occurs when Helen is speaking with Tom:[Helen] "It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world is involved!"[Tom] "I don't care about the rest of the world..."If that isn't blunt enough, I don't know what is. This movie is great because it has some brains to it- the effects aren't as important as the concepts. If you like old scifi, see this film for a change in style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Klaatu barada nikto!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, I watched this classic for the first time last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it! Michael Rennie stars as Klaatu, a tall, dignified alien who travels 250 million miles from an unnamed planet to Washington, D.C. He is accompanied by Gort (Lock Martin), a gigantic robot that can destroy weapons with a powerful laser beam. Klaatu takes a room in a boarding house, where he meets widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son Bobby (Billy Gray). (Incidentally, Gray would later play Bud Anderson in the hit TV series "Father Knows Best.") In summary, Klaatu warns the people on earth that they must either pursue peace or face obliteration. For me, everything about this movie meshes very well -- the intelligent plot, the superb cast, the eerie soundtrack, and the modest special effects. Trivia fans will note the obvious parallels between Klaatu and Jesus, e.g. Mr. Carpenter is Klaatu's alias, he prophesies destruction on earth, he dies and later comes back to life. The only thing I wish the screenwriters had changed would be to include Bobby in the final scene -- especially considering that he and Klaatu become good friends during the alien's stay in Washington. Other than that, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a sci-fi masterpiece that just gets better with age! Yes, technology has changed, but the film's message remains highly relevant to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Top 10-1950's Sci-Fi Classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this on NBC's "Saturday Night at the Movies". I never saw it on a big screen. The robot, "Gort" was not as scary on a 21" TV set, but when his "laser eye" opened it gave me chills and it still does. Remarkably simple special effects by today's standards yet highly effective. That "creepy" classic music. Gaunt and tall (6'4") Michael Rennie looks like an alien. Sam Jaffe is the perfect "Einstein-like" eccentric scientist. Patricia Neal, Billy Gray and Hugh Marlowe are credible as the supporting cast in the most unusual sci-fi film ever made. The studio "sold" it as a "monster" movie, which it never was. The robot carries a blond-haired bimbo (in a sultry red dress) in its arms on the lobby cards. Patricia was not blond and did not wear a "red" dress, though it's hard to tell in a b/w movie. It's one of the most thoughtful fantasy films ever made, although not perfect. The "speeded-up" film in the panic scenes looks very fake. The Army is portrayed as brainless and heartless. Poor Gort had wardrobe issues: You can see his air holes and zipper. Even the support "wires" as he carries Patricia back to the spaceship. The Earth doesn't really "stand still". The aliens just neutralize most electricity. That's not very scary, or is it? The movie's "message" is still relevant after 60 years. The people of Earth must learn to live in peace or someday we will all be blasted off the Earth. Whether we will kill ourselves off or are vaporized by alien robots like "Gort" still remains to be seen. A note to "Fox" and everyone else: A movie does not have to remade just because it's in black and white.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>60 years on, it improves with age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been 60 years and one month since the debut of "The Day the Earth Stood Still." Rather than the movie looking out of date, the fact that the crude 1951 technology looks so antiquated today helps make the point of the movie: humanity's conceit looks childish in the larger cosmic perspective. Multiply the way 1951 technology looks to us in 2011 times 100 or 1,000 and you begin to get some idea how we must look to an advanced galactic civilization. When this movie was released, televisions were just appearing in American homes, the transistor had been invented four years before and was not in any consumer products, jet planes were limited to the military, and the atomic bomb was marking its sixth birthday. The first satellite was still six years in the future. Man travel to the moon? Maybe in the 21st century.Yes, we've made enormous technological progress in 60 years, and now nearly everyone has a cell phone, or a laptop or an HD TV! How puny we would seem next to a civilization with thousands or even millions of years of scientific progress, instead of our mere 500. And then there were the rash of UFO sightings, including headlines across the nation of a crashed UFO recovered in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, based on a military press release quickly retracted. What if a UFO did land, say, in Washington, D.C.? People couldn't help but wonder. Bosley Crowther in his New York Times review of Sept. 19, 1951 was not impressed, seeming to prefer the thrills and action of H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds:"It is comforting, of course, to have it made plain that our planetary neighbors are much wiser and more peaceful than are we, but this makes for a tepid entertainment in what is anomalously labeled the science- fiction field."Crowther, it seems, did not want to face the issues head on, and did not understand the essence of modern science fiction, which is less about technology than about questions of human nature, society and even spirituality, set in some science fiction future. In other words, it is supposed to make you think outside the box of your little reality.Sadly, humanity seems to have made little progress in the social or spiritual realm over the past 60 years. For awhile, it seemed we were learning to cooperate among nations to address our problems, but now it seems more like things are flying apart. Could we call a meeting of all heads of state to meet with a visitor from another planet today? Well, there are some that seem preoccupied with civil wars at the moment. And there are others who are corrupt, or who are hopelessly mediocre and incompetent. With the perspective of 60 years, it is clear why UFOs would not want to land and meet our leaders then, and why they still would not, today. Humanity must seem like so many childish fools for being unable to face facts and cooperate to solve our imminent and urgent problems. The Day the Earth Stood Still is a classic, but it got some basic science wrong. That an advanced space ship would take five months to travel 250 million miles is pretty pathetic. That's about the distance to Mars. (The next Mars rover, Curiosity, will take 255 days to travel the 354 million miles to Mars at a leisurely 58,000 mph, or 16 miles per second.)Yet in the opening, we see vistas that seem to represent the view from the spaceship as it travels to Earth, and these include a view from a distance of our galaxy, which is far more than 250 million miles. It would have been more realistic to talk of billions or trillions of miles, or of light years, but for a time when we had not yet even sent a rocket into space, this might have been too hard to grasp.The interior of the spaceship is pretty cool. (I'm not sure what I would do in there for five months; where's the bed and kitchen and AV console? Did Klaatu play gin rummy with Gort for the entire trip? Barbarella's shag-carpeted RV spaceship looks like more fun.) Reportedly, it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The Bernard Herrmann score also holds up surprisingly well. Some people gripe that Hugh Marlowe's performance is stiff. But his character was an insurance salesman; he's a conservative with little imagination. I've seen plenty of people like this over the years, and Marlowe got it right. The aliens had the last laugh. Flying saucers were observed flying in formation over Washington, D.C. the next year, on radar and in photographs, apparently in a case of reality imitating art. It got front page headlines in the Washington Post. Wikipedia has an article, "1952 Washington D.C. UFO incident." There were numerous other sightings around the nation in 1952, and reports of a possible "shoot down" order if the UFOs did not obey orders to land. Yeah, right. One part of the movie does look especially quaint today, and that is the threat to destroy Earth if we did not learn to live together in peace. We don't need some outsiders threatening us; we are quite capable of destroying our planet all by ourselves through global warming. Our planet seems to have a built in self-destruct mechanism if we fail to learn to cooperate to solve our problems. This time, I'm afraid, simply repeating "Klaatu barada nikto" won't cut it, though it's worth a try.Trivia: Klaatu takes the name John Carpenter when he leaves the hospital, an ironic choice in light of the story, with the initials JC matching the founder of Christianity, who was a carpenter. Then, 33 years later, another movie about a visitor from space, Starman, was directed by John Carpenter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the alien messenger Klaatu lands his flying saucer in Washington DC, he is wounded by a nervous soldier and imprisoned in a hospital by the military. When he escapes, he seeks out a boarding house so that he can meet the people of this planet. He befriends a small boy and a peace loving professor, and is hunted by the authorities. When governments refuse to listen to his message, he gives an impressive demonstration of his power and leaves a warning for the people of Earth.The Day the Earth Stood Still is a wonderful and simple tale, skilfully and artistically put on the big screen by director Robert Wise. It is beautifully filmed, has a great script that emphasizes the relationships between the characters in a very real way despite its fantastic subject, and is absolutely perfectly paced. Michael Rennie has a quiet authority and charisma in his role as Klaatu that makes him an excellent choice for the part, and I was also impressed by Sam Jaffe as the professor.The movie has a nice, if trite, message of peace but unlike many other science fiction movies, accents this with a lack of violent action by the aliens, even if the threat of violence remains. The aliens here are not seen as evil conquerors and destroyers-a nice change.Overall, a great movie that has held up through the decades and is still a great story today.</fullReview>

He might as well admit he's only after getting into mom's pants - what kind of movie boyfriend doesn't take an interest in a widow's kid? Even a psychopath like Reverend Harry Powell had sense enough to pretend. Then Marlowe gets whiny jealous over the girl so much as speaking to another man: a sure sign of untrustworthiness. Next he robs jewels from the tourist's room and rats him out to the G, trying to play the big wheel at the expense of Earth and all the decency in it. If Gort ends up reducing us to a burning cinder, we know who to thank.This mealy-mouthed prick - he was never any good, never. If he shows up pretending to be a sheriff (RAWHIDE, '51): shoot him. If he wants to fly your airplane (12 O'CLOCK HIGH, '49): ground him. If he's trapped in a mine (GARDEN OF EVIL, '54): bury him alive.You cringe every time he kisses Patricia Neal - as if she didn't already have enough man trouble. This is the woman who survived an abortion foisted on her by a three-timing Gary Cooper (luckiest hypocrite on the face of the earth, huh? I wonder why your late-entry Catholic conversion didn't keep you from getting every kind of cancer known to man), then married a Limey who cheated on her with her best friend (yeah, Roald Dahl, you know who you are, and don't think writing some children's books is gonna get you out of hock for that), then got raped by Paul Newman (okay, that one was only a movie. But still.) The only decent guy she ever met talked gibberish to appliances and hotfooted it back to space in a big Frisbee, leaving her to raise her kid all alone on a secretary's wages, on a home planet at the edge of obliteration. Talk about unlucky in love - I'd hate to see her across a poker table. She'd have aces every time.</fullReview>

Considering the age and the black and white film, the story is as valid today as it was in 1951 when it was made. The special effects are still convincing. This is one of Michael Rennie best character's. One must not forget the role of Sam Jaffe, (Shalom Jaffee) as professor Barnhart, a very key and personable role that gave great weight to humanities outreach to the alien that comes in judgment . I can not rate this movie high enough ground breaking, this is the movie that directors and producers pray to make every time they start a new project.This movie did much for the whole Sci-fi industry, it raised production standards, introduced complex, meaningful, and socially relevant plots. With Patricia Neal as a powerful co star, the overall production standards of this movie were ground breaking in the late 1940's to the early 1950's. The success of this film gave the movie companies the courage to make other great movies, My favorites are The Day the Earth Stood Still, Invaders from Mars, War of the Worlds, Them!, 1984, Forbidden Planet, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Kronos, The Fly, The Blob, Journey to the Center of the Earth, On the Beach.If any of these are your favorites, I believe you can thank the people who made The Day the Earth Stood Still whose success inspired others to follow in it's foot steps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After revisiting this film just now, I have one word to say: Powerful. TDTESS is one of the greatest Cold War allegories ever created, but it really does transcend the time period it was created in and becomes simply a powerful film about the irrational fears, prejudices and jealousies of the human race, and the consequences of our behavior.A spaceship is detected landing in Washington D.C., setting off mass panic all around the world, and prompting heavy military response. Upon arrival, two figures are seen exiting the spacecraft: Klaatu, a mysterious visitor who looks remarkably human, and Gort, an advanced and dangerous robot. As the world watches the events unfolding before them on television and radio, Klaatu desperately seeks out an audience composed of representatives from all the nations and cultures of the world in order to give them an important message, a message that concerns the continuation of all life on planet Earth.When you watch this film you really have to be aware of the Cold War mentality of the time period, but the film works remarkably well even if you place it in the context of today's society. This is apparently why they have decided to create a remake, in theaters this December. Based on the trailer, I'm unsure if the spirit of this film will remain. I hope so, because this is an important film about issues concerning all of humanity. Perhaps they can find a new, more contemporary issue on which to draw inspiration for the remake.TDTESS constantly reminds us of the achievements made by humanity, including some very touching scenes involving the national landmarks and memorials in the Washington D.C. area, while also making a statement about the fragility of our society. Its themes are universal, including cultural intolerance, aggression, apathy, greed, corruption, and innocence. It's an extremely intelligent film that sustains interest, and all the way until the end it remains a compelling and interesting human study.10/10, a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about this film is that it is an intelligent one. It gives an idea time and it doesn't drown science fiction in lasers, monsters and daft romantic tangents. It asks serious questions about real subjects....can we be trusted with atomic power, what is our place in the bigger scheme of things, what are we achieving apart from internal fighting. The understated but powerful way the arrival of an alien shows up our smallness is tremendous and very affecting.Usually such films are diluted when the camera turns away from the special effects and concentrates on the domestic, here the opposite is true. The conversations and actions of ordinary people to the extraordinary events is where the films real value lies. As a human living on this planet it is quite amazing how completely you side with the alien against your own kind throughout the film. It's a disturbing truth, very subtly extracted by a wonderful film. It ranks as highly as Silent Running, which is praise indeed.Bottom line....a smart and thoughtful masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so totally refreshing different than its fellow genre movies from the '50's! Everyone has a certain images in their mind about '50's science-fiction movies, with flying saucers of which you can see the wires, aliens with bad make-up effects and simple plots. The type of Ed Wood movies. "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a much, much different movie fortunately!It's not a movie that tries to impress, it's instead more of a movie that tries to provoke and at all time remain as realistic as possible. The movie its message is clear and (unfortunately) it still applies today, just as much as it did over 50 years ago.Normally these type of movies from this time period would be about aliens causing mayhem and destruction, by trying to take over or simply destroy the Earth. This movie does begin as one of those sort of movies but soon starts to take a positive turn, when it starts to totally focus on its script and story, rather than any action or over-the-top science-fiction moments. It's a clever and provoking movie. Everything happening in this movie happens with a reason.The way the alien visits Earth and tries to discover things and places is done in a great way. It's a reflecting and objective view of a neutral person. It's really a movie that holds up a mirror to the world and therefor works great and effective as a social commentary, that still applies today.The movie has some great convincing special effects (especially for '50's standards of course) that are still acceptable by today standards. The movie is not as cheap looking as most of the genre movies from the same time period, though I imaging this movie had just such an high budget as any other. So also real big kudos to director Robert Wise who brought it all so very well and convincing to the screen. Robert Wise would later make also such science-fiction classics as "The Andromeda Strain" and "Star Trek: The Motion Picture". Another thing that makes this movie distinct itself from other is the classic Bernard Herrmann score.The main character is greatly played by the unknown Michael Rennie . He really has the right looks of an alien in human form. Also surprising how important and strong the female character played by Patricia Neal in this movie is. The always great Sam Jaffe also plays a good, though small role in the movie. But the real classic and most memorable character of the movie is the robot Gort, played by the very tall Lock Martin. Even though it's not a character that talks or even movies a lot, it's still one that impresses very much, just by its looks and actions. He has become a real classic!A real refreshing genre classic about still 'hot' subjects!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Your choice is simple. Join us and live in peace, or pursue your present course and face obliteration."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1951, in the aftermath of World War II and at the beginning of the Cold War, there existed considerable cultural fears related to violence, politics and even possible global annihilation if the trend towards human war and conflict continued. With the further development of atomic weapons, and the beginning of the Space Age just six short years away, these fears were beginning to intensify. Many science-fiction films of the 1950s simply exploited this paranoia, using alien invasions as an allegory to a Soviet invasion (the excellent 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)' being the most accomplished example). However, Robert Wise' science-fiction classic, 'The Day the Earth Stood Still,' is very much a cautionary tale, challenging the audience to consider what will become of humanity if we continue our current course, and pleading for a change in our destructive ways.The film gets straight into the action. Behind the opening credits, we briefly observe the approaching spacecraft's journey across the Universe, into the Milky Way, and towards a tiny planet Earth. The spacecraft steeps into our atmosphere, the clouds disperse and we glimpse the familiar open ocean. Radio and television stations announce the mysterious UFO's presence to the world. It travels at supersonic speed ? 4000 miles per hour ? and nobody can identify exactly what it is (to add another layer of reality, some of the era's most famous broadcast journalists were hired to provide cameos as themselves ? including Gabriel Heatter, H.V. Kaltenborn and Drew Pearson). Miraculously, the spacecraft slows above Washington D.C., and, to the horror of onlookers, lands dramatically on the Ellipse at President's Park.A curious crowd begins to gather around the mysterious craft; squadrons of heavily-armed army personnel cautiously surround it. Along the spacecraft's perfectly smooth body, an entrance opens and a ramp is lowered to the grass. A spaceman, dressed in a shiny, silver suit and accompanied by a massive impenetrable robot named Gort, steps out into the view of the stunned crowd. His first words are friendly and reassuring: "we have come to visit you in peace and with goodwill." Nevertheless, at the first sudden movement, a soldier's pistol is fired and the spaceman is struck. Already, Man is demonstrating his uncanny ability for destruction.As this mysterious spaceman, named Klaatu (Michael Rennie), reveals his intentions of saving the planet from potential obliteration, he is saddened to hear of the insurmountable gulfs between countries that hamper his plans. Embroiled in all their petty human politics, the countries of the world are simply unable to come to a mutual understanding, thus practically sealing their own demise. Klaatu quite easily flees from the detention of the hospital, assumes a new identity (as a Mr. Carpenter) and hires a room in a household full of with conspiracy theorists. It is here that he comes to know Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her son Bobby (Billy Gray).It is the latter who ? not knowing Klaatu's true identity ? suggests that he visit Prof. Jacob Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), purportedly one of the most intelligent men in the world. There is a familiar way in which Klaatu smiles at Barnhardt's complex mathematical calculations on the blackboard, as one would smile at a child learning addition and subtraction. It reminds us that, even with all our technological advancement, we are still but children in the eyes of the Universe. Nevertheless, Klaatu decides that, if anything is to be done to save the fate of the planet, it must take place through men whose judgment is not clouded by government policies and petty prejudices. He must approach the scientists of the world, the scholars of art, philosophy and culture; those whose only concern is the search for knowledge and happiness. It is not the bickering governments who will play any large part in this tale ? the President of the United States doesn't even earn himself an appearance ? but the uncorrupted hearts and minds of the rational thinkers.'The Day The Earth Stood Still' was adapted by Edmund H. North from Harry Bates' short story 'Farewell to the Master.' In the original story's shock ending, it is revealed that, contrary to initial belief, it is the robot Gort (named Gnut in the story) who is the master, and Klaatu who is the servant. This ending is not clearly addressed in the film itself ? though Klaatu does declare that, in order to maintain universal peace, they created a race of robots and, in matters of aggression, gave them absolute power of everyone, even over their creators. Despite this, Klaatu is inarguably given the role of a Messiah, most prominently by featuring a resurrection scene, and also by his choice of alias ? Jesus himself was a carpenter by trade.Countless later science-fiction films owe a lot to 'The Day The Earth Stood Still.' Roland Emmerich's 1996 blockbuster 'Independence Day' borrowed heavily from it, and acknowledges this by briefly featuring a clip from the film itself. The hysteria and confusion arising from the sudden loss of electricity and transport no doubt inspired Steven Spielberg for his 2005 remake of 'The War of the Worlds.' Most significantly, this film strongly reflects many of the cultural fears inherent in that era. One elderly female conspiracy theorist declares: "if you want my opinion, he (Klaatu) comes from right here on Earth. And you know where I mean." Yes, we immediately do. This paranoia between the two feuding powers is explicitly shown to be the main reason why Klaatu's initial peace proposal was a failure, as neither was able to reach an acceptable peace compromise by which the visitor's proposition could be heard. Mankind's primitive tendency towards violence, throughout the film, threatens to destroy any chance of its continuing existence, though the ending is deliberately left very open ending, as if the ultimate choice is left to the viewers themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Sci-Fi - timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with the original War of the Worlds it is a classic from the Golden Age of Sci-Fi from the 50's. It has the unforgettable characters of Klaatu and Gort. Also, friendly aliens instead of the usual terrifying evil ones. It has Biblical themes: a savior who is killed by those he came to save, the earth standing still, a few faithful disciples, a misunderstood message of salvation.Good effects, directing and acting that still looks good today, with a strong, powerful script.All this adds up to a B&amp;W movie of timeless quality still worth watching today with such others as King Kong, Its a Wonderful Life, Stagecoach, etc. You don't need to be a Sci-Fi fan to enjoy this, it appeals to all ages</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent sci-fi film... the one true flaw is the heavy-handed, preachy presentation of its moral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about this film a number of times before I got to watch it. It's been lauded as one of the best science fiction movies ever, and there are numerous references to it in other movies and on TV. I definitely understand its popularity now. The plot is interesting and develops nicely throughout. The pacing is pretty much solid all the way, I was never bored. The effects hold up remarkably well, and are seldom anything less than completely convincing. The writing is quite good, with credible characters and events(considering the genre, obviously); it did, however, stand out how one character seems to disappear for the final act with no explanation. The acting is fine; it doesn't soar to Oscar-winning heights(nor does it drop to the point where it's embarrassing), but it worked well for the film. I thought that the event which the title refers to held a great point, and worked well as satire and social commentary. The music has the disadvantage of being produced at a time where music for sci-fi alien/UFO stuff was what by any standard today is considered corny; this piece deserves a much more fitting score, but if you can overlook that(which I had little trouble doing), it's still a highly enjoyable movie. The film plays much more seriously than many sci-fi films(particularly of the period, and for dealing with UFOs), and works really well as such. The one thing that brings down the overall quality is the way the moral of the story is presented... I realize that movies did occasionally spoon-feed their points around this time(Scarface of '32 being a prime example thereof, although this film certainly isn't as bad as that), but it's difficult to listen to the point being presented, valid as it arguably may be, when it's being preached to us. Still, this is a fine piece of science fiction, and should be experienced by any and all fans of such. I recommend this to any fan of the people involved in making it as well as the genre of sci-fi. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Wine, Age Makes It Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when it first came out, as an early teenager. I had previously read "Farewell To the Master," the story the screenplay was based upon, which had a solider jolt to it than the film. However, for younger viewers, it's better to understand the historical context.When the film was made, we had no space program: a few rocket probes were being shot up to what later would be called "satellite height," but the concept of an artificial satellite would be unknown to the public for a few years. There were "big" rockets for atmospheric research, but many of them were refurbished V-2 missiles. There was some ferment in the public mind, and nuclear weapons were considered good things to have (there were all sorts of businesses that put "atomic" in their names, for example). Films like Destination Moon whetted the public's appetite for science fiction (resulting in clunkers like Rocketship X-M and The Man Fom Planet X), and this one fell right into this environment.The story in the film was simple: alien envoy comes to Earth to warn humans not to export nuclear weaponry to space or get zapped. He's wounded, hospitalized, and then works undercover until he was able to contact a leading scientist, Professor Barnhardt. He understands that he has to communicate with an international scientific community, and he delivers his message.An interesting point, tangentially a possible spoiler. Klaatu breaks into Professor Barnhardt's study, and corrects some of his math. When the professor asks him how he knows that his corrections are valid, he explains that it helped him travel some 250 million miles to reach the Earth. Now given the dimensions of the Solar System, this suggests strongly that the spacecraft came from a nearby planet, almost certainly Mars. Now had Klaatu merely said, "I'm from Mars," the impact on the audience would have been laughter: the idea of Men From Mars had been a cultural joke for many years before, possibly a byproduct of the radio "War Of the Worlds" scare.Now Klaatu's solution for World Peace (an incorruptible robotic police force) was very simplistic, and I could envision such mechanisms getting hacked, but that's almost another matter (a 1947 Buck Rogers radio show had a robotic civilization where Buck and company were being held prisoner until they were able to sneak in and reprogram the new head robot, so the concept would not have been that far-fetched). But it was a good way to give the film a quick ending that was consistent with Klaatu's perspective.I've enjoyed the film, and have it in my library. It's a good repeat view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The elevator scene with Klaatu and Helen, I believe is symbolic of a confessional booth used in religious context. In that scene Klaatu spills his beans to Helen. I think that the religious symbolism in the movie is very strong, but not meant to back the Christian point of view. The point is that if Jesus himself did come back today, he would be put down by many. Just seeing the movie for the first time the other day, I find it amazing that 50 something years later the movie is still amazingly contemporary and dead on with the way people are still on this Earth. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it, and I was blown away of how much I enjoyed it. The music is really great too.</fullReview>

Aside from 5 minutes of anti-piracy in six languages and another annoying five minute "THX Certified" animation, the DVD is very good. Easily the best picture quality I've seen for this movie, and I've been watching it on TV since the 50's.However, the best reason to buy or rent this DVD is Side B--the interviews with the late Julian Blaustein (producer), Robert Wise (dir.), Patricia Neal, and Billy Gray (Bobby). Blaustein's motivation to make this movie--well let me not be a spoiler, but both sides of the DVD carry a warning that the interviewees' views are their own and not those of Fox, its management, parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, or close relatives.The studio's first choice for the part of Klaatu: Spencer Tracy (and he wanted the part, too.) Wise's first choice: Claude Rains! "I'm shocked! Shocked to learn there's been gambling on this planet!"And boy, how have I missed it all these years...the Christ metaphor. Klaatu's "resurrection" is obvious, but did anyone else pick up on his assumed name, Maj. Carpenter???Klaatu Berada Nicto</fullReview>

We are desperately in need of some of that right now! Better shape up Osama, or Gort's gonna fry your a**!Michael Rennie is perfect as Klaatu, despite the Brit accent. And Patricia Neal's scene with Gort, as she tries to get past her fear to utter those memorable words, "Klaatu barrada nikto," is a great example not only of Neal's skill as an actor, but of the acting style of the time. Gort's suit is a little funny with the bending plastic parts, but when the visor opens up, one can almost believe the horror of the damage he's about to inflict. And when with Neal Gort finally understands the message and closes the visor, even to this day I still breathe a sigh of relief.Great stuff and heartily recommended!!</fullReview>

The 1950s was perhaps the golden age of the SciFi genre in Hollywood during the 1950s as there were a lot of classics coming out then. The Day the Earth Stood Still(1951) is a thoughtful and well meaning film that was engrossing to follow. Spreads more interest intellengent thories than any Science Fiction film made in Hollywood today. If The Day the Earth Stood Still was remade today then it would be just another generic good humans vs. bad aliens saga. One of a number of brilliant films by Robert Wise. Influenced many American and British science fiction films for the following decades. Bernard Herrmann performs a wonderful film score that is one of his best non Hitchcock score. Includes an early role from future Hammer studio actor and American action star, Stuart Whitman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsMy enormous video collection,constructed for around 8 years,consists of vast amounts of films that are unintentionally left to gather dust.With a collection so vast,unfortunately,it is really only once in a blue moon that I get the opportunity to view the truly great classics,such as The Day The Earth Stood Still.An aspect of this movie really showed me how time goes by,and how short life is.The young lad who played Bobby is,in 2000,62 years old.He looked and acted like he was about 11,but this would in fact have made him 13 at the time.Amazing to me.The movie , however,warranted far more merit than this.It is also amazing how this 49 year old movie can still hold a truly nervy,seat edge feel to it today.For those not alive to experience the decade it was set in,it also paints a modern portrait of how most important/trivial things were before things went hugely commercial in the late '50's.It's assuring to know that a year like 1951 was'nt in fact a horse/carot setting,as far as my feel to it seemed to be,although,of course,I still knew it was'nt really.I think the worst thing anyone could do with TDTESS is write it off as a '50's B movie flick.While I think the general intention of the flick might have been to be scary,it is also a wickedly intelligent account of the suspicions/paranoia that was tearing society as a whole apart at the time.I actually hold a slight suspicion that might have been why Gort and Klattu arrived in the first place :which was causing the society more break up?:their arrival,or themselves?There's a distinct McCarthyiness to the affair,which society (American society,anyway)might still have been clinging onto/pinning their hopes on at the time.It's hard to laugh at the film's tacky old fashioned effects like in mosts ,because their ar'nt that many to start with.Instead,every rose tintered spectrum of the film is masterfully,unervingly captured in a quiet,jumpy way by the superb Robert Wise.Though Wise excelled ,and made a supremely superior colour 1971 effort in The Andromeda Strain,this is probably the most tension packed black and white movie around.Maybe it dos'nt hold itself together as well as,say,King Kong (1933),a film 67 years in age,but,all the same,this,compared to features from the sixties and seventies (Chinatown and Enter The Dragon spring to mind)is probably the closest you're going to get to a riveting old feature.*****</fullReview>

While there are some moments that make the movie rather dated, I'd say it's stood the test of time very well.While the pace may be a bit slow, the story does a great job of building things up. The story is very thought provoking and makes a real comment on human nature. The characters, while a bit cliche at times, are sympathetic and well acted. While the movie, overall, is very good it does have some flaws. I really felt that the story went to far in beating me over the head with the Klaatu/Christ parallel. Also, Gort is just silly looking. It's rather hard to be afraid of a monster so awkward that he makes Frankinstein look like a ballerina.So while the film is a bit dated, it's still well worth your time to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1950's Time Capsule</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After WWII and the invention of the atomic bomb, people in the 50's were looking for strong leaders who could command moral authority. Enter General Eisenhower, who would become a two-term U.S. President; "Father Knows Best", with its stern but loving father figure; and the iron-fisted biblical epic: "The Ten Commandments".Enter, too, "The Day The Earth Stood Still", a 1951 sci-fi classic soaked in images of authority ... the police, the military, and the tall, stern, Moses-like figure from another world, Klaatu, who lectures us on the folly of nuclear war. It is, I believe, this pacifist message emanating from strength that explains the film's enduring popularity.Noble as the message is, what about its cinematic vehicle? Visually and musically, the film is appropriately frigid and forbidding. Leo Tover's noirish B&amp;W lighting and unobtrusive camera work, combined with Bernard Herrmann's score and the eerie theramin sounds all work in concert to convey a mood of Orwellian severity and other worldly coldness.But the script is disappointing. This is a very talky film, which dilutes its effectiveness as sci-fi. The dialogue seems stodgy, canned, uninspired. Example: "attention zone 5, attention zone 5, yellow cab moving north ... man and woman in backseat; get license number and report ... deploy all units according to Plan B immediately" (well, at least it was not Plan 9...).This pedestrian script could have been borrowed from most any cops and robbers flick of the 40's. On the other hand, I guess I can forgive the script's moratorium on humor, given the seriousness of the message.The film's science is very dated, thus requiring further tolerance. Klaatu to scientists: "The universe grows smaller every day"; no, actually the physical universe is expanding. "Venus and Mars ... are the only two planets capable of sustaining life as we know it"; no, not with their temperature extremes and chemical composition.And the special effects are curiously minimal in the same era that produced the beautifully weird gliding machines from Mars in "War Of The Worlds" (1953), and the lurking terror in "Forbidden Planet" (1956).One solid accomplishment of this film is its accurate portrayal of society in the early 1950's: the old cars, men's formal attire (especially those hats), interior decor, antiquated TV sets, and of course the confidence in institutional authority.In summary then, the movie, for me, functions less as a credible sci-fi vehicle than as a fascinating socio-political commentary on American life in the early 1950's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie with a message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A surprisingly intelligent sci-fi flick from the '50s, made before the craze for murderous cannibalistic aliens and monsters took over. What could easily have turned into another mindless 'alien invasion' flick turns out to be more interested in the story's moral, rather than extensive scenes of mass destruction as the aliens destroy Earth. Rightly regarded as a classic within the genre, this pulls the correct strings in all aspects concerned. The score is both spooky and exciting, thanks to Bernard Herrman's work (the man also did PSYCHO). The production values are all good too, and the film is refreshingly free of military and scientific jargon which would have dated it and therefore made it inaccessible to the modern audience.The acting is all top notch, from the realistic boy actor, Billy Grey, who becomes Klaatu's friend, to the surprisingly strong heroine who for once isn't forced around by the men in the film; in one good scene she tells her husband-to-be where to go after he ignores her pleas of rationality and decides to act irresponsibly ("The rest of the world doesn't matter!"). There is even a crusty professor who isn't irritating in the slightest. Obviously, though, it's Michael Rennie who carries the film in his pivotal role, and we see things from his point of view. Rennie is excellent as the spaceman, kind and compassionate, and yet with a hard edge which also shows itself occasionally.The special effects are used sparingly and therefore are all the better for it. While the flying UFO isn't too realistic, the robot, Gort, is very impressive as he fires lasers and destroys weapons. Apart from an exciting cab chase at the end of the film with the army closing in, there is relatively little action, the film is more concerned with theorising and discussion. It also paints a very accurate portrayal of mankind, a believable, realistic and frightening one.There is just so much to watch this film for, whether it be the classic images of the indestructible robot coming out of the UFO, the oft-quoted dialogue ("Klaatu verata nikto!"), the religious allegory (with Rennie as Christ) or the film's message (let's stop fighting and get rid of our atomic weaponry), still applicable to this day. THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL richly deserves the status that it has acquired. For those with taste...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In general, this is a well-executed, interesting glimpse into how the world viewed itself and aliens/UFOs in 1951. Renney is very good as the alien, and Neal does a fine job as the woman who befriends him. However, the beginning of the movie was so unrealistic that it made it difficult for me to take the rest of it seriously.SPOILER ALERT: The UFO lands and Rennie steps out and says in effect "we have come in peace." Nevertheless, an overeager military man shoots his hand as he draws something out of his coat to hand to the U.S. personnel. OK, that's not entirely unbelievable in and of itself. But then Gort steps out and NO ONE shoots him! In fact, after he shoots laser beams to destroy several military vehicles and weapons, STILL no one shoots!!! What????? This sequence is completely unbelievable and gave the movie a bad start.Also, the military personnel themselves seemed somewhat cartoonish. And for more unrealism,later in the movie, after seeing how Klaatu can self-heal and escape from the hospital with some unknown powers, the military believes it has Gort under control with some special plastic agent that is "stronger than steel". So it guards him with only 2 military personnel and no tanks? What? In the opening sequence numerous military personnel and tanks were present, but now that you believe this alien presence is a threat, you reduce military presence and rely on this mysterious plastic substance to hold Gort in check? Completely unrealistic.Another point lacking realism is that civilians could freely walk right up to the roped-off area, alongside military personnel. That is asinine, even in 1951.Movies have changed a lot since 1951. Now we expect much more realism, even in fantastic stories about aliens. I get that. But some of these faux pas were just too much for me to take, even for 1951.Absent that, the story is engaging and mysterious. We wonder what Klaatu's message is. Our heart is warmed when he engages so strikingly with the 11-year old boy (but another faux pas: even in 1951, what parent lets her 11yo boy go off for the day with a stranger?). We find ourselves rooting for Klaatu and embarrassed that the U.S. felt compelled to shoot him again late in the movie, and embarrassed at the sad state of affairs between countries on earth.Klaatu's solution of a robotic all-powerful police force is anathema to a country like the U.S who was founded on principles in contrast to an all-powerful anything and developed a system of checks and balances to prevent any branch of government from becoming too powerful. However, the movie does leave us with the eerie desire and hope for world, or cosmic, peace.But we know that will never come to pass.Because we are human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day the Earth Still Stood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widely Considered one of the most Literate and Popular among Sci-Fi Films and often Argued the Best of the 1950's. There have been more Words Written about it than there are Stars in the Sky.So for some Context and Fun, here is Offered a Look at the New York Times Review and some Comments on the "Real-Time" Review on its Initial Release. (NYT in Quotes, Comments Follow)Bosley Crowther...September 1951"...disembark creatures of such powers that they thoroughly belittle us mortals and put our worldly accomplishments to shame." Here there Seems to be a bit of Belittling of a "God" like Entity "Not of this Earth" and an Instant Defence of Humanity's Sins of Death and Destruction. How Dare anyone Question Our Behavior? Don't They know anything about History and Earthlings Stellar Track Record. We Know what We're Doing. Next He Describes a Vehicle that can Travel Millions of Miles through Space as a "contraption". "...once this contraption is down and its pilots have emerged?"...hardly expect them to split an infinitive, let alone an atom or a human head." Now remember, this is just a Few Years after two Atom Bombs were used in WWII and is Startling that Crowther would use that Whimsy. "But in a fable of such absurd assumptions as this one amusingly presents, cold chills might be more appropriate than lukewarm philosophy." Didn't He see the Last Scene in the Movie and if so, did He not find it Chilling?Klatu: "..if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder. Your choice is simple: join us and live in peace, or pursue your present course and face obliteration. We shall be waiting for your answer. The decision rests with you."..."this genteel soul, while charmingly suave and cosmopolitan, is likely to cause unguarded yawns." Really..."Nice chap, but a bit on the soft side, don't cha know." No, He is here delivering the Ultimate Ultimatum. Put down Your Weapons of Perish. "His giant mechanical assistant...We've seen better monsters in theater audiences..." Adopting a Hubris Beyond Belief nothing seems to Intimidate this Wordsmith Warrior."...this makes for a tepid entertainment?"Considering the Jesus Analogies present in the Film, One wonders what Crowther would have Reported if Similar Events had Occurred Millennia Ago and would He find said occurrences "Tepid".Note?The Title Summary line is not an original and was noticed in a Review by IMDb user Michael DeZubiria?and credit is due. It was so good it needed to be reiterated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic with all capitol letters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this when it first came out, waay back when of course, and it never fails to please.The newer Keanu Reeves remake could never hold a candle to this classic masterpiece. Filled with mystery, intrigue and the occasional humorous quip, the original was crafted superbly even with a tiny budget. Gort the robot was perfectly frightening, without having to be 60 feet tall, and managed to endear himself to the viewer rather than making you wonder "why is he even there?"I just wish they'd show this more often on TV, it's been a loong time now...I guess TV execs just don't believe in classics anymore. A pity really,as this original version holds your attention far better than any new age movie now a days. Perhaps SciFi Channel (proper spelling people!) could hold a few days of "nostalgia" or science fiction classics sometime. Ehhh, probably not...the young crowd doesn't seem to possess imagination now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While a lot of science fiction films focus on space or the very different and foreign aspects of aliens, robots, or other things we don't understand and are threatened by, this film is centrally focused around humanity and what kind of people we are. Honestly the main character, who is an alien and the character we associate the most with, is the most down to Earth and good example of how a person should conduct themselves. While the threat of alien annihilation is there, we find it is there for a good reason, because we as humans seem to lack the responsibility for our new technology. We end up becoming the threat in this film, which is what makes it so interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So There We Have It. Deterrence Works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In science fiction, especially in the cinema, aliens visiting Earth tend to fall into two categories, the Hostile Alien, as in "Signs", "Independence Day" or the various versions of "The War of the Worlds", and the Friendly Alien, as in "ET" or "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". A third possibility, namely that highly advanced aliens, rather than trying to conquer us or to extend the hand of friendship to us, might want to study us in the way a human zoologist studies some particularly interesting species of animal, has not proved so popular as a plot line. (A fourth possibility, that the aliens might simply ignore us altogether, has remained altogether unexplored, probably because it would not make for a very exciting film). Klaatu, the alien at the centre of "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is (at least at first sight) a Friendly Alien. To be specific he is a member of a particular subspecies of the genre, the Friendly Alien who comes to save us from ourselves. Klaatu lands in the centre of Washington, D.C in his flying saucer, from which he emerges with his robot companion Gort. His arrival naturally causes a good deal of consternation among the citizenry, and also among the military, who seem to think that Klaatu is the advance guard of an invasion by those dastardly Commies. In political circles, however, there is less interest. Although Klaatu announces that he has come to deliver an important message to all of humanity, the President does not put in an appearance. (A cool customer, that Harry S Truman). Instead Klaatu is greeted by a White House official who treats him with the sort of condescending politeness with which he might address a minor diplomat from some third-rate power. One might suppose that the arrival of alien emissaries were an everyday event in Washington and that most of Klaatu's predecessors in the role had proved something of a disappointment. Unable to gain any assistance from men of affairs, Klaatu turns his attention to men of science, and seeks out the famous scientist Professor Jacob Barnhardt (a thinly disguised Albert Einstein) who proves more amenable to his message. He also decides to find out more about the race among whom he is living by lodging incognito at a boarding house under the name of Carpenter, befriending an attractive young war widow, Helen Benson, and her son Bobby, whom he impresses by solving a problem in physics which has baffled even Barnhardt. As Klaatu looks indistinguishable from a human being and speaks impeccable English with an upper-class British accent, this deception is not difficult for him to pull off. Scriptwriter Edmund H. North seems to have had a lot of fun inserting subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, comparisons between Klaatu and Jesus Christ. The name "Carpenter" (Christ is traditionally believed to have worked as a carpenter) is perhaps one of the more subtle ones, but there are some more obvious parallels; Klaatu has seemingly miraculous powers- the title derives from an incident when he demonstrates them by neutralising all electric power around the globe- and even rises from the dead. Indeed, he was too much of a Christ-figure for the liking of Joseph Breen, America's chief film censor in 1951, and North was compelled to insert a line about the "Almighty Spirit", showing that Klaatu's people recognise a Supreme Being and that he himself does not claim divinity.And then the time comes for Klaatu to deliver his message. We have been led to believe that it will be something to do with peace and brotherhood, and so it proves, but the message itself comes as something of a surprise, and it is not as friendly or as Christ-like as we might have expected. Although Klaatu has boasted of his people's superior morality and rationality, it transpires that peace is maintained among the federation to which his planet belongs not by the exercise of reason or virtue but by deterrence. The federation has created an all-powerful race of robots- Gort is one of these galactic Robocops- to act as a sort of police force and to keep the peace by punishing anyone guilty of acts of aggression, up to and including the destruction of their own planet. Klaatu and his people are not too worried if the Earthlings fight among themselves, but they are solemnly warned that if they should try and export their aggression into Outer Space their world will be reduced to a burned-out cinder, just see if I don't. So there we have it. Deterrence works. Those who have praised the film for its "timeless message of peace" or who have condemned it as pinko leftist pacifist propaganda seem to me to have missed the point. "The Day the Earth Stood Still" can be seen as a vindication of the theory of the nuclear balance of power or of the war then being waged by the United Nations against communist aggression in Korea. It could even, in fact, be interpreted as a justification of the atomic bombing of Japan or the conventional bombing of Germany in response to the aggression perpetrated by the leaders of those two countries. Whether the film- makers actually intended these interpretations is another matter, but it does go to show that symbolism and allegory can be two-edged swords, allowing for more than one meaning. Yet, quite possibly, North and director Robert Wise did indeed intend their film to have this ambiguous double meaning. It certainly makes for a more intriguing film than an unambiguous pacifist sermon would have done. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard Sci-fi and the Fluffy Robot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Advertised as a frightening alien invasion movie about the end of days, the mantelpiece of 1950s science fiction on-screen fare "The Day the Earth Stood Still", manages to do what almost no other genre feature has managed to do. Survive the CGI revolution intact mainly thanks to its stunning and periodically relevant story, delivered by a memorable role of Michael Rennie as Klaatu / Mr. Carpenter, the extra-terrestial being, who visits Earth to deliver humankind a stern warning about their persistent path to self-annihilation. Met with fear and systemic governmental denial Klaatu becomes a runaway, attempting to deliver the message despite obstinacy of our stubborn ruling class.Set in the Cold War era of nuclear weapons and mutually assured destruction, the theme continues to resound thanks in part to the permeating sense of relevance in the paranoid time period, unlike the hollow remake with Keanu Reeves, which comes off as drab moralising. Here the threat is real - with the ideological divide drawn out as a petty squabble between bickering children, but which consequences are of a global scale. Showing the closed-mindedness of power, which seems to prefer penis-envy destruction and extrapolating foes over common sense and a willingness to create above differences, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" still rings true. A stark reminder that once the powers-to-be were basically ready to inflict global extermination of the human race as to protect the power caused by systemic differences. And uncovering the triviality of the Cold War power struggle remains the movies biggest input into world cinema.And not even the fluffy robot of apocalypse can change that...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very unique alien movie for it's time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see why critics are giving this one a lot of positive reviews. It's a sci-fi film with substance and way ahead of it's time. It has elements of humanity and what we take for granted. Even in today's society people are just mad about the world and after each others throats. Even if this movie was made in the 50's the nature of human beings didn't change one bit but gotten worse. I can tell why this movie stands out even today and how it was such a unique movie when it first came out. It doesn't have that generic monstrous looking aliens with ray guns or that super friendly alien thing going on. In fact the alien that comes from outer space is the most human like alien I have ever seen. I am not saying this is a positive or negative aspect to the alien genre. But the only difference seems to be the fact that the alien Klaatu has more knowledge and better technology. I thought this movie would have been better though if it showed Klaatue getting to have more of a bonding and relationship with the human race. He does to a degree but not that much with just the scene of him hanging out in Washington D.C. with a boy. Now to be honest I didn't find this movie to be all that entertaining but it does have substance and a message. And I thought the ending was great. It's one of those endings where the message is clear but leaves it up to the audiences.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A view of Earth from an outsider</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very famous movie and I can see why. I had not seen it previously but I am very glad that I did. It does not attack communism but it seems to attack world aggression. Maybe it is a subtle attack at communism, but it does not try to convince the viewers that communists are lurking around every corner. Rather it attacks our violent and distrusting nature and pleads with us to be reasonable and try to solve our problems in a reasonable way. The movie does distance the Americans from this by making it seem that Britain and Russia are the antagonists rather than America and Russia, but we see that it is the Americans who are also intrinsically hostile.A peaceful planetary power has been monitoring Earth and has been watching how hostilities have increased between the nation-states. They are concerned that they have nuclear power and are now making their way into space, so they send a representative to Earth to inform everybody. The reception is not pleasant as the army immediately mobilises and surrounds the ship, and as the alien marches down the ramp, there is a huge amount of tension. The alien goes to offer them a gift and even says that he comes in peace, but everybody is very hostile and cautious. Then one shoots the alien and the robot starts destroying the human's weaponry.The alien wants to try and help the earth solve their problems but the Americans are not interested. They keep the Alien locked in a room, even though that doesn't help, and when he escapes, they start a city wide manhunt looking for him. They close off all exits refusing to let anybody escape. They want to keep what the alien has to say to themselves and use it as an advantage against their enemies. The alien isn't that stupid, including demanding a full session of the UN, not just western bloc countries. They try to hide such associations from the alien, though he sees right through it.There is a praise of Abraham Lincoln in the movie though: he looks like a great man. That is a man that I want to speak to. Maybe this movie is an attack at centralised government and how it is the government that hinders the peace process. The army controls the streets watching everywhere the alien goes. He has little freedom and this is what the movie is possibly attacking. It is the government that is tyrannical and the less control the government has the more free we will be.The Day the Earth Stood Still is a seriously great movie. I was kept interested all the way through and enjoyed it thoroughly. Great movies don't become great because they are dull, they become great because they have something to say, and the Day the Earth Stood Still does have something to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie brings a message of peace that's well worth considering - and could and should be put into action. Unfortunately we haven't learned anything 60 years later...It's not a perfect movie, but the premise is intriguing: first, a flying saucer from outer space lands on Earth, causing the surprise and the panic among the population. Klaatu (a man from space), accompanied by Gort (a giant, intimidating and powerful robot), comes in peace only to get dismayed to learn the army's hostility against him.There is very little action, excitement or special effects, but still this has some great effects well ahead of their time. Anyway, this film has a purpose and a story, which I welcome, although it still could use a little more action, excitement and special effects.One of the best things about this movie is the friendship between Klaatu and the young boy Bobby.The line «Klaatu barada nikto» has become legendary but I haven't the slightest idea of its meaning.Michael Rennie is a great Klaatu; Patricia Neal is great; Billy Gray is great as Bobby; the unusually tall but unseen Lock Martin is a great Gort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love a good sci-fi movie as much as the next person, and I do have some favourites of the genre, Alien, Blade Runner, Empire Strikes Back, Metropolis and 2001:A Space Odyssey are wonderful movies, and like The Day the Earth Stood Still they not only have an influence on other movies of the genre and in general but also timeless classics in many more ways than one. The Day The Earth Stood Still has been a favourite since I first saw it and I still at 18 hold it in great regard. It still looks wonderful for its time, the effects and designs are wonderfully composed if purposefully simple and the cinematography is exemplary. Bernard Hermann's score is tense and wondrous, the script is deft, Robert Wise's direction is superb and while it has some solemn philosophical aspects and some heavy-handed symbolism neither of which are flaws in any way the story is compelling from start to finish. The acting is also impressive, Lock Martin is good as giant Gort but the real revelation is Michael Rennie's authoritative, dignified and sympathetic Klatu. Overall, a sci-fi masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless warning to Earthlings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one cult classic that perfectly stands the test of time.Clearly having been influenced by detonation of the atom bomb, this film delivers a message that is just as powerful today as it must have been in 1951 -- "Give up your senseless aggression, Earthlings?or you'll pay the ultimate price!" Michael Rennie was perfectly cast as alien Klaatu -- you really believed him as a superior being. I also liked the central earthlings --- Patricia Neal's Helen Benson, her precocious son, and her surprisingly venal boyfriend. As good as all the actors were, one couldn't help but notice the squeaky-cleanliness of the ensemble. An updated storyline filmed today would definitely have Klaatu and Mrs. Benson making passionate love -- or at least sharing a really long kiss in the darkened elevator! The film did falter a bit when Klaatu had Mrs. Benson speak a few words of his planet's gibberish to get the robot to rescue him. Neal's character seemed out of place as she dawdled in the spaceship. (I marveled that she didn't try to get out of there to be with her son at such a critical juncture in the history of the universe!) Still, it's probably a testament to this movie's appeal that I got my two boys (ages 8 and 14) to watch it with me all the way through. Usually older flicks lose their interest fast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Came To Warn Us!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only did director Robert Wise's seminal, science fiction saga "The Day The Earth Stood Still" espouse traditional American values and depict Cold War tensions, but the atmospheric, black &amp; white film also influenced a generation of alien invasion movies. Most early sci-fi movies occurred primarily on planet Earth. A mysterious flying saucer lands in Washington, D.C., and an eloquent spokesman from another planet warns earthlings that they must curb their destructive impulses. Wise and "Only the Valiant" scenarist Edmund North forged the first truly exceptional sci-fi film of the 1950s with "The Day The Earth Stood Still." Solid production values distinguished this far-fetched but intriguing thriller. Basically, aliens land on Earth and a trigger-happy military wants to obliterate them. The idea that an alien would masquerade as a human to try and understand our mind-set and culture before it passes judgment on mankind is pretty liberal. Wise manages to depict a public spectacle from an objective perspective as well as relate a smaller, more intimate story about the relationship between the alien and a single parent mother and her impressionable son. Despite its suspenseful doomsday plot, "The Day The Earth Stood Still" isn't a humorless bore. Choice lines of dialogue and the reactions which they elicit give the film a sly sense of humor. One item which enhances the atmosphere here is "Citizen Kane" composer Bernard Herrman's use of an electronic musical instrument called the Theremin that evokes an uneasy feeling. The bell-shaped spaceship with its retracting passageway and the looming hulk of a robot became iconic symbols that other filmmakers would pay tribute to in their variations on the plot. Clearly, "The Day The Earth Stood Still" exemplifies those sci-fi films about benevolent aliens who are not committed to the wholesale destruction of mankind. Interestingly enough, Twentieth Century Fox could not persuade the Pentagon to contribute U.S. Army vehicles so the company persuaded the National Guard to take up the slack and provide them with tanks, artillery and troops. Wise learned about the project from studio chieftain Darryl F. Zanuck who recommended him to see "Broken Arrow" producer Julian Blaustein. According to Wise, Zanuck wasn't as interested in producing a socially relevant thriller as much as he was intent on making an audience pleaser. "The Day The Earth Stood Still" opens with several shots of Earth as a giant flying saucer moving at supersonic speed arouses the attention of radar monitors. The exotic looking spacecraft lands in Washington, D.C. on the mall near the Washington Monument and a tall slender man in a space suit, Klaatu (Michael Rennie of "The Black Rose"), emerges to find his craft surrounded by the U.S. Army. He announces to the people crowded around his saucer that he has come in peace. He leaves the saucer and approaches the crowd with an object in his fist that sprouts spikes of some kind. Every soldier has their rifles and pistols trained on Klaatu, and one soldier in a tank shoots Klaatu. He obliterates the object in Klaatu's fist and wounds him. An even taller robot appears and emits a beam from its helmet-like head and melts rifles, tanks and artillery pieces and then does nothing. The military rush Klaatu to Walter Reed Hospital. Klaatu recovers and tells a representative from the President that he wants to meet all the leaders of the world. The representative explains that such a meeting is entirely impossible. Klaatu wants to leave, but the military refuse to allow him to leave so he vanishes later on his own in a suit of clothes that belong to a Major Carpenter. Carpenter roams the streets of Washington incognito while news of his escape covers the airwaves. Klaatu enters a boarding house and obtains a room. He meets Mrs. Benson (Patricia Neal of "Breakfast at Tiffany's") and her young son Billy Gray (Bobby Benson of "Bad Men of Tombstone") as well as the others who live in the boarding house. Helen's boyfriend, an insurance agent Tom Stevens (Hugh Marlowe of "Garden of Evil"), arrives to take Helen out and Helen asks if Carpenter will watch out for Billy. Billy and Carpenter stroll around Washington and Carpenter shows Billy a fistful of diamonds that he uses for currency. They visit Professor Jacob Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe of "Gunga Din"), but he isn't home. Carpenter leaves Barnhardt a calling card and fixes an equation that the professor has been toiling over in the realm of celestial mechanics. Later, Barnhardt sends a man to fetch Carpenter and they discuss the problem that the universe is facing. Earthlings have obtain the weapons of atomic power and now they pose a threat to the rest of the universe and Carpenter has come to warn them that the rest of the universe is prepared to destroy them if they send out atomic spaceships. Bobby follows Carpenter when the man heads back to the flying saucer and uses a flashlight to communicate with the robot Gort. By now the military are tracking Carpenter and they shoot him. Before Carpenter died, he warned Helen to rush to Gort and repeat a simple three word phrase to prevent Gort from destroying the world. Gort breaks into a jail and takes Carpenter's body back to the spacecraft and revives it. Carpenter emerges and warns the Earth one more time about its aggressive tendencies and then departs."The Day The Earth Stood Still" is an intelligent sci-fi adventure with a capable cast. Wise maintains suspense throughout the film's 92 minute running time. This was Michael Rennie's big break; he had been making films in England before Zanuck discovered him. Although it would probably bore audiences today, "The Day The Earth Stood Still" remains a cinematic landmark in terms of science fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be very careful what you wish for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really thought someone in Hollywood needed to do a remake of this movie, and that's not something I suggest lightly. Mainstream American movies are drowning in a shallow pool of unoriginality. The box office has been dominated for years by remakes and big screen adaptations of comic books and old TV shows. We see sequels to mediocre movies and sequels like Superman Returns and the new Indiana Jones that are coming out 20 years after the previous films. They spent a couple hundred million dollars doing a big screen version of Speed Racer, a 40 year old Japanese cartoon that most Americans have never even seen. That's how desperate and fixated Hollywood is on doing movies based on things that have worked before. But, The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of those rare works that deserves to be refashioned and reimagined for a new era and a new audience. It's because the story is still valid, it still speaks to essential elements of the human condition in a way that's not likely to be improved upon. It's especially because science fiction movies seem to have forgotten the initial point of the whole genre. The Day the Earth Stood Still tells the story of Klaatu, an alien who is bringing a great and terrible message to humanity. Coming in a single space ship and accompanied only by his 8 foot tall robot pal Gort, Klaatu lands in Washington D.C?.and promptly gets shot in the shoulder by a panicky U.S. soldier. While recovering in the hospital, Klaatu learns that the rest of the world can't put aside their fears and ambitions and resentments long enough to listen to his world-shaking message. So he escapes the hospital to get a closer look at humanity, settling in as a guest in an old fashioned boarding house. One of the best things about the film is that it demonstrates both the strengths and weaknesses of mankind, without amplifying them into exaggerated cartoons. Characters aren't portrayed as unrealistically good or irrationally fearful and selfish, yet the audience can clearly understand what Klaatu is both afraid and hopeful of in our planet. The Day the Earth Stood Still is largely remembered for its political and social daring. Making a movie in the early 1950s where the hero is an extraterrestrial standing in judgment of all Earth was pretty bold. Telling audiences that the solution to war and conflict isn't conquest or victory but submission of sovereignty, in the aftermath of World War II and the birth pangs of the Cold War, wasn't exactly following the tenor of the times. It's a provocative and thoughtful message that shouldn't be allowed to recede into history. Which is why The Day the Earth Stood Still should have been remade for modern audiences and freed from the burden of history. This movie reflects the rhythms of an American that was largely pre-television, let alone pre-internet. It was an American that was less cynical or less self-ware, depending on your perspective. I worry that kids growing up in today's America, where it seems they're not left alone with their own thoughts for 5 seconds at a time, simply won't tolerate the more measured and reflective tone of this film. That's the sort of remakes that Hollywood should be doing, ones that take great stories and make them palatable to new generations. Klaatu Barada Nikto aren't words that only 50 year old sci-fi geeks should understand.Of course, then they went and did a remake and I realize they should have left well enough alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film very effectively answers the question, "Why don't 'flying saucers' ever land in Washington, DC and ask to speak to the President?" Probably, they would if they had something to say? well, the alien in "The Day the Earth Stood Still" definitely has something to say... Silver-suited Michael Rennie (as Klaatu) lands in plain sight, and emerges from his spaceship in full view of everyone, along with his powerful robot companion "Gort" (Lock Martin). Although Mr. Rennie states, "We have come to visit you in peace," he oddly invites a trigger-happy American to shoot from the hip.Rennie is taken to the hospital, wounded. Then, he makes his demand. Rennie wants all of Earth's representatives to meet him for an important message. When that proves too daunting a task, Rennie escapes from watchful hospital eyes. To soak up local color, he takes the identity "L.M. Carpenter" and goes to live in a local boarding house. There, Rennie meets some typical Americans, including World War II widow Patricia Neal (as Helen Benson) and her Billy Gray (as Bobby). With young Gray's help, Rennie tries to arrange a meeting with brilliant Professor Sam Jaffe (as Jacob Barnhardt).Meanwhile, Ms. Neal's fiancé, Hugh Marlowe (Tom Stevens), becomes suspicious of Rennie. Although Rennie often seems powerful enough to deliver his message without all the problems he encounters, the suspense makes it a much more exciting film. It's also very cleverly written, by Edmund H. North, with an interesting mix of the obvious and the subtle; for example, "Carpenter" refers to "the almighty spirit" - but, when you expect Gray to kneel and pray, he pulls out a train set. Director Robert Wise, photographer Leo Tover, and especially soundtrack musician Bernard Herrmann really make it hum.********* The Day the Earth Stood Still (9/18/51) Robert Wise ~ Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Billy Gray, Sam Jaffe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gentleness of the Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the horrendous remake of this film, it made me go back to the original. This is a movie with a great message, and while it doesn't have all the bells and whistles, it has a human message. What makes it differ is that perhaps the response to power as significant as this first wave force may be tempered by a hesitation to destroy. Also, the aliens are benevolent and confident. Klatu is there to save the Earth and its people, not to make it a new central park for his future generations. Gort is an enforcer, but never acts unless provoked. It isn't that there is no cynicism in this film. Obviously, when threatened, the military types want to respond with carnage. Once it is established that this is of no use in a huge demonstration of power (done in the most "humanitarian" way. Michael Rennie has some personality, despite his bewilderment as a stranger in a strange land.. Patricia Neal is really caught in unfamiliar territory, but does a very good job in her role. This is an early treasure of the sci fi genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the 2008 remake of this title, partly because I wanted to make sure I had the original in my mind when I did, and it had been a long time since I had seen this. Considering the limitations it faced in 1951, it's a pretty decent sci-fi story. In the modern world, of course, sci-fi has become virtually synonymous with action-adventure and ridiculously costumed aliens and shoot 'em out gunfights (or laser fights, or phaser fights, or whatever.) There's really little of that here. This movie deals with story and characters rather than action, there are few ridiculous costumes (although Gort's make-up is really quite unconvincing as a robot, the scenes where his visor opens are quite effective in making him a threatening character) and aside from Klaatu being shot by us (ie, humans) the only thing remotely resembling gun fighting is some sort of laser beam Gort uses to disintegrate weapons. The story, to be honest, is pretty basic and to the point. Klaatu arrives to tell us that humanity is warlike and violent (now there's a shock) and that unless we stop it we'll be destroyed for the sake of the peace of the universe. The arrival of the aliens is problematic. Although it introduces excitement right off the top, we're told that Klaatu spent five months travelling 250 million miles to earth. If my math is right, then he could only have come from Mercury, Venus or Mars. Setting aside the fact that we now know that there's no intelligent life on any of those planets, taking five months to go 250 million miles is pretty slow, space travel-wise. With travel speeds like that, one wonders how there could be any sort of inter-planetary association the likes of which Klaatu speaks. In any event, the movie revolves around Klaatu's interactions with various humans. After being shot, he escapes from the hospital and adopts the identity of "Mr. Carpenter" - to learn more about human beings. My impression was that, while he developed some bonds (primarily with Bobby and his mother and with Professor Barnhart), he wasn't overly impressed with us, and the movie ends with an open-ended restatement of the message: "stop it, or else!"It's not quite the classic that it's made out by some to be, but it is a decent story, and a good reminder that science fiction doesn't have to have all the bells and whistles that we generally see now. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the 50s Sci-fi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of The Day the Earth Stood Still back 2 years ago, I thought it was a bad, cheap, cheesy "B" movie. But I decided to watch in AMC and I'm glad that I did. This movie revolutionized all Sci-Fi movies after it. Before 1951, Sci-Fi movies were pretty much mindless with the exception of Metropolis. But after this movie they started to have more meaning to them. This movie also was created around the time when UFO sightings were becoming rapidly increasing. So the movie came in the perfect time to fuel ideas of what the UFOs wanted or Aliens I guess. The title of this movie is great, I mean who would of thought of this title, only a genius! This was overall a very interesting, philosophical movie. I recommend everyone to see this film. It is highly influential and will stick to Cinema History for a very long time to come, possibly forever. I hope this film will not be forgetton, if it is, it would be a very sad day in Cinema indeed. Please go watch this movie, and then watch the remake of it. Which was a very bad remake because it didn't gave the same feeling as the original.10/10 To a Wonderful Classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still is still relevant in today's times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched director Robert Wise's debut, The Curse of the Cat People, I decided to rewatch his sci-fi classic, The Day the Earth Stood Still. Made during the Cold War, this drama about a space alien named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) trying to warn the entire planet Earth about the dangers of continued aggression against the enemy can still pack a wallop in terms of how we the people still haven't found a common ground of achieving lasting peace all around. In order to seem authentic concerning the way news was broadcast at the time, real newsmen like Drew Pearson and Elmer Davis make appearances. Incidentally, when Helen Benson's (Patricia Neal) elementary school age son, Bobby (Billy Gray), comes home from following Klaatu (who's posing under the alias of Mr. Carpenter) to his spaceship, and she doesn't believe him when he tells what he's seen, it reminded me of the scenes from TCOTCP where the young girl Amy is not believed by her father, Oliver. Other players like Hugh Marlowe as Mrs. Benson's initial boyfriend Tom Stevens and especially Sam Jaffe as Professor Jacob Barnhardt also make good impressions, performance-wise, in addition to the above cast I cited. And that Bernard Herrmann score being done with both higher and lower pitch theremins must have sounded really cool when first presented on cinema screens back in the early '50s! So on that note, The Day the Earth Stood Still comes highly recommended. Oh, and "Klaatu barada nikto"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As said before: Classic Sci-Fi with a Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I'll inevitably see the remake at some point too, I finally got around to watching THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951). By all means, a fine little classic Sci-Fi gem by a great director (Robert wise), carrying a message on the human condition that even in this day and age couldn't be more accurate. Amazing how the actuality of this film has not aged a single day since its release in 1951. In ways, this was a visionary film. Different things than which it speaks of are going on nowadays, but the message stays the same: Our human condition is a poor one. The inability of the human race to work together. The greed. The warmongering. The way we more easily manage to destroy things on this planet than we're able to save them. It's one of the few sci-fi films that, in a simple and effective way, makes sense: If peace-loving aliens (living in harmony with their planet) should see us acting the way we do down here, it makes perfect sense that they would fear the day we'd manage to stumble into outer space to see what all we could conquer, litter or blow out of the way.Consider this my two cents, as all else about this classic has already been said, far better, by others.Trivia for horror fans: Sam Raimi payed tribute to this film in ARMY OF DARKNESS by having Bruce Campbell try and remember the words... "Klaatu Barada Nikto".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day Sci Fi Got Moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Robert Wise directing, how can you go wrong? This original film is so superior to the crumby 2008 remake, that there is simply no comparison at all. Michael Rennie is superb as the extraterrestrial Klaatu. Patricia Neal is wonderful as the gal, and Hugh Marlowe is just as irritating as he is meant to be as the bothersome boy friend of Neal who is only interested in himself. Gort the frightening giant robot is superb, the best of all, and that was the only thing that worked in the remake, because they kept him with his visor eye slit that emits beams that kill (a bit like Cameron Diaz). The next time I want to intimidate someone I don't like, I am going to get my very own visor eye slit fitted. Must practice on the light beams, though. Well, this film is a bit preachy, but then it was the early 1950s when that sort of thing was expected of any film trying to be serious. Klaatu absolutely refuses to deal with the representatives of a single nation or even a selection of nations. For him it is the United Nations or nothing. Great globalist propaganda. The question as to why he landed on the White House lawn rather than in New York City in front of the United Nations building is swept aside. The film has plenty of pathetic soldiers with guns. It certainly is a standard motif of sci fi films coming out of America that you have to have panicky soldiers resolutely clutching their useless rifles, shooting the spacemen, revving up their tanks (before they get vaporized), the whole Pentagon thing. You simply cannot have an American sci fi film without nervous soldiers fingering their triggers, it just wouldn't be convincing, would it? The whole 'war on terror' might even be called into question, just think. This film is seriously intended, has a certain degree of profundity to it, albeit with great dollops of one-worldism thrown into the soup, to make it set. If you can wade through the messages and brush the forest of guns to one side, you have a really good story there, and it works on screen, justly being described as one of the classic sci fi movies of yesteryear. But what is wrong with now? Why can't they ever get remakes right anymore? In the old days, you could remake the 1937 'Glass Key' by Dash Hammett and even improve on it a lot only a few years later. But now, they couldn't remake a newsreel, they are so incompetent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In every sense of the word, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is Timeless: the Message is Eternal, the film-making flawless (as a whole, the "goofs" listed here on the IMDb notwithstanding). In terms of Entertainment Value alone, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL overshadows most of what came before and most of what has come since. It's one of those must-see movies that no serious fan of the genre (or of superior movie-making in general) can pass up. Michael Rennie set the standard for Extraterrestrial Emissaries (and may very well have inspired the stoic Spock on STAR TREK) and Robert Wise raised the bar for thoughtful Science Fiction films. (Although, of late, we've seen a sad degeneration to video-game stupid "sci-fi," THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the genre was a viable vehicle for the dissemination of speculative ideas.) There aren't very many movies regardless of genre that can stack up against THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. It remains a Timeless Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most important Science Fiction movies ever made. It is intelligent, and the fear factor is produced because one fully believes Klaatu, (Michael Rennie). It seems perfectly logical that someone who looks human would be sent to warn a world of impending doom with a all powerful robot as a 'body guard'. And the manner in which Klaatu 'proves' his power, (world wide electricity blackout) is so reasonable.This movie, as the previous commentator stated, opened my mind to possibilities and made me a life long sci-fi...(good sci-fi) fan for life.One has to view this movie in the context of the time it was made, what people understood, and not need the fx to tell a story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi that's still relevant today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a science fiction classic nearly sixty years old but still relevant today. The recent remake demonstrates this fact. In the film, an alien visits Earth delivering a warning and a message of peace. However, the paranoia and mistrust of the inhabitants of Earth threaten to spell the alien's doom along with their own.The film is undeniably a 'message' movie but it doesn't deliver the message heavy-handedly. Instead, the message is subtly presented to us throughout the film while the ending serves to reinforce the point. This way, the script doesn't get bogged down with a lot of exposition and is free to move on with the concerns of the plot.The cast isn't exactly outstanding, though it does include future Oscar winner Patricia Neal. Michael Rennie does a fine job of portraying the alien Klaatu but the rest of the cast is no better than average. Thankfully, the worst of the bit players are out of the way by the early stages of the film, which leaves the spotlight on the movie's more talented individuals.Two-time Best Director Robert Wise's direction is ably handled but I wouldn't cite it as one of the strengths of the film. Regarding the special effects, they're hardly convincing by today's standards but they are acceptable for the time period and they're only sparsely used anyways. Bernard Hermann's Golden Globe-nominated score is also worth mentioning, though it's difficult to judge it on it's own merits since it spawned scores of imitators.While the film is far from perfect in terms of acting and visuals I find that the compelling story more than makes up for any deficiencies. When combined with the film's depth and insight we have a mixture that results in a film that is justifiably lauded to this day.</fullReview>

The Plot, as most of you know, Is that an alien visitor named Klaatu( Micheal Rennie) lands on Earth demanding that the Earth ends its strange need for war, and excepts a new era of peace or be destroyed. The movie illustrates the insecurity of humans when we have come in contact with something unfamiliar to us. The movie couldn't be more original or touching in its way of showing the world that we need peace. The film also Illustrates that aliens might not be as fear-mongering as we expect them to be.

Although I'm sure that in 1951, it may have been perceived as so. But even still, this first version has a strong philosophical underlying that sets it far apart from other "space invader" movies.Robert Wise's direction was strong and subtle. He terrified us with a robot just standing there. Mr. Wise did this without the benefit of the unlimited amount of special visual effects that go into movies nowadays. "Now that's direction."Yes, and with the entertainment value there is a message, that is still profound today.I look forward to seeing the new version.

		<shortDescription>Slick science fiction from the early 1950's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still is a fine movie by any standards. I am not a science fiction fan but I liked it. Directed by Robert Wise and filmed in Washington D.C., the movie has a great sense of location and a perfect mood for the early cold war. Of course this type of movie is not meant to pass a reality check. We just appreciate it for what it is. Michael Rennie, as the alien Klaatu, is much like any other earthling in appearance, although he has supernatural powers and a life expectancy that is twice that of anyone else. He is a gentle being but his presence produces mass hysteria. He is accompanied by a robot, Gort, who is not gentle at all and instigates a flood of hysteria with a laser that melts weapons and tanks. Klaatu is sent to earth to bring an important message, which is apparently rejected, mainly because no one really pays any attention to it. The alien returns to space mortally wounded. This is the Jesus allegory.The paranoia that accompanies the arrival of the alien spaceship reflected the mass psychology of the day when people were building war shelters and fearing the next diplomatic gaffe that could lead to nuclear war. I liked the image of the family and friends gathered around the early television set getting reports on the alien landing. So reminiscent of the 50's.The columnist Drew Pearson has a role as a commentator. Billy Gray, a young television star in the 50's, plays Bobby Benson, the son of Patricia Neal. Sam Jaffe as Prof. Barnhardt, the epitome of the amiable scientist, is seen in a forerunner to his role in the Ben Casey TV Show. Patricia Neal is the widowed parent (Helen Benson) who is sympathetic to Klaatu and tries to help...but to no avail. People are in the grip of a frenzy of fear. Twice, soldiers gun him down because they fear the presence of an alien, without really knowing why. The distraction of the event itself gets in the way of the message that Klaatu brings to the world. It is from a higher intelligence and one gets the feeling that the world, full of distrust, is unable to respond with the wisdom needed to take a different course. But then, Gort didn't really help matters much, as he went around zapping the earthlings. All in all, good entertainment still and a glimpse into another era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the upcoming release of "The Day The Earth Stood Still" starring Keanu Reeves, a revisit to the classic Robert Wise film seemed like a good plan. This film is widely regarded as a classic and one of the best science fiction films of all time. No pressure there Neo. It's a film with a very simple but incredibly powerful and still very much relevant message. This world is falling apart and we need to straighten ourselves up and fix it. The film is about a spaceship that lands in the middle of Washington. A humanlike alien named Klaatu and his gigantic robot bodyguard, Gort, emerge from the craft with a message of peace for the entire planet. Michael Rennie portrays Klaatu as an optimistic, charismatic, Jesus like character that audiences are not used to seeing out of an alien. Gort is the "monster" of the movie and posses the power to destroy everything around him if necessary. His menacing presence is felt throughout the movie. The film was released in 1951. The Second World War was a not so distant memory and the cold war was building. The world was in need of a change and it was up to us as a human race to fix it. The films message was of hope and change and possibilities. Unfortunately over 50 years later, not much has changed. After escaping the hospital from the gunshot wound, Klaatu assumes the identity of a human named Mr. Carpenter. Carpenter is just one of the many Jesus references for Klaatu. He goes on to befriend a woman and her son while meeting with the very Einstein like Professor Barnhardt to devise a plan that would gather all of the worlds leaders so that he can deliver his climactic final message. The last scene to this day has all of the power and relevance it did over half a decade ago. Robert Wise crafted a film that stands out among the flock of science fiction films of the era. It's a movie with a strong message but never feels pretentious. From its powerful score, solid acting, and almost film noir cinematography, this is not an average alien/monster flick. The aliens are here to help us, not destroy us like every other movie of the time was about. It's entertaining and thought provoking. The world has only grown in turmoil since the release of "The Day The Earth Stood Still" in 1951. Perhaps the remake can spark our hopes again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remaking classics does not usually work very well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1954, we were climbing under out desks in nuclear attack drills. It seemed rather silly since we knew full well what a nuclear blast would do to our city. More silly considering I lived in a small rural town in northern Arizona. I never figured the Russians would waste a nuke on it.The movie came out and was an instant hit and as it turned out, a classic. As kids, we absolutely loved it and at that time we thought 250 million miles was a long ways. It would take several more years of astrological study to give us the real distances we are used to toady.Numerous movies at that time referred to aliens traveling short distances by today's standards, but what seemed long at time. I remember the leading actor in one movie astounding us with the fact the alien had come from a million miles away. In retrospect, I don't know why we were impressed, because even then, we knew the sun was 93 million miles distant.I am a bit apprehensive about the upcoming remake. Remaking classics generally does not work well. The best case in point I can think of right now is the remake of War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise. It did not hold a candle to the original with Gene Barry. That was truly suspenseful and featured alien craft far more imposing than the three legged camera tripods used in the remake.How do you, in color, make a robot as imposing as Gort was in black and white? I don't think it's possible. The robot has to be a true force of nature and I don't know how they can create that today and in color and not have it coming of so hokey we laugh at it. I will reserve final judgement however, until I see it. I will see it with anticipation, but also with great trepidation.</fullReview>

Seriously, this was an excellent film that promoted peace and understanding among all nations by attempting to demonstrate the common good and the need for international cooperation. Unfortunately, we have still failed to heed the warning over 50 years later and still act like Tom Stevens (Hugh Marlowe), concerned for our own self-interest.Oscar winner Patricia Neal (Hud, The Subject Was Roses) gave a powerful performance as Bobby's mother and a "real" secretary.If you haven't seen it, you should just to hear the final message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Occasionally hokey but ultimately as powerful today as when it was originally released</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Day the Earth Stood Still" was acclaimed as a masterpiece when originally released. At the peak of the arms race and right before the red scare really began to take its toll, its message of pacifism and communication between opposing nations was quite refreshing and surprising. The film is a bit dated understandably, often wallowing in the "gee-whiz" style of the day and occasional bits of nationalism. Still, the final message is just as powerful today as when originally released. The film ultimately remains shockingly relevant. Its further proof that many so called genre films of the era were amazingly intelligent - "The Incredible Shrinking Man" powerfully touches upon what it means to be human, "Forbidden Planet" is a literate adaptation of Shakespeare, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is a powerful representation of mass paranoia, and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" has a more powerful anti-war leaning than anything else in its day.The film is very well made in addition to being a powerful experience. Robert Wise isn't a great visionary director, but hes good at storytelling and maintaining an effective pace. Also, the acting is very good, particularly Michael Rennie in the lead role. His performance is one of great elegance, grace, and subtlety. Its really a shame he wasn't able to capitalize on his promise and become a more renowned actor, because hes really terrific here. The supporting cast is quite good as well, particularly the always excellent Sam Jaffe. "The Day the Earth Stood Still" has a few dated elements, but overall its still a powerful experience.

		<shortDescription>Farewell to the Master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just read Harry Bate's excellent short story "Farewell to the Master" I was surprised how many of the original story elements were transferred to the movie "The Day the Earth Stood Still" Actually, what we have here is an example of one great story causing a new story to come into being. These things were transferred into the new story: The Giant Robot in the story named Gnut, not Gort, that seems to stand totally still; The scene where Klaatu (the only name from the story that gets transferred into the film) greets a gathering of earthlings and is shot; A "Space" Ship that has no obvious entrance which exudes a Ramp, and the most famous image from The Day The Earth Stood Still: The Giant Robot encased in a block of clear plastic, this image was taken straight from the story. One last item that trickles into the film, is Gnut/Gort's ability to bring creatures "apparently" back to life for a limited time.The film version of this story of course had to be UFOised, it had to be changed to meet the Flying Saucer/UFO mania of the late 40's to mid 50's.Robert Wise was able to work within these bounds to create one of the most magnificent films ever made: Edmond North created a script that was short, to the point, and brought it's message (Which differed from the original short story) home in 92 minutes running time: Almost too short.But what this film lacks in running time it makes up for in scope, and the special effects created in 1951 broke ground for such as Star Trek 15 years later.Michael Rennie was the best actor to be used to flesh out the character of Klaatu, who we do not get to know so much about in the Harry Bates story. North created a character where none existed, actually he recreated the whole story around Gort and Klaatu and poured a lot of the original story elements into the screenplay in as many places as they could be used.And of course the use of Patricia Neal gives the whole story an added dimension, Neal who sees in Rennie a possible father figure for her son, and the jealousy and obsessive behavior of Hugh Marlowe causes the tension in the story which ultimately leads to the catastrophe that propels the final act of the film.We get to see Rennie bandy pseudo-scientific talk with Sam Jaffe (Gunga Din) and that dialogue is the 1951 equivalent of technical jargon used in Star Trek: The Next Generation, which was always interesting and part of the storyline. Some of this technical dialogue works its way into the relationship between Rennie and Neal's son Billy Gray, and is made light of by an onlooker, which brings realism and humour into the story.In the ending of this film, Rennie almost, but not quite, gives the film version almost the same ending as the Bates short story... Of the two, Klaatu and Gort, which one is really Master, and which one is really servant? Reading the short story this film is based upon will give any fan of the film a better understanding of Robert Wise' excellent rendition of it.</fullReview>

If you like Science fiction movie like me, see this kind of movie instead of viewing new crappy stuff with digital image and incredible story. The story of who came to earth to urge us to stop our destructive attitude right now is quit credible in 1951 and so it is now in 2007. We never stops us to want power and destroy other to get it. It,s been like since the old times. And the reaction of the humans of the earth in this movie are sharp as razorblades. Humans are always been scared of anything they don't know or anyone they don't know, and it,s very exposed in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just bought the restored DVD version of this with the excellent commentary. This is a fantastic film, superb script, excellently acted, great music and for the times remarkable special effects. It is a complete antidote to the "bug hunt" style film that Hollywood pumps out in the sci-fi genre at the moment. Films that show Monsters who are hell bent on destroying Earth. In this movie we are the monsters and the visiting life form is intelligent and compassionate. Admittedly it brings with it a very big stick with which to beat us if we continue on our war mongering ways, but the message is clear and unambivalent. I am looking forward with heightened interest to the remake. Will the message survive or will it be diluted or even excised completely?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Wise has got to be one of the top five directors of our time ,with the exception of Star TREK: THE Motion Picture , his movies have made us laugh , cry , sing , and dance and even smile when we left the theater .And The Day the Earth Stood Still , next to West Side Story , is one of his bests , actors were great , the story was out of this world . Even the ending was up there with the ending of West Side Story , when Natalie Wood grabbed the gun from Chino and said ,'' looking at Tony's body and then at the two gang members ,'' It wasn't guns or knives that killed Tony ,Riff and her brother , it was hate . Same message could be seen in The Day the Earth Stood Still , when he tells everyone before leaving that nuclear weapons if not use right or correctly could destroy or kill . Two of the best films of our era , directed by one of the greatest directors of our time .I love movies but I love movies that entertain as well as can teach us also .Rkallao@aol.comp.s. hope the new Day the Earth Stood Still movie in 2008 can live up to the original , probably not , but good luck ; piece of warning , DO NOT REMAKE West Side Story , like One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest , Gone With the Wind , Empire Strikes Back and even Star Trek : The Wrath of Khan , these movies should be not touch in any way , or remade , West Side Story was a gem of a movie ; a rare find , if Hollywood tries to do a remake , I'll be really let down . Never , Never touched West Side Story . You do not have the stars today that could even match the stars back then like Russ Tamblyn , Natelie , Rita Moreno, the actors who played Tony , Ice and Baby John ; one of a kind movie starred one of a kind cast :) Your remakes haven't done too well of recent years and good luck with reimagining Star Trek .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie for the first time and was really caught up in the filming, process and style. Many talk about the symbolism in the movie but I see a bit of trivia that others seemed to have missed. Either here or on Wikipedia.The film is about flying saucers and interplanetary craft (and the message that the aliens(s) bring). The main character, an alien, whose name is 'Klaatu', later adopts the Earthly name 'Carpenter'. Some years later a song by the name of 'Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft' was released in 1976 by a group called Klaatu. Several years later the same song was redone by the Carpenters tying the two names back to this famous motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The interest in Outer Space, Space Travel, Intelligent Life of other Planets and their relationship to us, Earth-bound little pesty gnats (in relation to the Cosmos)has long been a subject for discussion, literature and film. Science fiction stories by the likes of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, H.P. Lovecraft have been a staple of our literary entertainment. In the movies,we have had Spaceships and Space Travel from the earliest movie days* down to the Serial Adaptations of the likes of BUCK ROGERS, FLASH GORDON and BRICK BRADFORD.It was not until the 1950's that the theme of Earth being visited or even invaded or conquered by Martians or some other Planet became the popular subject for the Sci-Fi Films. The H.G. Wells novel THE WAR of THE WORLDS (1898) certainly was out there and adapted to popular entertainment, most notably of course with Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre of The Air Radio Production of 1938.So,it is true irony that the very best of these "Contact with Alien Beings" movies should come out in the first year of those 'fabulous '50's'. Just 6 short years after the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II that we witnessed the ascent of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL to the very pinnacle of the 'Spacemen' films.We are treated to a multi-sensual feast in the opening sequence of the movie. As the opening credits roll over a view of starry heavens, we become aware that the view is that of the Visitor coming to Earth. The principle of "the Subjective Camera" is put to good use, especially when the viewer isn't aware, having been powerfully drawn into the story already.As the spacecraft approaches the Earth, starting to orbit in slowing down for entry into our atmosphere we are shown short clips of the peoples of the whole world, all listening to news of the approaching extra-terrestrial craft. Military Radar is shown tracking and measuring the speed of the space craft. A Television Newscast with well-known Newspaper Columnist, Drew Pearson is shown and adds to the realistic effect being unveiled before the by now mesmerized audience.We are witness to the landing of the spacecraft in a Washington, D.C. park, smack dab in the middle of some baseball field, with its 3 or 4 Diamonds clearly visible in the scene showing the descent of the space craft. (Hmmmmm, could there be some symbolism at work here?) Needless to say the Capitol's Police and The U.S. Army are mobilized and have completely encircled the craft. After the longest time, the Pilot and Sole living passenger, emerges from the Craft. Starting off with a formal greeting to all peoples of Earth, the space man winds up in custody of the Federal Boys. Giving his name as Klatuu, he says that he wants the G Men to set up a meeting with all of the World's Leaders; an event of strongly unlikely occurrence, as it was explained to him.The bulk of the story follows Klatuu, trying his best to get through to the Earth's 'Brass' and having the great meeting. We aren't going to go into that. You should experience it for yourself, if you have not done so already.This Cinamatic Gem seems to be timeless, and is as fresh when viewed today as it was at the time of original showing in the Movie Houses of 1951. It truly boasts of having hit the high marks in just about every category that we can think of. Starting with Director, one Mr. Robert Wise, who over his long career managed to make some of the best films in just about every category. War, Biopic, Musical, Western and Sci-Fi.The B &amp; W film looks really good and puts one's mind on newspaper and other archival collections of photographs. This subtly, even subconsciously adds to the realism. Executing the shooting on locations right in the District of Columbia made for a look that could not be achieved on a Studio sound-stage.Michael Rennie heads up a great cast. He presents us with a very intelligent and kind person, a far cry from some of the disgusting creations of other Hollywood creations. Patricia Neal, strong but still beautiful and feminine, has the female lead. Sam Jaffe gives his best as Professor Barnhardt. Hugh Marlowe, a young Billy Gray ("Bud" on FATHER KNOWS BEST) and 'Aunt Bea' herself, Frances Bavier, round out the principal players. The previously mentioned Drew Pearson is joined by well known newsmen Elmer Davis, H.V. Kaltenborn and Gabriel Heatter, all getting their time before the movie camera.To all of these above we add a really large cast of players doing a fine job, though going 'uncredited' in the end. Oh yeah, let us not forget Lock Martin as Gort.This picture definitely brings us a message of the need for World Peace. My only message calls for you to go and see this Movie again. Of course I can't compel you to do so, for I don't have Gort to enforce any edict as Klatuu did! * Just take a look at Frenchman Georges Melies' film A VOYAGE TO THE MOON (1902) to see what we're talking about.</fullReview>

Scream in mindless horror when his "Pandora's door to death" visor slides open like liquid mercury and begins its irrevocable blinking count-down scan of her helpless form. Frantically yell out Klaatu's three secret code words that she must summon through the fog of her terror-seized brain or be incinerated by Gort. Never forget them. Burn them into your brain and train your tongue to repeat them with absolutely perfect diction in a loud, clear voice or the earth will be obliterated like a fly flung into the sun.However, how was the 10 foot tall lumbering silver robot, Gort, able to walk undetected through the streets to rescue his injured pal in jail and then return him to the saucer without so much as a pea-shooter being raised against him? Never mind?..just look on with jaw-dropping awe as the saucer's ramp silently telescopes back into the ship. Run like the wind before its glowing gale of magnetic winds snatches you into the air like a scrap of paper in a hurricane.Did you get that final ominous speech? Will your pitiful thoughts and insignificant life ever be coherent again? Will your puny world heed the message of warning or suffer a REPEAT visit from Gort?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Klaatu Barada Nikto?The Day the Earth Stood Still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one thinks of classic films from an age long gone, The Day the Earth Stood Still is one to be included. Just the fact that the movie was made in 1951 and has some nice special effects and intellectual underlying themes, which are still relevant today, makes it something of a phenomenon. Here is a story about worldwide paranoia and a deep-seeded fear of anything not human or of Earth. It is a very important question of how we would react to beings from another world coming to ours. We would like to think we could be accommodating and open-minded to a friendly visitor, but I believe we would most definitely shoot first and ask questions later. The most successful part of this film is the fact that it walks that very fine line with believability. While initially frightened and trigger happy, the US does allow its visitor hospitalization and a voice to explain his motives. However, it is all done with their own interests at hand. They will not let the man walk freely, and while quick to push him away, they call him a menace and danger when he finally escapes their corrupt clutches.The way in which the government is treated, as opposed to the genius minds of scientists, men willing to look beyond the surface and understand what is truly happening, is a great commentary on politics today. Those meant to protect may be too close-minded to truly see all angles of an intruder, they must fear the worst in order to be ready for it. On the other hand, scientists can see a problem and work it out to all of its ends. They are looking for answers and are willing to except everything as long as it makes logical sense. Klaatu understands that although these geniuses are his only means of communicating to the world, they are also looked upon as crackpots until they are proved wrong. It is not up to him to rectify this problem, though, he has been sent with a warning, whether the people heed it, or decide to not believe until it is too late, does not really concern him. Space's race of policeman robots does not think past right and wrong. If his own people did wrong they too would be destroyed, thus he can't think about the good Earth can do, only the bad they are capable of. A warning is the best he can do, and it is up to us to live in peace or risk utter destruction.This is all a thinly veiled commentary on war and internal annihilation by having an alien come and tell us to get along with each other as they have. Once the universe has a common law and destructive force as punishment, no one has a choice but to live in harmony. While this message is fantastic in the film, and great insight post bombing of Hiroshima (the Atom bomb our own looming Gort), it is the one thing I worry about in a planned remake for 2008. I can see the film being turned into commentary on the Iraq war and as a result losing its universal message. Besides that, though, I still don't think a remake is necessary because it is all done so effectively the first time.The Day the Earth Stood Still contains a wonderful script and moving performances to help it succeed. All Klaatu wishes to do is tell the world about the danger of bringing its destructive forces to the universe and then leave knowing he tried to help. Instead he is imprisoned by a government wanting him to be used as a pawn against their enemies, just like those would do against them. Each country is unwilling to put differences aside and Klaatu needs to take matters into his own hands. He goes amongst Earthlings and discovers that amidst the evil and corruption are people willing to work for good and understand the high stakes before them. He ultimately decides to put his own life at risk in order to hopefully save this world for those who deserve to live.Michael Rennie brilliantly portrays Klaatu with a sense of authority and power, but also a sly smile of enjoyment at times like a child running free in a toy store. Although highly intelligent, his lack of knowledge lends for some nice little moments with young Bobby and Mrs. Benson. Patricia Neal plays Helen Benson as a strong-minded female character with the moral scruples to honor the life of her late husband, who fought for his country, and help Klaatu despite the delusions of wealth and grandeur that her boyfriend has in turning the alien into authorities. One could say that Helen Benson is as strongly portrayed a patriot as you can have, without being involved in war or fighting itself. It is her bravery and gumption that will hopefully save the world before gunfire can even begin.Sure, some of the special effects come off as cheap and cheesy, but for its time one cannot complain. Gort, the robot, is made of the strongest metal ever seen; yet his limbs bend to show the foam rubber that he is truly made of. One can look beyond this, though, and accept him for what he is. Some stuff is very impressive to counteract that small glitch. The use of stop-motion to show Gort's power of destroying guns is fantastic. Each cut is seamless as his ray illuminates its target and then makes it disappear?an unfathomable trick that is more successful here than some new movies utilizing computers. Also, the spaceship is successful at being of another world and time. The way it opens is slick and its interior high-tech looking just by its use of light sensors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie isn't about some foam robot, it's about Patricia Neal!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>30 years before Steven Spielberg made E.T., Patricia Neal originated the archetype of a single mother who discovers her son is spending too much time with an alien. "Sci-fi Mom" can be found in the retro animated Iron Giant, and also in Spielberg's classic masterpiece Close Encounters of the Third Kind. What's the pattern here? Are fatherless boys more likely to attract aliens because they look for a father in every stranger?? Perhaps over mothering has left the boys gullible and needy, susceptible to the influence of dominating spacemen?. Maybe it's just because if left unsupervised, boys will get into all kinds of trouble?. Ugh, what's a single mom to do! Although an undisputed classic, The Day the Earth Stood Still is extremely dated. It was made in the paranoid Eisenhower-era of wise old scientists and panic-stricken people, when a messianic alien named Klaatu lands in Washington DC (the center of the universe in 1951) with his robot enforcer Gort. Klaatu (née Mr. Carpenter, née Jesus the Christ) delivers a message of universal peace ? OR ELSE! He explains that the worlds he represents haven't so much solved their differences as made violence illegal, enforced by a race of Gorts who will immediately destroy any aggressor. His peace message is actually a warning: Kill each other all you want here on Earth, but if your wars spread to other worlds the Gorts will get you.The script is at times either naive or ridiculous: although parked in the nation's capital, the flying saucer is guarded by only two solders and a wooden fence. The Gort which had previously melted a tank with his eye-ray is shellacked in a plastic cube which doesn't hold him. A meeting of benign and selfless scientists is called to disseminate the alien message, but a trigger-happy military shoots unarmed Klaatu not only once but twice, finally killing him so Klaatu can be resurrected to more convincingly deliver his doomsday ultimatum. Earth will be judged by a higher authority?.The reason this early '50s artifact is still praised is that it is barely sci-fi at all. Instead the film plays as a taught espionage thriller with long wordless sequences where Billy follows Klaatu to the spaceship, and later when Helen watches Gort bring Klaatu back to life. Solid directing by Robert Wise, noir-ish lighting and camera-work, and an ethereal theremin soundtrack by Bernhard Herrmann add gravity to what otherwise would have been a laughable display of alien power. When the Earth stands still, the result of selectively interrupting electricity for 30 minutes at noon (a noon that is apparently happening all around the Earth simultaneously as Moscow is frozen in midday as well?), we see a montage of soda fountain malts that can't be served, cows that can't be machine-milked, and unsuccessful phone calls to complain about the power outage. Ohh, the horrors?.There are really only three sci-fi elements in the film but they are all good: Gort whose stoic silence and deathray make him cool despite being puffy foam and mitten-handed, the seamless flying saucer that dramatically splits down the center to open, and the saucer's interior: a sophisticated executive office of louvered glass and mood-lighting that encloses the ubiquitous Lucite? control panels in an uncluttered rotunda.But the real attraction is Patricia Neal as the single mother with hard choices and few options. Six years after WW2 how many war widows were in the same position, living at a boarding house and supporting a family on their own? She works in an office, but with the return of solders women were expected to get married and give up their jobs to the men. Her personal life is subjected to gossip from the elder boarders whom she must rely on to help care for her son. She has an opportunistic fiancé who wants to get married quickly to boost his options for a raise?.In a story that combines menacing robots with Old Testament retribution, and pits evangelical scientists against a suspicious shoot-first military, it's ironic that Sci-fi Mom is the only compelling character. This underestimated woman who helps an alien escape, witnesses his resurrection, and confronts Gort is completely under the authorities radar, and she is free to simply walk away after cradling the wounded and dying Klaatu.Patricia Neal assumed the film would be forgotten, just another in a string of trashy flying saucer films of the day, but her performance raises it to an unexpected drama. The script is simplistic anti-war propaganda, but she alway seems to be playing several emotional levels at once, navigating her own suspicions while carefully speaking only in polite protocol. She's even convincing as a mother. She is moral, strong, and intelligent in a genre that often dismissed women as hysterical decor.</fullReview>

Where do we draw the line in the sand. Aggression will no doubt be checked at some point. The human race is in its infancy but aging quickly. The director is allowing this tale to be told from the heart. Forget FX. There is little need for it if the film has special meaning.

		<fullReview>I give this movie a 9 out of 10 because it's a bit dated in some of its scenes. But it still holds for me the magic it had when I was a boy because it hinted at wonderful mysteries you could "just almost" get hold of, as if I could find out secret knowledge if I just paid attention to what they were saying or doing. Gnosticism was alive and well in the 50s.For example, the formula Klaatu writes on the blackboard. The heck with the stupid math questions my teacher wanted solved, THIS was something to stick your teeth into. Or the way Gort brings Klaatu back to life. Or Klaatu-speak. "Klaatu barada nikto." Way before the first Klingon dictionary, I and I'm sure other boys my age, were trying to crack the code in case we ever ran into a giant robot of our own. But best of all was seeing the inside of a spaceship. "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" had its ending remade specifically because of this same sense of wonder, a peek inside and at the creatures is what every boy dreams of. This is what makes the ending of the original "War of the Worlds" so powerful as well. Nothing can replace that door sliding open and that sizzling, slithering, suction-cup hand coming out. Was I the only one who cocked my head trying to see further up into the ship? A great flight of fancy and a fancy flight of fun for any child of any age who has ever stared at the stars and wondered about the other beings made by the "Almighty Spirit."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie was first released, I was a teenager and the movie theaters were having a field day with science fiction and especially outer space movies. There are two movies at this time that I really like, "The Day The Earth Stood Still" and "This Planet Earth", but why do I like "Stood Still"? Well, no one really knew what the writer was writing about until many years later! If you notice; Klatoo comes from heaven to teach the world to love one another and if they don't that their world will be reduced to a cinder. After escaping from the hospital, Klatoo takes on the name of Mr. "Carpenter"? Then he meets a woman who has a young male-child who is almost ready to marry a man who turns out to be power-hungry; a sort of "Judas" type person. Next he proves to be quite a miracle worker when the earth stands still. Helens boyfriend turns to Judas, then Klatoo is killed and Gort, the God-Force, brings Klatoo back to life.Klatoo finally give his message after he's been resurrected and he ascends back to heaven from whence He came! I think that it is no secret, now, that what the writer did was loosely base the movie on the life of Jesus Christ. This was innovative, but only a few has seen this, even today, and the movies message is more powerful and needed today. It's almost as if the movie has become very prophetic, but it's funny how a movie has become famous through the years by people playing trivia games asking "What did Klatoo tell Patricia Neal to tell Gort is anything happened to him." Many bets were made with this question and many bets were won! Anyway, what the film is saying, if we take our violence into the planetary system, we will eventually be destroyed, but if we learn the value of love and peaceful living - the Universe is ours! This is a great movie for all to see. We have a valuable lesson to learn from it. Unfortunately, you can lead a horse to water, but - - - - -</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've loved this movie since I was a kid in the 60's. It was one of the first classic sci-F's that had an anti-war message coming at the height of Cold War paranoia. Although, the message itself boils down to the bigger bully theory -- do as we tell you to or we'll destroy you -- and for the America of today that would probably only be taken as a challenge, "Bring 'em on!" Still, the characters are memorable and with the possible exception of "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..." at the beginning of "Star Wars," the line "Gort! Klaatu, Berada, Nikto," is easily one of the most famous lines in sci-F moviedom. Given the current tensions of the world, isn't it time for a sequel? I've got an idea for one but don't know who holds the rights to the original that I could talk to. Does anybody out there know?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) More of a anti-war then a sci-fi movie "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is also a lot like the very maligned and laughed at, considered by many to be the worst movie ever made, the Ed Wood epic "Plan Nine from Outer Space". In that it more or less has the same storyline about aliens coming from deep space in order to not only prevent the people of earth from killing themselves in a nuclear holocaust but also from destroying their intergalactic neighbors as well. It's also interesting to note that the two films began and ended the 1950's. "The Day the Earth Stood still" in 1951 and "Plan Nine from Outer Sapace" in 1959.Traveling hundreds of millions of miles in space a giant spaceship lands right in the middle of Washington D.C as a shocked and terrified nation, and world looks on. Emerging from the spaceship is Klaatu, Michael Rennie, who after announcing himself offers a gift from his planet to the President of the United States. Frightened at Klaatu's gesture a soldier, one of the hundreds surrounding the spaceship, opens fire hitting and wounding Klaatu. This brings out Klaatu's partner an eight-foot tall menacing looking robot Gort, Lock Martin. Gort with some kind of killer ray, shooting out of his helmet, almost destroys the entire city until Klaatu, wounded but still conscious, orders him to stop.Taken to Walter Reed Army Hospital Klaatu tells those in the military and government who are, what seems like, debriefing him that he's here on a mission of peace. Klaatu wants all the leaders of earth to assemble in one place, like the UN, where he can give the massage he has for them: Disarm and desist from war or else his planet, as well as the other planets in his confederation, would have to do the job of disarming the nations of earth themselves with disastrous results.Not getting any results from those he talks to Klaatu escapes from the hospital and take on the name of Carpenter and finds a place to stay at a rooming house run by WWII widow Helen Benson, Patricia Neal, and her 12 year-old son Bobby, Billy Gray. As the entire nation has an all out police and military dragnet looking for Klaatu he, now the very human charming and likable Mr. Carpenter, goes about the city with little Billy sightseeing. Klaatu even exposes himself, that he's as the man who everyone wants to behind bars or dead, by going to see the Albrt Einstein like Prof. Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe) who's considered to be the smartest man in the world according to Billy. Breaking and entering into the professor's home Carpenter/Klaatu corrects and completes a complicated physics equation that the professor has been working on, and stymied at every turn, for months.It now becomes evident to the genius Prof. Barnhardt that Klaatu, or Mr. Carpenter, is the man from space that the entire country is looking for. It's later when Klaatu talks to him Prof. Barnhardt is startled at Klaatu's suggestion, more like a demand, of him getting all the top scientists and philosophers on earth to tell their governments his important massage: The immediate peace and disarmament of their nations or else face total destruction.Being made at the hight of The Cold, and Korean, War it's a miracle that the film " The Day the Earth Stood Still" was not only released but seemed to have both US Governments and military approval as well as participation in it. It's also ironic that a year after the films release, in late July 1952, there was an actual invasion of UFO's that penetrated Washington D.C airspace the most sensitive and heavily defended on earth. As it was later found out due to top secret documents released through The Freedom of Inmformaton Act this UFO invasion almost triggered a Third World War! With the top leaders of the US Government ,from President Truman on down, thinking it was an invasion from the USSR.Shot again by US military personnel as he and Helen tried to evade the dragnet out to get him Klaatu tells Helen before he expired to go back to the spaceship and give Gort this Very important massage: "Klaatu Berada Nikto", meaning as far as I could figure out "Klaatu says cool it" in space talk. That message to Gort will prevent the indestructible giant from doing a number not only on the US Capital but the entire planet.Helen getting Gort to desist from destroying the city, with Klaatu massage, he then goes back to the prison when Klaatu's body is. After breaking in Gort takes Klaatu back to the spaceship when he had taken Helen earlier. Through some kind of intense electoral jolt that Gort preforms of his dead body he brings Klaatu miraculously back to life.The movie ends with Klaatu speaking to Prof. Bernhardt and an assembly of top scientists from all over the world. In his speech Klaatu tells them that if they can't keep their governments from making bigger and more destructive nuclear weapons, that will not only destroy their planet but the entire universe as well, an army of intergalactic policemen, like Gort, will be sent out to stop them with unimaginable and total destruction. Undoubtedly one of the best through-provoking and most of all effective sci-fi movies ever made. Not just because of it's special effects but it's massage from the Spaceman Klaatu. A massage that makes it as clear as crystal to anyone who hears it: if we can't learn to live together with our neighbors, despite our differences in politics religion and culture, we in the final analysis won't be able to live at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a timely, fun science fiction film from 1951 directed by Robert Wise. It has a great cast: Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe, Billy Gray, Sam Jaffe, Lock Martin, and Frances Bavier. It concerns the aliens Klaatu and Gort (a 7'7" actor discovered working as a doorman at Graumann's Chinese Theater) who come to earth to talk to world leaders about their acquisition of atomic power and what it may mean to other planets. Klaatu is met with violence and distrust, but eludes his captors. He is helped by a woman (Patricia Neal) and her young son (Billy Gray) who live in the rooming house where Klaatu is hiding under the name of Mr. Carpenter.This classic movie has few special effects - certainly nothing like we would see today. It's a very simple story told in a straightforward way, but it remains timely as countries perceived as our enemies acquire not atomic power but nuclear power. Klaatu wants the world to live in peace and respect. Though it hasn't happened and probably isn't going to, it's still a worthwhile goal and is why the film remains on favorite lists.Klaatu barada nikto!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the truly great sci-fiction films and modern film directors should pay heed to Robert Wise's masterful touches. From the dramatic opening to the sermon at the end, it is compelling viewing. That true British gent , Michael Rennie was the perfect man for Klaatu and the underrated Patricia Neal( remember her Oscar role in Hud?), wife of Roald Dahl was superb as the leading lady. There are messages and lessons to be learned nowadays from this classic- and it just goes to show that even if the film is bereft of fantastic special effects ( like STAR WARS etc)it still compels the viewer to imagine hard. The flying saucer sequence at the beginning does looks realistic on landing in the park. Definitely in my top 3 sci fi films of all time with ALIENS and APOLLO 13 but i shall not disclose my number 1 ! Klaatu barada nikto!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie,considering we had just ended World War II a couple of years before. The timing could not have been better. When Michael Rennie comes down in his space craft, and tells the world that now that you have crated a new atomic energy !, Earth must now be watch, so they may not threaten other planets. This movie in my eyes, sets the tone how other movies of this type may be judged. It is a movie classic i believe, that will outlast all the others, even the ones of today. Robert Wise obviously saw what lies ahead in the future. I believe Mr. Wise eventually worked on the set of a Star Trek movie later, his experience or ideas were respected enough to be consulted. Even hough young adults would not appreciate this classic, but they must understand history plays an important part of the future. when i saw this movie as a young child, it was scary and believable. Patricia O'Neal did not think this movie would go very far, until after she saw the response form the audience. This movie will always be a ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given the primitive state of special effects when the movie was produced, the footage of the ship in flight is acceptable, and the ship's design in closer shots (the dull silver finish, retractable ramps, etc.) is elegant. Of special note, however, are Klaatu's quarters, which reach back to the Bauhaus and forward to contemporary interior design. It's not hard to imagine them appearing as a "neo-classicist" style option for ships designed over the next thousand years or so. Klaatu himself is a "perfect design" - the human form with a human intellect and a warm sense of humor, whose only impediment to diplomacy is the abysmal intelligence of the human race with whom he is required to deal. Gort is less successful, particularly when he is walking, but certainly impressive when he comes to rest!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard of this movie when I saw its soundtrack listed as one of the most classic original scores of all time. It sure is. The music is incredible. And so are he visual effects. And the movie itself.An alien (apparently an actual human from another planet similar to Earth) arrives to Earth with his big robot Gort and land in Wahington. After being shot at during his arrival, the alien, Klaatu, is taken to a hospital. He then escapes and joins a group of people renting rooms at an old lady's house. He then contacts a professor of some sort (presumably a professor of physics) and arranges for a meeting with scientist from around the world. He delivers his message to them. He states that Earth will be destroyed if the human race will threaten the universe with atom bombs. He leaves. The End.It is a very simple story, but it hides a big message that is still very important. Let's say that Earth in the movies is the United States and the universe would be the rest of the world. Americans will destroy everything if they start attacking somebody else. No one cares if they shoot each other in their backyards, but leave everybody else alone.This could of course be applied to any other state, USA is just the obvious choice for an example.In times like these, with Iran developing nuclear warheads, China on the rise, and terrorism everywhere, we could easily destroy the whole planet. So leaders of countries, watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of us know the plot of this film, upon which I will not dwell here. This brilliant "message" sci-fi from the paranoid 50s provides us all with a challenge and ideas that are as timely now as they were when Klaatu uttered his first lines from the ramp of his space ship.Perhaps a little slow for today's youth, this brilliantly acted, photographed and scripted film has enjoyed enduring popularity over the years. Michael Rennie, in one of his first Hollywood films, played the part of the alien lead with a conviction and authority that made this story very believable at a time when people regarded sci-fi as very "off beat".The soundtrack by the venerable Bernard Herrmann is eerie and very "other=worldy". At the time it was one of the first film soundtracks to employ an electronic instrument...the theremin. The music themes have become, perhaps, the most enduring passages of music ever written for a science fiction film . Surely this soundtrack gained Herrmann carte blanche in his introduction to Alfred Hitchcock, who would go on to use this composer for many of his early Hollywood classics.The DVD comprises a few newsreel extras as well as comparison outtakes of enhanced/unenhanced video clips. The visual quality is excellent, thanks to the wonderful recent restoration. A must-see classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched the movie for the first time tonight 5/11/06 on AMC, and the fact that my brother and I enjoyed it as much as we did attests to how it is able to stand the test of time. I hardly noticed that it is a black and white movie as the plot was constantly advancing. It presents a philosophical question that it is as true today as when the movie was first produced. If only modern-day leaders were open to its message, perhaps this world would be a safer if not better place. Sure it lacked the special affects present in the action-packed space thrillers of today; its presentation is unique and well-crafted. I have seen the new Star Wars that is filled with countless digital images, but they lack the dialogue. This film is able to paint a picture with words if not always with the most realistic images. Yet what truly makes a movie is the talent to keep the viewer entertained and absorbed, as a way to escape the drudgery of the world around him or her. This film is exceptional in its ability to command attention in an era when we are constantly seeking the fast or easy way. When I could have easily continued my search past the old black and white movie, I stopped and stayed on the channel to the end. It is my hope that anyone who has not seen this film, rent it, and if nothing else leave it with new ideas surrounding the world around us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film has a vital message that it is still not too late to understand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen this film for the first time and am bowled over by the relevance, insight and power of its message, and not just within the political context of when it was made at the height of the Cold War. The message, which must have shocked and offended many at the time, was that it wasn't just the Russians who were threatening world peace, but human stupidity in general, including that of Americans (of politicians, the military and of ordinary people). It is a testament to American democracy, however, that such a show of self-criticism was possible. It certainly would not have been tolerated in the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, it is also a testament to people's reluctance to learn from such wise teachers, who hold up a mirror to their own countrymen, since the effect of the film on politics was virtually zero, doing nothing to slow the nuclear arms race, under the threat of which we continued to live for another 40 years. Although few realise it, we were very lucky indeed to survive those years without committing nuclear self-annihilation. Not that we (or our politicians) have gotten any wiser. We are as blind and stupid now as we were back then. Notwithstanding the continued threat posed by nuclear weapons (especially their proliferation), it is now the plundering of our planet's natural resources and the disruption of its climate and life-supporting ecosystems which pose the biggest threat to human survival. But instead of facing up to the cause of our problems (i.e. our own stupid and misguided selves), we continue to blame others and remain in denial of our own culpability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those classic 50's Sci Fi films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sci Fi films were HUGE in the 1950's. They pumped them out faster than you could count them. Some were greeted with praise (Invasion of the Body Snatchers), others with hate (Plan 9 From Outer Space). This is one of the really good classic Sci Fi films. Not only because it has a good story and good special effects for the time, but because it has a really good message as well. The acting in this movie is quite good as well. Surprisingly, it's not as corny as most 50's films were.The Day the Earth Stood Still tells the story of an alien and his massive robot who come to Earth with a warning for mankind. The alien rents a room from a single mother who lives with her son. The woman's son befriends the alien and learns the secret. The alien activates a device that shuts off every electronic or battery operated device on the planet. People panic for half an hour until the alien turns it back on. As he leaves the earth, he lets mankind know that their constant war and pollution is harming other planets, and if they don't stop he will shut everything down permanently. Phew! Thank God this movie isn't based on fact because I'm pretty sure the earth would be gone now.The Day the Earth Stood still is a stellar Sci Fi film with a great message that's relevant even today. This movie provides a really good time.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A flying saucer lands in Washington, D.C. and out steps an alien named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) with his seven-foot robot Gort. Klaatu has a very important message to deliver to all the world's leaders but, unfortunately, he's met with violence immediately upon arrival. Despite this, he continues on his mission and decides to mingle among the humans and see what makes us tick before delivering an ultimatum from the stars.Classic sci-fi film from director Robert Wise that is, for my money, the best film from the golden age of sci-fi and among the top five films of the genre regardless of era. Considering how much I love '50s sci-fi, that's no small compliment. The acting is solid throughout, with special mentions to Michael Rennie in his career-defining role as Klaatu, Sam Jaffe as the Einstein stand-in Professor Barnhardt, and underrated child actor Billy Gray. The script is smart and fresh with interesting characters and believable dialogue. I never felt it was preachy or naive as some movies with similar themes often come across. The special effects, while quaint-looking now, still have an impact. Robert Wise's direction here is among the best work of his career. Enough good things can't possibly be said of Bernard Herrmann's evocative score The Day the Earth Stood Still is an imaginative and influential film with many memorable elements. It has stood the test of time in a way I think very few of today's sci-fi movies will. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend you do so. And please, for the love of all that's right and good in the world, do not see the Keanu Reeves remake before this original classic (if you must see it at all).</fullReview>

Klaatu escapes the hospital and goes to a boarding room where widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her son Bobby are staying. While Helen has the day with Tom Stephens, Klaatu babysits Bobby and learns about the world. Bobby leads Klaatu to Helen's boss Professor Jacob Barnhardt. It is an iconic 50s sci-fi. The story is timeless although it doesn't have many exciting thrills. The 50s style directions are a little stiff. The staging is somewhat static but it is still quite compelling. This is more of a message movie and Gort is one of the great robots of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the Best Sci-Fi Movie of All time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once I saw it on TV in the early 1960's, this film became embedded and has remained in my soul. From the opening shot of the universe being subjectively navigated by the unseen alien craft to find the earth, the film alerted me to the fact that where I lived was but a tiny part of a much larger whole. The music of Bernard Herman was a perfect match for the vastness, wonder and inscrutability of the universe. What followed had me wired to the screen until the final shot as the alien craft disappears into space. Just as it became a dot, it seemed as though it is coming back as I hoped it would. I wanted to hear more from Klaatu and see Gort ominously lift his visor but all that happened was a "THE END" sign disappointingly filled the screen. I couldn't wait to hear that "The Day the Earth Stood Still" would be on TV again. Few, if any, films have had such an impact upon me. I even decided that like Klaatu and Bobby, I would one day visit the Lincoln Monument and Arlington Cemetery. I know that this is not a genuine critique of the film but I hope my testimony convinces others to imagine the impact this film must have had upon a generation of young viewers from the 1950's and 60's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's an eerie atmosphere permeating "The Day the Earth Stood Still" that really draws you in. It worked on me at an unlikely young age and I've loved this movie ever since. It's mostly in the ship's interiors (which is a really cool look), but the pitch-black shadows really do add punch to the ominous mystery. The big question at the heart of the movie is what the hell has Michael Rennie traveled so far to tell us, but the road to that point isn't a drag - which is remarkable, seeing as this is mostly a "talky" movie. It's a slow burn, but the characters are mostly engaging, that score is nicely sinister and the promise of Gort's destructive possibilities loom large over the whole thing.This isn't some for of high art, and goodness knows it doesn't com off without a hitch (really, Gort's just a guy in a rubber suit; curiously, a rather frail non-actor). But it all comes together in an entertaining package. And that message we finally get to hear has the ring of some police state nightmare. Except it isn't, and Rennie's words just hang there as the movie fades out. It's a thought-provoking speech, and a great capper on the whole movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Might Be My Favorite Sci-Fi Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right at the start of the film the motif of a mass hysteria among American citizens is introduced, and the militia and police confront Klaatu, who makes it clear that he has come in peace. The robot who is with Klaatu even eliminates the Americans' weapons without the use of violence, and here we have the onset of a great Cold War reaction film.A very interesting and intriguing factor is that Klaatu takes the image of a human though he is alien, depicting the idea that if there is intelligent life elsewhere in the universe it could be similar to, if not the same, as us. Since he is not distinguishable among humans this gives him the advantage to hide in plain sight, which is a defensive strategy since his intentions are not to harm us earthlings.The best scenes of the film are when Klaatu talks with the young son of the female lead. He visits the grave of the boy's father and asks about how he served his country. There is a great moment when Klaatu describes atomic power as a way to potentially help civilization, and this is when Bobby says "I thought that was only for bombs." See what information we feed to the innocent of the world?Towards the conclusion of the film there are many references to Klaatu as a Christ figure, and though I don't see him as literally representing Jesus Christ he is definitely a savior. Though his closing monologue basically preaches the message the movie is trying to make, I think it is a powerful one.This film tries to look at atomic/nuclear war from a third party's point of view and does an excellent job of it.</fullReview>

I must mention one cinematographic gold moment. Gort is healing Klaatu in the spaceship with Helen in the background, she looks on as the mighty figure of Gort stares down impassively at the body of Klaatu.

		<fullReview>This movie is good, but not great. The movie's theme is obvious - war is bad, peace is good, and the human race better listen up, or else. Michael Rennie plays the principal role with dignity, which prevents the movie from becoming a spoof. Hugh Marlowe plays what is perhaps the most realistic character in the story and whose character reveals the kind of character flaws which have brought the human race to the brink of destruction. The special effects are surprisingly good. What is not that good is the contrived nature of the story with its obvious political spin. Also, the response to the alien's arrival is surprisingly understated. True, the alien is shot, twice, but given his unexpected arrival and the weapon he brought, a robot that could destroy the earth, such a response is not implausible. That is, the humans have cause to feel alarmed which this movie seems to suggest is an overreaction. The alien's unveiled threat of destruction should have been enough to send this alien packing. Any message delivered at the point of gun, so to speak, is a message that is not worth its weight in words. Now, the movie is well made - the story is straight forward and the acting is strong. This movie had great value as a cinematic antique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Give peace a chance. That is the message delivered to us Earthlings by this film's mysterious alien visitor. In the time this film was made the message was a rather powerful one. American/Soviet tensions were high, we had entered the age of nuclear weapons and the idea that humankind may be on the verge of destroying itself was not all that far-fetched. It is in this atmosphere that Klaatu, visitor from another world, arrives on Earth. When his flying saucer lands in Washington there is understandably much apprehension. But Klaatu comes in peace. We learn that he wishes to bring all the leaders of the world together to warn them of the dangers should they continue their nuclear arms race. Seems the aliens don't much mind if us silly Earthlings kill ourselves in war after war. But our nuclear weaponry, combined with the start of space exploration, causes the people of other worlds to be concerned that their peaceful existence could soon be threatened by the people of Earth. If that comes to pass Klaatu warns us that there will be consequences. Dire consequences.It's a rather simple story but one which certainly grabs and then holds on to your attention. In playing Klaatu, an alien who appears to be rather human, Michael Rennie turns in a quality performance. Klaatu may seem human but we always know there's something more there and Rennie portrays that otherworldliness wonderfully. When Klaatu foils our government's attempts to hold him and wanders out into society the movie kicks into life. We see this alien visitor interact with ordinary people as he tries to fulfill his mission and save us Earthlings from ourselves. Klaatu will be aided by a young boy, Bobby Benson, whom he befriends and by Bobby's friendly but wary widowed mother. They are unaware of who exactly "Mr. Carpenter", the alias Klaatu has taken, really is. Eventually though his true identity will be secret no longer and it's a race against time, and the military, as Klaatu tries to deliver his message of peace to the world without getting himself killed first.The movie is a little dry and rather talky. A lot of words and, especially for a science fiction film, very little action. Even the ending, after all that has come before, seems somewhat anticlimactic. You might be expecting some kind of spectacular, thrilling showdown but there's nothing of the sort. But in its own way the climax works for this movie, especially taking into account the time in which it was made. Nowadays Hollywood would certainly jazz things up with all kinds of spectacular effects. But as we have seen time and again great effects do not necessarily make for a great movie. The effects in this movie are incredibly primitive. For example Klaatu's companion, the giant, menacing robot Gort, is rather obviously just a tall guy in a cheesy foam rubber suit. And the story itself requires you to occasionally suspend disbelief as well. A spaceship lands in Washington and the military leaves just two soldiers there to guard it? Really? That's just one of the contrivances necessary to allow the plot to move forward. But while there are certainly some things to quibble with the movie is still undeniably compelling. It's a simple story but it works. For all the money spent to make modern sci-fi movies look spectacular there is a lesson to be learned here that the story is the most important thing. It doesn't matter how good your movie looks if the story stinks. This old-school movie may not look spectacular but the story makes it a film well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parable for the McCarthy Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an almost perfect movie and there a number or reasons why it is still so enjoyable and powerful after 57 years.The performances by Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal are as vital and powerful as Hollywood ever turns out, and their chemistry is excellent. They both appear to be highly intuitive actors who convey much of their respective characters without a lot of expository dialog, and there is an interesting undercurrent of sexual tension between them.Rennie and Neal are at the core of this movie, but the full arsenal of a good director is also employed: lighting, editing, camera work, special effects and music. Director Robt. Wise succeeded in making a film that had a feeling of documentary-like realism yet at the same time conveyed a true sense of other-worldliness. The special effects still work extremely well, better than most from this era, and better than the CGI crap used today. The only clumsy moment is some bad usage of fast motion, and I am inclined to forgive that because the overall film is so great.This is a parable about the warlike and aggressive nature of humanity, an exposition of the McCarthy era, and a plea for sanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see for sci-fi fans and fans of film in general</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would consider this a must see flick for any fan of the sci-fi genre of for movies in general. Yes, it is not perfect. Every movie has it's flaws.Let's start with the story. An alien from another world comes to Earth and lands in Washington D.C. Along he has brought a huge and scary looking robot. What exactly he want's no one knows. He claim he comes in peace and demands to speak with the leaders. All the leaders... Of the whole world... At once. His mission is to speak of peace and tell the leaders and the people of Earth that as long as they fight among themselves nobody cares, but if they should attempt to bring their war eager habits into space and thereby threaten other planets measures will be taken against Earth to ensure future peace in the rest of space.The script is good, but maybe a little less conversation and a little more action would have pleased. Almost the whole movie is basically talk and so it may be a little slow. Yet, this makes it a "simple" movie, a plot focused movie and it's this that makes this film stand out from most other sci-fi films at the time and even still to day. There are also a couple of other minor aspect of the script that could've been done different and perhaps better. However, the story and idea behind the movie was and still is original and good and you get caught up with it. All in all this makes a good result.One thing that stands out is the visual. First of all the cinematography with good lightning and nice shots and then there is the excellent special effects. The opening and closing of the spaceship is looking good and the disappearance of various items is really impressive. Then there is the design. The exterior and interior of the spaceship is really good looking and well made. The lightning in the corridor is really nice and it all joins forces and becomes a really good looking movie.The actors does a good job. Michael Rennie is memorable as Klaatu and Billy Gray is good as Bobby Benson. Also Patricia Neal is good as Helen Benson. Good believable acting in that good old style.Bernard Herrmann's score is good. It lifts the scenes to a whole new level, bringing a nice sci-fi feel to them. The all over sound editing is quite good.What makes this a must see is maybe not as much it's story although it is a good and classic one and has a very relevant message. What, in my mind as a film in general and also a sci-fi fan, makes this a must see it's the influence it has had on the sci-fi genre. At the time it brought sci-fi to a new level. This movie and aspects of it has made way for and been inspiration for other films and series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you rate this movie, you must place it in perspective. That is why my rating is high. You cannot rate this movie based on todays technology and standards. Also, think about the mind set of the average American at that time. Although the story plot is simplistic, it is also rather deep and complex in its message.If you consider when this movie was made (1951) when only a minority of people owned televisions, the special effects are amazing. The premise of the story is prophetic and the morality issues, still hold true today. Michael Rene was the perfect actor for this part having the demeanor and integirty to carry out his part as an intergalactic emissary. Gort(robot), what can you say?, made the movie. Without his ominous presence and potential for destroying the human world, the story line would have been very weak.I wish someone would re-make this movie but maintaining the integrity and powerful message of this story. Using todays special effects it would be awesome.</fullReview>

I enjoyed the black and white cinematography, eerie music, famous reporters ala Drew Pearson etc being shown. This is a film that the ID4 guys obviously had watched but never came remotely close to matching too.Gort is kinda hokey but along with the stereo typical saucer it all works well.

		<shortDescription>Gort! Klaatu barada nikto!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many respects THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is a very dated film. Obviously a comment on Cold War paranoia, it has little in the way of special effects or high-class production values, Edmund H. North's script is surprisingly talky, and it captures the very clunky look of late-1940s/early-1950s America to an uncomfortable degree. Certainly few involved in the project took it very seriously--even leading lady Patricia Neal admitted that she and Michael Rennie had tremendous difficulty keeping straight faces while spouting "Gort! Klaatu barada nikto!" But strangely, against all the odds, the film continues to speak, capturing the imagination of each new generation that sees it.The film's enduring power seems to arise from its very simplicity, which lifts the story of a visitor from outer space from mere sci-fi pulp to the level of a parable. As frequently noted, the film contains significant religious symbolism. It is easy to read the visitor as Christ, the woman who befriends him as Mary Magdalene, the man who betrays him as Judas, and the message the visitor brings as both call to repentance and opportunity for redemption--and whatever one's actual religious beliefs, the film taps into these archetypes to create a very effective modern morality tale that works on several levels. At the same time, the film makes a surprisingly acid comment on American and international politics, small minded bigotry, and media hysteria that still rings true today. And the film has surprising visual power. Although the cinematography is very basic, and the design of both the spaceship and the robot Gort are very simple, they combine to create a number of startling images: the first moment that Gort is seen standing on the spaceship's ramp; the spacecraft interior; Gort as he menaces a screaming Patricia Neal--images so simple and yet so powerful that they have become part of our cultural landscape.The cast plays very unpretentiously and cleanly, and although Rennie and Neal may have snickered on the set none of it shows in their performances. Both are very memorable. Hugh Marlowe is appropriately smarmy as Neal's unpleasant boyfriend, and Sam Jaffe and Billy Gray are enjoyable in their supporting roles; film buffs will also enjoy seeing Frances Bavier (television's "Aunt Bea") in a rare film appearance. Robert Wise's direction is impressively unobtrusive, and any review that did not reference Bernard Herrman's brilliant score--which easily doubles the film's effectiveness--would be incredibly remiss. If you want computer generated special effects, evil aliens, and lots of blood-letting, you should look elsewhere... but if you want something to think about, and something that will hold up under repeated viewings, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the first time I saw "The Day The Earth Stood Still." It was broadcast on TV in the early 1960s, when I was 10 years old.In 1951 this film portrayed People of Color as intelligent and dignified. Crowd scenes are integrated, and the world's leading scientists were not just Caucasion men, but Asian, African, Hispanic, men and women played by actors of those ethnicities. While other films of the era were Xenophobic (and I'm not just referring to Sci Fi films), "Day the Earth Stood Still" was the first time I saw People of Color as just People.The themes of this film are basic comments and truths about the Human Race. Cinematogropher Leo Tover's mastery of light and shadow creates not only the mood, but lends a timeless style. "Day the Earth Stood Still" is one of the few films of the era that will never become dated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Klaatu and his Robot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very interesting from the stand point that the actions of a few affect many. It was interesting that the spaceman had all this technology to travel through space, to turn power off to the world, survive multiple gunshot wounds, and revive someone from death, but yet they could not get a meeting of the world's leaders together. This movie is also interesting because while Klaatu and his robot come to preserve the peace, they invoke more violence. Also rather than Klaatu and his robot killing just the people who are in charge and are creating this problem they threaten to kill everyone and everything on earth. Later, Klaatu says that the matters on our planet are ours to deal with, but if we continue to show aggression and threaten the other planets that they would destroy us. This doesn't make much sense because while we might be capable of making nuclear bombs, we still didn't have the power to send a nuke into space or anything else of that matter. Klaatu and his robot were truly violating our rights. We had no intentions of going to another planet to start an intergalactic war or such, Klaatu and his robot were really just making attempts to control Earth. However, overall I believe this movie drives home a very important message about abusing power, we see the humans abusing their power of knowledge by making nuclear bombs that could end the world. On the other hand we have Klaatu and his robot that are abusing their knowledge of space to control other races that might not agree with their way of living. This film has only aged in the form of movie making and the way the information would have gotten out to people. The storyline is still a quite possible occurrence as we have developed nuclear arms and other militaristic advances in science, and other planets could feel threatened by us doing so. The movie is still very realistic from the standpoint of people on Earth not being able to come together in an emergency because of egos. This movie shows just how dangerous we can be if we abuse our knowledge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Day the Earth Stood Still' is a morally enlightening film, with a special message to be carried on throughout time, and in the film, throughout space. In this 1951 film an alien called Klaatu (Michael Rennie) comes down to earth to relay a message about the violence in our world. After being assumed hostile and wounded at the very beginning, and then his attempts to get together a meeting with all world leaders to tell his message fails, he escapes his hospital room to discover more about the ways we live and how to get his message out to the entire world. He ends up learning about our society by taking a fake name, Carpenter, and boarding with a small family which includes Helen Benson (Patricia Neal), Bobby Benson (Billy Gray), and two other household members. The cast also include Ms. Benson's courtier, Tom Stevens (Hugh Marlowe), who in the end turned Klaatu in for his own fame, which I think was the main example of the hate in the world that Klaatu was trying to stop from spreading.I thought that the overall meaning and purpose of the film was a very excellent point, but I didn't particularly like how they put it into a sci-fi film, it seemed to make it drag on a little, like they were stretching the plot line to make it work. Overall I thought it was a decent movie, and I would recommend it for all ages, particularly those of an older age with positions of power who control the amount of violence in our world today. A part I especially enjoyed was the speech at the end because it wrapped up the film and summed up the entire purpose to it, in a way gave the movie a clean, crisp, and easy to understand point. This film is a movie that is universal throughout time. The message will be significant no matter or where or when it's shown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mostly good flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the movie was good because it had a meaningful message, if all the countries don't cease aggressions the entire world will be destroyed. Whether the world is destroyed by an outside force, Gort, or by the inevitable destruction that will come with nuclear war, the world can't go on with wars and hate. The most interesting part of the movie was where Klaatu shows the power he controls. The demonstration of turning off the power all over the world for ? hour was remarkable. The ingenuity of his decision to stop only non-essential power was also interesting, choosing to keep planes in air with power and have hospitals remain powered. This showed that only necessary harm would be done to humans. I don't believe that the aliens came to Earth just to kill everyone. If they wanted to, they easily could. They simply came to warn us that our actions could get us killed, either by ourselves or from Gort and robots like him. I understand why Klaatu was forcing the Earth to join the organization against aggression, but I wouldn't have liked being told what to do by someone who I have never seen. Its just a little unprecedented that someone would go to a person they have never met and force them to do something. That's just not something we do on Earth. One of the things that I didn't like in the movie was Gort's appearance. The robot was made out of some super strong metal that was unbreakable, but yet his legs would bend and he wasn't always walking straight up. If the robot is going to be able to move freely and nimbly, make him have joints on his suit, don't just have the metal bend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still delivers the maximum message with the most minimum effort. The special effects were sparse, but the plot and story were the main focus. As a point of departure, I'd like to construct a character study of a few of the characters. The fiancé as an insurance salesman seemed to be a condemnation of that profession. Professor Barnhardt as a prototype of Einstein, seems to be a persecuted Jewish scientist who, like Einstein came up with theories that were used as blueprints for weapons of mass destruction, but in his old age wants to correct things through the humanitarian efforts of saving the world, instead of being responsible for helping to make it possible to destroy it. Klatu as an outsider came to Washington and made many of the characters face the reality of their lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At one point in the film Klaatu states he has traveled 250 million miles in 5 months to reach Earth. Does anyone have any theories as to what may be at that distance from Earth in any direction? Of course that does not necessarily mean it would have been Klaatu's ultimate point of origin. It could have been some sort of man-made space station.When Klaatu was examined by the doctors they noted his lungs were just like ours, suggesting he came from an Earth-like planet with atmospheric pressure similar to the Earth's atmosphere. In science fiction anything is possible and I would enjoy any theories that can be posted. This film is now over 50 years old and it is amazing how well it holds up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Critique on the validity of the film's science</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ian Gore- The Day the Earth Stood StillThis fantastic movie beautifully wove known science of its time together with speculation on what could be possible in the future. The biggest field of scientific study addressed in the movie was clearly that of electricity; after all, the movie wouldn't even have the same title without it. Klaatu, the main character, some how managed to neutralize all of the electricity in the world, with the exception of that in hospitals and planes in flight, in an effort to grab the attention of the earth's leading scientists. What Klaatu did was impossible. The first problem with this is how could Klaatu and/or Gort distinguish between the electricity within every thing, living and nonliving, on earth. It seems that by neutralizing electricity on such a large scale, it would be extremely difficulty to pin-point the numerous hospitals and planes around the globe in order to exclude them from this. Secondly, neutralizing the electricity would result in the collapsing of all of the affected atoms, thus causing the disintegration of those affected items. Finally, if all the electricity on the planet had been neutralized, then how was Mrs. Helen Bensen able to know that it was exactly 12:30 when the electricity was "un-neutralized?" Why would her her battery-powered watch continue to funcition and motor-powered automobiles stop? Cars use electricity in the ignition process, this is true, but it seems that once they had been strated, they should've been able to keep driving; at most, I think that people might no longer have been able to enjoy the latest songs on the radio. I understand that the creators of the film probably thought it easier top just not adress these questions, but it wuold've greatly strengthened the validity of the storyline because they deal with something so essential to the plot line. Another field which was very important to the movie was metallurgy. Both Klaatu's ship and Gort were made from some indestructable metal which was previously unknown to mankind. The US government tried every method available to them but was still unable to make even the slightest scratch on its surface; blow torches and diamond drills both failed miserably. No metal such as this one exists on earth.The film's audience learns nothing of its composition or of its properties. While there is no reason to believe that it is impossible to develop such a metal, I think that it would've been better if the makers of the film offered some explanation of the metal's strength rather than forcing us to accept this strength because of the simple fact that the aliens would be more advanced than us and wuold have developed such things. Also very important to the movie was biology, especially the posibility for the reanimation of an organism once it has died. The movie first adresses this first in the beginning of the film. When Klaatu is accidentally shot, he is taken to a military facility to be cared for. The doctors there examen his physical structure and determine that it is identical to human structure in every way that they could tell. With this knowledge, one would assume that it would take months for Klaatu's wound to heal. However, he simply pours some of his "magic space juice" on it, and the wound heals almost instantly. We are given no explanation as to how this happens. How does the "juice" help to regenerate his cells? Is it simply a catalyst for thehealing that would've happened naturally? Later in the film, Klaatu is killed. Gort retrieves his body and puts it on the reanimating machine that they have aboard their ship. By the time Gort reached Klaatu, rigor mortis would've set in. Also, we are once again given no explanation as to how the machine works. We are told that the machine restores life indefinitely. If it is able to regenerate dead and/or damaged cells, then why wouldn't Klaatu be able to live out his 130 year life expectancy? Is it because there machines aren't capable of that, or is it because of his alien ethics. Altough the film did stretch much of the science known at the time, it did correctly incorporate some science which was possible. When Klaatu wanted to communicate with Gort without alerting the armed guards, he used Bobby Bensen's flash light to convey a message in some sort of code. It is quite possible that Gort's different sensors could've been sensitive enough to detect such a change in the light. His computer also would've been able to translate the pattern of long and short lights into orders for it to follow. Also completely true to science was Klaatu's explanation to Bobby Bensen of inertia. It was also possible for the space ship to be traveling at 4,000 mph around the planet. The only issue that the makers of the film failed to address here was the sonic boom that would undoubtedly accompany an object traveling faster than the speed of sound, 741.1 mph. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The creators managed to do a great amount without the modern special effects seen in movies today; I wasn't bored at any time during the movie. I also feel that it was good because the writers challenged us to examine our conceptions of possible aliens and also to examine the way that our society works, two things that modern science fiction/alien movies often fail to do. I give this movie 9.5/ 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Review of The Day The Earth Stood Still Including its Science and the practicality and correctness of it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day The Earth Stood Still ranks among the greatest scifi thrillers of all time. The plot is a classic: the battle for human kind to not only thwart the odds placed against them, but save their entire species from obliteration. However, even though this is a great movie, its science can in some cases be questioned.First I present a piece of correct fact. The ship that Klaatu uses is able to neutralized the earth's gravitational pull. This is being experimented on and theoretical designs for ships, via magnetic forces and the "warping" of space, are being conducted. Therefore, the idea that Klaatu's ship neutralizes gravity, or at least alters it so that it my enter Earth controllably is theoretically possible. But, the movie also boasts a strong sense of incorrect science.Klaatu's statement that he traveled 250 million miles to get here is not practical considering that no planet exists 250 million miles away. If he meant 250 million light years away, then tat would be possible. The reason this is impractical is because, to our present knowledge and all likelyhood, thee is no intelligent life in our solar system and the nearest star to our own is Alpha Centauri, which is 4.3 light years away.Today, we look back at this movie and several aspects, which in 1951 may have seemed impressive, now don't seem so daunting. For example, Klaatu states that his ship travels 4,000 miles per hour at 20,000 feet. This is not such a great feat today. Moreover, the average speed Klaatu reportedly flew at, is 70,000 miles per hour. This, when compared to the escape velocity of Earth, slightly over two dozen thousand miles per hour, is not so great for a species seemingly as advanced as Klaatu's.Overall this movie is perhaps the best of the scifi "starters". It includes a suspensful plot, a plethra of science, and many analogies and messages which can be interpreted and used effectively in any generation. I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic That Deserves to be Revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very simply, until Forbidden Planet was made in 1956, this was the greatest science fiction film of all time. Michael Rennie is perfect as the alien Klaatu, Billy Gray (Father Knows Best) is wonderful as the boy he befriends, and Patricia Neal has a penetrating "cold war" look in her eyes that reminds us what this story was really about. Only one sour note, the movie does not capture the ending of the short story on which it was based. I won't spoil the movie for you, but in the movie it is clear that Klaatu is the Master of Gort, while in the story Klaatu is the servant. Klaatu Barrata Nikto. 9.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GREAT work of science fiction!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this for the first time when I was about 10. It was and still is a very absorbing story, unless you are someone who is only interested in 'Short-Attention-Span-Theatre' type movies. I won't give away any more of the plot, but I will say this: I was a little on edge watching it on TV but that didn't stop me from sitting about six inches from the screen. At the very end the saucer takes off and very slowly shrinks to a dot in the center of the picture tube as it flies away, only to change into the words 'The End' which appear to jump right back at you. I about flew across the living room when that happened, probably just what the moviemakers wanted. Well worth seeing!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The genre of science fiction has evolved drastically over the years since Day the Earth Stood Still came out. I suggest that in the light of such films as this, modern sci-fi has devolved significantly (see Independence Day).Day The Earth Stood Still is pure science fiction, but in a decade of cheesy "B" movies, witch hunting for communists and the growing awareness that mankind could nuke itself into oblivion at any moment, it's a bold statement about the human race. Most people living nowadays can't remember what it was like to have the threat of a full nuclear exchange hanging over their head all the time. A lot of people alive during the early 50's were scared by the atom bomb, and had little faith in human wisdom. That's what this movie was talking about. It's a movie with a message, and just like The Matrix, it's message takes precedence over any petty, minor inconsistencies that may exist within its framework.This movie is a peice of art trying to make a statement, not JUST a movie about a human extraterrestrial visiting Earth in a spaceship. There are reasons The Day The Earth Stood Still is considered one of the finest movies of the 50's. The most important being that it gave the sci-fi genre credibility through its exploration and understanding of the wide spectrum of human nature. We understand the hot soup that we're in by the end of the movie, and it leaves any rational, good natured person lamenting the fact that it's message is still as relevant today as it was in 1951.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is simple yet powerful. Stop continuing along this paranoid destructive path or alien races immeasurably more powerful than us will convince us otherwise. When you watch this film for the first time - it hits a magical spot. This was filmed in a time before Sputnik, way before the Moon landings. Yet the storyline is as fresh as any Sci-Fi you will see today.Acting wise Michael Rennie as Klaatu is perfect as the strange but appealing/friendly alien with a message. The other actors blend in perfectly with the film.Hey it's one of the first big alien metallic robots ever seen. Cool! Don't be tempted to not watch this - Sci-Fi at it's original and bestAs with all good movies you should come away from a film with more than you went in with. You won't be displeased!Sit back, turn the lights down. Enjoy.Russ</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do i Believe its one of the best. Well who knows. But I do know i was surprised at his almost timeless message, particularly from a time in the 50 &amp; 60'ties when Hollywood si-fi movies where either campy, B type, or simply so crapppy and yet unaware of its own lameness, that they had to be timeless cult classics. But not the case at all with The Day the Earth Stood Still. I can say I'm not really into older movies, but I guess I was indoctrinated into liking this movie by my father, who saw this movie as a boy, and without question, was thoroughly amazed as a impressionable boy growing up in the begining of the Cold War. I guess you could say his nostalgic love of the movie affectionitley rubbed off onto me. But, still, if you like sci-fi even a little, and can forgive the out of date effects, go rent it, and just enjoy. Heck, one day this movie may be remade, and I'll guarntee an updated screenplay and modern day effects will make it a modern day classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 50's, grade schools had the children participate in bomb drills. So when my cousin and I went to see the movie (a double feature with cartoon of course), the thought that people from a far away world were concerned that the earth was playing around with weapons that could destroy all life and possibly effect other worlds, well we didn't sleep for a few days. Of course, we went to see the film two more times to make sure that "Gort" had really left the earth! Even when it is on cable today, I'll still sit and watch the entire movie, just to make sure the robot gets on the ship. This is the stuff SIFI is made of!!!</fullReview>

Indestructable, and with the unbelievable power to destroy entire worlds.... Wow! Even though Gort symbolizes immeasurable cruelty and a total lack of compassion or empathy, he also is perhaps the most realistic depiction of a sad truth.... the ONLY sure way to bring peace and brotherhood to all of the nations on this little blue planet is the absolute threat of total destruction.

		<shortDescription>Focus on the Poetics - Not the Prose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers - spoilers - spoilersThis movie is riddled with flaws, but just as it is easy to decry the black monolith in Kubrick's "2001" as a stupid contrivance - and thereby nullify its symbolism - so it is easy to ridicule the design of this movie's robot, to take one example. Do people praise this movie simply because they are commanded to by social convention? Do its merits lie only in its "cult status"? Or does this movie indeed have intrinsic value? It does. But its greatness lies not in its story, which is easily assailed, but in its art. Or, if one prefers, not in its prose but its poetics. It is the poetics of this movie (like those of "2001") that make it difficult for most people to explain their enthusiasm for it.Consider the particulars. When the alien's ship first moves in to land on earth, people on the ground hear a strange sound from everywhere, a hum or a singing, a song celestial from the clouds. The alien's ship, moving over Washington DC, is not huge, black and ominous like that seen in the recent movie "Independence Day." It is radiant with white light, for its bears a visitor from Beyond. It lands in the sunlit glare of a lazy afternoon and then sits silent for hours, giving earthmen the first hint of its power, which lies not in destructiveness or technological prowess but in mystery. The silence of the ship, like that of the robot that stands motionless through most of the story, does not inspire terror, for terrible things can be measured, mathematically encompassed, and opposed. Instead, the ship's silence, its very motionlessness, inspires dread and awe. It is never what the robot does that unnerves earth people but what it might do. What it does remains in the realm of actuality. What it might do hails from the realm of boundless potential. The robot's smooth minimalist surfaces accentuate its mystery. It sits silent and featureless throughout most of the movie. Human technology cannot penetrate its surface. Its power remains inscrutable, its might emanating from the realm of the formless. Like the Egyptian pyramids, the robot is impressive not for its size but its sheer being-there, its is-ness. To stand before a pyramid is to ask searching questions about who built it and why -- questions about life, death, and so on. Who can resist the pyramid's silence? Who can resist the robot's Silence? How to oppose or delimit it? How to grasp the motives behind that expressionless face? And just as the robot's mysteries are inscrutable, so do they defy containment. At one point earthmen try to encase the robot in a hi-tech laminate, but the robot vaporizes its imprisoning block. If more techno-babble and special effects were infused into "The Day The Earth Stood Still," the film would lose its poetic value. Because tedious explanation is minimized, the alien is a visitor not from some other planet, but from the stars, from a celestial other-universe. All of this is lost on those who insist on comparing the sheer production values of this film to subsequent movie technology. Many have blasted the plot of this movie as improbable. How, for example, does a hulking robot walk the streets of Washington DC undetected? And so on. Every great film and book has flaws. "Moby Dick," for example, is a wonderful story, but the book cries out for editing. Yet "Moby Dick" remains a great novel, partly because of the Ahab character. The "Klattu" character in DESS is similarly interesting. From his first appearance he radiates respect and authority without the overbearingness that usually accompanies it. He befriends the boy "Bobby" as an ideal father . . . patient, respectful, delighted to be in the boy's company. He epitomizes the air of the tall distinguished visitor: modest, polished, obliging, but with an edge of mystery about him. Contrived? Yes. But great art inspires its audience to pursue greatness themselves. We would all like to have the general calm that "Klaatu" does. What woman wouldn't want something of the alien's personality in her child's father? "Toughness" in him is not necessary, for this being, in the story, has every human being at his mercy.The movie's poetics extend to the robot that brings back the alien from the dead as a master surgeon whose skill stems not from adroitness with a scalpel, but from sheer presence. When the alien becomes alive again, the robot stands back and awaits further orders. This is taking the archetype of the "strong silent type" to a mythic degree. We feel that the robot, as a mobile obelisk, could stand motionless for eons if need be, unconcerned with human developments. The robot therefore hints at the eternal in a manner akin to that of the black monolith in "2001." Some detractors base their comments on the fact that the plot is a product of its bygone day. Then, manifesting the prejudices of their own day, those same detractors berate the film because the alien is not female and not non-white. We see in a film what we want to see, and what we want to see is a product of the prejudices and ideologies we bring to the theatre or VCR.This was sci-fi before it lapsed into self-parody. One reviewer wrote, "Imagine that you're in a dimly lit room listening to the radio about an alien on the loose. All of the sudden, the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end as you quickly turn to see the dark and sullen figure of a strange man named Mr. Carpenter." These and other scenes are what we celebrate as "cinematic moments." Those who get nothing from them have our sympathy. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie but it's slow-pace and undramatic story is often a turn off to others so I've stopped recommending it, and because of it's moral tone it's more like a long "Outer Limits" episode. The funny thing about the movie is the unparrelled amount of Christian symbolism. The first words in the movies are "Holy cow" and "Holy Christmas" as radar-trackers observe a bright light in the sky (aka Star of Bethlelhem). Our hero Klaatu disguises himself with some drycleaned clothes belonging to a "Major Carpenter" (christ the son of a carpenter). Gort(God?)seems all-powerful, quick to anger, and can only be pacified by Latin-sounding alien words which are meaningless to us (and might as well be a Latin prayer). Gort also resurrects Klaatu, after rescuing him from jail. Gort could be like a golem, made in a generic human image but the reverse could also said - that he is the essential image and thus godlike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Klaatu arrives on Earth from space and tells the higher ups in Washington that he has a message to deliver to all the rulers of the world, in which the fate of the Earth hangs in the balance. When he learns that the world is filled with too much distrust between nations to have a summit, he escapes and finds sanctuary in a D.C. area boarding house, where he befriends a young boy and sees hope for this world. In order to make his voice be heard, Klaatu demonstrates his power ( in a very big way ), and arranges a meeting with dignitaries to discuss his mission, but US government and army officials believe him to be a menace and hunt him down. This is one of those films that really makes you think for awhile. The film does have a enigmatic eeriness to it which is complimented by the brilliant story. Rennie is perfectly cast as Klaatu. Great job by all involved. Rating- 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(www.plasticpals.com) After having watched the disappointing 2008 remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still, I owed it to myself to watch the original, an understated black and white thinking-man's science fiction film. I like to think the special effects were dazzling to audiences in the early '50s, but there's no denying they look quaint by today's standards. But that's not really the point, which was sorely missed by the people who made the remake. The world was only just recovering from World War 2, and the threat of annihilation by atom bomb was crystallizing into the Cold War.This led the screenwriters to imagine what could prevent us from destroying ourselves, and their answer is the appearance of an alien. An alien named Klaatu sent to earth to warn us that if we continue behaving badly, we'll only end up destroying ourselves, or be destroyed by giant peace-keeping robots. It's a story of first contact, and how people might react to such a situation, and it does an OK job of showing us.GortKlaatuKlaatu's robot pal GORT gets more screen time than he does in the remake, and even busts out his disintegrating laser beams to disarm the human aggressors. It wouldn't be a '50s movie if he didn't get to pick up and carry a beautiful woman back to his spaceship, too. Thanks to the limitations of the day, GORT is a practical effect, and that means he's at least partly real, which is more than one can say of the remake's version.It's easy to see why the film is a bonafide cult classic, though it suffers from the grammar of cinema from its day. Some events, including the planet-wide power outage that gives the film its title, are shown in cut after cut of redundant scenes (in case the movie is going too fast for you) which could shave minutes from the running time. This complaint aside, the movie is actually much better than the remake; if not for its inherent camp value than for its message, which rings more clearly and true than that of the rehash. I'm not saying you need to run out and get your copy today, but there are worse ways to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon than watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSHe also looks uncannily like us, too. For Klaatu the alien seems to derive his appearance, manner, and science from the perspective of 50's Middle America. This distinctly unalien quality is offset by having ?atu expressing differences between our cultures. So that when he tells us he's been travelling for five months, he quickly adds "your months". And when he talks of traversing millions of miles, it's "your miles". Now, call me a stickler for detail, but an alien race that just happened to evolve exactly the same words for time and distance as ours? What are the chances of that happening? And note that it's not a more respectable "light years" he's travelled.This may all sound like quibbling, but now I've set this sacred cow up for the slaughter, it's time to justify my argument. For The Day The Earth Stood Still is widely regarded as one of the all-time greats of movie SF. And, for it's era, that's a valid view. But ironically its contemporary failure is highlighted by its title. The Earth hasn't stood still. And the staid direction, acting and dialogue ? Holy Christmas! ? of the film makes it now hopelessly dated. Some may say the camerawork is understated, but the rigid blocking palls, and the fluctuating incidental music ? ranging from silence to deafening, often in the same scene ? distracts. The silly comic-book sound effects, the narrative driven by radio reports, the sped-up reels as people flee in terror ... it's all so leaden and clunky. There's also a discussion and summary of the film so far around a dinnertable. Have the moral standpoints of a film ever been so contrivedly introduced?Before we know it, Klaatu is undercover, and babysitting young, wholesome, American-as-apple-pie Bobby. Here Bobby and Klaatu bond and subtly get the issues across. Like the alien explaining how where he comes from there are no wars. "Gee, that's a good idea!" says Bobby. Is this a pacifistic message? I couldn't quite tell. Around this time Klaatu develops a trend for pious moralising and platitudes. So much so that a reporter, getting vox pops from a crowd, legs it after being bored silly by the stiffest alien this side of Mr.Spock on his mating ritual. And as for Bobby ? would such a young boy really have a mathematician as an idol-worshipped role model? Mind you, this was 1951 ? men still wore hats, and rock and roll had yet to be invented.However, it soon turns out that Klaatu has a system ? you've gotta have a system, haven't you? ? and doesn't really care about our planet's wars, but is merely worried about the threat to his own. If Earth develops atomic weapons in space then it will, he explains, be "eliminated". Eventually Klaatu hits on an ingenious idea to get back his spaceship ? go at night when there'll only be two people guarding it, of course! Bobby, the world's most neglected child, is again abandoned by mum and potential step-dad, causing him to follow Klaatu and so further the plot.This eventually leads to the alien's big speech, which is all peace, being nice to one another, etc. It's all very well meant, though the lack of allegory does cause you to question how stupid the filmmakers thought their audience was. Klaatu's death is clearly signposted (and given away in the first sentence of The Rocky Horror Picture Show) where he speaks of what Gort would do in such an eventuality. Apparently Gort ? an extra in a cheap rubber suit ? is an indestructible robot that could destroy the Earth.Best bit? The shadows cast over Klaatu's face in the elevator, oddly reminiscent of The Seventh Seal. Worst bit? The accent in the paralysed London scene. Who did the dubbing, Dick Van Dyke? Or maybe the worst bit is the obvious wire on Gort when he picks up Patricia Neal. That said, 90% of the effects are superb, even today.Another contradiction is that the vaguely pretentious undercurrent is what makes it less accessible nowadays. If the film was as silly as 50s SF movies usually are then it would make the screen backdrops and ropy bitpart actors more acceptable. As it is, perhaps the greatest legacy the film can offer is Neal's proactive role and unusual function as single parent. The sliding ramps on the UFO are great, and the movie must be praised for flying in the face of anti-Communist convention. Where it's peers were content to be "Killer Russkies From Mars!", this one tried something that was then radically different. Daringly so, for the time. The Day The Earth Stood Still is commendable, honourable and worthy of a "6", but is also undeniably dated. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day Sci Fi Stood Still.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951): Dir: Robert Wise / Cast: Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Sam Jaffe, Hugh Marlowe, Billy Gray: Tremendous science fiction film about world shock. A spacecraft hovers over the city before landing on a baseball diamond. Citizens speculate and media is on hand until a being in a spacesuit emerges from the spacecraft. He observes the crowd before producing a reading device that is mistaken by military and a firearm discharges. One of the beings will poise as human and befriend a boy. He wishes to deliver a message to world leaders regarding peace. Meanwhile soldiers are zapped by a robot when they advance the craft. Provocative with a poorly handled conclusion regarding a message. Director Robert Wise gives it an effective media coverage appeal. The production is excellent and ahead of its time. Great performances by Michael Rennie as the ominous being who experiences both the good and bad of Earth. Patricia Neal plays the boy's mother whose fiancé breaks trust leaving her to assist Rennie to his ship when fatality occurs. Sam Jaffe plays a professor impressed with Rennie's skills and decides to assist in his message getting across. Hugh Marlowe plays Neal's fiancé who will break trust. Billy Gray plays Neal's curious son. Theme regards hostility and chaos caused when impulses override the brain. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Sci-Fi Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four years before the release of The Day The Earth Stood Still, the Cold War began. One year before it's release, the Korean War began. The U.S. was also still feeling the results of World War II. Needless to say, war was, and still is, an important and divisive issue. Thus, it's a wonder that this movie's anti-war message doesn't come across as preachy. Klaatu is treated as a threat upon his arrival. Coming with the message that the Earth will soon be destroyed if it doesn't unite, he certainly seems threatening. He has good intentions, however, and it takes a kid to see that. Too many adults in the movie are so consumed with their political views that they can't see that the choice has obvious right answer. Klaatu is killed of course, and subsequently revived, but only momentarily. He tells the assembled people that if any of Earth's violence extends into space, they will be wiped out by the advanced robot protectors. He says the choice is theirs, and leaves.The ending didn't provide a lot of closure, but it works better that way. WE are left to decide how to act ourselves. The ending doesn't comfort the audience by showing that people can make the right choice, and it doesn't present the Earth being destroyed as a means of manipulating people to act through fear. It doesn't know how we will act, and it makes the mature decision of letting us be responsible for actions.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day the Earth Stood Still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Highly renowned sci-fi classic, directed by prolific Robert Wise (who could direct *any* genre), has an alien landing right on the front lawn of DC, with a direct and clear message to earth: either quite warring or else we will be obliterated by the united league of planets outside our own! With giant robot Gort at his side, the alien, Klaatu (the wonderful Michael Rennie, who never, for whatever reason, became a star he should have) is immediately injured not long after leaving his ship, just because he pulled out a device meant as a greeting of peace for the President of the United States. Taken to the hospital, he demands for all the world's leaders to meet him because of his message directly for all nations on the planet. Not being taken seriously, he decides to walk among the citizens of Washington, to learn of how they feel, what they have to say, and to get an idea of what earthlings are like in general. Through the chance relationships bonded with a mother and son (Patricia Neal and Billy Gray), he sees that mankind deserves the benefit of the doubt. Also getting a potential sounding board with a gathering arranging the intellects of many who might listen to what he has to say thanks to his meeting with Professor Jacob Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), Klaatu could accomplish what he is setting out to do.This is as much a drama as it is a moody sci-fi film. It has a distinct anti-war, anti-military stance. The pacifist message of "stop and do so or else" is an obvious wish-fulfillment by those who made this film. It is a dream for those who hate the use of violence to dictate diplomacy and puffing chests forward, pounding them with their superior weaponry and willingness to use it if need-be. I imagine that message is just as important today as it ever was in 1951. The spooky, noirish lighting and eerie score (by Bernard Herrmann) enhance a specific look and feel that really lifts the movie right off the screen.The building to the final warning with all that potency, the film's most memorable and finer details of this film (Bobby's following Klaatu, telling his mother and her boyfriend who both consider what he is saying about Klaatu being the "spaceman" just a dream, realizing he's right because of his wet shoes and very vivid telling of what he saw; Klaatu's visit to the Lincoln Memorial and appreciating his words, the intellect in them; Klaatu setting his plan in motion just in case he wasn't able to get to the meeting of minds by providing specific instructions to Neal for Gort, anticipating being harmed; Jaffe's amusement at the devices we so heavily depend on being "cut off" by Klaatu as a demonstration of his power; the visit to the cemetery where so many lie in graves due to dying in wars) are told in a poignant, pointed, and unsubtle fashion.It is all an accumulation that forms one central point of view: that if you plan to leave the planet in the rocket ships produced by you, then all that violence and war will stop. That you won't bring all that hostility and "petty squabbling" with all the war toys and such to other planets in other universes/galaxies. How Klaatu looks on at Neal's secretary, recognizing her contribution to his cause, there's hope that the world "gets it together". Perhaps that's what our world needs? Yeah, it wouldn't do any good. Might as well obliterate us. Frances Bavier (Aunt Bea on Andy Griffith) has an amusing cameo as an opinionated rooming house boarder, while Hugh Marlowe is quite a callous romantic interest for Neal, revealing he'd do whatever it takes to get his name in the news for "helping to nab the 'spaceman'"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Klaatu Goes to Washington</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still is to the science fiction film genre as High Noon is/was to the Western: it's the one that you can watch even if (or particularly if) you don't particularly like movies of that genre. People have watched High Noon who don't usually go near Westerns, since it speaks to the times and has solid production values - it's slick, a cut above the rest, and totally efficient in the use of the time given. 'Day' is like that in its way, as Robert Wise gets in quickly, gets Klaatu (Michael Rennie) to come in and get (some) information, try and inform, get (sort of) shut down, and then leave with his warning of, simply, Live in Peace, or DIE! Context, as usual, is everything; just as Noon was about the blacklist, Day is about the threat of nuclear annihilation, how close the US and Russia (and other nations, though they were the two big ones at the time in 1950/1951) were to destroying one another - and would be for years to come. Wise and company wanted to put forward a different message than most (if not practically all) other alien-invasion movies before and especially after. Klaatu and Gort the robot arrive on Earth, and of course brawn is first to respond over brain and Klaatu gets shot (but heals). Then he's taken in by a family - as "Mr. Carpenter" - and the boy shows him around the city (Billy Gray, who is mostly alright as an actor, if a bit one note).I found it interesting that one moment where Klaatu and the boy visit the Lincoln Memorial. It's one of those All-American Scenes In a Movie, maybe not unlike Capra, and with its own sort of commentary on the times. Characters in the film are trustworthy or not, though people can certainly be swayed easily by the media or attention of the sort (like the would-be father/husband to Patricia Neal, who quickly gets to saying where Klaatu is soon as he gets a shot at it). But Wise's gift here, more than social commentary, is with montage, setting up reactions across the world to the alien coming to Earth, or people reacting to the sudden lack of electricity around the world.If I have criticisms of the film, it's that Wise doesn't give that much time at all for build-up to the ship coming to Earth. Maybe that will be a plus for some - don't waste any time, just get to it, and I understand that - but things just quickly HAPPEN in the film, and politicians and the military aren't at all characters really, if barely types. The only people of any consequence are Klaatu (an alien, but closer to that of, I dunno, Jesus Christ himself), and the Neal character and her family. Also, though Rennie is wonderful in his final speech to the planet about peace and understanding vs war and destruction, I found him by and large rather flat in his performance. Not so much by the design of it, I got that as well, just by a total lack of... personality. Which would be fine if the other actors added some extra heft. Only Neal is memorable in that regard, though also subdued.Yet there's much to recommend 'Day' for, like Bernard Herrmann's eerie and landmark score - the kind that would influence many science fiction films to come by how the music sounds like it's being beamed from space or something - and the moments where suspense does really pop out (Neal confronting Gort, and if those words really will stop him from going ape-s***). And most of all, to be sure, is that this is one of that are group of movies where an alien, albeit looking and seeming just like us (probably be design), is here for reasons not of destruction but understanding, of knowledge trumping brawn. It wants to go past how we usually see these INVADERS, and it's not just admirable, it's inspiring when one thinks about it.Ultimately, the reputation of this work really brings so much expectation that, for me, it just didn't reach up to. This may be more on me than for others who come to it; it's very good work cinematically, but it's not "great", and if it is a classic it's mostly due, I think, to its iconic imagery, with the Gort robot certainly a memorable, scarily sleek representation that would be imitated for decades to come. I can't fault the direction that much, aside from a couple of potential missed moments of suspense, because it is made by people who are out to do more than schlock or cheap scares or effects. The work here lasts. I simply wish it connected more for me emotionally, aside from the intellectual experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An alien (Michael Rennie) lands and tells the people of Earth that they must live peacefully or be destroyed as a danger to other planets.Producer Julian Blaustein set out to make a film that illustrated the fear and suspicion that characterized the early Cold War and Atomic Age. He reviewed more than 200 science fiction short stories and novels in search of a storyline that could be used, since this film genre was well suited for a metaphorical discussion of such grave issues. Indeed, anyone who knows philosophy knows that debate and science fiction often overlap. Blaustein later said his aim with the film was to promote a "strong United Nations." That goal likely did not work.The Cold War aspect is obvious, and Frances Bavier makes explicit reference to the Russians invading (via flying saucers). Whether one chooses to see this as a story about the war or the larger picture of humanity's role in keep the Earth safe is up to the viewer.The film was written by Edmund H. North ("Patton"), based on the 1940 science fiction short story "Farewell to the Master" by Harry Bates. The notable score was composed by Bernard Herrmann ("Psycho"). Director Robert Wise needs no introduction, having made a whole string of hits.The film has some humorous moments, too, whether intentional or not. One scene in particular is quite funny, as two characters talk about about the life expectancy of aliens (130 years), while at the same time smoking their cigarettes. Oh, the irony.Today, many see the film for the Christ allegory, which seems to be contrary to Robert Wise's intentions. Censor Joseph Breen wanted the line about "the Almighty", Wise did not, and its inclusion only brought the religious aspects more to the forefront. But even before Breen, it seems this was all intended, whether Wise knew or not. Edmund North said, "It was my private little joke. I never discussed this angle with Blaustein or Wise because I didn't want it expressed. I had originally hoped that the Christ comparison would be subliminal." Interestingly, Danny Elfman noted "The Day the Earth Stood Still" wa&#x200b;s the score that inspired his interest in film composing, and made him a fan of Herrmann. While Paul Reubens and Tim Burton are generally seen as the duo that brought Elfman to Hollywood, maybe Herrmann had planted the seeds decades earlier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could I possibly add that hasn't already been written about this expertly crafted sci-fi classic that 158 film critics (presumably of considerable scholarship coming from the position of being a respected authority either nationally or internationally on the subject of film critique) to say nothing of the 375 user reviews because let's face it, everyone thinks he or she is critic, myself, as limited and meager an offing mine might be, included. Let's recap a few interesting tidbits of trivia most of us know about the film. Oscar winning director Robert Wise ("West Side Story", "The Sound of Music") and Oscar winning screenwriter Edmund H. North (Co-writer: "Patton") claim that the allegorical Christ-reference in alluding to Klaatu's alias while on earth of a certain "Mr. Carpenter" was purely coincidental and unintentional as astonishing as that confession by both men might be 63 years after the film's premiere. Still audiences simply can't resist drawing parallels. Klaatu is other-worldly. Christ demonstrated time and again to his many followers His other-worldliness (transmuting water molecules into wine, defying gravity by walking on water, resuscitating life in one who was pronounced dead by means of an electro-chemical discharge, etc.). Christ delivered a sermon on the mount. Klaatu delivered a message of warning from his interstellar spacecraft, not exactly a mount but close enough. Christ was crucified. Klaatu was shot (twice in fairly close succession during the course of the film). Christ rose again from the dead after lying in a tomb for three days. Klaatu was revived with the personal assist of his traveling companion and intergalactic constable on patrol Gort. Christ then ascended into heaven and after Klaatu had conveyed his warning completing his mission on earth, does likewise. The parallels are not only irresistible, they're unavoidable. And, perhaps for this reason, more than any other any film critic or critic cum movie-lover (first), may have for commenting on this film, this is what resonates most with us who have loved and cherished this film over these many years. Because now, in the new millennium, more so than ever, we need a Christ/Klaatu to come around just to remind us to shape up and fly right...or else!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A "human" alien arrives to direct earth out of it's potential misuses of nuclear power.I liked sci-fi very much as a teenager but drifted away from it. This movie I had heard of and even seen pictures of the large one "eyed" robot but had no idea what it was about. Full of misgivings was very surprised to find it highly entertaining.Will try and point out some things I haven't seen in other reviews. There is a biblical theme in it (I don't care for)...the alien assumes the name Carpenter (ring a bell?) and although actually humanity's Savior the Alien is killed by us and brought back to life by it's own advanced technology.The actors playing Alien (Michael Rennie) Widow (Patricia Neal) and kid (Billy Gray) were very likable and are extremely important in making this work---the special effects are primitive but are believable enough.Oddly I tried to watch 'Upside Down' right before streaming this one---and wanted so much for that movie to work as the visuals are fantastic but the story ruined it for me. Now if they could have gotten actors and more importantly screen writers like this film what a phenomenon....Movie cost $900,000 Grossed $1.8 million.The original Star Trek series copied this plot almost directly with a black cat for a robot and a Miss Lincoln---.RECOMMEND</fullReview>

The film moves at a blistering pace (in fact there is no real build up to the spaceship arriving, which would have made it a little more intriguing) packing social commentary and grand visuals played out to BERNARD HERMANN'sinister sounding score.THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL does provide a blue print for future sci-fi films with its scenes from across the world, including an announcement in Hindi by Calcutta radio. The military mobilization at the beginning of the movie predicts what the sci-fi alien landing genre would eventually turn into.The film is like a novelty, I don't think anyone takes the message seriously anymore. i guess most people love this film for the special effects, PATRICIA NEAL and the attitudes of the 40s-50s.(8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi and the Cold War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still is considered on of the best sci-fi movies to come from the 1950s, standing along side Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It not just serve as a film for sci-fi fans, but also a commentary of the Cold War.A lone alien Klaatu (Michael Rennie) land his flying saucer in the middle of Washington D.C., with a message of good-will and peace, but get shot by a nervous solider. When he asks to meet all of Earth's leaders his request is met with death, so escapes from the American military's custody. On the run Klaatu hides in a boarding house and befriends Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son Bobby (Billy Gray). Seeing the short-term nature of humanity who see the alien as a threat he decides he needs to give the Earth a warning to ensure their listen to him. He has to do it before his robot protector Gort (Lock Martin) attacks humanity.The Day the Earth Stood Still has had an enduring legacy, having been remade in 2008 and been constantly referred to in Alan Moore's Watchmen. It was not only a film that wanted to be a big spectacle but a more thoughtful film about the nature of mankind and it's short-sighted nature and a commentary about the Cold War and the nuclear arms race, which would have led to the end of live as we know it.The special effects and action sequences are cheesy, particularly by today's standards but the director Richard Wise compensates through his characters and overall themes. His direction is more subtle looking at the world through Klaatu's eyes, with simple looks at the characters and their reactions. This is a film with likable characters where no one is treated as truly evil. The scene when Klaatu makes his final speech is particularly memorable.The acting of the main cast is decent, pretty standard for the period. Gray was not a particularly good child actor. But Rennie was very strong in the lead role as an alien not use to Earth's customs, a creature who is logical but believes in his cause. He is far from being a dull character.Obviously this is a film that does stretch believable logic, but it is worth watching.</fullReview>

This film is epic for many reasons. The brilliant effects of the flying saucer and the epic Gort that shoots optic beams. It also has a good story and that catchy sci-fi appeal that a person like myself can come to enjoy. It's too bad the 2008 remake wasn't like this. It's so bad, it deserves to be taken aboard a spaceship and taken to a far away to a far away planet. But Wise's film is epic and fantastic, and remains one of my favorite sci-fi flicks.</fullReview>

It's stoic and it's slow moving, it doesn't have frenetic action, but it stays with you, even though it's not flawless.The movie is really good and it really wasn't necessary to make a Remake ... but the went ahead and made one in 2008.

		<fullReview>There are times a man or woman should question films made today and say, "where did these ideas come from?". For the drama genre, the influences of films today root from "Citizen Kane" and "12 Angry Men". The family friendly films root from the first Disney-made movies. For the sci fi genre today, everything roots from "The Day the Earth Stood Still"."Star Wars", "Star Trek", and most definitely "Plan 9 from Outer Space" have gotten a piece of "TDTESS" in their plots. Even "Wall E" looks as if it has a little piece of it as well. What did this film have that made the other Sci fi films modeled after it? Well first, there is an invasion of an alien from another planet. Not a scaly, tentacled, monster; but a Caucasian coming from a race 10 times the intelligence and resource of our own. So well educated this race is that war is not an option.Second, he comes with a warning. This warning is in the form of preventing space exploration because a bunch of indestructible robots will destroy earth.Hollywood is in the production of remaking this classic for a new generation. Personally, it seems hard to replace "space exploration" with "destruction of ozone layer" or "communism" with "terrorism". I think remaking this will only accomplish 2 things; taking away its original morals for Michael Bay-ish boom booms and making the quick dollar off of people hoping for the same movie.I don't give movies 10 stars unless it inspires others. This did.</fullReview>

But, all good things must come to an end eventually.The plot is something that is much needed in this mess of a 21st century. An alien and his unstoppable, 8 ft tall, assistant robot come to Earth, in hopes of ending violence on the planet before it spreads to other worlds.The cast was exceptional. Michael Rennie was extraordinary as the alien Klaatu. He gave such a performance that it is sure to stick with the viewer for quite a while. Patricia Neal also gave an award-winning performance as Helen Benson, the only one besides Klaatu who can stop the destruction of the Earth. Billy Gray was excellent playing the part of Bobby Benson, Helen's son and Klaatu's new human best buddy. Lock Martin did a fantastic job as Gort, the silent, very trimmed and obedient robot assistant of Klaatu. And Sam Jaffe showed some great talent as Professor Barnhardt, the intelligent man who listens to Klaatu well.The effects were first rate, especially by 1951 standards.I'm only sad that they are remaking this movie. I can only hope they have enough sense to cease production, that way this movie is not completely overlooked by some modern, overly done, effects-filled Hollywood hit.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day the Earth Stood Still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Patrick Johns Humanities 10 8-29-04 Movie ReviewThe movie we watched in class, The Day the Earth Stood Still, was interesting in two main ways. This movie contradicted itself many times but the point of the movie still applies to today's world. Klaatu believed in no violence but he would fight violence with violence. The point of the movie, which was to live in peace or there will be consequences, has still not been accomplished in today's world.This movie contradicted itself many times about violence. Klaatu's speech states, 'We have and organization for the mutual protection of all planets and for the complete elimination of aggression.' Then, Klaatu contradicts himself by saying, 'At the first signs of violence they act automatically against the aggressor.' He contradicts himself further by saying, 'It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet, but if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder.' Klaatu during the movie brags many times about how his planet is free from violence and they all live in peace. However, Klaatu now says he will fight violence with violence. This means his planet is not totally free from violence and peace. Also, the policemen from his planet act only when they see violence. This is another example that people on his planet are still being violent or they would not have a need for policemen in the first place.The theme of this movie is humans need to find a way to live in complete peace and without violence. If we don't live in peace we may end up destroying ourselves. This goal is still trying to be accomplished in today's world. This goal may take millions and millions of years to complete but we need to make progress every single day. It's like Klaatu said, if we don't start living in peace and without violence, there will be consequences. Character list: 1. Klaatu (man from outer space also known as Mr. Carpenter). Played by Michael Rennie. 2. Helen Benson played by Patricia Neal. 3. Tom Stevens played by Hugh Marlowe. Insurance salesmen and Helen's boyfriend. 4. Bobby Benson played by Billy Gray. 5. Professor Barnhardt played by Sam Jaffe. A very brilliant scientist. 6. Mrs. Barley played by Frances Bavier. A guest in the boarding house. 7. Gort played by Lock Martin. Klaatu's robot. 8.

		<shortDescription>The SETI Phone Rings, and ..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is told in three parts. The first, and weakest of the three, is an affected, clumsy study in mob behavior. The spaceship lands, Klaatu appears, and every reaction to his appearance is either an attempt to get closer out of some lurid curiosity, or suspicious fear bordering on paranoia. The alien Klaatu is shot within moments of disembarking his ship.There is some real truth here about why we might not want to answer the SETI telephone when and if it rings, but it is shallow, unsophisticated and undeveloped. The middle is a standard caper flick with the alien and the boy who befriends him on the run, as it were, seeing the sights of Washington DC. They walk everywhere. While it's possible to do that, I know because I have, it's not particularly plausible. When my attention is drawn to insignificant little details like that, the details are not insignificant.The final third, everything from the blackout to closing credits, is the sci-fi thriller we all love. Bernard Herrmann's score is eerie, atonal, and annoying early-on, trying to build mystery, mood and suspense, I suppose. It undermined rather than developed the suspense, but in the last part of the film, the music changed, and was much more effective. Part Three has many of the parts we love: the worldwide blackout; Gort on the prowl, vaporizing two guards (a moment when we suddenly realize Klaatu's quest is deadly serious business); Klaatu's death and resurrection, and that wonderful line about the "Almighty Spirit" associated with it; and, of course, the magnificent closing soliloquy: "Join us .. or be obliterated.!"Michael Rennie is terrific here. Yes, he is wooden, unable to move, it would appear, from the waist up, but that stiffness is a very believable quality in this role as an alien trying to pass as human. I thought Sam Jaffe as the Professor, and Frank Conroy (uncredited) as the President's Secretary were also very good in supporting roles. 7 out of 10, but I wanted to like it so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy of all the praise bestowed upon it, as long as you don't read the story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I love this movie, I would dearly love to see it remade closer to the original intent of the author, much as John Carpenter remade 'The Thing' to reflect some semblance of the story 'Who Goes There?' I think the movie-makers of the 50's and 60's must have thought that we weren't sophisticated or grown-up enough to handle the concepts in these two short-story masterpieces.None of that detracts from the great performances in this film, the theramin soundtrack, and the clear anti-war message. I must say, however, that the Christian symbolism escaped me completely. I guess I was too busy looking for the Harry Bates concept to emerge.Everyone should see this, and read the story by Harry Bates, most easily found in the anthology 'The Past Through Tomorrow,' which also just happens to include 'Who Goes There.'Who will bring me Gnut instead of Gort?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for its time, but the 2008 version is superior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this version and the 2008 remake back-to-back and was curious to determine which one was better. I'll have to go with the 2008 version because this 1951 version is too dated. Although Michael Rennie as Klaatu is arguably superior to Keanu Reeves, I like the fish-our-of-water approach Reeves took, sort of Spock-like. Basically, the 2008 version took everything about this version and made it better: color, drama, f/x, Gort, the Christian typology and the spectacular apocalyptic climax.That said, this '51 version was great for its time and is definitely worthy of one's video library. It has a nice eerie 50's sci-fi score.Although some parts of this version are just lame and boring, I found it interesting to see how the USA was back in 1950, the way people dressed and talked, etc. Other than that, though, the 2008 version is leagues superior in every conceivable way. Unless your thoroughly tainted by nostalgia, it's the simple truth. Maybe YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.GRADE: B+ (considering its era)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Listen to the Wise Alien!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is considered as one of the greatest landmarks in Sci-Fi cinema, and righteously so, as it epitomizes plentiful of trademarks directly linked to the genre. The film baths in an atmosphere of mass paranoia and fear, but still the script is more of a political statement rather than a story about planetary invasion. "The Day the Earth Stood Still" was one of the very first Sci-Fi classics to come out in the 1950's ? a decade famous amongst genre fanatics for all its versatile outings ? and still remains one of the most solid ones, thanks to the heavyweight morals in the script and the surefooted direction of Robert Wise. Still relatively shortly after the end of WWII, this movie came with an ambitious and definitely admirable message. Superior alien races, with technologies and medical wisdom that is far more advanced than ours, put the entire earthly population to an ultimatum: stop all the senseless political turmoil and particularly the development of nuclear warfare, if not we will all face the disastrous consequences. The transfer of this message already goes horribly wrong, as the humanoid alien Klaatu is immediately gunned down by nervous military men as soon as he lands his flying saucer in the middle of Washington D.C. Humanity is even more petrified when Klaatu's ten ft. tall and indestructible pet robot Gort emerges from the spaceship and vaporizes the earthly artillery. Klaatu subsequently dismantles his robot and decides to go 'undercover' for a while, renting a room as Mr. Carpenter and living with a widow and her inquisitive 12-year-old son. "The Day The Earth Stood Still" might have lost a little bit of its impact over the past sixty years (not a whole lot though), it contains numerous sequences that are timelessly classic and forever will be, like the global power breakdown and ? of course ? the legendary "Klaatu Barada Nikto" words. It's simply a great film with a wonderful cast and many of the best dialogs ever written. If you look at the film with skeptical post-2000 eyes, you'll find plentiful of charming defaults (like extremely slow-moving robots moving around half of Washington without being spotted) and primitive special effects, but it's all part of its bona fide classic status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That power cannot be revoked"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although science fiction cinema can be said to go back as far as Melies and his Trip to the Moon, it took a long time to establish its character and clichés. The Day the Earth Stood Still has earned its place in history for turning sci-fi into a genre in its own right.One thing that makes The Day the Earth Stood Still different from earlier sci-fi pictures is that it adds an element of horror. It not only attempts to terrify us with the thought an extra-terrestrial threat, it actually borrows techniques from the horror genre to unsettle us. Director Robert Wise's earliest assignments were at Val Lewton's B-unit at RKO, and he had slipped in touches of Lewton-esquire horror atmospherics, where appropriate, into the handful of thrillers and Westerns he had made since then. He subtly continues this pattern here, adding layers of creepiness to many scenes with low-key lighting, distant vanishing points and looming framing devices. Bernard Hermann's theremin score compliments this mood.The Day the Earth Stood Still is also unusual in that its story is told on a global scale, and needs to show events going on simultaneously all over the world ? something that was quite unusual in cinema prior to this. This is where Robert Wise's background as an editor comes in. Although no longer cutting the pictures himself, he shows awareness of what an editor needs. Take those opening scenes in which the spaceship is first spotted ? the sense of movement and lighting in each shot seems aimed at making each one compliment the next. The actual editor William Reynolds (one of the best in the business; he also did the job on The Godfather) uses Wise's material to put together some powerful sequences, expertly building up the intensity as panic spreads across the globe, or dropping back down to an eerie calm.You can see why people love The Day the Earth Stood Still. There is power and profundity to the message, the plot is nicely balanced and the analogy to the Jesus story is well-defined but not overstated (although funnily Klaatu's ultimatum is more reminiscent of the Old Testament God who sent the deluge). And yet on closer inspection it does have its flaws. The dialogue is fairly trite and some moments are just daft. The acting is mediocre, and it seems faintly ridiculous how obvious Michael Rennie's RADA accent is when he speaks in the alien language. Like Fight Club or Memento today, this is one of those "clever" films that wows people first time round, but won't seem so amazing on repeated viewings. It may be an important picture in cinema history, and it is certainly memorable, but it isn't a brilliantly put together package and doesn't hold up as entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soft spot in my heart for this fun-filled sci-fi film from the past...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL may have lost some of its punch in this day of CGI generated thrills, and it always was a rather slow moving story that gradually builds to an interesting climax--but it has a soft spot in my heart as one of the first sci-fi thrillers that got me interested in this genre.PATRICIA NEAL claims that she felt awfully silly uttering some of her lines spoken to Klaatu and I don't blame her. In fact, when it comes right down to it (and seen from a different perspective years later), the reaction to this space alien all seems rather overdone and on the plus side of being unbelievable. But it still manages to hold the interest because everyone in the cast seems to believe in the story with solemn faces and earnest performances.MICHAEL RENNIE is quietly effective and dignified as Klaatu, and HUGH MARLOWE, SAM JAFFE and little BILLY GRAY are satisfying in supporting roles. Robert Wise directs with a flair for this sort of thing and it's just plain fun to watch the tale unfold in almost documentary fashion. It's no WAR OF THE WORLDS, but it's sci-fi fun that still clicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great idea, but not really that well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This would have been one of the greatest "Twilight Zone" episodes ever done, but stretching it out to a full-length movie left it without much action or character development. There is the twist at the end that the robot is really the one in charge, but that doesn't really matter. It's the idea that we are too violent to be left alive and would be a threat to the rest of the galaxy if we don't change our ways that is a theme in many other science fiction books and stories. That some good is found in some people and that we have promise as a species so we are to be spared is the point of the movie, but I wonder if that is really true.This is still a very good movie, and the lack of special effects is not the problem. The depth of the characters and our ability to relate to them is the real problem. I found myself wishing the robot would destroy the earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a Sci-Fi movie, the film 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' has quite realistic and mind-thinking themes and conflicts. Klaatu, an alien from another planet, lands on earth and tells the people that they must live peacefully. If they do not succeed in this, then they will be destroyed in result from possibly endangering other planets. My overall personal opinion of the movie was positive. I enjoyed this film, even though I don't really care at all for Sci-Fi movies or old ones in general. I was pleasantly surprised to find that even though this movie was made in 1951, it still can make sense in our world today.Unlike other Sci-Fi or thriller movies in the market today, this movie made the aliens out to be the 'good guys'. They came in peace, and their purposeful destination was to bring a helpful suggestion to stop violence all together on Earth. Klaatu, one of the main characters, was made to seem just like a real human being. The actor, Michael Rennie, did a fine job on the acting. For this movie being made in 1951, the special affects were surprisingly good and not too weird. Another great aspect of this film was the music. The suspense-building music gave the movie a bonus. The little extras of this movie pulled 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' together.Like all movies, there were also negative parts to it. I personally did not care for the robot's costume. It seemed too unrealistic. Also, there were parts of the ending I didn't like. I wish the ending would have continued to show how Helen and her son Bobby ended up. It felt like these two important characters didn't have a big enough role in the ending. Another of my disappointments occurred during the speech that Klaatu gave for the people. The cure for violence on Earth would be for robots to have absolute power over humans. If a human showed violent actions, the robots would seek him/her and destroy that person. I think this solution would solve a lot of problems and save lots of lives since there would be no war or fighting, but the first time you make a mistake, you would not get the chance to make it right, you would right away be destroyed. This action is a little too harsh and strong for me.Overall I would rate this film as 7 out of 10. For a movie that I would not normally pick out for myself, I liked it a lot better then I would have expected to. I liked how the movie, being so old, actually goes along with the world today. Besides some of the parts during the ending, this movie kept my attention and was thoroughly enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughts and Comments on The Day The Earth Stood Still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood StillThis movie portrayed a very important message in a very different, unique way. It's categorized as a science fiction film. It had interesting input throughout the entire film. The characters in the film are Klaatu, who plays as a man namd Mr Carpenter. He was very intelligent, compassionate, understanding, and ideally what a perfect person would be like. There was the boy, Bobby Benson, who Mr. Carpenter chose to reach out to. Also in the movie was Bobby's mother, Helen Benson, who had an impact on the movie. Mr. Carpenter came to earth with a purpose, and he found the perfect people to help display what he wanted to be done. I think when he reaches out to the boy, who is in the later generation shows significance to the movie. Mr. Carpenter's message to Bobby, shows that he not only wanted changes are Earth to be made now, but later on, too. His purpose was to wake us up and realize we aren't headed in the right direction. We don't show human rights, like they should be acted upon. I think the deeper message to this movie was that we're disregarding what human rights are meant to be. He wanted us to know that, and to take action on it. If we don't work on it, then we won't get anywhere, just hateful people who lie to each other and themselves.The movie should have shown a different way to derive its message, you can't get a great understanding of what the movie is about until Klaatu's major speech at the end of the movie. The science fiction kind of made the movie unrealistic and it didn't help get its message across that way. Although the setting and plot was idealistically incorrect, it still brought a great understanding of the changes we need to make as humans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day the Earth Stood Still, The (1951) **** (out of 4) One of the all time great sci-fi films has an alien (Michael Rennie) landing in Washington D.C. hoping to talk with the world leaders warning them that the Earth will be over if they continue doing bad things. This here is probably the film that kick started the countless sci-fi flicks that would follow throughout the decade. While there have been countless imitators there's no denying that this is the greatest of them all and the simple nature of the story also makes it one of the best films ever made. The simple nature of the story is the reason I think the film works so well because instead of some silly, over the top storyline we've got something that comes off as real and not fiction. The simple nature of the storytelling also makes the film seem all the more realistic and, again, this here makes the film come off more as drama than some silly fiction. The thought of the world's fighting could cause damage to other planets and then having those planets attack is a pretty easy thing to think about and understand. Rennie never gets enough credit but his performance also brings realism to the film that helps it. He has to give several speeches about how bad things could get on Earth and a lesser performance would have had these scenes come off as campy but that's not the case here. Patricia Neal also comes off very good in her supporting role. Another amazing thing about this film is how it's story is pretty much timeless and could work in any decade. The film also benefits from Bernard Herrmann's brilliant music score, which in my opinion is one of the greatest ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very very small number of 50s sci-fi films are truly perfect films and this is one of them--along with INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. Not only does this have wonderful production values and acting, but the story itself transcends the "bug-eyed monster" aspect of sci-fi and is metaphorical because it provides ample material we can apply to our own lives today. The aliens in this case are not mindless destroyers, beings intent on inseminating our women or out to do us serious harm--but they are also far from perfect themselves and I like this about the movie.Michael Rennie ("Klaatu") lands on the Mall in Washington, DC. And, humans being distrustful and stupid, take a friendly gesture on his part as an act of aggression and shoot him! Later, after escaping and hiding out among the humans to recuperate, Klaatu returns to warn humans to shape up or face annihilation by his planet because they are afraid of how dangerous humans are now that we have the bomb! Frankly, I think the writers of the film have good points--people ARE stupid and we came pretty darn close to destroying ourselves in the 1950s. Insightful, intelligent and with lasting appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Wise's recent death brings "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to mind. Some of the things in the movie are clearly a product of the '50s, namely the public's blind trust of the government (made evident early in the movie when the people crowd around the spacecraft without any protection; for all that anyone knew, that spacecraft could have been radioactive). But still, this story of alien Klaatu (Michael Rennie) coming to Earth to warn humanity about the dangers of war seems especially relevant given the current state of the world. Patricia Neal is particularly good as Helen Benson, an every-woman who takes Klaatu into her apartment (without knowing who he is). And Klaatu's wordless cohort Gort is really something, as is the now famous line "Klaatu barada nikto." All in all, "TDTESS" isn't your average sci-fi movie. There are no scenes of scared crowds running away from something, or rays blowing up buildings. In fact, it might not suffice to call this a sci-fi movie. I don't want to use the phrase "social commentary", but it's something like that. We could all learn something from Klaatu.</fullReview>

As a point of departure, I'd like to construct a character study of a few of the characters. The fiancé as an insurance salesman seemed to be a condemnation of that profession. Professor Barnhardt as a prototype of Einstein, seems to be a persecuted Jewish scientist who, like Einstein came up with theories that were used as blueprints for weapons of mass destruction, but in his old age wants to correct things through the humanitarian efforts of saving the world, instead of being responsible for helping to make it possible to destroy it.

		<fullReview>Oh my, is this movie silly. Well intentioned, but dumb. That's why, of the 4 points I gave to it, 2 go just for good intentions. Besides that, there's not much to salvage and I cannot figure out why it has become such a cultural icon while other far better films?Forbidden Planet, The Day the Earth Caught Fire, Them!--get mostly ignored. For starters, there are at least 4 things right at the beginning that reveal the hand of an amateur. First, there is absolutely no building up of tensions, no instilled foreboding, no anticipation. The spaceship is detected in the radar, the wire sends the news, and minutes later it lands on a Wash. mall. So, we have been told: this is not WOTW. Meanwhile, breaking away from their usually overly cautious approach to this kind of incident, authorities give full account to the masses, knowing well that this may provoke mass hysteria. And what about that robot in underwear, or those are really diapers? There must be a message there and one I'm not sure I want to hear. And why authorities allow civilians to get that close to the ship, one that could well be a secret weapon, even a bacteriological one sent by the Cold War enemy? And later, why nobody bothers to get a mug shot of the alien, while he's still in custody? And how smart Bobby can be, when he logically concludes, after seeing Carpenter entering the spaceship, that he must be...wait for it: a diamond smuggler! Or why a guy superb at Maths must forcibly be a space alien; and why should he be instantly capable of recognizing Dr. Bernhart's equations?Then, there is Klaatu. Boy, is this guy clueless about the world he comes to reform, even after having travelled 250 million miles, during which time he could have taken care of reading something about us earthlings. For ex., he lands in Washington and brings a gift to the U.S. president but then he declares he must talk to ALL heads of State. The premiers of Burkina Faso and Gabon must be thrilled! But no wonder the yanks are P.O. Later, when he gets to the boarding house, things get preachy as we're invited to see things his way and to conclude with him that us humans are indeed, after all, a primitive, violent species. As the story drags on we see that still Klaatu doesn't have a clue about our world as he insists--with his usual condescending tone--that he must see...well, his expectations are a bit lower by now as he would accept instead philosophers and scientists. A little bit more he has to wait and he'll probably settle for the coaches of all national soccer teams. But the most ridiculous thing about the whole thing is the message he brings us: be nice or be fried! Funny thing, I got the same message from Clockwork Orange and they didn't need a spaceship to deliver it. So, at the end Klaatu has bothered to travel half a billion miles both ways just to show us he's not much different from us; that if we come to displease him, or rather his stormtroopers, they'll zap us to oblivion. If that's the Galactic Order, I can do without. Klaatu barada...Aw, why bother</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever aliens from outer space visit our planet, there are three possibilities. The first is that the aliens are good, but we want to kill them because we just don't understand them, as in "It Came from Outer Space" (1953). The second is that the aliens are evil and we have to defend ourselves, as in "Earth vs. the Flying Saucers" (1956). All alien invasion plots were one or the other for a long time. Eventually, a third possibility emerged in which the aliens are good and we get along with them just fine, as in the movie "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (1977)."The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a strange combination of the first two. Klaatu is an alien from an unspecified planet in our solar system. He has come to destroy every creature on this planet, if we don't do what he says. That's every creature, mind you, not just man, but animals too. So, he is evil and we need to destroy him, right? Wrong! Like a Necker cube, at various times the movie flips and it is Klaatu who is good while we are in the wrong. Helen Benson says that the spaceman may not be a menace at all, and that he is just afraid. The movie approves of her sentiment. Her fiancé, Tom Stevens, believes that the spaceman is a menace, but the movie wants us to regard him as narrow-minded and prejudiced. As a result, we get this incongruous depiction of an alien who is kind and lovable and good, but who will wipe out our entire planet if we don't obey him.What he insists upon, it turns out, is that we not extend out violent ways into space, thereby threatening his civilization and that of other planets. Because the movie is set contemporaneously, the year is 1951, and it will be several years before the Soviets even manage to launch Sputnik. So we are not about to extend our violence any time soon. But never mind that. Klaatu says he is losing patience and may have to level New York to get everyone's attention. That sounds pretty evil, but then the Necker cube flips, and he is seen having a warm conversation with Professor Barnhardt, who does not seem to be the least appalled by Klaatu's threats to kill everybody.Barnhardt, you see, is a scientist. In a right-wing movie, it is the government along with the military and the police who are good, while the scientists are dangerous, because they want to communicate with the aliens or study them. But this is a left-wing movie, where scientists are good and politicians are bad, or at least pigheaded and narrow-minded. Barnhardt agrees to get scientists from all over the world to listen to Klaatu (apparently it takes a scientist to understand Klaatu's threat to destroy all life on this planet).Earlier in the movie, when the Necker cube flips and Klaatu is basically a good alien, he decides to find out what earthlings are like. He seems impressed by the goodness of humans; he is deeply moved by the words of Lincoln; and he is fond of Helen and Bobby. But then the Necker cube flips back, and he is once again threatening us with destruction, as if we were the scourge of the universe, and that includes Helen and Bobby.Barnhardt suggests that instead of leveling New York, Klaatu should demonstrate his power without hurting anyone. Klaatu does this by neutralizing electricity all over the world, causing the electricity to go off, not only in buildings but also in engines, excepting only airplanes and hospitals. During the blackout, Klaatu and Helen are trapped on an elevator. By the time the power comes back on, he has confided in her and now she trusts him. "He's not a menace," she says to Tom. But Tom thinks Klaatu is a menace, which he clearly is. So, to keep us from siding with Tom, he is revealed to be an unpleasant character. He lets Helen know that telling the army where they can find Klaatu will allow him to write his own ticket, be the biggest man in the country, get his picture in all the papers, and be a hero. We should have suspected something like this when we found out he was a life insurance salesman. Needless to say, that engagement is off.Finally, Klaatu delivers his message, saying that Gort is one of a race of robots who patrol the planets. If any planet steps out of line, it is incinerated. And they are like a doomsday machine, which cannot be turned off. Then Klaatu and Gort fly away.As I said, this is a left-wing movie. Conservatives have always been suspicious of the United Nations, fearing a loss of sovereignty, accusing liberals of wanting our nation to submit to some supranational government in charge of a new world order. This takes that idea to the next level. Now there is a kind of United Planets, and it is Earth that has lost its sovereignty. The attitude of this movie is that this is a good thing.I have always fantasized about a sequel, in which Americans capture one of the flying saucers with a robot on board, and reverse engineer them until we have an army of robots and a fleet of flying saucers of our own, which we then use to destroy all those arrogant aliens and colonize their planets. At the end of the movie, with America triumphant, the president gives a victory speech, saying that our new manifest destiny has been achieved because we are a God-fearing people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprise, Its Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched The Day the Earth Stood Still for the first time this past week. I can honestly say that I was shocked--this movie is really good, and not just as tacky entertainment. It has a clever idea, a message, and a follow-through that are all well-conceived. The special effects are, well, primitive, but this is 1951 after all.For me, there were three phases to watching the movie. In the first phase, we get a dose of the tacky special effects as a flying saucer lands on the mall in Washington DC and a robot from the old Lost in Space TV series comes out. At this point, we think, uh oh, this is a prequel to Plan Nine from Outer Space--should be good for a few laughs.We then get introduced to the main character, Klaatu, who is an alien with a message of peace. He is definitely a friendly alien, and wants to achieve his aims without violence. The goal is to warn the earth--live in peace or face obliteration, and as he tries to spread his message, he is faced with fearful people who want to capture and kill him.It is at this point where we enter the second phase of viewing the movie, when we realize he is an allegory for Jesus (Mr. Carptenter!). We then go UH OH, they aren't really going there, are they? We settle back for the train wreck that we think will happen.And then the miracle occurs--the train wreck does not happen. There are amazing scenes--like when the alien views with sadness and compassion the war dead at Arlington Cemetery, including the father of the small boy he is babysitting for the day. The frightful and cool scene where the alien peacefully demonstrates his power over the Earth. The truly edgy car chase as the alien is pursued in the streets of Washington. The story gets going, the characters really come to life, and allegory works--it is powerful stuff. This movie is no joke--it is a classic with a message that I think even the subject of the allegory would have appreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An alien spaceship lands in Washington and a man from another planet emerges with a message for Earthlings. This is a quintessential sci-fi from the 1950s, perhaps the peak decade for the genre. Rennie is perfectly cast as the alien, with his gaunt looks and tall, slender build. The plot is simplistic and silly of course, with little attempt at any logic, and the message is somewhat forced, a product of its times. It's solidly directed by Wise, but he overdoes the global reactions to the alien's actions. Herrmann provides an appropriately other-worldly score, although his best work was yet to come in Hitchcock's films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destroying the earth - Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If media reflects its society's culture, then the Hollywood blockbuster, the most expensive and complex media around, may hold the key to Western society's deepest fears.Emerson said that "fiction reveals the truth that reality obscures." Some commentators (including Baudrillard) have said that Independence Day (1996) foresaw the events of 9/11 ? that it gave an insight into the subconscious hatred of American hegemony.I've just seen The Day The Earth Stood Still (2008), Keanu Reeve's latest sci-fi vehicle. It seems to me, that ever since Independence Day in 1996, Hollywood has been producing and exporting a wide variety of disaster movies which centre around the theme of "destruction of the earth." Communications Theory can be seen as an offshoot of Sociology ? what this means is that, for a Communications theorist, newspapers, magazines, books, television, cinema and advertising are all open to interpretation. The hope is that, by interpreting or deconstructing these media, we gain a deeper insight into our society, and possibly human nature.In the 50s, Hollywood was obsessed with aliens and monsters wreaking destruction upon the earth. These images are said to have been manufactured as a conscious effort in the propaganda war against Communism ? Communism being the destructive alien or monster.But it's too simplistic to say that in the 50s, Hollywood alien movies represented communism and now alien movies represent the threat of Islamic terrorism.The Day The Earth Stood Still is a remake of a 1951 movie, but the alien depicted in the original was hardly threatening. Actually, he brought with him a message of pacifism, calm and logic. His message was one of peace not subversion and war. Also, Independence Day was made before 9/11.The events of 9/11 temporarily abated film projects involving urban destruction, but only briefly. Spielberg's War of the Worlds (2005) and Cloverfield (2008) have definitive, obvious references to 9/11.There are several references to 9/11 in the The Day The Earth Stood Still: people running from smoke and dust in Manhattan, the dead father of the child in the film, who went to war to build, the child constantly shouting "why should we help them?" (the "them" being the aliens ? representing Muslims). More telling still, The Secretary of Defence now represents America ? not the President.The film reads like a party political broadcast for Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth, and is one a growing number of films including The Day After Tomorrow (2004), and M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening (2008), that purports to warn us about the dangers if we don't treat our planet right. Nature is literally fighting back in these films.What else do all these films have in common? They consistently show the destruction of structures. Starting with Independence Day, notice the buildings that get blown to smithereens: most notably The White House and The Empire State Building. The first building signifies the destruction of democracy, the second, the imminent demise of the American empire.In The Happening too, Shyamalan shows us that only the North East of America is affected ? why? The North East represents the centre of Finance, Print Media, Television and News in America. Along with California, the North East is the wealthiest part of the US. It is as if Shyamalan is saying, all these structures have gone to ****.The Brooklyn Bridge has been destroyed twice: once in I Am Legend (2007), and once in Cloverfield. Could this signify souring relations between those in Manhattan and those in Brooklyn? Or, is it as some critics have said, that "Manhattan is America" and the destruction of the bridge signifies a wider chasm of American separateness."Liberty" has been under attack several times: in The Day After Tomorrow, we see The Statue of Liberty buried in snow ? frozen; in Cloverfield, J. J. Abrams violently decapitates Liberty, hurling it like a weapon. Like in 1968, when we first saw Liberty damaged, buried in the sand in Planet of the Apes.Let us now look at the social representations in the films. Many of the films allude to the separation from loved ones: The Day after Tomorrow, The War of the Worlds, The Happening, Cloverfield, Independence Day, Armageddon (1998), I Am Legend and Deep Impact (1998) to name a few. But these films do not only show separation; they also reveal complex relationships and themes of adoption and surrogate parenting.In I Am Legend, Will Smith finds "a wife" and child that are not his own; in War of the Worlds, Tom Cruise is estranged from his children ? a useless dad. In Armageddon, Liv Tyler has no mother; in the Happening, Mark Walberg is "chasing" his own wife and is forced to look after a friend's child. In Independence Day, Will Smith is going out with an "exotic dancer" who has a child ? he has taken on the child as his own. In The Day The Earth Stood Still, it gets more complex still: the female lead is forced to look after a child that is not her own after the father and mother have died. What does this all mean?Hollywood would never have made films like these twenty years ago. What we can see is an obvious breaking down of the traditional family units of the last 100 years; traditional society is literally being torn apart, with a new restructuring of family and community taking shape.Former Mayor Ed Koch, who now keeps himself busy by reviewing movies for several newspapers in Manhattan, has attributed the persistence of the destruction theme to "edifice envy." "They want to see our skyscrapers destroyed because they are envious of them," Mr. Koch has said. We can only assume the "they" is the rest of the world.Then again, all these theories could just be a lot of bull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic yes, perfect, far from it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MILD SPOILERSThis is a great classic film, it has some of the best effects of the decade. Some of the best performances I've seen for this kind of film. Gort is way cool, and with the huge budget of almost a million, the production values were through the roof. But enough of the good stuff, let's talk about the major flaw with it. People always talk about how perfect this film is. Well, I don't think so. It's kind of slow, even for a fifties flick. Then the concept of the rest of the universe if peaceful except Earth. I find that hard to believe that we as humans are the only creatures in this vast universe that wages war. I find the theory that technologically advanced equals peaceful. That crud and everyone knows it. I mean, warlike people would destroy themselves before reaching that far is also crud, after all in the movie we were about to go into space. Hence the "warning" from space. So if we can be warlike and not destroy ourselves and reach some technology others can to. The theory is flawed and the movie is flawed. But not enough to ruin it. It's still an excellent classic that deserves recognition for what it did right. It's also nice to see a nice alien in a fifties movie. All and all I give it 8 STARS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A flying saucer lands in Washington DC and an alien being named Klaatu emerges. His mission is to meet with heads of all Earth nations and deliver an ultimatum not to develop weapons capable of threatening outer space. Will mankind heed the warning ?Based on an great short story by Harry Bates and with a first-rate script, this terrific sci-fi classic (along with The Thing) kick-started the boom of exciting and imaginative fantasy films of the fifties. It's a three-act movie, each of which is engrossing and visually brilliant. Firstly, the UFO landing in the park and the appearance of Klaatu and his giant, foreboding, faceless robot Gort. Secondly, Billy and Mr Carpenter's thought-provoking odyssey through the city, which is my favourite part. And finally, the suspenseful conclusion as the military net closes in on Klaatu and he delivers his final message. It's a great yarn on several levels - as an escapist adventure, a global military-political treatise and a messianic allegory, complete with resurrection scene. Rennie is pretty unforgettable in the lead, playing the alien with stiff, polite sincerity, but also warmth, humour and trenchant purposefulness. Highly influential (see Starman particularly), with excellent photography throughout and a great creepy score by Bernard Herrmann. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Starry Messenger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superior example of the SF films so popular during the 1950s. Oh, the plot is full of holes and some of the characters are cardboard but it's enjoyable nonetheless and, more than that, thought provoking.Is the plot full of holes? Well, I don't really know exactly what that means, but the fact is that I have no idea how Klaatu (Michael Rennie) gets out of his locked room at Walter Reed Hospital without breaking through the door or the walls. I also don't know how it's possible for an 8-foot giant robot with a head the size of a beanbag chair to walk across the city of Washington, DC, melt the wall of a government building, pick up the dead body of an alien, and carry it back across town with no one bothering to notice. What do they do, pay Gort what sociologists call "civil inattention"? And how does Klaatu manage to open the door to Professor Barnhardt's study when Bobby can't? I should say that not all of the characters are cardboard. I was thinking mainly of Pat Neal's boyfriend Tom (Hugh Marlowe), a slimy creep from beginning to end. That mellifluous baritone didn't fool me for a minute. Just watch him light up with glee as he scopes that diamond! And his best scene -- shooing away Pat Neal while he squeals over the phone to the general about Klaatu's whereabouts, telling her, "Just wait till I get my picture in the papers. You'll feel differently." I had my picture in the papers once and look where I am now -- The Landru Home for the Criminally Insane, without possibility of grounds privileges! Rennie's Klaatu is not cardboard but is still a bit of a puzzle. Okay, his planet has been monitoring our transmissions for years. So Klaatu, as we would expect, is not only tall and handsome in an ectomorphic way but is gracious and polite as well. He knows all the interactional graces. ("Well, I'll say good-night again.") Well then how come he doesn't know the word "jittery" and isn't familiar with a music box? Huh? There's also a certain smugness about him that I'm not sure I cared for. He smiles and shakes his head with slight amusement at our stupidity.The kid wasn't much better, but I've always like Patricia Neal. Not sure why. She's not a knockout beauty and not a bravura actress but she seems to radiate a sort of integrity or stability that most of the rest of us could use a shot of from time to time.The message that Klaatu brings to Earth is an engaging one. No more of that aggression business on the geopolitical front. At least I think that's what his message is. He himself doesn't actually clarify it. If you people persist, we will destroy your rogue planet. On Klaatu's planet they have outlawed aggression and turned enforcement over to the interplanetary police, of which Gort is an example. The powers of the police cannot be revoked. At the first sign of aggression they turn the aggressor to toast.I've heard this movie called "fascist" because nobody wants a police force that has zero tolerance for aggression or anything else. But I'm not so sure. We have a police simulacrum built into our brains already. The brain is roughly dividable into three parts: (1) the reptilian brain that governs primitive functions like smelling and breathing, (2) the mammalian brain which generates and channels emotions like love and rage, and (3) the human brain, for lack of a better term, the huge cortex that sits on top of the others and damps down and regulates the more primitive emotions. If you remove the cortex in, say, a cat, what you get are digital emotions, either no anger at all or a full-blown rage.The problem with our built-in cop is that, like any other system of social control, it doesn't always work properly. When somebody insults us we hate him and want to punch him. That just "human nature", right? You can also call the impulse to do physical damage to another "pride" or "dignity" or "justifiable homicide" or "just desserts" -- but this is precisely the part of human nature that Tinker Toys like Gort will not tolerate.We remain free to kill those we hate. We can fly airplanes into their buildings or blow up their subways or invade their countries or fry them in an electric chair. We have the freedom to do that. But is this a kind of "freedom" we want to preserve? The freedom to express our most base impulses, the impulses that make us no different from monkeys or pit bulls or camels? Would we really lose that much if we turned ourselves over to the Gorts of the universe? If biology can't do the job can we turn it over to culture? If high schools can have zero tolerance policies for drug possession and if traffic cops can have zero tolerance for speeding, why not zero tolerance for killing? The Ten Commandments tells us clearly Thou Shallt Not Kill, without adding dozens of footnotes.The question is rhetorical. I don't know the answer. But the movie prompts us to ask it of ourselves, if we don't simply close down our logic when Klaatu starts going on about "police" and "absolute power" and "irrevocable." (An image forms out of Spiritus Mundi -- an Aryan in a Gestapo uniform.) Of course we hesitate. Anyone would. Klaatu has held back an important piece of information about Gort. Does he get free donuts?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood StillThe fact that I had never heard of the movie or the book 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' before I saw it was a very good thing. If I had seen it before I wouldn't have really cared to pay attention to it and if I had read the book I would have fallen asleep during it because the plot of the movie was so boring.I also found it funny how stupid some things were. One of them was the way that Gort was indestructible and could destroy anything he wanted to. I also thought it was funny how fake it looked when Klaatu was shot and he just stood up and spun, then fell to the ground. Despite all of the stupid antics it actually made you think about what was going on at the time with the Cold War, the space race and how Russia and the United States were at each others throats, when they would not agree on a spot to hold a meeting for the whole world so that they could find out what could happen. It also makes you realize how childish the United States and Russia were about not being able to hold a peaceful meeting in one area or another without quarreling over it. Also it makes the viewer think about what would have happened if Russia and the United States had had fought with nuclear weapons in space as Klaatu had hinted at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part of the "old science fiction is good for young kids" series in my mind (father of 8-year old twins) and time (2010). Perhaps my boys in the future will sit with their children and watch "Gattaca" and marvel at the simplistic message and special effects ("Wow, only one of the five senses invoked, and even that is restricted to 2D").Or perhaps they'll laugh at a time when politicians and the military held sway over scientists? Not yet unfortunately.Anyways, this was fun enough to watch with the little guys, I had never before seen it although the music has long ago been deeply implanted in my cortex. It was truly the best part of the film, but I have no problem with the idiocy of war as a message. The kids of course dug the unwitting befriending of a stranger in a strange land with a young boy. My wife pointed out that such a friendship would be trouble in the trades today. Even worse, technically Klaatu was an illegal alien.One of the boys liked the reverse Frankenstein move of Gort re-animating his "humanoid" master. And watching this on Thanksgiving weekend, I can only guess how badly the forces of Black Friday long for the power to stop all currents and currency, if only for half an hour.Hospitals and aircraft excepted. In our house the film did keep all earthlings off the internet, so that's sort of similar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8/28/04The Day the Earth Stood Still'The Day the Earth Stood Still,' was a boring movie, but however, had a good point behind it. Back then people were interested in alien movies, but now people are more into the action and comedies. An alien comes down to Earth to send a message to everyone, not just the US but the entire world. There are many hardships that take place during this movie which lead to the message of the aliens. One hardship that the alien goes through is with a young boy who takes the alien on a tour of Washington D.C., and the blackout. The blackout part of the movie warns everyone that they better pay attention to Klaatu he has a message that needs to get out to the people. Towards the end of the movie Klaatu gives his speech which states that we can live happy lives without war, guns and anger. It's all about working together. I think everyone knows that the world would be better if there were no guns, or war. I didn't really like that the fact that the movie was really boring. I think everyone needs to see this movie to realize what we can do to live better lives. If this movie was a little bit more exciting I would rate this movie a 6 out of 10. Not one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never seen `Day the Earth Stood Still' until recently. I couldn't help but notice the uncanny resemblance Klaatu's ?with-us-or-against-us' view of Earth to President Bush's view of Iraq and his so-called Axis of Evil. Klaatu represents a planet who wants not to meddle in the affairs of Earth, but fears its experiments with atomic energy and its newfound ability to launch objects into space, could be merged-and pose a threat to other worlds (in this illustration we, as a planet, are Iraq). Its fears are well founded. The film is set in 1951, 6 years after the greatest war the world had ever seen. Looking at the world now, 52 years after `Day' came out, the outlook is, sadly, not much brighter. Bush's declaration to world leaders post-9/11 (a day the Earth really did come to a stop) on the ?war on terror,' `you are either with us or you are against us,' may not have been biblically-based (as it is believed to be). Maybe he'd just watched this film, near the end of which Klaatu makes an almost identical ultimatum to the people of the savage, divided people of this planet. Perhaps we can add 50s sci-fi to the possible reasons for Bush's misguided foreign policy on Iraq (and, hopefully not, North Korea). Interesting how `43' emulates Klaatu's words but not his philosophy-a policy of defense, of using force if threatened (we're talking real threats here, not manufactured ones). Still the message of `Day the Earth Stood Still' is a good one-we're all in this together. Back then, the message was supposed to be anti-nuclear. Watching it today, that doesn't come across as much as how we can't seem to get over our differences. The message still fits today because, as recent events have proven, we STILL can't all just get along. We can't even get everyone to agree on whom to attack. We're fighting over?whether to fight. Yes, the makers of `Day the Earth Stood Still' sure were on to something here. Klaatu saw how absurd our world is and will continue to be, hence the warning, ?change your course or be destroyed.'</fullReview>

Most of the movie is spent showing how little the alien knows about earth,while the rest is spent showing how much he does know about earth. He knows about the UN but doesn't know who Abraham Lincoln is, a lot of that type of stuff. The plot had great potential but falls flat by not having any substance or a real ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I agree with Patricia Neal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Patricia Neal has admitted in interviews that she was completely unaware during the filming that the film would turn out so well and become one of the great science-fiction classics of all time. She assumed it would be just another one of the then-current and rather trashy flying saucer films that were popular at the time, and she found it difficult to keep a straight face while saying her lines."I gave this film a 7 just because I am a sci-fi film junkie ... and almost any 1930s,40s,50s,60s sci-fi tickles my fancy ... but I did find myself bursting out laughing ... or groaning at times ... however I still enjoyed it. The idea of this spaceman "walking/running" through DC in a suit and tie ... and threatening to destroy all humanity unless they accept his way of seeing things ... does not make for believable cinema in my book ... fun cinema yes ... but not profound at all. Is this what a supposedly light years ahead of us ... superior species ... purposes as a solution to earths problems? Again I state that I did like it ... but I certainly don't hold this up to be some sort of timeless masterpiece ... more akin to eating jelly beans ... but I do love them at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always hate trying to review a movie this old mainly because technology today is so much more advanced than it was in 1951. It's sad, because technology really ties this movie down.Let's start with the premise: an alien from a distant planet travels to Earth to deliver a warning. This being wishes to arrange a meeting with the world leaders to deliver such a message, but cannot seem to do so as these leaders cannot even decide on a location to hold it. He then escapes military custody and goes out into the public to try and understand the human race more, all the while being hunted down by the military. He befriends a widow and her son and stays with them. He also meets a scientist who is organizing a meeting between some of the greatest minds in the world to learn more from this alien and sees this as a perfect opportunity to deliver his message. Unfortunately, I don't really do justice to the plot but it is actually pretty good.My main problem with this film is the alien and his companion, a giant robot. The alien, named Klaatu, is literally a man dressed up in a shiny jumpsuit. Even when they examine him, the scientists reveal that there is very little difference in his anatomy to our own. The robot, I believe named Gort, also looks very cheesy. It is hard to think of Klaatu as an alien when he is so similar to a human. I just wish a little more creativity had been applied to the design of him and Gort.The backdrop of the 1950's is great considering this was the height of alien paranoia. Unfortunately, many of the characters come across as flat and stereotypical with the exception of the family which befriends Klaatu. I found almost everyone else in this movie to be detestable. There is one scene in particular where Klaatu is sitting at a table with a group of people who are discussing this alien and his motives. It was quite possibly the most annoying scene in the entire movie.This movie is built on a very solid premise. The plot and message of the movie are just as good and relevant now as they were in the 1950s, if not more so today. It's also not special effects oriented, all it needs is some better costumes and a better alien and it would be a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other day I bought the DVD of one of my favorite all-time films: The Day The Earth Stood Still. In watching it I was struck by how relevant this sci fi classic from over 50 years ago is to today's political milieu. In brief, a flying saucer lands in Washington, D.C. Its occupant is a creature that looks human enough, named Klaatu (Michael Rennie). He is injured by fearful humans as the military surrounds the spacecraft. He is rescued by an all-powerful robot named Gort, who vaporizes the military machinery.Klaatu decides to infiltrate human society under the pseudonym Carpenter and takes up residence at a local boarding house, where he meets a widow named Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) who has a 10 year old son Bobby (Billy Gray of later Father Knows Best fame). In short, Klaatu is hunted down and killed by the military, then resurrected by Gort, who is aided by Helen, who knows the phrase that can control Gort: Klaatu Barada Nikto. Upon leaving Earth Klaatu issues an edict: either humans can change their ways or they will be exterminated if they spread their nuclear terror to the stars. Klaatu has only been an emissary from an organization called the United Planets. Gort is merely one of many all-powerful robots that police the UP registry and battle warring instinct with extermination- a policy all UP members submit to. With this knowledge Klaatu and Gort leave Earth to ponder its fate.Of course, the film has provoked many philosophical, ethical, and political salvos through the years. Made during the early years of the Cold War its symbolism was obvious, and its 'message' later became standard fare for much of the early 'real' UFO lore, depicted by the 'Contactees' of that era. But, its message still resonates today, in the post-Cold War restiveness of dying religious Fundamentalism's death throes. Especially since Rennie plays a near-Christ-like character.It has also been vociferously attacked as 'liberal' propaganda. Many Leftists of the day saw the film as a plea against the insanity of the nuclear arms race, which was insane- not because of the arms race mentality, but because total annihilation could occur by error, and not intent. Rightists pointed out that the 'peace' offered by Klaatu, Gort, and the UP comes only if humanity is either content to remain earthbound, or submit to the tyranny of the Gortian robocops. Counterarguments span range from the social compact gambit- i.e.- that while Earth is our home and we can do what we like the universal society at large has every right to set up its own laws and penalties. After all, we are free to parade around naked in our own homes, but not in public- to the sanity defense- that any society advanced enough to discover interstellar travel will likely create weaponry capable of planet destruction, therefore only a preemptive ban and enforcement can work.Yet, there does seem something amiss with Klaatu's UP. Klaatu shows he has the power to utterly immobilize human machinery (hence the film's title) yet it is oblivion or else- no degrees of shading, such as 'we'll take away all your nuclear toys if you humans are bad'. It's Armageddon or compliance. The UP has no problems with hypocrisy or 'benevolent' dictatorship. If we are too violent, by UP standards, they will counter with the ultimate violence. This is their law, and will be applied without any research into why humans fight: exploitation, racism, sociology, and ideological differences as reasons are all equally wrong, even if in self defense. The query rises- is peace without freedom a virtue?It has been counter-argued that there is such a thing as limited freedom- we do not have the right to infringe upon others' rights with our own. Klaatu claims the only freedom the UP has given up is the freedom of violence. Violence is the only freedom that is policed by Gort and his robotic brethren. The film has thus been seen as posing the question How would society function if disputes had to be resolved without violence? And it's a good query.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the day the earth got told off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Day the Earth Stood Still' is one of the first, and best, sci-fi films to utilize a 'pompous alien' storyline. This has been a favorite device of science-fiction writers for as long as anyone can remember; it is practically a sub-genre and can be seen in productions as diverse as 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' and episodes of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation.' In these stories, a representative of a superior alien culture makes contact with we Earthlings, lectures us on our shortcomings, and usually threatens to destroy us unless we behave ourselves or kowtow to them or something. The enduring appeal of this type of sci-fi tale seems attributable to guilt feelings some have about mankind's failings, and also the recurring idea that when we finally meet visitors from another world, they will be better, smarter and more powerful than us. I suppose it would be a bit depressing to imagine meeting aliens for the first time and finding out they're a bunch of sniveling, worthless lowlifes. The high-minded alien in 'Day the Earth Stood Still' is Klaatu (Michael Rennie) who, along with his trusty sidekick Gort, gives Earth an ultimatum: behave yourselves or be destroyed. I don't know, for an advanced civilization that claims to worship peace above all else, that seems kind of harsh to me. What did we do to them? Did we go to THEIR planet and start bossing THEM around? But this is how the 'pompous alien' plot always goes. Anyway, Klaatu explains that the way his people have achieved peace is by creating a race of robots like Gort who are given absolute authority to stop any kind of hostile behavior. If only it were that simple. The movie makes one major change from the story it is based on; the Gort character (named Gnut, who can speak) corrects an Earth man who refers to Klaatu as Gnut's master. "You misunderstand," Gnut says. "I am the master." Which is a salient truth that would have to be the case for the system Klaatu describes to realistically function. The movie is well-produced with good performances by Rennie, Patricia Neal, and Hugh Marlowe. It is quite eerie at times; the great Bernard Herrmann contributes another of his classic music scores which helps immensely. It was a huge success and paved the way for all the great '50s sf/horror films that followed, from 'Forbidden Planet' to 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers.' And one can just see Ed Wood sitting in a dark theater watching it, absolutely mesmerized!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Some spoilers*Don't you just hate people who come to your house un-invited, criticise the decor, break something without offering to pay and then push of without so much as a by-your-leave? Well, the arrogance and pomposity of this ET is beyond belief. Despite the flaunting of superior technology he lacks even basic common sense. He leaves his spaceship surrounded by people pointing guns at him, says nothing, then reaches into his jacket and takes out something that makes a sudden movement resulting in his wounding. What does he expect? But no, of course it's all our fault and he sulks. we were too stupid to realise it was a gift, he laments. Well, excuse ME, Mr Alien entity, but we don't have space ships landing every five minutes and scaring the hell out of us, did you take that into consideration? And that huge robot of yours should respect our customs and wear his underpants INSIDE his trousers, this is a public place. But no, Klaatu is here to tell us our business and arrogantly expects us to organise a conference just the way he wants rather than taking a more diplomatic approach or doing a television broadcast which would be more practical. Finally, he decides to do just that, after much huffing and puffing.Fortunately for Klaatu, the military are none too bright either when he decides to go walkies around Washington. No one thought to take his picture or show a sketch or photo-fit of him over the TV or newspapers thus allowing him to move into a boarding house where he meets Helen and her son, Bobby. Bobby is a bright kid. After seeing Klaatu go into the space ship at night he comes to the perfectly reasonable conclusion that he's a diamond smuggler. And Helen is an irresponsible mother in allowing him to wander around with a total stranger who could be a child molester or something. I'm sure they get them in outer space too. Meanwhile the military continues it's bungling. Only two men guard the most dangerous object in the world without any other hardware or electronic surveillance and the public seems none too curious, either. Also despite there being soldiers on every street corner, not one of them notices a great big robot stomping along the pavements looking for Klaatu. Could his low opinion of the human race be justified? Possibly. Helen is told to say to Gort: "Klaatu barada nikto." But instead she tells him: "Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto" which isn't the same thing. She was lucky not to get zapped.Now, I could go on all day (and I usually do) but it has to be said that Klaatu's out of order. He enters American air space without permission, lands an unlicensed vehicle in a municipal park, damages military property, deals in un-authorised currency, obstructs traffic, illegally uses a service elevator, kills two men, damages some deck chairs, knocks down a wall and finally tries evading a taxi fare. Are we meant to be impressed?In fairness, he does pay a great personal price for his reprehensible behaviour but remains supercilious and lacking in humility to the last. He gives us some fascistic nonsense about a system that crushes any aggression with robots that fly around the galaxy. What is this, dumb and dumber? Can you imagine how many arguments and punch-ups there are amongst billions of inhabitants on a planet PER DAY? Get real. And EXCUSE ME, Mr Silver jumpsuit, but doesn't all human progress rely on aggression and individuality? It's every human's right to start wars, oppress the weak and drive around at dangerous speeds in a jeep while having one hand on a phone. We saw off Communism and we'll see you off too, MISTER Klaatu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never understood why "peaceniks" adopted this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always loved this movie. It's from the days where the writing carried the movie instead of special effects. But I've never grasped why this movie is so loved by our friends of the left. Let's face it, the alien philosophy is conservatism to the core. They never cared what we did on our planet, to ourselves, it was our business and not theirs. But now we've reached the point where we might get off the planet, with nuclear weapons, and pose a threat to them. So they send an emissary, who's not nasty, or interested in conquering the Earth, with a simple message. The aliens demonstrate that they are immeasurably more powerful than we are, in a non-violent but still convincing manner, and then inform us, in simple terms, to cut it out and disarm. If we continue to pose a POTENTIAL future threat, they'll eliminate us now to avoid any possible trouble. That's it. No negotiation. Just their position, and fair warning. That's not a "peacenik" philosophy. The current remake is obviously aimed at proposing something more in line with our friends' views, as the aliens are out to punish us for not being "green" enough and being "nice" to the planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day the Earth Stood Still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this classic film on a poster in McDonalds and thought it looked pretty cool, especially the thought of our planet stopping (imagine the consequences). Of course when I actually saw the film it wasn't what I had in mind for the Earth standing still, but it was pretty freaky. Anyway, basically an alien craft from a distant place lands in a football field, and Klaatu (Michael Rennie) is the human looking alien that comes out, as well as his spooky robot Gort (Lock Martin) who can zap things and make them vanish. Anyway, Klaatu pretending to be Carpenter to all who don't know him, befriends some people including cute Bobby Benson (Billy Gray), but he isn't on Earth to make friends, he needs to warn that the planet is in danger. To make his point and show what he is capable of to Prof. Jacob Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe) he freezes all electricity in the world (apart from needed ones like hospitals and airports) for half an hour. It nearly looks like he dies, but in the end everyone hears him out. Also starring Patricia Neal as Helen Benson and Hugh Marlowe as Tom Stevens. It won the Golden Globe for Best Film Promoting International Understanding, and it was nominated for Best Score for Bernard Herrmann. It was number 82 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 67 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been hearing about "The Day The Earth Stood Still" since I was a little kid. It has become one of the most popular and best-loved sci-fi films ever. Now, having watched it, I can say that while it is a very good movie, it doesn't live up to the hype.The film stars Michael Rennie as the alien Klaatu, who comes to Earth with the message that its people must change our violent ways, or else our planet will be destroyed. He is shot as soon as he steps foot on the planet, and then treated badly by the government. He escapes from the hospital where he is imprisoned and befriends a widow (Patricia Neal) and her son (Billy Gray). Ignoring the hostility of Earth's people, Klaatu continuously tries to find a way to give us peace."The Day The Earth Stood Still" won a Golden Globe for "Best Film Promoting International Understanding". The greatest part of the film, and the biggest reason that it is respected, is that it only uses the aliens and science-fiction as the plot. The movie's message is about peace, and it states that message loud and clear throughout the film.The cast is great, especially Rennie as Klaatu - and who could forget Klaatu's assistant, the towering robot Gort, played by 7'7" Lock Martin? There's also a terrific score by Bernard Herrmann.This is a film that I would recommend to anyone. While it is, truly, a very good, intelligent sci-fi classic, I'd have to say it is a little overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arrogant Hypocrisy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must echo the earlier negative comments of Gary's review below (12/21/00). This movie is unbelievably pretentious and arrogant and for the life of me, I will never understand why a lot of critics can't get it through their heads that Klatuu, the supposedly noble figure from an intelligent "superior" race, is actually prepared to murder five billion men, women, and children if the people of Earth don't get down on bended knee and obey his "superior" race's dictates. To me, that isn't a well-thought message about peace and tolerance, that's a chilling tale of a master race that is willing to commit the ultimate form of barbarism for the sake of preserving their precious racial purity in space. And the arrogance of this film is that it expects us to accept that as good while taking us to task for the far lesser "barbarism" of fighting wars in the name of freedom and justice, as World War II and the Cold War struggle was. While to be certain the film boasts some interesting visual effects and performances and a fine Bernard Herrmann score, I'd rather watch "Earth vs. The Flying Saucers" any day over this work of arrogant hypocrisy ever again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This old film is much admired. Most folks consider it science fiction and have it on their lists under that header; usually it is high on the list.My enthusiasm is often unbounded when it comes to projects like this, ones that worked in their time and were successful in the way intended. And I have great respect for the sort of world bending into alternatives that often uses "science fiction" devices. But I have to report that this film leaves me with less effect than any of a hundred monster and alien movies that had less purpose in mind.Its because the purpose is so vacuous. Was then, is now.The science fiction device ? basically just the appearance of a demigod ? is there to support the preaching of a simple message. Now I can tell you that in this era we all were terrified. Much of this was because there was a real threat, and much because ? as today ? the administration whipped up a narrative of impending, determined evil. Everyone wished for some higher level sense of reason and most believed they were part of it. This simply hooked into that desire. Its not a narrative, simply a small knothole into one that already existed.But there is something about the decisions they made. This film merely inserts a scifi plot device as I've noted. And the way they did this was to make a "real life" movie as much as possible. It seems that real Washington DC locations are used almost exclusively. The alien is as human as could be; likewise the lethal technology takes the form of a human.Even in small things, the way scenes are framed are all borrowed from small town movies though its set in a metropolis. We even have a family grouping that would be carried nearly intact into the Mayberry context, with Aunt Bee, an Opie, a girlfriend, even (in a predictable inversion) the professor transformed into the Don Knotts character.So there's some interesting stuff here in the decisions that filmmakers of ordinary skill made some simple decisions to enhance the effect of their film. But it isn't science fiction of any of the kinds I know. And it isn't an effective film in any way that matters.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the risk of sounding blasphemous, I just cant give this film my stamp of approval. There are so many things wrong with the story. I cant accept the idea that a flying saucer can land in the middle of Washington DC during the height of the Cold War, and the military response involves...cordoning off an area roughly fifty feet around the spaceship? A crowd of a thousand people are allowed to gawk in awe at a potentially hostile visitor, shoulder-to-shoulder with soldiers wielding automatic weapons (not to mention the tanks and heavy artillery). Klaatu, after being shot (an impossibly irresponsible act from a trained soldier), is whisked away to a hospital that seems content to simply lock the door to his room. That should hold this alien with the ability to travel at light speed and disintegrate army tanks! Later on, when Klaatu is gunned down a second time, Helen manages to elude the military and make it back to the spaceship to give Gort his orders. I could go on and on about the holes in the plot, but that isn't what really irritates me about this film. Plot holes can be forgiven. What cannot be forgiven, however, is Klaatu's notion that a Utopian society can be achieved through martial law. The only reason that Klaatu's people renounced violence was to avoid being zapped by Gort and his fellow robot police. Is this the way that humanity should pursue a world without violence? The constant threat of death? Robert Wise is an incredible director. His contributions cannot be underestimated. However, the greatest director cannot rise above bad writing and a faulty premise</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply Flawed, but Mostly Superb Science Fiction Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is "The Day the Earth Stood Still" one of the five best science fiction films of the fifties? Most definitely. Is "The Day the Earth Stood Still Still" one of the ten best science fiction films ever made? Arguably, though I think so. Is "The Day the Earth Stood Still" a classic science fiction film? Without a doubt? Is "The Day the Earth Stood Still" a masterpiece? Far from it. It's deeply flawed from a dramatic standpoint, almost crippled by illogical manipulations which advance the plot, while undermining its credibility. First, let's talk about what's excellent in "The Day ?" Bernard Hermann's score is not only wonderful, it's the best match of score and subject I've ever heard. Equally sublime is the photography. The special effects hold up extremely well, even after nearly 60 years. Robert Wise's direction is topnotch, as is Michael Rennie's performance as Klaatu. Gort, Klaatu's mute robot enforcer, is one of the most memorable character's in science fiction history.Now, let's talk about the movie's dramatic shortcomings:WARNING: SPOILERSKlaatu describes humans as frequently stupid. Well, Klaatu, how smart is it to:o Wear a helmet, disguising your humanity, in the midst of hundreds of nervous armedtroops and armored vehicles, when know one knows you are, what's your intent orwhat you look like? o Flash a device easily confused for a weapon, without first identifying it's purpose and taking even minimal precautions for your own protection? o Leave the protection of your ship when it is absolutely unnecessary, since your all important meeting with the world's scientists is going to take place right outside your ship?Certainly, the weakest plot device takes place when Klaatu is shot while he is trying to escape the army. Certainly the soldiers had strict orders NOT to shoot Klaatu without provocation; and, if Klaatu WAS shot under these circumstances, it would NOT be by a crew manning a jeep-mounted machine gun.Of course, this last plot device leads us to the most subversive element of "The Day ?" that being it's pseudo-religious implications. Clearly, Klaatu represents Jesus, while Gort represents the Torah's Jehovah. Klaatu MUST be killed, so he can be resurrected. Pretty heavy-handed stuff; but, fortunately, it works. So, unfortunately, does the misguided message that peace can been maintained by terror. Let's face it, that's what Klaatu and Gort are offering.END OF SPOILERSThis being said, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a fine movie, well worth seeing. I give "The Day the Earth Stood Still" an "8".</fullReview>

The story behind 7' 7" Lock Martin was interesting too. The special effects are 1951, the whole bit about the cold war, it is truly a great movie to watch.

		<fullReview>I have seen The Day the Earth Stood Still three times. The first two times I saw it was a young kid so I didn't get much out of it except big robots and spaceships. But the third time I saw it I was 15, the age I am now, and now I realize the heaviness of the story and it's very serious message. I can appreciate the movie so much now, like how the movie's ideas are still relevant to this day. Also most of the acting is way above level for a sci-fi movie as is the story itself. It is not your run of the mill evil aliens attacking Earth plot, this time the alien is here to help and the humans fear him(maybe because they have seen too many of those evil alien movies). Because of the interesting plot it made me think about ourselves and where we might be headed in the future. Robert Wise did a wonderful job using the light and music to great effect. I especially like the way the lights eerily danced on Gort's helmet when he was in the space ship. But I believe that all movies have their flaws and TDTESS does have a few. I said most of the acting was very good, but 'lil Bobby was just so 50's era sweet I almost puked. He looked like a refugee from Lassie or something with lines like, 'Jeepers!' Oh?the humanity. Also the UFO looked great far away as just a brilliant glowing spot on the film, but up close it looked like one big hubcap. And my biggest complaint was Gort. If things like him are supposed to suppress violence then why does he move so slowly? Also it looked like the actor who was playing Gort was wearing silver hip waders. I didn't know that robots on Klattu's planet liked to get in some good fishing during the break from protecting the universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George W. Bush and the Wisdom of Klaatu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never seen `Day the Earth Stood Still' until recently. I couldn't help but notice the uncanny resemblance Klaatu's ?with-us-or-against-us' view of Earth to President Bush's view of Iraq and his so-called Axis of Evil. Klaatu represents a planet who wants not to meddle in the affairs of Earth, but fears its experiments with atomic energy and its newfound ability to launch objects into space, could be merged-and pose a threat to other worlds (in this illustration we, as a planet, are Iraq). Its fears are well founded. The film is set in 1951, 6 years after the greatest war the world had ever seen. Looking at the world now, 52 years after `Day' came out, the outlook is, sadly, not much brighter. Bush's declaration to world leaders post-9/11 (a day the Earth really did come to a stop) on the ?war on terror,' `you are either with us or you are against us,' may not have been biblically-based (as it is believed to be). Maybe he'd just watched this film, near the end of which Klaatu makes an almost identical ultimatum to the people of the savage, divided people of this planet. Perhaps we can add 50s sci-fi to the possible reasons for Bush's misguided foreign policy on Iraq (and, hopefully not, North Korea). Interesting how `43' emulates Klaatu's words but not his philosophy-a policy of defense, of using force if threatened (we're talking real threats here, not manufactured ones). Still the message of `Day the Earth Stood Still' is a good one-we're all in this together. Back then, the message was supposed to be anti-nuclear. Watching it today, that doesn't come across as much as how we can't seem to get over our differences. The message still fits today because, as recent events have proven, we STILL can't all just get along. We can't even get everyone to agree on whom to attack. We're fighting over?whether to fight. Yes, the makers of `Day the Earth Stood Still' sure were on to something here. Klaatu saw how absurd our world is and will continue to be, hence the warning, ?change your course or be destroyed.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget reality and logical plot to build this story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see this so much in moving making. No logic and reality. To me, a good movie builds on logic and reality situations, even sci-fi movies. Do really think a alien would step out of his space ship in front of a army ready to fire weapons, having no protection and a helmet he didn't need to breath, then pull a hidden gift from his suit? Sounds like suicide to me. And if he would have dyed then, sure would have been a short movie. Take a writer like Alfred Hitchcock,if he would have written or re written it, what a block buster it would have been. Like his movie the BIRDS. To me, Jules Vern wrote good sci-fi stories and some his stories did become reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escape Velocity Not Reached</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies are supposed to transport us to other worlds; worlds based on *how* things are seen, not so much 'where' or 'what happens'. It's the 'how' that draws us in, regardless of topic.Cinematically, this is completely pedestrian. The acting and camera work are akin, in that they are equally stiff, flat and characterless. The 'how' never gets off the ground. It took enormous film-making capability to overcome these problems during this period. Transcendent examples include "Rear Window".But a few things help prop it up. It's rooted in a remarkably simple idea that taps into much bigger notions shared with the audience. With Capra, we had pure jingoism. Here we have equal opportunity obliteration. Science is the ultimate medium of equal opportunities; it's no wonder that the narrative is placed at this level: 'matter of fact'.The cold calculation forms the necessary platform for the visual retelling of "War of the Worlds" two years later. It is also a distant forerunner of the "Terminator" series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a sci-fi movie it's not bad. As social commentary it's a joke. Ironically this movie that tries so hard to show what a brilliant idea pacifism is showcases how utterly ridiculous it is. Here's the movie in a nutshell: "Foolish humans! You're so stupid and primitive that you haven't learned how to settle your differences without violence. Now do what I say or I'll blow up your planet." Good stuff. The real moral of the story? Actions speak louder than words. Sometimes it's necessary to nip threatening situations in the bud before they get out of control. And, sadly, sometimes all certain people understand is threats of violence and violence itself. Sound familiar?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original sci-fi 'classic'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day the Earth Stood Still starts in Washington D.C. as an alien spacecraft lands in a baseball park, the army is called in &amp; soon the spacecraft is surrounded. An alien man named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) &amp; a tall robot named Gort (Lock Martin) emerge from the craft, Klaatu is about to hand over a gift for the President when one soldier who believes it to be a weapon opens fire &amp; shoots Klaatu, in retaliation Gort destroys all the guns &amp; tanks surrounding the craft. Klaatu is taken to hospital &amp; makes an amazing recovery, he asks to speak to all the worlds leaders but the level of suspicion makes this request impossible. Klaatu escapes from his hospital room &amp; checks into a boarding house in order to observe human nature better &amp; set his plans in motion to speak to a collection of Earth's scientists, Klaatu warns that unless humanity stops the nuclear arms race his people will be forced to destroy Earth &amp; everything living creature on it...Directed by Robert Wise this was based on the short story 'Farewell to the Master' by Harry Bates who was apparently paid just $500 for it, widely considered as one of the true greats of the sci-fi genre I have to say that while The Day the Earth Stood Still is a good film I would be very hard pressed to call it a great one let alone a genre defining classic. The script is sci-fi with a message, it's a message &amp; a warning about nuclear armament &amp; that we heading for total destruction if we carry on. It's a point quite well made even if it's been done to death over the years so maybe doesn't feel anywhere near as original as it once did. However as a film I found it rather dated &amp; the script quite creaky, your telling me that when an alien lands on Earth &amp; end sup in the hospital he will be unguarded in his room &amp; free to escape? The authorities have no pictures or photo's of him at all? The spacecraft gets a paltry two guards? People are allowed to stand mere feet from the spacecraft when it first arrives? You need to suspend your disbelief quite a lot while watching this, the script really isn't that good &amp; apart from a strong central message &amp; one or two striking moments I can't say I liked The Day the Earth Stood Still that much, sure it's a good solid film worth a watch but I don't think it's the undisputed classic that a lot of people &amp; so-called experts consider it to be. After a great opening in which the spaceship lands &amp; Klaatu emerges the script settles down into a human interest story as the human looking alien Klaatu observes people &amp; tries to make his own mind up if we are worth saving before one final message at the end.Certainly well made with special effects that hold up quite well even today, at least there are no tentacled aliens or monsters &amp; Gort the robot who was played by 7'7 Lock Martin is memorable even if the crinkles &amp; creases in his suit when he moves lessens the effect. Well shot with good use of shadow too. Composer Bernard Hermann provides a good score as well.With a supposed budget of about $1,200,000 this has good production values &amp; is well made, although set mainly in Washington this was actually mainly filmed in Los Angeles. The acting is pretty good, nothing amazing but decent enough.The Day the Earth Stood Still is regarded by many as an absolute classic but not by me, I don't think time has been that kind to it &amp; with a fairly serious &amp; sombre message it's not the most fun film to just sit down &amp; watch. Remade by Hollywood as The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's important to keep in mind that the story this film is based on, like much other "Golden Age" science fiction, is deservedly forgotten. What survives from that era of science fiction are a few names--Clarke, Asimov, Heinlein--and a slew of stories by other authors that can genuinely be appreciated for their vision and storytelling. "The Day The Earth Stood Still" however seems more rooted in the insipid science fiction of the era, the type that was guaranteed to be forgotten fairly soon. Everything about this film is banal and hokey--surely gripping at the time, but quite silly and laughable by today's standards. It isn't even on par with the best episodes of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits, and the message strikes one as obvious and heavy handed. It's a wonder how adults can continue to find merit in a film with such a puerile center.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day the Earth Turned Silly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I thought the movie itself was stupid! Little did I know how snicker-worthy it would be to read that this laughable little 50s piece of sci-fi cheese is on IMDb's top 250 list. No doubt a bunch of clueless and confused film students had something to do with that...A silly-looking flying saucer (no, not a UFO; UFOs are "unidentified objects", remember) lands in Washington D.C., and who exits the elegant-looking vehicle? A suave-looking human with finely cut hair and impeccable gentleman's-club manners. (I guess this was one of the moments that really had those film students relieving themselves in their movie diapers.) Earth people, who are all portrayed as utter idiots, send a military squadron with orders to shoot at will. All these highly-trained soldiers are on the verge of a nervous breakdown - that's how excited and scared they get that a human dressed as a gay diver approaches them. I found it infinitely amusing that the military would be sweating bullets about this alien, while the civilian spectators would just casually grin and not show any signs of distress at all! Of course the alien, whose name is Klutz, is so completely above us all in intelligence, sophistication, morals, and knowledge - and yet the doofus fails to predict that a violent species such as Earthlings would misread his action of pulling out an object that looks like a weapon. Klutz gets shot. At that moment, I could just hear him saying "See? See?? Your stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!". Klutz doesn't exactly scream "stupid", but he does sound very hurt, bitching like a little baby that the toy in his hands was not a weapon but a gift for mankind. If Klutz is so totally All-Knowing, then why did he not inform the masses of people that had gathered there that he was about to take out a mere movie-prop toy? Perhaps Klutz wanted to get shot, so he'd become an intergalactic martyr? Or maybe he just didn't do his homework and prepare for his mission with the degree of seriousness that this requires. Or maybe Klutz is just plain DUMB.Klutz informs us that his toy is a gift "to study life on other planets". Hey, Klutzy, how about getting us a SPACESHIP first! It's like giving someone a guitar pick for birthday instead of a guitar. What exactly does this little device do? Detect moronic scripts on other planets? Foolish alien film students? 1950s actors that always just stand around motionless like statuettes during the dialogues? Klutz can do almost anything throughout the movie, even magic, but he can't set up a pair of speakers to address all of the world's leaders. "Yeah, I've come from a long way away, in a very advanced spacecraft, we've beaten death and disease, and we have robots that can do just about everything except sing YESTERDAY in baritone, but our civilization knows nothing about sound transmission. Please help, little freckled boy!" What is with these 50s sci-fi flicks and their Irish-immigrant pre-school boys who befriend the oh-so misunderstood, noble aliens? Isn't that a bit of a hint whom these films were primarily targeted at? Kids and morons.I loved the part when Klutz tells one of the adults (yes, he occasionally communicated with adults - when he wasn't too busy wasting his precious mission time with little boys) that the nuclear missiles that mankind had developed were a threat to the other planets. That was a good one... But, hey... Hang on! If the Intergalactic United Nations are so concerned about this threat then WHY go to Earth hence reveal themselves, their existence, location etc? "We know you are extremely dangerous to us, what with your short-range missiles that can't even hit the Moon, but we want to tell you where WE are, so that if you ever DO feel like obliterating something outside your own orbit you can have a proper target!" Klutz's visit is about 10,000 years too early: for the life of me I can't imagine that humans could launch an unstoppable nuclear projectile toward the closest planet in the next couple of aeons. Why would these silly Martians, Venusians (and other B-movie "ians") worry about this utterly hypothetical threat in the first place? They should be so advanced that shooting down a potential missile coming from primitive little Earth should be child's play. But I forget that an organization that sends a clod like Klutz to Earth can't be a particularly smart organization...Between the fairly eventful beginning and the very Grand Finale there is almost nothing going on in the film; just a lot of padding: Klutz in the stereotypical "stranded and somewhat confused alien" role, plus the half-hearted establishing of some rather unessential and dull human characters. Will she marry him? Won't she? That is certainly the Question of the Day when an alien spaceship sits not far from the White House...What silly 50s kids' movie would be complete without a robot or a monster carrying a damsel-in-distress... The damsel (Patricia Neal) isn't particularly attractive. (No wonder her fiancé treats her badly.) Why can't these B-movie damsels walk on their own? Why do they faints so easily? These are the urgent questions the movie failed to answer. Instead, we get an idealistic, Hollywood-type speech by Klutz that finally clarifies a few things. Of course, this alien moron could have said all of that on the day that he landed, hence saving everyone the trouble of watching all those dull goings-on in-between.If this "race of robots" prevents all violence between the aliens, does that mean that there are security cameras everywhere, including toilet facilities? If so, I should think that losing one's bathroom privacy would be too high a price to pay, even for peace...Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and check out my "TV &amp; Cinema: 150 Worst Cases Of Nepotism" list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aliens outstay their welcome. Again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aliens annoy the hell out of me. Firstly, they're not invited so they're not welcome. It's like when you have a party for all your friends and then the police turn up. They're not invited and they're unwelcome, especially when they close down the party and Dave has to go home. So imagine my disdain when I see that there's a film called ?The Day the Earth Stood Still' about aliens turning up and telling us off for various things. What's more they land in Washington, which isn't the safest place to park a spaceship and then don't do much until the army shows up. If there are any aliens reading this then I'd just like to say YOU'RE NOT WELCOME, but if you do insist on coming here then use some common sense.Firstly, when you do land on earth and there's a big crowd with guns and tanks outside your ship then don't be a spazmo and run out brandishing something from the Anne Summers catalogue! Use your ships loudspeaker to say something like; `Hello, this is Klaatu. I'm coming out now. Please don't shoot me, I'm unarmed but carrying a Lady Pleasure 8000.' Also, don't wear a space suit that makes you look like a robot. We don't like robots here either.Secondly, if we've only just invented atomic weapons don't turn up and threaten to kill us. That's impolite and shows no respect for the host:Guest: `Hello I've just turned up uninvited and parked my car on your flowerbed.'Host: `I? Erm?'Guest: `Stop your son from playing with fireworks or I will destroy Luton.'This is why you green skinned extra terrestrial FREAKS are so unwelcome here! When you're not turning up and making us look bad with your compassion and wisdom, you're exploding out of people's chest cavities and blowing up the White House! Is it any wonder we don't want you here? Besides, what's the big deal about atomic weapons? We've used them on you before and THEY DON'T WORK. Just look at ?War of the Worlds', ?Independence Day' and `Mars Attacks!' Not that you aliens have anything to worry about, sat inside your impervious ships, guarded by huge killer robots.Alien General: `Earth has launched a solitary atomic bomb strapped to a Ford Mustang at us.'Alien Overlord: `Oh General Glaaag, I feel so sorry for that poor planet. They hurl their greatest weapon at us in an attempt to destroy us. Yet their attempt is in vain, for as the great space poet Agrazztobep said?'Alien General: `Sir, the atomic bomb has detonated and taken the sheen off of our space fender.'Alien Overlord: `Curses! I had that waxed this morning. Very well, DESTROY EARTH! And mess Pluto up a bit, I hate that dull planet.'And while you're at it you green-skinned rocket jockeys, don't bother landing in America. The North Americans are sick to death of you turning up and either being misunderstood or killing millions of them with some kind of death ray. Leave them alone you boggle-eyed, toad faced retards. LEAVE ALL OF US ALONE.However, if any space amazons or galactic nymphets are reading this then you are wanted and you should land in Aylesbury, near the bus station. I'll be the guy with no trousers on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deliciously silly film for the perennially young at heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of my friends and I - we would go together to see films such as "The Day The Earth Stood Still" in packs of 8 or more - thought it was, well, sort of silly. (This was in 1951, we were 16 or so and too sophisticated to be impressed by flying saucers that looked something like pie pans.) And to us Michael Rennie appeared to be awfully wooden; he reminded us of our math teacher. And Gort - his shiny metal, indestructible gofer - wasn't a very interesting-looking alien; he bore a striking resemblance to Jack Haley as the Tin Man in "The Wizard of Oz." (Of course this was eons before the likes of R2D2 and "2001 Space Odessy.") But the thing that is most delightful about the film is that the magic MumboJumbo phrase, "Klaatu Barrada Nikto," which I believe Rennie (who played Klaatu) told Patricia Neal to memorize and say to Gort when she approached Gort so that he wouldn't zap her or eat her for breakfast - had that certain . . . something such that it became part of the lexicon of our generation; when my mother would yell for me in the middle of a ball game to come in for dinner I would pause, pull myself up to my full height, and haughtily announce to her, "Klaatu Barrada Nikto" - and then run from the broom that she invariably tried to swat me with. And amazingly the apparent deliciousness of the mystique of that phrase has survived to this day. No less a distinguished columnist than Maureen Dowd used it in a syndicated New York Times column on August 17, 2003, to segue into a discussion of a power outage that the East Coast was experiencing at the time. (In the film Klaatu demonstrates his powers by causing a world-wide "freeze" of electricity for 30 minutes or so, stopping everything mechanical from moving, in order to prove to humans that he wasn't fooling around!) So those ridiculous three words came to be part of the wonderful magic of Hollywood; once in a while some trifle catches on, is loved by movie fans everywhere, and survives. Klaatu Barrada Nikto.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Day the Earth Stood Still' applies to our day in age much better than many other black and white movies do. The movie landscapes different views of peace and how it is accomplished, various nations' inability to cooperate with each other, and also serves as an entertaining Sci-Fi film for the whole family. You just can't beat an entertaining, educational movie. Similar movies that come to mind are Titanic, Good Will Hunting, and Black Hawk Down. Although these movies are completely different, they each portray a message or a story line that can instigate a healthy class discussion. I particularly enjoyed the way some people reacted to Klaatu. Some, like Professor Barnhardt, were fascinated by Klaatu's intelligence and way of life. They embraced his advice and advocated his idea of peace. Others wanted nothing more than to throw him in jail. The balance between who wished to get to know Klaatu and who wanted to kill him was actually very different than how it would be if a real alien landed on earth. People would be heading for the hills. And if he implied that our time on Earth was limited, America would start planning ways to attack him or his planet. Everyone would react violently as opposed to just crumbling beneath his orders. Something that I found worthy of note was the fact that the movie ended before a solution was reached. They decided to leave that part up to the audience. This enables people to come up with their own resolutions for a problem that we face today. When nothing is at stake, and all that might be sacrificed are some people on the big screen, the problem seems much simpler and easier to resolve. Therefore, an answer is much closer to us.Some things I didn't like as much were the space suits that Klaatu and Gort wear throughout the movie. I've been spoiled by high tech costumes and amazing special effects in movies that appear in theaters today. The lack of pizzazz among the costumes, sets, and story plot are a breath of fresh air because the element of surprise is left to the music, acting, and lighting. Still, all in all, the movie was enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone with a free Saturday night.</fullReview>

He then demands that we submit to the totalitarian power of therace of robots that rule his world. Our alternative ? to beincinerated if we refuse to submit. And this guy comes from apeace-loving culture? Who's the real violence-prone civilizationhere?

		<shortDescription>The Half Hour The Earth Stood Still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title should've been "The Half-Hour the Earth Stood Still" as that's how long the technology was silenced. That and a few other things got a few laughs out of me, such as all technology stalled, but Helen's watch kept ticking (and the government was given reports from all around the world, and the world seemed to be at daylight all at the same time, etc) and the baseball field the ship landed in suddenly grew trees when both Klaatu and Bobby ventured to at night ? at least they could hide. Though the logic (yes, I know it's about a space man &amp; robot) was out the window, the heart's definitely apparent in this feature. I also loved the acting of the leading lady Helen and even Klaatu ? he shares my opinion of the idiots we call humans, or more so, leaders. Sad to see how childish we humans (or, again, leaders) are portrayed in the film, and even though this came out in 1951, I imagine the same would happen today ? or worse. Granted, I didn't see the film when it first landed in theatres (born in 1974), nor did I see it until tonight for the first time; I still have seen greater "classics" of that era. I had no desire to see the updated version coming out December 2008, specifically due to Keanu Reeves, but I figured if I did see it, I might as well watch the original. So far, I see only two similarities from the original and the trailers ? the title and it's about a man from outer space ? that's about it. Strange, I would've thought Keanu would've played the robot Gort vs Klaatu due to his normal acting range.</fullReview>

First of all, Klaatu disappeared from the hospital and suddenly he has a complete suit and briefcase. Where did he buy these things, when he doesn't have money?Then the newspapers run stories about him, but don't have a single picture of him. It is very impossible that nobody took a picture of Klaatu while he was in the hospital.Klaatu wanted to meet every leader of the world, but finally settled with a group of scientists. How can scientists become the representatives of the world? They don't even decide when and whether a country goes to war.If I were to make a book about how non sense the story of this film is, it could be thicker than the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Shame for Robert Wise, whose later films I enjoy very much, especially Sound of Music and Star Trek: the Motion Picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film that Moved the Earth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1951, in the shadow of the Cold War, in the grip of McCarthyism, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL was just another stanky B-Movie science fiction thriller with a sanctimonious message of the human race on the edge of doom. Somehow, it rose above the engine pit and is now regarded as a classic.Classic in intent; execution, still stanky B-Movie.A "flying saucer" lands in Washington amidst widespread dismay and theramins twoinging. Two alien beings emerge, Klaatu (Michael Rennie, doing his Charlton Heston Lite) and Gort (played by tall Lock Martin), an eight-foot metal robot (who looks suspiciously like foam rubber). Klaatu's message to Earth is simple: "it is no concern of ours how you run your own planet, but if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned out cinder." McCarthy's gonna LOVE this guy...Klaatu's message is only delivered in the last five minutes of the movie, where we discover there is life on many other worlds and that Klaatu's race are "police" of the cosmos, sending out their metal foam rubber drogues like Gort, who "at the first sign of violence, act automatically against the aggressor." With violence. So much for turning the other cheek; so much for benevolent superior beings...Though there are many unintentional Christ allegories throughout this tale - Klaatu's message of peace; Klaatu going undercover as "Mr. Carpenter"; Klaatu dying and being "resurrected" by Gort - this Orwellian dance of paradoxy was not one of them. The main question raised when a civilization is forced into behaving under threat of obliteration is the same question I always ponder of this civilization and, in particular, religions that threaten damnation: What does this say about your vaunted "goodness" if it is only to avoid penalty or hell or jail? Directed by Robert Wise, what set this movie apart from the hundreds of 1950s "atomic"-themed B-fiascos that ended with the caveat "The decision rests with you" is the non-provincial nature of Klaatu's message. Klaatu insists he will NOT meet with any world leader exclusively; that includes the president of the United States. Of course, this "insult" twists the narcissistic panties of America, but widens the audience for the film. Eventually, Klaatu decides to meet "intelligent" people - all the scientists he can muster. To prove his power, to bring them to the table, he makes "the Earth stand still" - stops everything electric, stops all the traffic in the streets, the trains on their tracks, yet keeps hospitals and necessities running. We never find out "how" Klaatu makes the Earth stand still, but we figure it has something to do with him being wicked at algebra.Unfortunately, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL has not dated well (which is why, I presume, some meathead felt the need to remake it in 2008.Social mores and filmic techniques have progressed so far that the film's old-world execution and 1950s Amish mentality is cringeworthy.This movie is from a time when white men wore hats more religiously than Jews wear yamulkes; from an age when the pointy bra was the weapon of choice for single women; when rear projection was the new CGI; when dating couples in their 40s were considered "crazy kids in love"; when everyone addressed each "Mr" and "Mrs" and kept their ties tight and girdles tighter to deter the opposite sex from unholy acts of "bad thoughts"; when the military protected a spaceship landing field with two inept guards; when people clustered around the radio for their news, drove cars as big as boats, lathered Brylcreem through their hair (to keep their hats on?) and wore their pants so high it chafed their nipples... it would be hideous kinky if it wan't so unwatchable cringy...In one of the inanest scenes this side of THIS ISLAND EARTH (1955), Gort carries the "love interest" (Patricia Neal, who shows no "love" - not even to her 45-year-old "boyfriend," Hugh Marlowe - and therefore holds none of our interest) into Klaatu's spaceship. She fulfills no function within, does nothing to further the plot, doesn't even get anal-probed (which would have loosened that girdle enough for a man to get a finger under that pointy bra with a chisel), and simply walks out later, unconcerned. We realize Gort's act was simply to comply with 1950s film poster protocol of "Alien Carrying Earth Woman." Poster achieved. Back into the kitchen, woman! Judge this film not on its superficial message (preachy messages of doom were a staple of 1950s sci-fi cinema); judge it not on its "timeliness" (there is always the threat of unmanageable war - we're looking at you, Dubya!); judge it on the one point that even Roger Ebert misunderstood: that humans killing each other does not concern the cosmos, but that if our weapons were turned outwards, it WOULD concern other life forms. THAT is why this film is a classic, even if most humans are too provincial to comprehend the concept and even if the film doesn't quite understand what it's talking about itself, humans not having conquered space yet at the film's release.Klaatu also presages the future insane President Bush's governing style: "I am fearful when I see people substitute fear for reason." When the shot Klaatu is resurrected (the blood on his jacket looking like tomato sauce even in black and white), he explains his "born again" state, and makes about as much sense as any religion: "Only the Almighty Spirit has power over life and death" ...You mean there IS a god, overseeing all the alien worlds and taking their weird-looking spirit forms up unto his capacious bosom? And he wears tiny metal superhero undies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid, but fun as a curiosity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know when Superman stops a train with his hands, and then some crook who saw that wants to start a fist fight with him? This film is full of implausible human reactions like that. If you are not stupid, you will find that this film is, despite some great moments.Of course, as a curious piece of history, there are many reasons to love "The Day the Earth Stood Still".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1950s science-fiction, from the garbage of 'Beginning of the End' to the sophisticated 'Them!', frequently contains one of two ideas. The first being "what science can't do, God can do" (War of the Worlds), the second being "what God can do, science shouldn't do" (Tarantula).This is your only spoiler warning...Here we have yet another morality play in the form of anti-nuke, only this time the perpetrators are from space. That's as inventive as it gets.There are the basic military types, the weak scientists, the politicians, and the everyman. The basic character inventory for all others to follow, only changes from here on result in story setup.This movie is silly and dated beyond all rational thought, much like 'North by Northwest'. For those wanting a better version of the same thing, see Wise's first 'Star Trek' effort.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finger-wagger from space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't understand how people can say they like this movie, or associate it with pleasure/enjoyment. I've watched it 5 times over the last twenty years and I can only imagine they mean that they respect it or admire it's peaceful, non-violent message, and wish that some common enemy of the earth could unite us. The message is a safe pile of pap that no one could disagree with, except on dramatic terms.And that's where TDTESS fails totally. The movie is dramatically inert. It never fails to put me to sleep. It takes the form of a tiresome sermon and structurally it's big disclosures are dramatically facile. Well heavens, Patricia O'Neal's house-guest has turned out to be the helmetted alien from the first reel? Um, that's utterly obvious. Michael Renny is a truly annoying, superior, emotionally-flat alien with a New England accent; come to earth ostensibly to change our bellicose ways. Robert Wise (the man who destroyed The Magnificent Ambersons) is a bad director. When the plot calls for a sequence showing that a development is occurring all over the earth, rather than ten well-chosen vignettes, Wise crams in twenty-five; I wanted to throttle him. Whenever a single scene could handle the narrative job, here come twelve covering the same ground. This is the most padded movie I've ever seen. On top of that, can anything be more horrifying than being asked to identify with chilly, remote Patricia O'Neal? She has little to do, except demonstrate the catalog of acting conventions from 1951. There is no emotion shown by anyone, alien or otherwise. An alternate reading I prefer is that Renny's planet got tired of his preachy act, and flung him into space with some crap mission to get him out of their hair; Go be a drag someplace else! How many cultures have greeted his startling vegetable-steamer device with anything but gunfire? ...the big dope.About the only nice thing I can say about this is that it has nice lighting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood is trying to teach us another moral lesson. The main problem with that lesson is that it comes from immoral Hollywood. They have no room for God so they create a spaceman to be the earth's moral police and teach us to get along with each other. This Hollywood God evens rises from the dead. The best thing about the film is that it isn't filmed today (2006) where the directors/writers/actors try to disgust or embarrass you with their language or actions. What do you know! No one took their clothes off for a love scene."Klaatu barada nikto!" One suggestion has the word "barada" meaning "alive" and the word "nikto" meaning "not" (by comparison with the German nicht); thus, "Gort, Klaatu is not alive." I'm offering an alternate translation, where "Klaatu barada nikto!" means "LASSIE, FIND TIMMY?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for the 50s, not even worth looking at in the 21st century.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You cannot review a movie based on what it was in its time. It's the 21st century, and now this movie doesn't hold a single candle to movies now. Honestly, the special effects alone are below power rangers. There is NO realism whatsoever to the actions of Klatarded. If you're going to call humans stupid, at least realize the propulsion system on your spacecraft is sub par and of horrible design. Not to mention the camera work. All of a sudden the people start running at 2x regular camera speed? What is up with that. There is NO suspension of disbelief, I found myself laughing at the movie within five minutes. Watch a real movie people, stop being nostalgic, biased reviewers.</fullReview>
