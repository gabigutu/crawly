		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. For some reason, I keep thinking director Tony Scott will re-capture his magic of "Crimson Tide". Instead, he thrives on being the center of attention, rather than letting the story and characters unfold on screen. How he mangles the great cat-and-mouse game of the original "Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is pure torture to watch.In the original Walter Matthau and the icy cold Robert Shaw were brilliant. Here Travolta is way over-the-top with all his "MF'ers". Denzel, for all his greatness, is simply miscast as the nice, working class hero. In the original, NYC shots were gritty and real ... here they are Tony Scott disco complete with flying cars. Since when does a car collision send one of the vehicles soaring and somersaulting? And why does a skilled motorcycle cop ram right into a parked vehicle? Just a ridiculous action sequence.Also in the original, Martin Balsam, Hector Elizondo and Earl Hindman (Wilson from Home Improvement) were Shaw's team and each had their own personality. Here Luis Guzman is given little to do and I couldn't pick the other two out of a line-up after just watching the film! John Tuturro and James Gandolfini are the only others with much to say. Gandolfini is a nice combo of Giuliani and Bloomberg, and provides at least a touch of humor. The story is expanded from a pure heist film to a bit of distorted revenge by Travolta, a disgraced Wall Street stud.Just not much good to say about this one since I don't believe it stands on its own and it certainly can't hold a candle to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>two solid leads but the results are underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It started like any ordinary day; that's likely what N.Y.C. subway dispatcher Walter Garber, an employee of questionable character, was thinking when he got up and went to work in the morning. Little did he know that he'd become the confidant and 'stand-in' hostage negotiator for a prickly criminal mastermind who takes over the Pelham subway train and demands money in exchange for the lives of its passengers. Hearing the names Washington, Travolta, and Scott creates a lot of anticipation, but unfortunately what wants to be a slick combination of suspense thriller and character study instead results in a ponderous film with a weak setup, predictable plot twists, shallow characters, and little tension. It's easy to watch with actors of Washington and Travolta's caliber at work, but Scott's direction is pretentious and throws out some obligatory action scenes that seem to exist for the sole purpose of padding the time on the way to an expected climax. The leads do what they can with the strained material but really deserve better. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent entertainment, but doesn't hold a candle to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the this most recent remake of Pelham 1-2-3 (most don't even recall the made-for-TV version filmed in Toronto - with good reason) with an open mind. I was weened on Godey's book when 8, and saw the original film when it was released a few years later. I've committed practically every line and scene to memory. I'll admit.... I'm biased. I felt the original could not be successfully remade... the gritty feel, the outstanding David Shire soundtrack, the believable performances of the ensemble cast..... and I was right. I did not go into the theater hoping to hate the remake, but instead to like it. I REALLY wanted to like it. I have always enjoyed both Denzel Washington and John Travolta in their various endeavors and thought the chemistry might work fine here. While entertaining, it became almost tiresome after a while. I felt no tension, no "edge of the seat" sensation that the original brought, I found myself disliking most of the characters and really not caring what happened to them. It passed the time, had some thrills, but that was about it for me.The '09 version is entertaining, with some excellent action scenes and more than a few decent dialog exchanges between characters, but it is nothing more than a Tony Scott action movie dressed up as "The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3". While starting off liking Washington's character (now disgraced MTA administrator-turned dispatcher Walter Garber, as opposed to Detective Zachary Garber in the book and original screen incarnation), I found, as the movie progressed, that he went from believable to just another two-dimensional action movie hero who, if he was what as he really started out as being, would not have ended up doing what he did in the film. Sorry, no spoilers here gang. You'll have to go judge for yourselves.Travolta was dynamic, putting in a great performance, but I found his manic characterization not befitting as the supposed master-mind of the criminal plot involved. Remarkably, there were three other hijackers in the movie. I don't know why Scott even bothered including them. They were not only ineffectual characters with lackluster performances, but totally lacked the dynamic presence and interplay between the hijackers of the original film so much so that you barely even noticed them - or cared. Oh well, I guess it would not have been practical with only one hijacker....The dizzy camera-work and stylized production were tedious at times and distracting. The soundtrack was, IMHO pure garbage.Like I said, I found it entertaining, but despite some opinions that the "updated" and "freshened" plot was exhilarating and an improvement on the '74 incarnation, I honestly don't think the Matthau/Shaw/Balsam version need worry about being eclipsed by this remake. Go see it though, as it is fun summer fare and if you have no ties to the original, you'll probably find it relevant. Afterward, do yourself a favor and rent the original. You'll see the way the story was meant to be done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travolta and Washington make it work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Taking of Pelham 123" was the movie that had it all. A great director in Tony Scott, screenwriter in Brian Helgeland (Man on Fire, LA Confidential), and leading men in Denzel Washington and John Travolta each doing what they do best. To its credit, Washington and Travolta keep it afloat. This is the kind of movie both can do in their sleep and watching them go one on one with each other is the film's main bright spot. Were also in for a pretty exciting ride as Tony Scott swings his camera around New York city streets and underground subway tunnels. Though this remake of the 1974 film starring Walter Mathau and Robert Shaw proves to be a little less than the sum of its parts.Washington plays Walter Garber, the chief detective for the MTA currently involved in some controversy over a bribe he may or may not have taken. While that's being worked out, he's been reassigned to desk duty as dispatcher in the subway command center. Just today will be a day unlike any other as armed men hijack a New York City subway 6 train and hold all of its passengers hostage. The leader of the hi-jackers wishes to be called Ryder (John Travolta), and tells Walter that he wants 10 million dollars within an hour or he will start executing hostages. The cops (led by John Turturro) are brought in but Walter remains as the lead negotiator at Ryder's request.Short on actual plot, I was expecting more of a character driven movie and early on it appears to go in that direction. There is a great scene where Ryder puts Walter on trial for the bribe and it leads you to think that these two are going to butt heads in dialogue-driven scenes all day long, exposing each other for who they really are. Just the battle of wits ends there, which is unfortunate cause the movie really crackles whenever they talk to each other. Travolta, sporting a menacing goatee and tattoo, is at his over-the-top, f-bomb-dropping, lunatic best and Washington is his level-headed, average-guy adversary.The rest is all action. Car crashes and shoot-outs take place, the car crashes coming within a sloppy scene where the police travel by motorcade to deliver the money and the shoot-out starting from a rat crawling up a guy's leg of all things. Both feature no important characters and situations that are manipulated. The finale comes before you know it, a chase through the streets of NY that's more exciting because it makes more sense. And Tony Scott, despite using clichés like counting down the clock and going into slow-motion, keeps the movie gritty and fast-paced. As for the rest of the cast, James Gandolfini, playing a New York Mayor, is good comic relief, getting jokes about Giuliani, subways, and the Yankees but Turturro and Luis Guzman, playing a disgruntled MTA employee working with Ryder, don't get much to do."Pelham" works pretty well as a thriller because the Tony Scott-Denzel Washington teaming (this is their fourth go-around) always seems to do so and adding Travolta, always fun as a villain, is another nice touch. Just it doesn't always leave you engaged in what's happening, whether because the plot or the action lacks humanity. Still it's held together by good acting and solid direction and for that alone it's worth a ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Washington offsets Travolta, producing entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to find this remake of the 1974 thriller was actually pretty good. I thought that, because it was a remake by an explosion-happy director (Tony Scott) and starred ultraham John Travolta, it couldn't possibly be all that interesting. Maybe a mild diversion, but those are a dime a dozen during the summer. But hey, big shock! It's actually pretty tense, with just enough twistiness to fascinate without seeming implausible.Of course, the biggest reason the movie succeeds is Denzel Washington. Washington plays a disgraced (investigation pending) transit executive who's currently slumming as the control chief. On his shift, naturally, a 1:23 train out of Pelham (New York City) suddenly stops in the middle of its run, and a hijacker demands $10 million to be delivered in exactly one hour, or passengers start dying unnaturally.What makes this a little more than your typical cat-and-mouse game is the undercurrent of what's gotten Washington character into hot water, as well as Travolta's character's actual motives. After all, he's just grabbed a subway full of hostages, but obviously he can't just ride the car to Cuba, or something. He has to have an escape plan.Washington and Travolta play off each other very nicely, with Washington's flawless portrayal of a flawed man far more convincing than Travolta's garden-variety unhinged wacko. Essentially, Washington was good enough to counterbalance Travolta's overacting. (Is he crazy, or is he just cleverly acting crazy? Who cares?) Washington's Walter Garber is unsure of himself, an actual Everyman thrust into a madman's master plan. It's roles like these that separate Washington from people like, say, Tom Cruise, guys who can play really only one character, the Man Who Knows Everything. Walter Garber not only isn't a "seize the day" kind of person, he shies away from confrontations he knows he can't win.Also worth noting are John Turturro (as a hostage negotiator displaced by Washington, since Travolta won't talk to anyone else) and James Gandolfini (as Hizzoner, finally playing a mayor who's not a complete nitwit). Gone is the whimsical naming convention from the first, in which Robert Shaw named his comrades after colors, which was swiped by Quentin Tarantino for Reservoir Dogs. There are some changes from the original, true, but they don't seem contrived; for example, Walter Matthau was a transit cop in the 1974 version, not some under-investigation suit.The action is tense throughout, especially since you assume that the hijackers are going to have to murder someone at some point (otherwise, why have a deadline?) Somehow, the movie manages to be gripping and realistic without being over the top. There are some minor bouts of nonsense (did we really need to know that Garber needed to bring home a gallon of milk?), and maybe in the final 20 minutes or so it's a little by the numbers in its approach to action, but overall it's not bad at all. It's certainly a lot better than I'd expect a John Travolta movie to be, but maybe that's because he's the bad guy here, and they're practically expected to be over the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that goes off the tracks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technical wizardry does not make for a good film. Mix in an annoying jazzy score, guitar riffs and some violin music, a couple of overrated actors, and you get TTOP123.First off did Denzel do a reverse DeNiro and gain 50 pounds for this role? He looked like fat Albert "on a good day." Travolta, also sporting an earring or two -- what are these guys, two metrosexuals wanting to do each other? -- alternately drops f-bombs between ridiculous soliloquies about his tortured past and while plugging a hostage or two just to break the boredom. OK, he was reading bad lines, but he did not make for a believable villain, alternately scowling and laughing or otherwise mugging for the camera. Compare to the superb Robert Shaw, who played the character with calm menace that was 10 times as scary.Plot holes? By the bushel. First off, there's Denzel's wife, in the middle of a tension-filled crisis in which blood is being spattered left and right, badgering her husband to bring home a gallon of milk. Could anything be more ridiculous? Maybe a producer promised the woman some more celluloid time on the casting couch, but the role was entirely superfluous and the 10-minute scene of the couple talking sweet nothings on a cellphone while bodies are dropping everywhere was one of the funniest I've ever seen.Then there's Travolta, $300 million richer, thanks to his manipulation of the stock and commodity markets, worried about a paltry $2.5 million cut from the heist, weighing around 55 pounds, that he had to lug around at the end during his escape.No disguise, easily identifiable, Travolta and the rest of the gang blithely stride through midtown Manhattan carrying big heavy satchels of cash, trying to hail cabs with thousands of people milling around and hundreds of cops. Travolta's character was about as stupid as you can get, riding and then walking in broad daylight, inviting easy capture. A more plausible ending would have had him stroll into the Waldorf, get a room and disguise himself until he could try to get away later, setting up a cat-and-mouse finish.But there was no imagination, no humor, no intelligence, nothing whatsoever to justify making this movie other than its sole purpose: another big paycheck day for the two stars. Watching Gandolfini play mayor, I couldn't help thinking that if he was Tony Soprano, he would clip the entire cast, crew, director and production team and dump em all in the East River.Save your money and rent the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It started off so good... where did it go wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, from the minute I saw the trailer, this looked like it was going to be such an exciting thriller. We have two great actors in the leads: John Travolta and Dezel Washington. Where could you go wrong with that? So my boyfriend and I saw this movie a couple nights ago and had a great time. The movie was intense and provided very good action? BUT? there is a huge but? the film just fell flat at the end. The first and second act are extremely entertaining and beyond intense, two power house actors pulling in very decent performances, had great chemistry and did a good job with the script they were given. But what the heck was with the ending? We shift into this Action 101 book of clichés list and was a complete let down. As a movie, The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is certainly entertaining, but when it comes to being realistic, yeah, it's pretty bad.Four heavily armed men, led by a man who calls himself "Ryder," board a New York City subway 6 train, then proceed to take control of the train. Meanwhile, MTA dispatcher, Walter Garber, is assigned to the Rail Control Center due to an ongoing investigation that he took a bribe to recommend a Japanese car manufacturer for the next subway car contract. The group then uncouple the front car from the rest of the train and hold the passengers of that car hostage. Ryder and the hijackers settle down on the front car, demanding $10 million dollars in ransom money to be paid within the next 60 minutes. For each minute past the deadline, one passenger aboard his car will be killed. Garber and Ryder exchange conversations though the microphone, Garber agrees to have the city pay Ryder the $10 million ransom. Lt. Camonetti enters RCC, and Garber's boss, who has a rocky relationship with Garber, orders Garber to leave the premises. Camonetti takes over the hostage negotiations, infuriating Ryder who demands that Garber be put back on the mic and that he will speak only to Garber. Beginning a very award friendship as the clock ticks down to get the money for the hostages.Over all I would recommend this for a matinée show or just a rental, it's nothing I would say to rush out and see. It's still a decent enough movie that I'm shocked John Travolta actually made a good choice in taking. He's a great villain when he wants to be and he proved that in Face/Off. Denzel also did a great job as this poor man who just coincidentally was having an average day and now all of a sudden has the added pressure of having lives depend on him. But like I said there are some major flaws that came with this film as well, there were unnecessary moments like what was with the kid and his computer? It had nothing really to do with the story and wasn't that vital. The nice army black man that jumped in front of the gun to protect the kid, the kid's mother talks to him before, but turned out to be unnecessary. Still as silly as these flaws are, it's still a fun movie to watch, I'm glad I checked it out.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, tense heist thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A surprisingly enjoyable and tense thriller. While it does have a good bit of the kind of silly excess that ruins most summer blockbuster movies anymore, those flaws are overshadowed by the tightly-wound script and a couple of good performances from Denzel Washington and John Travolta. Director Tony Scott seems to have spent a good bit of effort trying to channel the spirit of 1970's American movies, and often this pays dividends as the focus on grittiness over spectacular action sequences ups the suspense. It's interesting that as the movie approaches the end you can feel the director's 21st century comic-book instincts straining against the genre he's working in as the story becomes increasingly less believable and more "heroic." Nevertheless I can recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a suspenseful action movie that doesn't beat you over the head with histrionics from beginning to end. Admittedly I've never seen the original, and I can easily imagine those who love it might be substantially less enthusiastic about this remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brain Damaged Film-making!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" (1974) starring Robert Shaw and Walter Matthau is a classic. Tony Scott's remake, "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" (2009) is not.This remake begins with what has become the obtrusive and defining style of Tony Scott's recent pictures. Frenetic editing, sudden wipes, stuttering frames, rapid focus-pulls, repetitive zooms and ear piercing sound design to punctuate every moment. This style soon becomes sickening and you wish for a moment a shot would simply hold for more than 3 seconds without constant self-conscious cinematic gimmicks.This arranged marriage of production effects even made me laugh out loud when during a helicopter shot of the New York skyline, the sun disappears behind some sky scrappers and each time it does you get a "whoosh" sound followed by a train "beeep"!Soon after this nauseous beginning, a simple edit of Denzel Washington sitting at his desk is badly botched when a mid-shot cuts to a close-up and he is looking and sitting in a completely different position! On top of these shallow post production and in-camera effects, the core of the original has been dumbed down with a profane and ranting script. The joy of the original ending has gone to be replaced by guns, ranting, salutes and machismo.Gone is the tension and excitement of the original. Gone is the subtlety of performance. Gone is the humour. In fact everything that made the original great has been wiped clean from this horrendous exercise in style over content.The wife asks for a gallon of milk (a ridiculous scene) and I am sure you would have a better time trying to drink that gallon of milk in one go than suffer this atrocious attempt at film-making. Tony Scott is less talented than his brother but still showed promise with his early work. If he continues down this route of brain damaged film-making, I will avoid his pictures as I do those of Michael Bay and Ron Howard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pelham Offers Quite a Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Tony Scott movie gives one helluva ride, but don't sit and analyze the plot for credibility during the closing credits, this is not that kind of movie. Four sleazy thugs, who could be spotted as bad guys by a blind man, hijack a Lexington Avenue subway and take passengers as hostages. A ransom-for-hostages negotiation begins via radio between the driver's compartment on the train and the central control center for the New York City subway system. The premise is hardly new territory, and, for those who have seen the Walter-Matthau-Robert-Shaw version of the John Godey novel, the film is even less original.However, for audiences that want a night out at the movies with a rousing action flick, "The Taking of Pelham 123" will fill the bill nicely. The editing is often frenetic, and the camera moves even during dialog-heavy scenes. The chases are fast paced, the car crashes are over the top, and the bloody scenes are properly bloody. While all of this is enough for some mindless entertainment, four excellent performances enhance the proceedings and make the film seem better than it is. John Travolta pulls out the stops as Ryder, the head hijacker, and, in his full wacko persona, steals his every scene. As the man on the other end of the phone, bespectacled Denzel Washington, dressed down in everyman frumpy, is quiet and assured, although nothing quite suggests that the character of Walter Garber will or could rise to his climactic actions. James Gandolfini plays the mayor with a sly sense of fun, and John Turturro is a hard-to-gauge hostage negotiator. "Pelham" is a man's movie, and the women are relegated to small, peripheral roles as wives, conductors, and hostages. How refreshing the film might have been if Scott had cast a female in one of the four main roles.However, whatever the movie's flaws, and there are many, "The Taking of Pelham 123" does what it sets out to do: entertain and engage the audience for two hours. Don't expect more, and you won't be disappointed, and, in a summer movie, "Pelham's" assets are exactly what most of us are looking for anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed with the Usual Exaggerations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, four criminals led by the smart Ryder (John Travolta) hijack the subway train Pelham 123, stopping the first car with nineteen hostages in a higher plane in the tunnel in Manhattan. Ryder calls the subway control center and the operator Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) talks to him. The abductor demands ten million dollar and gives one hour to the delivery by the City Hall. The Mayor (James Gandolfini) accepts to pay the ransom while the NYPD negotiator Camonetti (John Turturro) assumes the negotiation. However Ryder demands that Garber, who was demoted from an executive position due to the accusation of accepting kickback in the purchase business of Japanese trains, continues to be his liaison with the authorities. Within the tense hour, Ryder empathizes with Garber and asks him to bring the money to the train. "The Taking of Pelham 123" could be a good movie, with a story with potential and great cast. Unfortunately it is spoiled due to flaws combined with the usual exaggerations of most of Hollywood action movies. There are terrible moments that really destroy the story, such as: (1) why the corrupt Garber would confess the true story of his bribery? He could have told a fantasy to satisfy Ryder and keep secret of his kickback. (2) Why the ransom was not transported by helicopter? (3)Why that imbecile girlfriend would insist on asking her boyfriend to say that he loves her in such a tense situation? (4) Even in an unusual day like that one, how could an investment be multiplied by 150 in a few hours? Two million dollars transformed in three hundred million dollar in less than two hours is simply ridiculous. (5) Why should Garber risk his life following Ryder? (6) Why should two criminals under siege of a large number of police officers and without any protection shoot their guns? (7) Garber had less than six minutes to reach the location to deliver the money and spends precious seconds talking nonsense with his wife. (8) Why would a cold blood killer like Ryder with three hundred million dollars to pay bribery pacifically surrender to Garber? I listed only some absurd and silly parts that insult the intelligence of any average viewer. Unfortunately I have not seen the original movie to make a comparison. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "O Sequestro do Metrô" ("The Hijack of the Subway Train")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel Washington does it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This urban crime drama is a diverting entry with plenty of action, tense moments and running dialogue to sustain interest for the duration of the film. The main plot is a hostage situation and a demand for an outrageous sum of money. Denzel Washington and John Travolta spar throughout the picture and play off each other very well. Denzel, as always, is great and Travolta makes a good heavy although some of his one-liners fall flat as he negotiates with Washington. There are several interesting scenes of the trains, subway stations, tunnels, track beds and elevated sequences where the action takes place. Some of the street-level scenes, involving taxi and police car stunts don't seem to be necessary. Cast and camera work are very nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pelham" Is Suspenseful, Fun Summer Heist Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Taking of Pelham 123," Denzel Washington plays Walter Garber, a dispatcher in the New York City subway's control center. When Garber notices that the Pelham 123 train has stopped for seemingly no reason, he radios the driver and discovers that the train and its passengers have been taken hostage. A team of criminals led by a man who identifies himself as Ryder (John Travolta) is demanding that the mayor (James Gandolfini) give them $10 million within one hour in exchange for the hostages. If there's a delay, Ryder threatens to kill one hostage for each minute that the money's late.This film is a remake of the 1974 original starring Walter Matthau alongside Jerry Stiller and Hector Elizondo. The filmmakers took some liberties with the story, which enhanced it. For instance, Garber is no longer Lt. Garber, a transit cop. "Pelham" is a by-the-numbers heist flick; the good guy will win, but the fun is seeing how he'll do it. Because Garber is no longer a professional crime fighter, an otherwise predictable (although enjoyable) premise becomes more suspenseful.Also, the updated story portrays technology as both a blessing and a curse to good effect.Washington and Travolta deliver engaging performances. Playing a relatively low-key, almost geeky civil servant is an interesting change of pace for Washington. Travolta is terrifying as a disturbingly intelligent crook who oscillates between being sadistic and amiable. The conversations between Garber and Ryder touch on fate, relationships and even contain moments of humor. Such lines, in the mouths of less capable actors, would have been tedious.A standout in the supporting cast is John Turturro as police negotiator Officer Camonetti, who inserts himself into the hostage situation. Although playing a hard-boiled cop, Turturro handles the role delicately and prevents Camonetti from becoming a caricature.One slight disappointment is that Garber's wife Therese (Aunjanue Ellis) does not factor into the film that much. Her appearance in the film's trailer is half of her appearance in the film. One would think that there would be plenty of home-related conflict considering that Garber's situation could result in professional, if not fatal, consequences. But then again, the story plays out in a little more than an hour, so the short shrift makes some logical sense: Perhaps there wasn't enough time for panic to mount.This performance-driven (I had to make a pun somewhere) crime thriller is a must-see for the summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forced action scenes and nonsense script ruin what could have been a good thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! MAJOR SPOILERS! This film started out good, but it soon became clear that the director (Tony Scott) and the source material had a bit of a falling out somewhere along the way.The story was obviously meant to be a sort of a low-key thriller, where most of the action takes place on a psychological level, in the interaction between the hostage taker (Travolta) and a hapless train operator (Washington) who happened to be on the shift when the takeover took place. And at times, it is exactly that. The scenes where Travolta forces a confession out of Washington and offers hostages in exchange for the mayor (the Soprano guy) were great. This is where the movie shines, where it's the way it was meant to be.However, Scott apparently thought this tension-filled psychological mind-game would be too high-brow for the average consumer. So he decided he must do everything in his power to make the sucker more EXTREME, you know, the way modern kids like it. And how in the would would a prolific Hollywood director like Tony Scott make a bunch of tension-filled conversations more exciting?You've guessed it. This is yet another modern movie suffering from the infamous shaky camera syndrome. If you enjoy your POV flying loopdeloops around the room, shaky closeups of character faces and stop-motion intermezzos (and all that during an average dialog scene), you're in for a treat. A direction style normally reserved for action scenes was used to effectively detract the viewers' attention (and source of their tension) from the events inside the plot to the director outside it.Scott obviously knew this, which is why he made sure the little action this movie has (and NEEDS) is as EXTREME as humanly possible. Thus, a simple matter of transporting two bags from point A to point B is turned into an idiotic and completely needles car chase, that destroys more property than there's money inside the bags. Then, there are Travolta's nameless henchmen, who are apparently there solely to die gruesome bloody (and EXTREME) deaths. And finally, there's the main bad guy himself, who isn't content to simply head-shot his helpless victims but must empty his entire clip into their jerking bodies, while droplets of blood and guts spray over the screaming hostages. EXTREME!Really, if Tony Scott wanted to make an action movie, why he didn't just order an action script? It's not like he's some rookie who must film whatever is given to him.Speaking of the script, forced action is hardly the only thing wrong with it. Throughout the movie, police snipers have hostage-takers in their sights and can end the crises in the moment they are ordered to shoot. But for some reason, no one gives the order, nor is anyone apparently in charge of giving it (where is the police captain coordinating the hostage negotiations and SWAT shooters)? What government would rather pay millions than try a rescue operation if there's even the slightest chance of success? And where's the FBI and SEALs taking over and icing Travolta in a minute?On the other hand, why bother at all? Very soon, the police finds out identities and faces of everyone involved in the heist. With traffic cameras on every street corner and other assets of the 21st century law enforcement, the criminals are screwed, whether they escape the train or not. Doesn't Travolta know that? After becoming a YouTube legend, how long would it take someone to recognize his face and twitter him over to the police (LOL ITS THE SBWAY DUDE !1!!)?Considering all this, you'd think the bad guys must have a really good reason for engaging in such a risky enterprise. And really, throughout the movie, Travolta makes it a point to portray his character as a desperate man living on the edge, staking his life in an all-or-nothing game against the might of the city that had let him down. Only later, we learn his entire scheme-within-the-scheme depended on him investing $2 million from an earlier robbery, so he could make hundred times as much on the market, when... wait, what!? He'd rather risk his life, kill a bunch of innocent people and spend the rest of his life in hiding, than retire with *just* two million!? That burning urge that drove him through his crazy scheme wasn't idealism or revenge or even the simple desire to get rich, but the desire to get even RICHER!? He must be the craziest, greediest, most idiotic millionaire on Earth. And a douche bag to boot.These baffling inconsistencies in the plot make much more sense when we take in account this is a remake of a movie originally published in the early 70-ies. Back then, they didn't have the Internet, cameras and Nazis in charge of airports. The bad guy actually had a chance of getting away with his ingenious plan. The least script rewriters could have done was give Travolta and his men masks, or some other way of concealing their identities.On the other hand, watching a pair of eyes talking into a radio for 90 minutes would have hardly made for an exciting film, so I guess I can see why they decided to sacrifice believability for the sake of character interaction. Now if only Scott would slow down the camera enough so we could actually see that interaction...So, was there anything good about this movie? Surprisingly Travolta's acting. All the Scientology stuff aside, you can see why he was once considered an A-class star. Great job. Washington was very good too, you can really tell the panic taking a hold of his character when Travolta forces him to confess. As I mentioned earlier, radio dialogs between the two of them were truly the highlight of this movie.Too bad the rest of it was sacrificed on the altar of blockbuster popcorn fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When placed side-by-side to the original 1974 classic slow-burning thriller, Tony Scott's remake looks like Danny Devito did in Twins: inferior in every way. Where Joseph Sargent's direction was subtle, Scott opts to shove everything down your throat; where Peter Stone's screenplay from 25 years ago was clever, Brian Helgeland tries too hard to make it hip and cool; and where Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw proved an unlikely but memorable pairing as good guy / bad guy, Washington and Travolta share next to no chemistry. So rather than sentencing this film to death by comparison (which it does deserve mind you) how does it go as a stand-alone picture? Tony Scott is essentially a glorified Michael Bay. Everything is done fast and loud, regardless if the film calls for it or not. Where this has worked for Top Gun or Crimson Tide it fails here. Scott has infused so much needless action with rapid edits and whiplashing camera movements that it proves to be distracting. Even an innocuous conversation between the Mayor and an adviser has a circling camera catching the scene, such is the constant motion Scott feels compelled to instil. It doesn't stop at the eyes though. Every chance possible our ears are assaulted with unnecessary sounds which are poorly matched to what we see on screen (at one point a helicopter sounds like an F1 car.) Occasionally a film calls for coarse language ? some movies can even use excessive language to great effect (Reservoir Dogs or Boondock Saints for example) ? however almost every time the F-bomb is dropped in Brian Helgeland's script, and it happens a hell of a lot, it is simply not required. 99% of the colourful language comes from Travolta's crim, but instead of emphasising emotion it purely makes him look stupid. Couple this with plot holes galore and this screenplay from the Oscar winner who wrote L.A. Confidential and Mystic River leaves a lot to be desired.Thank goodness for Denzel. Incapable of delivering a bad performance, Scott's go-to man (this is their fourth collaboration) salvages this run-of-the-mill action / thriller with his nuanced performance and sheer charisma. As Garber (first name Walter as a nod to Matthau who played his 1974 counterpart), Washington finds a nice balance between your every day worker and someone able to step up in this extreme situation. Travolta doesn't succeed as the foul-mouthed psycho Ryder at all, his go-for-broke portrayal is laughable and ensures we can never take him seriously. Supporting players Gandolfini and Turturro are solid but don't have much to do.Don't waste your money seeing this on the big screen, wait the six months and rent it on DVD. Better yet, skip this and see the remarkable original Pelham instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very poor remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 27 years old when the original was produced but didn't see it at the time. In fact, I didn't have my first viewing of that fine thriller until a couple of years ago on TCM. I was engrossed. This film is a prime example of a remake that replaces plot and substance with technology and foul language to make its point.Many other reviewers here have dealt with their criticisms in comparing the new version with the original. I will not. I can't improve upon them. However, consider this. Washington's character has just been the primary negotiator for the "good guys" in a tense hostage situation; has been virtually forced, for the good of others, to put his life in danger to deliver the ransom money to hijackers of a NYC subway train; at the end, in a kill or be killed scenario, he must shoot the ringleader(Travolta)of the bad guys. His background? A former train engineer who is promoted to a pencil pushing executive position.Now tell me, wouldn't this be a situation where Washington's character might require some psychological debriefing for his own mental health? Not in this flick! Nope, he goes home dutifully with the gallon of milk his wife requested during the tense negotations with the hijackers! By the subway, of course! Immediately after his ordeal! Incredible... and that's what this movie is in the worst definition of the term.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly Pointless Remake of a Classic, Don't Bother With This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to describe my contempt for this remake if you are not familiar with the original. First off, the original had a much realer feel to it, the stations, control tower, command center, the car etc. You felt that you were really down there. This one was made in the subways too with the cooperation of the MTA, but it felt so generic with its trick photography, rap blasts, etc. It was more like some lame MTV video than a movie at points. Where it fell far behind the original is in the character. This one is just a mind game duel between some generic Hollywood mastermind who also is a pointlessly violent movie psycho and Joe Niceguy in his space age command center. The original had a rich set of extras: the tired cranky subway workers, the hostages in the car, the other hijackers, as well as Detective Garber's partners. They all added some humor and color and made it feel that it was a reality based movie. Even the bad guy, a ruthless mercenary, was at least operating in reality, not playing violent head games with his counterpart on the other end of a radio link.For instance, Joe Niceguy Garber-Washington is sent home by his superior after the NYPD hostage negotiation team moves in. So what does Psycho Bad Guy Ryder-Travolta do? He freaks out, threatens then murders a hostage in cold blood in order to get Garber back on the mike. No one, not Garber , the cops, or his colleagues even says something like: "you psychotic bastard what did you shoot an innocent man for you scum? That was not one of your demands." Instead the pacify him and act like it was the city's fault the man was shot. The original had a subway management guys who insulted and refused to cooperate with the hijackers until prodded by Garber. One of them was even murdered in the original when he walked down to the captured subway car unarmed and alone, and kept berating the hijackers. Then Bad Guy threatens to murder a teenager unless Good Guy admitted he took some bribe he was accused by the MTA of. Of course Good Guy fesses up, saving the youth's life. But when you add that to the last scene of Bad Guy murdering the motorman over Good Guy's absence, you have to wonder how someone so childish and impulsive could ever mastermind a sophisticated crime that took planning and others, as well as his previous life as some master of the universe. It reminded me of one of those "crazed vet with his gun in the room full of hostages for no particular reason" sort of scenarios, not a complex heist like this.Both of the leads had all sorts of background story fillers that the original did just fine without. Then there is the mayor. In the original he as played by a nobody but he and his coterie of advisers were funny as he struggled with a cold. When he asked if paying off the hijackers would get him any votes, the reply was that he would get the hostages' votes. In this one Gandolfini as Mayor walked through the role, providing not much more than a cameo. Both movies had a car accident scene when the police were running the money from the federal reserve bank to the subway station cross town at high speed through downtown. But this one had about 3 times the footage as well 3 times the wrecks, for what purpose, NASCAR fans?I could go on and on, but this one just had two stars, one hamming, the other loafing with a bunch of trick editing and some extras to fill up space. It was technically a good film with good production values so I gave it a 3 instead of a 1. The best think about this movie, when compared to the original, is to show us how bad things have slipped in Hollywood.</fullReview>

I decided to give it the benefit of doubt-the crew people said Travolta, Denzel, Gandolfini, Turturo...so I though okay: what the worst that could happen!Somewhere Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw and Martin Balsam are all spinning in their graves! Took recap my thesis argument: Hands down the worst remake that I ever seen in my almost 35 years. I have lost so much respect for the Hollywood Machine. The plot was ridiculous! The acting was cheesy! The dialogue was hilarious! (and folks this was no comedy) John Travolta was on the rise again- this might have knocked him down a few pegs. Denzel Washington... come on, And I am saying this with the utmost respect and admiration- But you could have picked a better script-if I were you I would fire your agent...I am not saying they ruined you but this was no American Gangster or X etc!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-so thriller but swooshing cameras do not cover for lack of spark and tension in the material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been the best part of a decade since I saw the original film version of this story but I still remember it being pretty enjoyable with a dark edge of comedy. From the opening seconds of the remake it is clear that the focus here is going to be on the action. Jay-Z's 99 Problems kicks things off while the camera swooshes and zooms round as all the main players move into position ? within minutes subway car Pelham 123 has been taken and a race to save the hostages begins. The rest of the film is meant to be exciting and tense and we know this because the camera is constantly swooshing and throwing in slow-motion bits here and there to let us know that the stakes are high, lives are on the line and that we should all be tense.Sadly, while the cinematographer is keen to make sure we know this, nobody else seems that bothered because the film does nothing to justify the sweeping camera movements and pumping soundtrack. In terms of physical "money up there on the screen" action, there is very little and what there is just seems thrown in for the sake of having some action (the car crashes trying to get the money in on time) rather than being part of the film. This in itself is not a problem by any means, because the nature of the plot did always suggest that the spark would be in the dialogue and the interplay between the two stars. Sadly this is lacking as well. It isn't "bad" though, but it just lacks spark, impact and tension. The problem is mainly with the script but director Scott doesn't seem to know what to do with it all anyway and seems desperate for characters to get shot or for things to crash into something just for the sake of having action. Travolta appears to be happy just to ham it up with a simplistic performance that matches the basic feel of the film. Washington had the harder job and suggests he could have done it with better material and direction ? instead he is thrown into forced dialogue and unlikely semi-action sequences towards the end. The supporting cast is pretty good through with a handful of HBO faces in there (Sopranos' Gandolfini, Generation Kill's Kelly and The Wire's Akinnagbe). Gandolfini, Guzman and Turturro all do the good work you would expect from them, although again all are limited by the material.It is not an awful film, so if you are looking for a glossy but basic thriller with stars and a big budget then this will just about be good enough to pass the time. The lack of spark and tension is the killer though and this the film cannot compensate for no matter how many time the camera swooshes around or the editor makes quick cuts ? the failure is deeper than that and nobody appeared to be able to address it to make this film better than it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original movie was a smart witty thriller , a cut above the usual heist thriller . Some people might complain the action is a little bit too static but that's not the point and it is very important to remember this . Having nothing better planned I turned over to Film4 to catchthis remake and caught the tail end of the advert break . It was only after two minutes that I realised what I was watching wasn't the adverts but the opening sequence of THE TAKING PELHAM 123 . That's says all there is about this movie Do I have to repeat it ? It's important to remember that whilst the original only having two sets , the subway control room and the subway train the original film managed to carry itself by some smart dialogue and character interaction . This obviously isn't enough for director Tony Scott and the production crew who feel the need to bludgeon the audience to death with MTV style camera work , editing and score . It's as if the production team think if people are being held at gun point on a train that's not exciting enough for a cinema audience so feel the need to insert sequences regardless of it makes any sense or not It might have been a good idea to make the hostages in the train interesting . The original film succeeded on this score even if they were slightly offensive in their ethnic stereotypes but hey nothing is perfect but even that was preferable than a jarring cut of police cars zooming around the city with crash zoom lens , then to even this up we get a sequence in slow motion . The only people in this film who deserve any credit are the hairdressers who gave John Travolta the same hairstyle as me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pelham 1, 2, 3 Times a Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Scott is obviously obsessed with the "F" word to the point of not being obsessed with logical details regarding his story. His goal was apparently to replace Scarface as one of the top "F" flicks of all time. Note to Tony: A good thriller flick is, in large part, based upon the believability of the story-line and the situation at hand. 1. Why would you deliver the money across NYC in mid afternoon by car vs. flying it by small helicopter (when facing a 38 minute deadline)?2. Even then, surely you would know the best car route and block off the intersections in advance (vs. using a rolling roadblock) and thus, avoid two collisions (and potentially killing pedestrians on the most crowded sidewalks in the country).3. You've got snipers surrounding the train car and can clearly see two men sitting in the front and two men standing in the back with guns. Give the signal and plink all four at one time.4. A truly well-trained negotiator would have taken command of the scene and never let some smuck supervisor tell Denzel to go home. The negotiator knows that whomever establishes the initial report with the terrorist leader is critical on the scene.5. Someone that Wall Street savvy also knows the SEC can trace and track activity that amounts to $307 million in a single day. How'd he think he could run from that?I could go on but.., why? This is simply another remake that disgraces the original.</fullReview>

But the rest of this movie isn't up to scratch.The dramatic tension of the hostage situation never quite builds up to the promised crescendo, perhaps because Walter doesn't fully follow through on his threats or because the hostages' characters are not developed very well.The focal point from start to finish should have been the pressure-cooker situation of the characters all being stuck on the one train, but the protagonists end up leaving the train and just chasing each other around the city, at which point any tension disintegrates and the movie becomes a bit dull.</fullReview>

This is the first movie for probably several years i couldn't finish - at some point i just stood up and left.Don't get me wrong, i know this is a remake (never saw an original and doubt i will) but screenplay is absolutely, totally horrible, from start to finish.First, kidnapping is a federal crime, so there wouldn't be any NYPD guys in less then 20 minutes. No NYPD in the tunnels - FBI SWAT would be. And thats just whole another story, i felt that every piece of drama in film is made out of nothing. Car crashes and fly like 10 meters by air? on a full controlled lane when every cop in the city knowing what is going on? Skilled motorcyclist bumping into parked! car?give me a break. but when i saw that rat getting inside the pants of a sniper i finally couldn't take it anymore - get some pictures of SWAT teams you will note that they either put pants into shoes or use inner tube like on snowboard pants to prevent EXACTLY that kind of incidents.When i want to see a since fiction flick i go watch since fiction (btw i love since fiction, for real). But thats like a modern day thriller, serious movie with top stars and top director.i was absolutely disappointed and badly surprised that such a low quality script got into production. and i couldn't even finish the film, while most people say that last part of the movie and ending is even worse. what a shame.</fullReview>

To top it off there's a meaningless sequence in the middle where the NYPD has to deliver the money to a specific location and race to get there. Cars crash and flip over, a taxi cab is totaled. Even the people in the NY transit authority 'hang the lampshade' by saying "couldn't we have just sent a chopper?!" Yeah. But choppers don't have exciting chases through the streets of New York City.

Then there is the hero's phone home with his tearful wife and her "I'm so proud of you" etc. etc.Next we have foul mouthed Mr Travolta doing some mindless killing and his team of hi-jackers who must have been on "Extra" wages because they don't say more than 5 words between them.Mr Washington actually puts in a good performance which is overshadowed by a stupid bribery sub plot.Take away the above and we are left with car crashes, people running around and an ending with a host of continuity flaws.Watch the original ? it was superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, my friends, I will go to see any Tony Scott film. I know ahead of time that it will not touch me in any way, merely providing me with colorful movement.I know that the story will be irrelevant, and that the same slots will occur to be filled: the computer squeaks; the overhead map-location situating; the text on screen that tells us where we are; the in-story folks who monitor, usually in a room with display screens.I know there will be excesses in the acting and chases. I know I will leave wondering how to replace the intellectual gap that has appeared in my life. But by golly, he makes competent films. They are useless, but they work. And I value things that work, if only because it affirms that the world is in good order and that when I make my own internal films, they will work as well.I watched this and the original. It is amazing how much they differ. The original was built when technology still meant big things like trains. And in those days, one diverting script event was sufficient. You could hold the energy yourself without being told to and given aids. So it was something to see how the thing was reborn. Yes, you still have the runaway train and the connection between hijacker and dispatcher.But here we have two nice complications. Denzel's character is a crook, and for once he does an understated job. And the diversion of the hijack? Instead of the diversion for the getaway, we have the ransom as irrelevant. Nice touch.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The are so many reasons why this film, originally put on celluloid in 1974, should not have been remade, the No. 1 being that it's difficult to out-act Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw.This version's leads, Denzel Washington and John Travolta, however, give it their best shot. The problem is I always compare the latest incarnation with the original, and this was never more acute than while watching the newest release "The Taking of Pelham 123," the tale of a ruthless, heavily-armed gang which attempts to hijack a New York City subway train.Washington is nice guy Walter Garber, a former transit employee bigwig demoted and trying to clear his name. During a routine day at work he finds himself confronting Travolta's "Ryder," (via radio communication) an ex-con who has taken over the Pelham train and demands $10 million for the safe return of the 15-plus hostages (inflation has taken its toll here, as the price in the original picture was only $1 million) to be accomplished in a short one hour time limit.Walter and his superiors want to hand the situation off to NYPD negotiator Lt. Camonetti (John Turturro, "Transformers," "Quiz Show"), but Ryder is having none of it. He's grown to like his conversations with Walter (even killing the train's motorman to prove it). While Washington plays his role cool-as-a-cucumber and almost too low-key, Travolta more than makes up for it, going so far over-the-top that he falls down the other side.This huffing and puffing performance makes his other more notable bad guy roles (namely "Swordfish" and "Face-Off") look like quiet, introverted, nuanced character studies. Combine that with the innumerable and somehow obligatory F-bombs and you have quite an annoying effort from a fairly decent thespian.The movie now develops into a game of cat-and-mouse as the the clock ticks down and both men feel each other out and force painful revelations from one another.Meanwhile, the mayor (James Gandolfini, TV series "The Sopranos") becomes involved and sequences of the money transfer and a few more hostage killings are then inserted to liven the action.Finally, as one can deduce, Ryder asks Walter to deliver the money himself, so we get a chance to see the two on camera at the same time. This leads to a stale, safe and muddled ending that had this reviewer scratching his head and hoping for a concluding twist that never took place.Without any real backstory or motivation, the whole effort seems pretty pointless. In the first film, the steel cool Shaw was a mercenary with an ax to grind with the city and the harried Matthau was an overworked cop caught up in a situation beyond his control. The members of the original movie's gang and individual hostages were also much more interesting, as well.Here, members of both groups are just prop set-ups to be killed on cue. We pretty much know who will die and when. Not too much suspense here, friends. The first movie's bad guys had faces and names (remember Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey and Mr. Brown the precursor to Quentin Tarantino's bad guys in "Reservoir Dogs"); here, the villains who support Ryder are so undercooked, we could care less.The grit and feel of the first picture was also conspicuously absent in the new version, too. Here is an antiseptic New York which is so crime and chaos free the mayor can travel to and fro on the subway each day without being confronted by the normal crazies who occupy the city. In addition, the gradual suspense of the 1974 installment is replaced with a rocket fire plot line and scenes of ridiculous automobile rides that result in one of the most ludicrous car crashes on film.Now, I know many will argue that the special effects alone continue to make these re-makes a necessity, but even for 1974, the action was not bad. Today, with everything being created on a green screens, there are no more exciting moments when we wonder about stuntmen and real crashes and explosions. Now we just watch slack-jawed and think, "Oh, the subway goes 500 miles per hour and then crashes; that's nice." You know, the more I write about this film, the more I miss 1974.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty poor, laughably corny popcorn nonsense from uber meister Michael Bay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning *mild suggestive spoilers* This glossy remake of the little known 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One, Two, Three has a slick, stylish opening with a clever use of credits and camera angles that makes promises it can't keep for what's coming up in the rest of the film. Indeed, it's this sort of gimmick that sets the film up for what it is, all style over substance.It's pretty clear this was intended as a 'real time' thriller, but no genuine air of tension or suspense is ever generated, and every clever gimmick Bay uses to try and do this, from slow motion camera use, fast cuts/editing and most nauseatingly of all, spinning the camera around as James Gandolfini liases with his followers, doesn't work. Even freeze framing the screen to reveal it's '48 minutes', '32 minutes', '12 minutes' before the ransom deadline, doesn't work.Cast wise, the basic problem is the two lead stars are simply playing their roles the wrong way round. Denzel Washington could have added some genuine dynamism to the bad guy role, but he has the biggest star power and, as the guy with top billing, is stuck in the role as the nice guy, but the real problem is John Travolta as the villain. Sadly, he just comes off as laughable in the role, with his daft facial expressions, 70s porn star moustache and shouting 'motherfu*ker' down the line seemingly at the end of every sentence.With all this going on, sadly the film's implausibility and corniness become a real issue, and you're left niggling over the miracle broadband connection under a tunnel, Denzel's character being thick and asking what to do with the cent from ten million dollars and a cent, not to mention returning home from his ordeal at the end of the day seemingly unscathed by it all. When he phones his wife and she tells him to come home safe at the end of it all with a gallon of milk, you can just tell how it's going to end.Sadly, for all the publicity, this emerges as just another one of those pot boiler thrillers Denzel likes to make in between all his more meaty stuff. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can tell within the first 5 minutes it was going to be a bad movie, and with in 10 minutes what this movie was all about. Never saw the previous movies, but this one was pretty awful.No real depth to the characters and the story line quite predictable. The actions of the characters lack motive, or reason. Many scenarios or sub plots go no where, nor do they serve any purpose. Action scenes seem to be there only to add drama, but do not assist in the storyline or plot. By the end of the movie, you do not connect or feel a bias towards any of the characters and realise they all just had a pointless day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do you begin with a movie this bad? This is the Hollywood industry with its head jammed right up its own rear end. The line-up, the setting, the countdown, the one-to-one head-on climax --- it's a no-brainer, a dead cert for solid profits, right? Sadly, no one could see past this fabrication to Brian Helgeland's screenplay, which is a remake of a remake, and should be a slam-dunk, no? Not. It grasps for originality with a drunken grope that scoops in only tawdry gimmicks. I walked out when Travolta's stereotypical doomed-psycho character started head-banging Denzel Washington's subway factotum into admitting he had taken a bribe over a train purchase in Japan. Sorry, this was not entertainment, this was a movie industry desperate to manipulate me and my attention span into ignoring the removal of dollars from my pocket-book. The US industry badly needs to get its head out of there, and start seeking fresh new directors and writers with interesting new ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in a while, there is an arcade game-like remake of some classic movie, (remember Rollerball), and some criminally silly ones (Solaris!?!) so I'm just waiting for the day when some bright accountant in charge of the studio decides it's time to remake a "2001 Space Odyssey" and the lunacy will be in full swing. This time, after many others, they decided to ruin Joseph Sargent's classic 1974 caper, with brilliant roles from late Walher Matthau, Robert Shaw and Martin Balsam and fabulous Jerry Stiller. I often wonder why do studios employ armies of writers, readers and producers when they can't think up a movie any more that wasn't filmed before. There are lots of potentially good or even great movies in the history of cinema that had the foundation that wasn't build upon properly, and that would benefit from being remade, but the studios don't want to waste time by developing those, it's much easier and faster to sell the ones that were great to begin with.Steer clear of the instant plastic video game remakes they make nowadays, and always look for the original. It'll be like tasting a vintage wine instead of the supermarket one from a brown paper bag. Trust me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The noise, oh, the noise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there a prerequisite somewhere in Tony Scott's contract that his films all have to be terribly, terribly noisy for no particular reason? I suppose if there was one filmmaker who could take a delicious cat-and-mouse thriller - that was made into a superb 1974 film starring Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw, Jerry Stiller and Martin Balsam - and turn it into a cacophonous mess, it would be Tony Scott.Scott has replaced the wit, nuance and subtlety in the original film with yelling, bombast, some pointless action and noise.After the screeching title credits, I actually thought Scott's remake showed promise when it settled into telling the story of the hijacking of Pelham 123. I liked the initial interaction between Denzel Washington's Walter Garber - a tribute to Matthau, perhaps? - and John Travolta's Ryder. There were the seeds being grown for a thrilling cat-and-mouse game.But then Scott's needless wizardry comes to the forefront. The dazzling camera work, the fast edits, the obnoxious music that simply overpowers scenes.Honestly, one cannot blame screenwriter Brian Helgeland for this. I am sure had Scott eschewed some of the technical razzmatazz for the story, going for substance over style, there might actually be an entertaining picture here.Then again, Helgeland shares some blame for the story. Ryder is the only hijacker we get to know. The others, including one played by Luis Guzman, are completely forgettable. We only see them shooting guns or walking around the train carriage. They are cyphers and of little use to the plot. Watch this and then consider the 1974 original, where we got to know the other hijackers - they had some depth, they were fleshed-out - because director Joseph Sargent actually cared about delving into his characters.In this remake, Garber is a civil servant, as opposed to a cop, with a shady past. Washington is up to the task of playing this Everyman character. There's a nice calmness to him, even though Helgeland has deprived Garber of any humor or spunk. Though, in a van attempt to give Garber depth, we have to sit through superfluous scenes involving Garber's wife.Then, there's Travolta. Is it possible that Travola, like Al Pacino, is fast-becoming a caricature of himself? That was certainly the impression I got from watching this version of "The Taking of Pelham 123." Travolta's performance is so over-the-top that it simply is tough to take seriously. This is over-acting of "Battlefield Earth" (2000) proportions.The trouble with Helgeland's screenplay is that it is riddled with giant plot holes. It really doesn't take a genius to figure out Ryder's background. But just in case we are too daft to get it, we are given hints as subtle as thunderous gunshots. But if Ryder is supposed to be as smart a person as he is, just consider his getaway plan. It borders on ridiculous. I can see why the other characters might want to abscond with the money, but why on earth would Ryder, given what we know about him? And given what we know about him, why would he want anyone to know what he looks like?The action sequences are completely over-blown. Some even don't make any sense. One involving a parked car and a cop is utterly pointless. Action scenes have to make sense, there has to be a reason for them. It might look cool to blow things up and have vehicles crashing into each other, but if they don't have any meaning, they make no sense. That is the case in Scott's film."The Taking of Pelham 123" is the kind of film that gives Hollywood a bad name. Not that there are not style-over-substance movies that aren't enjoyable. Take Hong Kong actioners such as "So Close" (2002) or "The Killer" (1989), for instance: Despite their style, they still succeeded in being movies that one could get engrossed in. They are thrillers that thrill.Scott uses slam-bang in a failed attempt to drum up thrills. He and Helgeland had a great chance to update the story and make a thoroughly exciting and captivating thriller with two strong, intelligent men matching wits. Instead, what we have is a boisterous, needlessly noisy, mindless action film that ignores an enticing premise because it is far more fascinated with car crashes than with nail-biting suspense.</fullReview>

John Travolta, what can I say...BAD. All the dialogue with Denzel Washington... Painful to endure. This is a perfect example of people making a movie, just to make money, and not even trying to make it good. I wonder what Walter Matthau would have said about this... Garbage. Do yourself a favor, get the original and watch that. OK, the color and graphics and sound wont be as good, but you must admit, there was an element to movie making back then that they lack today.If you should buy this movie, and cry after, remember, I warned you about how bad it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how bad this film is. It is so truly remarkable. The film is so bad it is almost as bad as a Michael Bay movie. Yes it is that terrible. This film is disguised as a seat of your pants blockbuster thriller. There are quite a few reasons why the film fails to pull this off.First of all, the acting is unbearable. This is by far the worst acting I have seen by Travolta in his career. He comes off as very forced and lacking in any genuine emotion. He also fails to give any depth to his character and as such, does not come off as a serious threat to the audience. Second is Denzel, who actually does a great deal better, but puts in just enough of himself to allow us to keep watching. Thus Denzel's performance compared to his other films is quite wooden.Secondly, the plot is horrible. I know this is a remake, and I haven't seen the original, but these days it is possible to jazz up a boring plot with whichever mechanics are applicable, be it a colourful script or the subtle use of storytelling gimmicks and effects. Because the story is mundane and the script is cheesy and unsatisfying, I did not care about anyone in the film. I did not want the good guys to win. I did not want the bad guys to win, I just wanted the film with two of my favorite actors of all time to just end as quickly as possible, so that I could remove it from my film collection.Thirdly the music. To its credit, the music is not bad, but when combined with the low standard of the film, it comes across as a lie, trying to make us believe that the film is as 'epic' as the score would lead us to believe. If they had played down on the soundtrack and used dramatic sound effects/music at specific turning points in the movie, it would not have saved it, but would at least bring it up to an average level so that the participants could save some face.I tried watching this film at least three times, and each time, it put me to sleep. Now I have finally watched it and I am utterly dismayed at this below par effort. 42% And I shudder to think of how bad it would have been if they had not included such prestigious actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie plenty of twists and turns with heart-stopping excitement , it's an outstanding take on of the 1974 film of the same title in which various hijackers (Travolta, Luis Guzman, Gojcaj) , kidnap a N.Y.C. subway train and hold the city to ransom . Gripping thriller about a ragged team (led by ruthless John Travolta and his cohorts ) of kidnappers who hijack a commuter train and the events get worse . Soon , what should have been a standard kidnap and ransom transaction turns a dangerous game of killings between the foul-mouthed ringleader Travolta and the authorities (Inspector played by John Turturro and Mayor performed by James Gandolfini) with Denzel Washington in middle . The leader demands by them for millions of dollars ransom in cash to be delivered on limited time to avoid murdering the occupants one by one. The transit controller framed allegedly by bribes must deal with the unexpected , a terrible hijacking of a commuter train and he becomes saviour of the system . The passengers of the tube represent a cross-section of New York , as an African-American , , ex-soldier , a WASP , a mother with her little boy , and a teen with his personal computer , among others.Exciting action movie that contains first-rate edition ,terrific acting and jarring bursts of violence . Brooding narrative of Washington's efforts to rescue and save the victims is developed on a unthinkable final . Pulsating musical score by Harry Gregson Williams and colorful cinematography by Tobias Schliessler . Crackerjack script by Brian Helgeland who greatly improves John Godey's best seller novel. This edge-of-your-seat motion picture is professionally directed by Tony Scott in his usual desperate style that retains a peculiar fascination .Other films dealing with this thrilling story are the following : 1974 classic version by Joseph Sargent with Robert Shaw (Travolta role), Walter Matthaw (Washington character) as a cynical, grumbling , gum-chewing Transit Authority adding his comic and ironic qualities , along with Martin Balsam and Jerry Stiller . Furthermore ,a boring TV adaptation by Felix Enriquez Alcala with Edward James Olmos , Vincent DÓnofrio and Donnie Wahlberg .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 (2009)Well, you can't really blame anyone except the director for this pretty-good-not-great struggle of a crime hostage subway drama. John Travolta is convincing enough as a smart guy gone bad, but he never quite exudes evil (he doesn't even swear very convincingly) or the craziness you'd need to try this scenario. Denzel Washington is smooth and quick and impressive as the bad guy done good (though not very bad--he just bribed some folks in Japan). The two connect over a telephone, and a lot of the movie, with all the mayhem aside, boils down to their back and forth.Well, a lot of the movie actually boils down to editing. The camera-work is very dynamic, every scene, even a short head shot, seems to have the camera sweeping or swooping. This makes everything edgy, which of course is a good thing when you have a high stakes disaster in the works. But the editors have cut this footage as if it was Hitchcock's showers scene in Psycho. I don't mean literally (it's not a constant montage, not quite), but there is rarely, if ever, a sense of immersion and flow. We are battered by all this amazingly horrible stuff (including some really heartless killing) and it happens on the screen in a flurry of short takes and jarring snippets. We know too much that it's a movie, and the pieces are made to go together sensibly, up there, not in here, where it would be a thrill.The director by the way is Tony Scott, an action adventure guy (Top Gun), and the movie does have a steady intensity. But there are some unneeded sentimental cornball things, too, highly unlikely, between passengers, or between one guy and his girlfriend through his laptop, which seems to run out of power at one point and then is working again later. But anyway. As usual, Washington holds his own and gives some stability to the whole, which is made up of so so many parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pelham 123 is taken over by John Travolta is his posse. Denzel Washington is the poor guy who's working the day this happens and he is stuck in the middle of it all. Travolta doesn't want to speak with the hostage negotiator, he wants to speak with Washington. Demands are made, people are killed and this remake lacks what I wanted from a hostage film. That would be suspense. Travolta is the bad guy, I dig it. He's been bad before. In Face/Off he had a lot of fun impersonating Nic Cage, I had fun with him too. In Broken Arrow he is up against Christian Slater, this time Travolta plays it cool. Pulp Fiction, he gained his respect back as Vincent the hit-man. In this one he cut his hair short and crew out a goatee. He looks really ridiculous, but that's besides the point. He is not terrifying here and for some odd reason it sounded really awkward when he would start swearing. Like it was some kind of forced material, it did not flow like in his other films. Washington is the good guy, he is the loser, not knowing what to do, yet gets it done. He doesn't go above and beyond, he plays it regular. His pairing with Tony Scott here is very ho- hum. He doesn't command the screen and he shouldn't because it's not that type of character. But then again, Travolta doesn't either, when he really should have.The suspense is no where to be found. I appreciate the gratitude the film puts the hostages in. A lot of films are scared to kill off some hostages, this one isn't. Usually we would also get to know some of the hostages, maybe find interest in the characters. Not here, they are on the back burner. So we could care less about them living or dying. There is a subplot involving Washington taking a bribe, doesn't do much for me, or the story. The direction is as expected from Tony Scott. It gels with the same crowed as Domino, Man on Fire and Deja Vu. I do give it a little more respect than some of those I mentioned though because it doesn't have the same colour tinted editing that really got old fast. Domino and Man on Fire are guilty. This remake is an okay way to spend 2 hours, it doesn't suck. But it doesn't really stay with you either, or turn up on your best of lists. What it boils down to is, this is mediocre and is full of characters that I just couldn't essentially care about. I haven't seen the original either, but that doesn't matter. Washington is more convincing than Travolta. Actually, when I look back and think about it, it wasn't all bad...until the last 20 or so minutes. Then it gets really out of hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Taking Of Pelham 123 A Decent Action Thriller With Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Taking Of Pelham 123 is a decent action thriller with flaws which I'll get into later from director Tony Scott whose admirable in making this movie despite it's problems. He puts his own unique touch to the film which might not be one of his best but overall the movie is okay. Denzel Washington is perfect as average joe Walter Garber a dispatcher who gets more than he bargains for what starts off as a seemingly ordinary day at work turns into something much more. Washington is very believable as the character turning in another solid performance among many continuing to show audiences his talent as an actor. If he wasn't in the movie I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did and given the film a lower rating because Washington made it worth watching. Well done. John Travolta is decent as Ryder a mysterious criminal mastermind but I felt he went over the top at times at least to me. I'm not sure if it was his performance or the eventual twist involving his character's past I just couldn't really take seriously. -Spolier- I mean Ryder was some Wall Street broker or something like that who spent a little time in jail and when he gets out he's all of a sudden this real smart bad ass criminal mastermind willing to kill for money. Travolta still turns in a good performance though none the less and he did have nice chemistry with Washington in their scenes together creating tension that builds between them which kind of made up for either his performance or the lack of believability involving his character's twist. The rest of the cast including John Turturro, Luis Guzman, and James Gandolfini are solid as the supporting characters who aren't given a whole lot to do but they're effective in their small roles. The few action sequences are well executed and there's some suspense that worked in it's favor for the most part. The pacing of the movie however was a little slow making it feel longer than the film really was, and the dialog wasn't the best at times. Many characters (like Guzman's who's role is more of an extended appearance) aren't really developed and the ending was a bit predictable but it was fitting for the film I guess. The twist as I mentioned earlier involving Ryder I didn't find very believable but the film is decent for what it was. So if you're in the mood for a good action thriller this might fit the bill but don't expect any classic heist masterpiece. The Taking Of Pelham 123 does have some action, drama, suspense, and good performances by the cast (especially Washington) for the most part who make this film worth the time to watch at least once despite it's flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow this film had a lot more potential than the final production. John Travolta and Denzel Washington both class actors but even they must have known that this film was quite poorly produced.Denzel's character was plausible at least but the real let down has to be Travolta's attempt at playing a crazy train hijacker. Words escape me as to why his character was so ridiculous with all the random out of place swearing. This was topped off by a whole new look for Travolta which made me chuckle at several points.One of the "highlights" has to be the transportation of the money.... I thought this was the CRAZIEST literally CRAZIEST sequence ever!! How does the police vehicle manage to send another vehicle into a perfect somersault through the air?? Then the officer on a bike crashing straight into a parked vehicle?? And finally the transport car crashing and falling off a bridge??? Speechless...All in all I didn't have very high expectations and just wanted to watch an action flick. So if that's what you're after then this movie should do just fine. In the end I was just in awe of why this film required such great actors for this insane film.I hope this is the last film of this kind either of them do again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tunnel, A Desk, and a Car Chase?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trouble with Hollywood movie makers is that they think we possess insufficient intelligence and/or patience to watch a film about a hostage situation unfold without shoehorning in a superfluous 'action' sequence. In The Taking of Pelham 123 we have one man (Denzel Washington) sitting at the control desk of a section of the New York underground negotiating with another man (John Travolta) who has hijacked one of the subway trains, uncoupled one carriage, and is holding its occupants ransom for $10 million in a tunnel underground. The city of New York has one hour to come up with the goods or big bad John starts indiscriminately picking off the passengers.You'd think that would be enough to enable any filmmaker to fashion a compelling, suspenseful drama ? and you'd also think any attempt to insert a few action shots of cars slamming into each other at umpteen miles-per-hour as they race through New York City's streets would look like horribly incongruous. Well, guess what: you'd be wrong and right. The film, while entertaining enough, lacks any real tension simply because the characters are drawn in black and white with no shades of grey. Yeah, Denzel took a bung from the Japanese for recommending their train ? but he did it after he'd chosen their train, and he only did it to pay for his kid's education (note to self: employment at senior management level with the NY train service clearly pays peanuts). So that's barely off-white, let alone grey. Travolta hates the world and has no redeeming features, so we all know what's going to happen to him before the credits roll.The action scene comes courtesy of an attempt to transport the $10 million ransom across the city by car with a motorbike escort. The writer cannily has the Mayor of New York asking why they didn't helicopter the money in order to prevent people from pointing out the glaringly obvious. The guy the mayor asks just stands there looking dumb which means the writer couldn't figure out a plausible reason either.John Travolta is by far the best thing about this film. As he approaches late middle-age he has truly divested himself of all hints of the teen heartthrob of yesteryear. He really looks like he has a grudge against the world and everyone in it, and brings an entirely believable furious intensity to his role ? he doesn't just look the part, he acts it as well. Washington is good enough, but his character's development is clumsily handled and his transformation from desk jockey to have a go hero is too abrupt to be believable.If you just want an action thriller that requires ? or, in fact, encourages ? little or no thought on the part of the audience, then this is the film for you. It's also worth watching for Travolta's blistering performance. If you're considering renting it for any other reason, I wouldn't bother if I were you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit reluctant about seeing "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" because most remakes don't always live up to the original movie. They either leave out material, add things that weren't there originally, and the coherency is non-existent. So here I am writing a movie I never really wanted to see and it wasn't because of the action and thrills it delivers (though that's one of the greater qualities of the film), but mostly to be amazed at the brilliant performances by the dynamic acting from Denzel Washington and John Travolta.Washington takes the lead as Walter Garber, a New York City subway dispatcher who takes part in a hostage crisis as one of the trains has been taken over in a hijack lead by the psychotic Ryder (Travolta) and his gang of goons. The story follows in the typical Hollywood standard fare hostage story very much like the classic "Speed" which doesn't add anything really that special, story-wise. Director Tony Scott includes a plethora of highly powerful vehicle crashes to keep the action junkies heart thumping. But where the weakness of the story stems from the script as the harried mayor (played my a miscast James Gandolfini) as he wants to know why was there a need to terrify innocent passengers to deliver ransom money instead of using a helicopter. Sure it's not very original and only a bit far-fetched at times, but it's still enjoyable overall, but not strong enough to add excitement about.However, the acting from Washington and Travolta as hero and villain respectively add some much-needed spark as they're able to spar words without looking back. They were just really natural. John Travolta has plenty of versatility as an actor and when given the right script, he is capable of making people's heads spin. Sure he's right on the spot when he's playing lovable, pelvis gyrating light-heartening studs, but his best roles are when he plays tough, deranged baddies or dangerous hit-men like Vincent Vega in "Pulp Fiction". But in this flick, he sacrifices his looks, his charm and his suave persona for someone ruthless, diabolical and remorseless and he pulls it off flawlessly. And what's even more freaky is that he looks like he's enjoying every minute of playing the villain, which is by far no easy task.In contrast, I feel Washington's status as a performer has taken a downward spiral as of late. He constantly speaks his lines the same way like in all his other films (sans "Training Day"). That typical drawl blended with Denzel's symbolic arrogance has become tiring and monotonous over the years. But in this movie, he delivers a rather tranquil, relaxed character in Mr. Garber. Even the scene where Walter and Ryder verbally spar on radio with each other which could have been a manically stressful moment was executed in a calm, and professional matter making it the best dramatic scene in the movie. Granted the story may be dry and pedestrian, but when two veteran performers spar with each other I can assure this movie can be passive about its flaws that make for a grand day the movies. And that's what makes this movie very special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>action/ negotiate/ hostage type of movie with 2 big name stars. John Travolta plays the bad guy, Ryder, and Denzel Washington, Gruber, is monitoring the train tracks. Ryder and his gang take over a train car and hold passengers as ransom. They want 10 million dollars. But that is not really all they want. It's obvious they have another plan in motion in which to make a lot more money concerning the stock market. Most of the film is just Ryder making demands with Gruber and finally using Gruber to deliver the money, give directions, and drive the train. In a very boring, little action ending, Gruber saves the day.I thought all the cussing went overboard. It was just distracting and made me like it even less. And I don't think Travolta is very good in the bad guy role. He plays too many heroes in films.FINAL VERDICT: If you really like films involving hostages and negotiators then see it, but otherwise, there are better movies out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, I'm not sure why Hollywood continues to produce movies that have been done a thousand times already. I knew this was a remake going into it so I was half expecting something new or a twist that would catch me by surprise but nope.............bang, bang you're dead. I like the idea of leaving almost all back story out, letting you figure out the motives on your own but movie-watchers are far too intelligent anymore to be spoon fed a straight cops and robbers story. Travolta and Washinton are always good but they seem to play just about the same character in every movie they appear in. I just saw Washington's "Book of Eli" and you can almost interchange the character from that movie and Pelham 123 and have the same movies. The one thing that stays with me from this movie is the black dude on the train....saying, "This is the only plan I could come up with." If you see the movie, you'll understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid performances,can't save this somewhat,underwhelming remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Taking Of Pelham 1,2,3 is certainly a disappointment in eyes,considering the talent involved. John Travolta and Denzel Washington,are both non issues,except for a couple, they both play off one another tremendously. However, the film fails to spark any sort of excitement at all,and in the end,it gives you,a competent,but rather underwhelming redoing. Everybody seems to be going through the motions at one point or another,I don't know,it just seemed to me,like they Wern't fully into it. The film relies heavily on the performances,from Denzel and Travolta,but the film unfortunate gives them very little screen time together,and I think that hurt the movie a lot. Now I haven't seen the original,but this is why I detest remakes in general,simply because they are nothing more then money makers,and it shows how uncreative and lazy, Hollywood has become. I did enjoy the film to a certain extent,John Travolta is always a wonderful villain in films,so he managed to create the perfect villain. Taking Of Pelham 1,2,3 is a big disappointment. It's bland,uncreative,and goes through the motions often.Performances. Denzel Washington is one of the best actors,currently working today. Here he is solid,managing to capture our interest,but he often seemed to be on autopilot,therefore he wasn't as good as he could have been. That being said,he still put on a good show,he is Denzel Washington after all,one of my favorites!. John Travolta plays one of the best villains. Here he puts on a show for the audience. He is clearly enjoying himself,and as a result,we enjoy watching him. John Turturro is classy,and managed to be pretty decent,in his role. James Gandolfini is very good as the classy,yet slimy Mayor.Bottom Line. This is a rather underwhelming remake,with very little going for it. It looks good,it's well made,but it just lacks the proper tension,the film desperately needs to succeed. Unfourtantley the film failed completely in that aspect. Worth the watch,as it's watchable,but save it for a rainy day.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple ransom thriller gives you what you'd expect, nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There comes a point in the repetitive nature of films where the phrase "run-of-the-mill" just won't do. In the case of the remake of the train hijack/ransom heist thriller "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3," the mill has been running so much that maybe the more adequate phrase should be the past tense "ran." Tony Scott's "Pelham" does give us those vital and homey conventions of the "mad man takes hostages and demands millions" movie, but the story is so straightforward and the film as a whole never seems to take itself seriously enough to completely hook its audience and pull them into the situation.First there's John Travolta, rocking some creepy facial hair, senseless tattoos and shouting swear words at authorities like it's the third grade and his buddy just taught them to him. Considering "Pelham" is not a movie that aims to dig into the psychological background of its antagonist, his attempt to play up the Joker-esquire semi-insanity of his character is pointless. The script does coax you to guess the motive of his character, but the ultimate answer isn't good enough to justify Travolta's performance. Even Denzel Washington, unlike previous Tony Scott thrillers, is relegated to spectacles and a weak attitude. The characters offer very little gravity to the hostage situation.In the film, Travolta and his cronies hijack a New York City subway train and hold everyone in it hostage for $10 million dollars In the process. Washington's character, the man who oversees that section of the rail traffic, gets stuck in the situation because Travolta's character takes a strong liking to him from their radio conversations.Travolta's "all guts, no glory" attitude does keep you in suspense for brief moments when he might kill another hostage, but the attempts to make us really care about the hostages on board are feeble and half-hearted. I really don't pity the guy video chatting with his girlfriend during the crisis who keeps stupidly demanding that he tell her he loves her when he could get shot if he says something. Then there's the matter of him getting Internet down in the tunnel, but that would have been more forgivable if it weren't such a cop out.The only real solid other than Washington despite his limitations is the direction of Scott, who does everything in his power to keep up the intensity of this bare bones movie. Speeding blur transition to mimic the feeling of a train as it barrels by and briefly freezing moments and giving us title cards to show time ticking down until the deadline for the money exchange are a few of the techniques that the master of highly watchable thrillers employs."Pelham" isn't horrid, it just doesn't bring a whole lot to the table. It makes no effort to stand out among the dozens of ransom thrillers that came before it other than that it involves a subway train. Unless you're a sucker for the genre, "Pelham" won't feel like it made enough effort to go beyond mere sufficiency and I say that having really enjoyed Scott's "Deja Vu" and "Man on Fire," for example. I'd recommend searching for a thriller that might have something more to offer before trying out "Pelham."~Steven CVisit my site, moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A New York subway train is hijacked and the bad guys are demanding $10-million.This is a remake of the same title back in the 1970s and the original had more suspense, tension, better dialogue and we cared. Here we didn't care. This was a talk-fest between Garber (Washington) and Ryder (Travolta) and most of it was quite boring after a while. This could have been a one-act play and maybe should have been.The acting was good all around , but Travolta isn't convincing as a bad guy. We still like him. Willem Defoe would have been my choice. He's scary. Maybe that was what was wrong with this. Also, the presentation didn't measure up. We were fed rapid fire action scenes mixed with dialogue, but they weren't effective. The shootings of some innocents didn't have the effects they should have. There should have been shock here and there wasn't any. Then, the story crawled into Garber's background and the investigation of him being accused of taking bribes. Need to stretch things out, that's what you throw in. The action scenes were terrific, whether CGI was used or not. But, I don't think CGI was a factor here and the stunts were outstanding. Quite outstanding in fact. Washington's Brooklyn accent was lost somewhere in the beginning and was quite noticeable when he left it behind. That's a picky point but I wanted you to know it was noticed. We New Yorkers are proud to defend our accentBeing the location was New York, the story had to roll out the F-bombs and there were many. Too many. I know New Yorkers don't always talk like that. Aren't you tired of these Remakes that don't measure up? Go rent the original. It's much better, and you will care. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, almost non-stop</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... if you haven't watched the original movie, with Walter Matthau that is! If you have watched the original, you might be tempted to rate it even lower. Depending on your own taste that is. The thing is, while some movies age badly, in this case, the original is still far superior than the remake! And when John Travolta can outshine Denzel Washington (not by really much though), than you know you're in for trouble. Both characters aren't really "good" (pun intended), but Travolta has some finer moments, when he plays the evil card! Still there is far less "talk" than in the original, which means far less (to none) one-liners. It's less fun, it has more action, but is far more ridiculous. And it changed the very good ending of the original. Which isn't a bad thing itself, but the "new" ending is just ... well bad! Better watch the original once more!</fullReview>

This is a good movie overall, one of the better flicks so far this year (but not good enough for Oscars unfortunately - they should forget about trying to find 10 nominees for best picture...it's a joke right??? it's not like we live in the Golden Age of Hollywood or somthin)...Anyhow...only thing I didn't care for was the rat causing accidental shooting - that sort of came out from nowhere and seemed like a cheap plot trick IMHO.

		<shortDescription>You can't add to perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Taking of Pelham 123 is a film classic, combining the serious plot of a hostage situation with a light hearted background humour and an array of subtle acting by an all star cast. This on the other hand is just over the top. You would think after his ridiculous performance in Battlefield Earth, John Travolta would have learnt that loudmouth over the top goofiness is not the way to act, apparently he didn't as this shows his constant yelling, screaming, violent mannerisms and general rashness, unlike the impression Robert Shaw left on the audience with his cool, calm way of thinking, his subtle approach and generally more relate-able character. I realise they're attempting to make a different character in this movie, changing him from the mysterious ex-British Mercenary that was Mr Blue into the arrogant and psychotic Ryder, but the reason why Mr Blue is far more likable is because he appears to have more grasp of the situation that Ryder does. Rather than stomping up and down the train randomly shooting every life- form he comes across like Ryder, Mr Blue can calmly take over the train without firing a shot, only stating his demands by pointing his sub- machine gun at the passengers and not having to shoot any unless he had to.Garber's character has also been heavily downgraded. Again, although they are attempting to make a different character out of this person, the fact that they reused his name was indignant to begin with. Going from the sarcastic and nonchalant Subway Security Lieutenant to the corruptible Train Dispatcher was really not a good turn for this character, and I preferred Walter Matthau's role in the original because it made the film less of an emotionally serious drama story and into something a little bit more laid back. The character as well you can relate to because we all know someone who is sarcastic and cool in our lives don't we, not someone who is relatively uptight and has an overly complex back-story.The rest of the film plays out similar to the original, with the Subway train being hijacked, demands for money, cops in the tunnel, etc, etc. However he ending has been changed where rather than Garber going down to confront Mr Blue at gunpoint, Ryder demands that Garber bring the money and then take him hostage. Overall, the modified ending is just a mess of sparks and small arms fire that I'd rather not reflect on.Basically, this movie is a load of gibberish compared to the original, and a failed attempt by film makers to try and recreate the genius of a film that was perfect to begin with and didn't need recreating. From once rather simple characters, this film turns them into overly complex cardboard cut outs, with John Travolta once again topping the Pavlova in the acting department, turning Robert Shaw's cool and sophisticated character into a disorganised, gunslinging madman who has no grasp on the situation at hand. And to be honest, I also think he's an attention seeker as well because unlike Mr Blue, who calmly sat in the cab reading his book whilst the other men watched over the hostages, Ryder goes out of his way to get the attention of Garber and the people on the other end of the radio, calling (more like yelling) them every two to three minutes to make sure their still interested, even holding passengers at gunpoint so he could learn Garber's life story. If that's not a messy Character development, I don't know what is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never really takes off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the previous two incarnations of Pelham 123, but since the original was directed by Joseph Sargent, the man responsible for Jaws the Revenge, I think I'll give it a miss. Presumably Sargent is doing a life stretch in the funhouse without parole thanks to Jaws, so Tony Scott stepped in for this remake that is in danger of a Red Bull induced heart attack.Travolta (dressed as one of the village people) and Washington star as the crook and subway controller who come to rely on each when a subway train is hijacked beneath New York City. A lot of back story is squeezed into the film in an effort to deepen the drama. But in the end...none of it really comes together.The subway train spends 90% of the film completely stationary, so Scott exaggerates as much of the cinematography as he can to compensate for the lack of momentum. Federico Fellini once said that in order to entertain an audience all you have to do is show a train in motion. Well, there ain't much motion on board Pelham 123 I tell ya.It's not a bad movie, just an entertaining one that might annoy you with it's multiple missed opportunities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How To Do Bland 1-2-3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. I don't know where to begin in describing the blandness of this movie. ( not a film, a movie).John Travolta as a bad guy? Are you kidding me? He sits in a Subway car and curses for two hours and shoots innocent people in the head and I still don't believe he's a bad guy? Then he isn't a bad guy. There is absolutely ZERO character development in Travolta's 'character'. He swears and kills people then gets killed unceremoniously - who cares? Nobody.There are few people on this earth, let alone actors, with an ego as large as Denzel Washington's. Does he have any clue whatsoever at the drivel he is engaged in here? Probably not. Denzel as a meek, working man subway employee?? Ha! Maybe Oprah believes his hogwash, but nobody else does, and its evidenced in the meager box office for this pathetic endeavor.You can almost see the contempt in Denzel's eyes in every scene with every actor. Denzel exists for Denzel, how he did a movie with Russell Crowe is beyond me - oh wait - they only had one scene together, that's how two losers on the downslope of a career can co-exist. There are certain actors who receive Best Actor Oscars because they WILL fellow actors to vote for them and Denzel and Russell are two of them. I'm sure they'll be happy to join Roberto Benigni and Kevin Spacey as past winners who have gone on to mediocrity and boring people to death in pubs and bars about how great their acting prowess is.Thanks Denzel, I hope this film paid for the fuel in your private jet for many years to come because you won't be able to get away with this bunk much longer. Does anyone born after 1995 even know or care who you are? And those are the ones who have been paying your bills for 20 years.You can badger and push executives around and maybe wrangle yourself another big budget picture here and there but you don't have the chops or the gravitas to carry a picture anymore. Humbling, isn't it? No, not for the Guinness World Record Book's holder of the biggest ego.Good luck, retirement won't be easy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Taking of Pelham 123</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Taking of Pelham 123" is your typical "hostiage negotiation" thriller where crooks, led by the dynamic Travolta who has perfected the craft behind portraying wide-smiling criminals with larger-than-life personalities, take hostages on a subway train and forward their demands to the proper authorities. Denzel Washington is the dependable source of calm who somehow manages to get on Travolta's good side while on the job of directing trains to their proper stations. The film establishes, through Travolta's methods of getting information he so desires, that Washington took bribes from a foreign Japanese train designer and is currently on probation/investigation. Through this unique and difficult series of developments, Washington might have a chance to redeem himself if he can rescue the hostages by keeping Travolta from murdering them as 10 million dollars makes it's way across New York City to their position at Vanderbuilt street. Meanwhile, director Tony Scott, who can not resist his usual self-indulgent editing style and rapid-fire camera speeds, continues to call to the viewer's attention just how long the hostages have before the money arrives where it needs to as Washington attempts to correspond peacefully with Travolta. Also, we see how expert hostage negotiator John Turturro and Mayor James Gandolfini, and others located at the epicenter of activity where trains are guided to their destinations, help Washington, a veritable think-tank trying to put names to faces and identify who Travolta and his criminals are..including Luis Guzmán as the actual mastermind behind the operation, derived while serving prison for killing people in a motorcar, helping flesh out the details while sharing a cell with Travolta(..who is, in actuality, a Wall Street broker using the hostage crisis as a means to move stocks on gold!). The movie results in a big chase scene as Washington, assigned the role of delivering the millions to the bad guys, must apprehend Travolta, with the action spilling into the streets across Manhattan bridge. The movie ultimately hinges on it's impressive cast and ongoing dramatic possibilities of harm to the hostages as Travolta is adamant towards having his orders followed at any given moment(..a motorman is shot down in cold blood because Washington's superior had him leave his post for home, raising the ire of Travolta who developed a warped kinship with him, only wanting Denzel at the controls during the delivery process). With Michael Rispoli as Washington's supervisor. The movie also shows how a young man(hostage) keeps in touch with his girlfriend by a lap-top computer and this helps the authorities put a name to Travolta and recognize Guzmán. This version isn't a patch on the crackerjack original, and all ends predictably, the two screen legends meeting face-to-face, eventually caught in a stare-down where life and death hang in the balance. I must say I enjoyed it as popcorn fare, and the motorcade, where car crashes result in delays of the money getting to it's drop spot, sequences are pretty impressive as action set pieces. This doesn't escape it's air of familiarity, you've seen it all before. One major suspense set piece has the Pelham train building in speeds as it heads for Coney Island, the threat of a derailing imminent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The New York City subway 6 line that runs the length of Manhattan and continues to the borough of The Bronx, being Pelham Bay its terminus in its Northernmost point. At one time, it bore the name of the last station and thus the title of the 1974 film by Joseph Sargent that was based on the novel by Joseph Godey. It was a spectacular achievement because of the confrontation because of the mastermind behind the extortion plan and the man at the police that hunted him. It was a great turn for both Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw.The remake comes to the screen thanks to Tony Scott, a man with his own visual style. The Godey novel is again retold this time by Brian Helgeland, who has collaborated with the director before. Their effort gives the viewer another take on the scheme between the extortionist Ryder, and the man in the control room, Walter Garber. The name is used in this version as a deference to the star of the original film, who was named Zachary Garber, as it is an obvious reference to that genius that was Mr. Matthau, especially in his work of the first installment.This new take on the old product, although paling in comparison, is not a total waste. It gives us a more 'normal' hero, as Walter Garber has the responsibility of the inner work of the subway system, but he does not pursue the criminals, that is, until the end. Denzel Washington does another good turn as the conscientious man that gets trapped in the desk after the criminal mind Ryder hijacks the train.There are the usual dose of special effects and fast camera work that is Mr. Scott trade mark. Gone though is the thrill of the story which relies on fast moving cars, transit pile ups and the usual devices to create the tense atmosphere outside the subway tunnels, rather than to concentrate the conflict inside the train itself.John Travolta with his neck tattoos makes a menacing Ryder. John Turturro plays the policeman in charge of the operation. Luis Guzman has nothing to do. James Gandolfini is seen as New York's mayor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has all the trademarks of a Tony Scott film. Good cast, brisk pace and good editing. For some time, the film even moves in real time as events unfold. But all this get lost in loose script, mediocre narrative, funny dialog, technical glitches and average performances.The film is shot in hand-held style to give a feel of intimacy to the viewer which it fails to achieve unlike what Michael Mann has been able to do with Public Enemies.There are a few scenes that are intense due to some superlative editing, gripping background score and wavy camera motion. But it lacks good dialog that should give you an adrenalin rush.The film is full of flaws. There is little attention to detail and a lot of implausible events that you are forced to accept &amp; overlook. For example, Denzel Washington's shirt is too crispy for a guy who has just worked a full shift. The internet connection on one of the passengers' laptop is too far fetched and his lines are cheesy. A car crash has been put just for the heck of it just like many other things. A word about the cast. John Travolta has really gotten under the skin of his character and carries the role effortlessly. Entirely passable as the Wall Street guy gone wrong.But, Denzel Washington, James Gandolfini &amp; John Turturro have been wasted. Washington has very few good scenes and fewer good lines. He is exceptional in whatever little he has been given to do.James Gandolfini could be better cast as a hard negotiator or a bad guy, not as the two scene mayor of New York. Turturro just moves around on the fringes without purpose.None of the characters of the hostages is developed much, so we don't feel bad when they get killed. Even the Hijackers are just roaming holding guns without purpose. And go on to be killed too easily &amp; oh, too foolishly. In the end, the film becomes very predictable with a lame ending. Most of it looks as if the director will not be able to outgrow DejaVu. Remember, this same director has given us cult classics like Top Gun &amp; True Romance. Sadly, there is nothing fresh about this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It might not change the world of cinema forever, but this movie is a solid thriller/actioner. It's a little formulaic and predictable, but who cares? You've got Denzel Vs. Travolta, so you can switch your brain off and put it in a bucket of ice water for a couple of hours.The acting is, of course, of a very high standard. Denzel Washington is rarely anything other than sublime, and Travolta gives a decent performance as a determined death-wish lunatic.The worst problems stem from the absurd camera-work and pitiful video effects. There are a number of scenes where the picture becomes very jerky - which looks like a mistake, very much like a movie running on a computer that isn't powerful enough to sustain the framerate. This is ugly and unpleasant to watch; it belongs in a 1980s pop video, not in a modern Hollywood movie.Arguably worse is a minor scene involving the mayor, in which the camera swings very rapidly around the actors in a continual 360 degree arc. The effect is nothing short of nauseating. There's no reason for it except to make you physically ill.There's also some dubious bluescreen work going on, but that's not unusual. Griping aside, the film is fairly well written and well acted. There's also a really impressive shoot-out scene, which is short but almost worth the price of admission.Worth watching, but I'd wait until you can rent the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Misplacing of Pelham 1 2 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had high hopes for this film when i saw the trailer but if you have not seen the original, you are in for a treat. The original had a great cast{Matthau and Shaw), great tension and probably one of the best endings in film history. The remake has the first part in Washington and Travolta but clearly lacks the last two parts from the original. Washington is a subway dispatcher while Travolta is head of a armed gang which takes over a train and stops in a tunnel. Suspense and action are clearly lacking and the ending to make Washington into a hero is beyond the stage of laughing. One scene gives Washington seven minutes to get to the tunnel with the money but it feels like an hour before he gets there. Have not seen much of Travolta and Washington in recent years and this film will not do much too enhance their reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travolta vs. Washington, with a big choo choo.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original The Taking of Pelham One Two Three a couple of months ago on a premium channel, and I loved it. The trailer for this remake looked pretty awesome, with Denzel Washington and John Travolta starring and Tony Scott directing. I overall enjoyed this remake, even though it's not as good as the 1974 Walter Matthau/Robert Shaw classic.It follows Walter Garber(Washington), a NYC subway dispatcher who has been demoted due to a possible bribe problem. One day, a con known only as Ryder(Travolta) and three others hijack subway train Pelham 123. Ryder demands $10 million in exchange for the hostages in the front subway car. He wants the money in 1 hour. If it takes longer than that, Ryder will kill one passenger for every extra minute. During the time it takes to get the money, Garber and Ryder have a series of chit-chats. But things get even more crazy when Ryder demands that Garber deliver the money himself.First, the positives. The chemistry between Travolta and Washington is excellent. Washington is great as an everyday guy who handles this situation very emotionally. Travolta is back on the good acting track as Ryder who, while colder than Shaw's version, is also more likable and is a character you can show more remorse for. There are also great supporting performances. John Turturro is good as a hostage negotiator who supports Garber throughout the film and James Gandolfini steals his scenes as the mayor of NYC.Now for the negatives. The first 60-70 minutes are great. Then the movie takes an idiotic turn towards The Bourne Ultimatum with an out of nowhere car chase. This practically ruins the rest of the film. I also disliked some of the changes made from the 1974 version.Overall I give it an 8 out of 10. I'd give it a higher score, but that last act ruined its chances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sound and fury signifying boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of a 1974 semi-classic film puts Denzel Washington and John Travolta step into the shoes of Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw respectively in this story of a group of men who take over a subway car and demand a ransom be paid or else. Both films were based on a novel by John Godey, a source I have not read. Washington plays a subway dispatcher who ends up in the middle of it all as Travolta and his men take over the titled subway car and give him and the city one hour to come up with the ransom before they start killing a hostage a minute.This is a tense, but not very good action drama that seems to confuses frenetic film-making with real action. Director Tony Scott uses a variety of unnecessary tricks to make the film, to a large degree just people talking on a radio to each other, is more than people talking to each other on a radio. It kind of baffles me since the situation is ripe with suspense and doesn't need to be amped up any more than it is. I'm guessing that Scott did it to hide the fact that the script is weak and instead of dealing with the drama between Washington and Travolta adds in any number of additional slimy characters, from John Tuturro's detective to James Gandolfini's mayor, who really has no place in the story. Yes the changes make the film reasonably interesting (though why they removed much of the uncomfortable humor of the first film is beyond me), but for the most part I was bored and wondering what possessed me to be so excited about needing to see this that I went out of my way to do so late on a Sunday night. From the movie milestone department I have to say that the film has a patented psycho performance by John Travolta and marks the point that his ability to play characters like Ryder are now officially cliché. (John please stop taking the paychecks and phoning these sort of roles in) Its not a bad film but it's only okay and ultimately rather pointless since there is a better version of the story out there. If you must wait for cable.</fullReview>

Denzel Washington and John Travolta are good choices as the lead roles, and I could almost see them in each other's parts. They weren't totally good or totally bad (a la the Andy Garcia/Dustin Hoffman movie Hero)as Washington's character ,the hero, had previously accepted a bribe, but you knew who to root for. James Gandolfini was also an outstanding choice to play the mayor. The chase and crash scenes to get the money in time were great to watch, and overall I think this movie will be remembered as one of the best of this summer.

You can really feel how good of a guy he is and how much he wants to do the right thing. It draws you in from the very beginning and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.

		<fullReview>Climax is the most enjoyable sequence in any action/ thriller movie. As we savor the first 80 minutes, we wait for that interesting 20 minute climax. But what is it for Pehlam 123? Once Denzel drops out of helicopter and enters into the subway, the movie starts to become slow. They take money and run. Denzel escapes. Obsolutely no more action, no more suspense. The train stops on the tracks. That's the end. You feel like you can leave the theater. Rest of the movie looks unnatural. Why wouldn't John have his own escape plan? Why should he depend on a taxi, run on the tracks, and finally get caught by Denzel? Why should he ask Denzel to shoot him? I felt as if he was intentionally caught by hero to end the story.Such a nice movie for the first 80 minutes. Good plot points even in a two location situation. Good action. Spoiled by very dilapidated climax. Looked like they were out of budget, so they rushed to finish the movie faster. Did I miss something?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, what do you expect from Tony Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Scott is like a happy kid clanging trash can lids: It's all noise, all mayhem, no logic. In this update of the Walter Matthau-Robert Shaw thriller about a subway hijacking, he's impatient to get to the car crashes, the shootings, and the chases, and eager to impress us with his mastery of technology. So character is inevitably slighted, and Denzel Washington hasn't much to play except average-Joe ordinariness, and Travolta, as a mean white-collar crook-turned-proletarian, spits out his lines with little variance and less emotional investment. Even the basic plot points, like whether Washington is or isn't guilty of taking a bribe, are left flapping in the breeze. Women count for nothing in movies like this, and Travolta happens to hijack the dullest group of travelers ever to ride the MTA, so the supporting characters don't lift it out of its testosterone-driven clichés. All you have is Tony Scott trying to grab the audience by the b---s and shake hard. It's what he does, it's what he's always done, and I hate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Still Cannot Take Pelham 1-2-3 Successfully</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1974 version of "The Taking Of Pelham 1-2-3 was much more realistic than this version because the person the NYCTA assigned with decision authority to guide the project was listened to. In the original version, they used a real train for the portions of the movie that required location work, while in this version they used a real train as little as possible. In no case did they show actual Train Operator and Conductor Cabs. When they had the scenes in the Train Operator's Cab, the layout was flipped, with the Train Operator on the left side instead of the right, and lots of phony flashing lights on the back wall. In the original version, they kept the train on the line that a #6 train would actually use, while in this version they were all over the system, ending up in Coney Island, a location the #6 Train could never approach much less reach. The chase scene down what was supposed to be the Lexington Avenue Line was actually a montage of clips strung end to end which showed several other lines mixed in with Lexington Avenue clips. Most of the location work was done at Hoyt-Schermerhorn Station (Where Michael Jackson did his "Beat It" Video) and on Track Two between Hoyt Schermerhorn and the Court Street Transit Museum, with establishing shots made at Grand Central and 14th Street-Union Square.In the original, all location work was done on the Lexington Avenue Line between 51st Street and Brooklyn Bridge, with the final scene taking place on the City Hall Loop. The 1974scenes that showed a single car uncoupled from the rest of the train was plausible because the cars used in that version could be uncoupled and operated as single cars. The R-142 Cars in this version are coupled together as permanent five-car sets (two per train), and cannot be uncoupled as shown in service.The street work, which obviously was set to show how hard it would be to drive through Manhattan in Mid-day, pushed that plausible scenario over the top. Furthermore, the NY Federal Reserve shown in this version was actually the Post Office down the street from the former World Trade Center in Manhattan, NOT the Federal Reserve Bank which is down near Wall Street. Observant viewers will recall that the real Fed stood in for itself in the third "Die Hard" movie.I was prepared to suspend disbelief for this movie, given its complex nature and highly technical subject, but I could stick my tongue only so far into my cheek before I started to gag. For someone not familiar with either the New York Subway or the geography of New York City, the movie can be a lot of fun. John Travolta, Denzel Washington and John Turtorro fans will like seeing their stars at work, and James Gondolfini does a reasonable turn as a supporting cast member playing the NYC Mayor. This film is very much superior to the TV version of the 1990s, but is very weak when compared to the original 1974 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Taking of Too Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: There are "spoilers" in this editorial piece! The way that this story was re-imagined by the filmmakers wasn't too bad. There are a few suspenseful scenes, a couple of humorous lines and maybe a single scene of true emotion that I could relate to. But what I found so annoying, unpleasant and offensive is the way the story was presented on the screen. The director, Tony Scott, has a glaringly serious problem, which his inability, or refusal, to film scenes in real-time. Watching The Taking of Pelham 123 is like watching a child playing around with a film-editing machine. Speed the film up. Slow it down. Speed it up. Slow it down. This is silly and intensely visually irritating. Brian Hegeland, the screenwriter, writes dialogue that is so filthy, nasty and foul, you'd think he has Turette's disease. And then there is that unfortunate and deeply, profoundly, and disturbingly offensive scene where a Black man sacrifices his life for a white woman and her little boy who are absolute strangers to him. There was absolutely no reason for that scene other than to make a point ? and quite unnecessarily at that -- about how ruthless and murderous John Travolta's character was, a point which had already been made with more than sufficient brutality once before when he murdered the motorman. This kind of stereotypical, disposable use of Black bodies on movie screens has been going on since Hollywood was born, and it reflects a mean-spirited, contemptuous and callous disregard for Black life. I can't think of a single Black actor of any rank in Hollywood who has been able to avoid doing his Master's bidding in this way. From Sidney Poitier to Jim Brown to Denzel Washington, for some reason Hollywood won't, or is afraid to imagine a Black man giving his life to save a Black woman and/or child. Why is this so? Does it frighten the status quo to imagine the descendants of their former slaves ennobling themselves in such dramatically heroic ways?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a patch on the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a transit fan and former New Yorker living on the Pelham Line I looked forward to this remake. The original was voted the best film giving the real flavor of New York City. This one could just as well been done completely in Hollywood. One reviewer stated that this should be a treat for transit fans - not for a moment. The early scenes of trains were jump cut and speed fuzzed. No stations were shown in detail. Even walking down the tracks failed to show the tunnels. There were so many detail errors it was dismaying (but that's to be expected). For example, we know the mayor is riding the 6 train because a one-half second shot of the bridges at Whitlock Avenue appears. He calms the passengers by saying they will make all the stops. But the trains are all backed up on the line from 59th Street! In any event, the film itself was not much better. There was no character development other than Washington and Travolta. The other hijackers are barely there. Washington is excellent as the everyman until he turns supercop at the finale. Travolta is way over the top. I'm no prude but his mfing every other word was an embaresment. Most of the film is just the two of them talking on the radio. When there is some action it's much bloodier than it needs to be. To say I was bitterly disappointed would be an understatement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense, if a bit formulaic, thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen the original Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, I went into this film fairly open-minded. Denzel Washington is one of my personal favorite actors working today, so I expected this movie to - if nothing else - have a solid lead performance. What I ended up getting was an intense, if a bit formulaic, thriller.What makes this movie work is the interplay between these two main characters. Denzel Washington, again, as expected, does a terrific job portraying the redemption-seeking Walter Garber. Surprisingly, though, I found myself more impressed by John Travolta as the overconfident "Ryder." In fact, aside from his performances in Bolt and Pulp Fiction, this is probably my favorite role that I've seen him in. It's just intense when watching these two characters play off of each other throughout the first two acts of this film, which leads me to my biggest problem with The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3.While the first hour of this film is extremely ? again ? intense, around the last 30-40 minutes, the movie just becomes your typical action, chase film. Throughout that final act of the movie, I was just thinking "C'mon, go back to the two of them talking!" And with that said, the action sequences aren't really impressive, as the directing is simply too frenetic.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3. While the movie does lose a good bit of its steam towards the end, I literally found myself on the edge of my seat throughout the first two thirds of it, not to mention that the acting is excellent all around. It's by no means a must-see, but I'd certainly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kept my attention and good action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in to this movie with less than high hopes. I just assumed the hype and big names were typical overblown Hollywood propaganda. From the very beginning as you see the "terrorists" entering the train, you're hooked. Low key at the beginning with the technical aspects of overtaking the train, and what transpires with the conductor and some of the passengers all leads to a crescendo that doesn't drop until the final rolling credits. I found it odd that audience members were laughing in some very disturbing parts; but maybe it was reaction to a sense of feeling uncomfortable with a different type role for Travolta. Denzel Washington I could watch all day; his character's introspective analysis of some questionable behavior from his past and being forced to discuss this with Ryder (Travolta) while his boss and NYPD are listening was captivating. Turturro also stood out in his role as hostage negotiator and his character provided a compassionate comrade for Garber. Don't want to give anything away, but when an audience member shouted out, "Duh!" it does make it apparent some the actions in dealing with the "terrorists" were a little lame. Nice twist on Ryder's past as well. Enjoyed and had me totally attentive for the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The remake establishes a more credible scenario, characteristics, and appeal of modern-day life in the City of NY!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indeed, I've enjoyed seeing this remake. I was able to catch the 1974 original again recently. Sure, I do appreciate the remake's presentation of a NY, its characters and dialogue that are more credible to contemporary times and culture, and yet, without losing the themes and plot of John Godey's novel. How three decades have not only changed the atmosphere of the City of New York, but also its demographic composition. Yep, a diversity of cultures and a city with lots of young people traveling on the subway and on the streets. Oh yes, I do welcome Tony Scott's more earnest reflections of this city ? not the dark, gritty, ugly, and the somewhat creepy "Gotham City", offered by Joseph Sargent. Yep, Sargent's NY is ugly with stereotypes, his characters are oft times quirky, and the dialogue reeks with racial slurs. The events and characters of the remake are far less predictable, subjecting the viewers to to take a hard look at the gray areas between the good guy and the villain. The story is no longer the same, old tale that defines good vs. evil as either black or white. We are given two principle characters that are as different as day and night, and yet these are two men have to deal with their unpleasant pasts. Two men with earrings, each wearing it on either his right or left ear! Two men with a desperate need to outwit each other, yet never failing in their attempts for soul searching. The passengers on the train, too, succeed in commanding our attention as they face their fate.Denzel Washington's Garber, not a cop, but a subway dispatcher and very much our regular Joe (unlike the very predictable, grouchy, caustic and cynical Garber cop portrayed by Walter Matthau), and. John Travolta's mastermind Ryder (projecting more intrigue and mystery than the downright brutal and evil Ryder of Robert Shaw) are fascinating to study. Yep, I wasn't merely petrified with what Ryder would do, but was completely taken by the two men's dialogue that slowly opens up their hidden past. Indeed, the two actors' performances are absolutely awesome! Director Scott certainly does understand contemporary human behaviors when terror strikes at the heart of this city! Yep, his remake offers a NY with contemporary realities... haste, speed, and fast-paced responses, actions, and chaos. Fascinating scenes of Manhattan and Brooklyn come alive, vibrantly busy, excitingly modern and full of energy. We observe a cosmopolitan NY with bridges and streets, jam-packed with traffic. Indeed, a tech-savvy city with savvy internet-based communication devices that speaks of our modern way of life! Scott also brings a darker side to all his characters, seen as unsettling as the danger that lurks. Scott is not shy of using the profanity and insanity, familiar to our times, to rock us to unease as frustrated characters lose their mental bearings and temperaments.Yep, most of the characters seem to have adrenaline-driven temperaments that seem to be spilling into madness. Oh yes, Scott's film brings all the thrills, chills, suspense, and loudness to sustain the viewers attention, creating a sense of non-stop urgency for them, from beginning to end. This film succeeds in making Sargent's original film's portrayal of sloppy attitudes, the OCD with cleanliness and mess, and bullying seem so far fetched, so out of trend, and so lame. Besides, there are plenty of neat and uncompromising surprises, new characters, and a cool twist, and a new ending to keep me entertained.My rating: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The solid leads cut through Tony Scott's bluster and flourishes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Tony Scott's remake of the 1974 classic is a four star reimagining lost amongst one star gimmicks and flourishes. An immensely impressive opening half begins to quiver towards the end and finally pops and deflates at the climax. In fact, Pelham runs almost in a reverse build-up to most films. It seems as if Scott didn't realize how intelligent and ultimately entertaining the early chapters were and in place of an intense and slow burning nail biter emerges and wildly excessive action flick.Scott is certainly no stranger to style as all his films pulsate with a manic energy, zoom shots, quick cuts assembled in an almost eccentric but to and often amusing end. Here thankfully, I found such freeze frame and camera swirls not to be distracting, just entirely unnecessary. The reported budget for this film was a mind melting $100 million and I literally cannot tell you what they spent it on. The cast is small, aside from the perfunctory action scenes most of the film is set in a stationary train in a dark tunnel or the rail control center. If there has ever been a benchmark for a 'not needed' budget, this would be a front runner. Of the aforementioned action scenes, the films most embarrassing sequence comes shortly after the hour mark and involves an absolutely ridiculous police chase that involves defiance of physics and of logic. That being said, it is ultimately the characters that take central stage and the movie succeeds fully because of the stellar cast.Replacing Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw are Denzel Washington and John Travolta respectively. Washington stars as Walter Garber a timid, but thoroughly likable and charismatic subway operator and Travolta as Ryder, the man on the other end of the line; a criminal who has hijacked Pelham 123 and is one part over-the-top, one part smooth talking' and one part brutal killer. Both these veteran actors pull off their rolls fantastically. Travolta is a far better rounded villain then he was in Swordfish or The Punisher, never playing the character one note, or as a messy collage of traits. Garber is an innerly flawed man, overweight, aging, with strains both on his professional and personal life and Washington makes him into a real sympathetic person about a man in the moment.As we have seen in many movies before, a bond forms between the two men, as Garber frantically tries to fulfill the demands of a $10,000,000 dollar ransom for the lives of his captives on a subway car. But unlike other similar flicks the kinship does not remain all smiles and sunshine, nor does a contrivance of their friendship lead to the villain's downfall. That coupled with an equally intelligent twist there is plenty to admire in Pelham but also enough to scoff at. Joining the duos ranks are two other solid rolls fulfilled by John Tutturo as a hostage negotiator and James Gandolfini as the New York City mayor. In fact, it is almost a four man show, with Travolta and Washington carrying the bulk weight of the film. While still a testament to how Hollywood continues to unearth the classics of the past, The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is also a testament to how a film that has fallen to its bluster can be saved by its leads.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com</fullReview>

Their talent was caged all throughout the movie by a dry and predictable story. Director Tony Scott bizarrely tries to inject life and action in to the film but those endeavors seem forced and even laughable. A cop caravan races across town to deliver bags of money and periodically we see cabs crashing, motorcycle cops flipping and car crashes for no real reason. It's like they declared this was a big budget movie and we need to see car crashes, damnit! I was actually snickering by the time of the final silly crash.

		<shortDescription>A predictable and preposterous thriller that relies on Travolta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when John Q and that once popular bad boy from Grease face off? Director Tony Scott (Man on Fire) brings you his update of the 1970's classic The Taking of Pelham 123. What starts off as a normal day for transit authority officer Walter Garber (Washington) is soon turned around when an escaped convict (Travolta, once again as the ultimate badass) takes a New York metro-train hostage. The convict only known as Ryder demands a ransom of 10 million delivered to him and his crew of criminals in an hour, or he'll start executing people every minute till New York's finest can pay the cash. Now it's up to Garber to put his life on the line and take action when no one else can. Scott's update boosts up a couple of decent action scenes but it's weighed down by its predictable and poorly executed plot. The cast including James Gandofini (The Sopranos) as a controversial mayor and John Tuttoro (Mr. Deeds) as a Hostage negotiator finely tuned their roles, but the rest of the cast including the once great Denzel (who sadly gives a wooden performance) didn't. What's disappointing is Denzel can do a great in movies (eg: The Hurricane) but lately he's been playing the same roles that it's getting old and lifeless. Travolta on the other hand takes the cake, and gives his best performance since Face/Off, but some of his lines were heterosexual and got distracting and embarrassing after a while. Scott had done movies that I quite enjoyed, but here I think he's just trying to become the next Michael Bay. The action sequences even looked like they were filmed by a Bay wannabe. Like, car crashes, a train running out of control? Come on, you can do better. Needless to say I also felt that the ending was preposterous and overdone that I guessed the ending minutes ahead of time. This update has what could have been the makings of a great movie, but there are too many coincidences, poor editing (which means jerky action sequences) and some very bad dialogue to recommend. There's nothing new here, but the movie really relies on the foul mouthed but badassed John Travolta to work. This remake just didn't translate well from the original and I expected a lot more from Tony Scott.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Travolta was the only thing worth watching in this movie. This movie was a waste of time and they should have considered giving the paying customers their money back for purchasing the ticket. Denzel Washington played the same damn character he plays every movie. Just completely stupid. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy. This is my first posting, and that's how bad I feel about this movie that I do not want anyone else to waste their time.Stupid cut scenes to the police cars going to the scene, they were crashing into each other to try and make it an action flick, but this was completely different. It had nothing to do with the movie, they just tried to make it seem exciting. It made it nothing but annoying.Do NOT see this movie if you can help it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It does have some pretty nasty finishing to its script but Tony Scott makes the most of this remake. It's full of his trademark bleach-n-blur photography, nodding in the direction of verité. The action is super too - there's a terrific 'car chase' which doesn't actually involve any chasing, just the natural hazard of New York.Indeed New York is the gargantuan, tacet player in this cast of characters. Clearly this is a post-9/11 film but it's played without any sort of direct implication or mawkish sentimentality. This is simply a devotional piece to the Big Apple, in the same vein as As Good As It Gets or 70-80s Woody Allen. I liked it for this reason.Alas, there are things I don't really like. The story's terribly thin - the end is shrieking for a startling plot twist - and the Manhattan overview pulls interest away from the minor and major characters with gravitational indiscretion. Nonetheless, Gandolfini is a well-pitched Mayor, labouring under the same suspicion of moral misdeed as Washington's everyman Garber. They both have better lines and make a better fist of their roles than Travolta's messy criminal mastermind, but, as always with Travolta, he's no less /appealing for it. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was a pretty good remake of the old one. The movie did not have much action in it. It had a lot of talking between Denzel Washington and John Travolta. The dialog was very funny at some points in the film, and also very intense in other parts of the film. I would have liked to see a little more action in it, but otherwise it was a good remake. John Travolta is the perfect person to play that part. He is definitely the reason I would encourage anyone to see this movie. Denzel Washington did a superb job playing his part. The movie kept me wondering what was going to happen, even though I have seen the old one. This is not a movie I would say you have to go to the theater to watch, but you should watch it on DVD.</fullReview>

Bumped it up in my rental cue to satisfy my curiosity and I was correct. It makes me wonder who's controlling "them/ Hollywood" today and how they are trying to control and manipulate us by passing off such dribble! There were really no heroes in the original and the original movie faded to black before its ending was dragged out and forced down your throat. It's a simple story from/ for a simpler time. A story that is now muddled with bribery, family obligation and wall street shenanigans. It's sad to see where we are now as a society and its sad to see where Hollywood is now with film-making. The casting in this remake blows as John Travolta seems much too kind of a human being to play a deranged bad guy. And if I see Denzel Washington in another angry black man and/ or hero saves the day/ world/ city/ classroom or country role then he will need to play yet another hero role in the movie made about me after I've gone completely ape? AUGH!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we go again. It must be summer, so here come the remakes. I really wanted to say something good about this one, but, alas, I really can't .Cast is competent but Washington seems to be sleepwalking in a role he obviously did for a paycheck. Travolta- a generally likable actor gives his worst performance since Stayin'Alive-or Swordfish as the baddie who masterminds a heist on a subway train to bring NY City to its knees. Worst of all there is no gallows humor that made the Matthau- Shaw version so much fun.The action scenes are predictable and seem to be lifted from every action flick ever made and the subway system functions only as a prop. No real suspense is ever generated and the predictability factor manifests itself from the beginning.What is even more amazing is that the City of New York allegedly co operated with the filmmakers. Does anybody remember 9-11-01? Matthau and Shaw would be spinning in their graves if they could see this. The viewer has an easier choice. Save your 9 bucks and a trip to the multiplex and rent the 1974 original. Don't get pushed under the train for this! It ain't worth your time-or money. Zero stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad film by its own rights, but as a remake it suffers by comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE TAKING OF PELHAM 123 is Tony Scott's flashy and expensive remake of a stone-cold classic of 1970s cinema. The original had Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw as hero and villain respectively, while this remake sees Scott regular Denzel Washington and bad-guy-for-hire John Travolta stepping into those lofty shoes. And, unsurprisingly enough, this turns out to be a redundant remake that can't hope to better - or, indeed, even come close - to the quality of the original.I'm not a hater of remakes per se. Occasionally certain films will be flawed or dated and the remake works better than the original; I found this with THE HILLS HAVE EYES. However, the original PELHAM is a great film and anyone who's seen it will end up just watching this version and criticising it by comparison. I'm sure if the original didn't exist I would have enjoyed the updated PELHAM a lot more, but as it stands it's a waste of time.It's not all bad. Washington is the slick master of professionalism as always and never disappoints this viewer. Travolta gives another fun villainous turn, following on from FACE/OFF and BROKEN ARROW. Scott certainly knows how to make a fast-paced movie and this is a thriller that's never dull. But compared to the original, it's vapid, shallow, and way too superficial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this movie for a very long time now and I must say that it was a bit disappointing. The story line is very predictable. One could tell from the beginning that Walter Garber will be the big great hero at the end of the movie. Ryder's character starts to develop in the beginning in the right direction and makes you curious about his reasons for doing what he was doing. It leaves the impression that maybe something personal and emotional, a wrong doing or an injustice has led him to respond in this wrong way. But, in the end the character development takes a complete disappointing turn. Ryder was doing all this because of money. So, overall the very end of the movie can be anticipated. Even the fact that Ryder's plan A will fail and a plan B is needed, is also what one would expect from movies like this. In terms of the message that the movie was trying to convey, I must say that all it got to me was that in the end the bad boys always lose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but no match for the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Author John Godey's premise gets reinvented for the technology-driven 21st century in this second screen adaptation of his work. Denzel Washington stars as Walter Garber, an NYC subway system dispatcher who just happens to field the call of the movies' villain. That man is "Ryder" (John Travolta), who holds the passengers of a subway car for ransom. $10,000,000.01 to be exact. But the catch is that the money must be delivered in exactly ONE HOUR. And Ryder is willing to kill hostages as punishment for not meeting his demands to the letter.Washington and the late director Tony Scott once again team up for undemanding, technically slick thrills. Part of the problem, though, is that the presentation is often TOO flashy, with a camera that sometimes refuses to stay still. For this viewer, that approach always seems to be saying that the filmmakers don't quite trust the material. Scott is able to generate some excitement, and tension, but the story doesn't have the same impact as it did in the 1974 version.In terms of the bad guys, Travolta really is the only one to leave an impression. The Brian Helgeland script gives Luis Guzman, as a participant in Ryders' scheme, precious little to do, and the other two guys who are in on it come across as one dimensional ciphers. Travolta is definitely good, and charismatic, in a fairly flamboyant portrayal, but it's Washingtons' efficient, low key performance as a working man caught up in an escalating situation that holds the movie together.An excellent supporting cast is on hand to provide their expertise: John Turturro as a crack hostage negotiator, James Gandolfini as the mayor, John Benjamin Hickey as the deputy mayor, Michael Rispoli as Garbers' boss, Gary Basaraba as a motorman, Aunjanue Ellis as Garbers' wife, etc.There's some cringe inducing dialogue along the way, but some decent moments as well. But this version of "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" really starts to derail once it insists on turning Garber into a typical action movie hero.Watchable but uninspired.Six out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 (2009): Dir: Tony Scott / Cast: John Travolta, Denzel Washington, Jon Turturro, James Gandolfini, Luis Guzman: The villain's anger is against New York so Pelham 1 2 3 is somewhat a metaphor of his conquest. John Travolta plays a subway hijacker who forces a dispatcher into negotiations. Starts out well until formula sets in including nonsense moments of recklessness to transport the cash. Directed by Tony Scott with blazing action and an effective climax. He previously directed Washington in Man on Fire as well as directing the underrated Domino. Travolta and Denzel Washington have a terrific battle of wills. We learn that Washington had accepting a bribe in the past and is under investigation but he claims that it was to pay for his daughter's tuition. Travolta demands that Washington remain contact and the two have an effective standoff on a bridge. Supporting roles are not as broad as they should be although they are well cast. Jon Turturro plays a hostage negotiator shunned by Travolta. James Gandolfini brings comic relief as the Mayor. Luis Guzman plays one of the hijackers under Travolta's ruling. The action is blazing with several sequences that deliver tension, however this is just an average pop corn movie. Not heavy on theme but action fans will enjoy this subway venture of destruction.

		<shortDescription>Miss this train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cards on the table, I loved the original 1974 movie on which this latter-day remake was based. It was exciting, clever and funny. I don't know what it is with modern-day remakes of classic 60's and 70's films but it seems to me that directors throw almost all the good stuff out and bring in instead eye-hurting jerky-flashy camera-work, an ear-poundingly loud soundtrack which is constantly in the background and even-louder talking characters who swear and commit random acts of mindless violence whenever it suits them.So the Pelham 123 subway train in New York gets hijacked by disgruntled psychopathic Wall Street trader John Travolta as part of a devious plot to make a killing on the stock- exchange and revenge himself on the city for turfing him out of his high-paid job years before. That's your plot folks, with Denzel Washington as the demoted subway controller now running point in a desk job pending an investigation for corruption, who finds himself on duty just as Travolta and his bunch of merry men put their plan into action. For some strange reason madman Travolta hits it off with decent man Washington, ignoring professional cop negotiator John Torturro, as he executes his nefarious plan. There's the expected number of bloody killings along the way, completely irrelevant car- chases around New York where cars don't just crash, they rise vertically in the air and roll over a dozen times on collision (the police have no less than three separate accidents trying to race the ransom money across town to meet Travolta's deadline) and of course, an out of control train tearing over New York with a car-load of innocent passengers who probably wish they'd taken the bus instead.It's all unbelievable nonsense as you'd expect. I'm fast tiring of Washingston's ever- narrowing repertoire of decent-but-flawed leading men, Travolta is just awful as the loudmouth gang-leader and Torturro irrelevant as the negotiator. Only James Gandolfini shines as the city mayor who divines Travolta's real plan, wouldn't you know it, before the cops do.The direction is eye-hurtingly bad, the dialogue excruciating, especially the scenes between Washington and Travolta and Washington and his wife. There's no humour present at all, although there are some unintentional laughs, like when a rat runs up the trouser leg of a police sniper just as he's taking aim at Travolta, causing him to miss.I've decided I really have to stop watching high-octane low-intelligence nonsense like this in future. Better yet, I wish Hollywood would stop making or remaking movies like this altogether.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood's Prejudices on Parade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to clear the air: I read the novel before seeing the 1974 version, and found it unfocused and therefore uninteresting. As for the 1974 movie, it was okay but not a flick I ever warmed to. I'm all for remakes from novels, especially when the first versions were dogs.So I came into this "The Taking of Pelham 123" without any prejudices against it.Touted as a post-9/11 version of the story, I was interested in seeing the changes made to the story. It was nicely updated, as it had to be. But I had no sense of characters, only types. In the novel, in the first movie, as poor as they were, they at least had passengers stand out as people, and therefore one could feel for their situations. Not here. And the first movie had actors like Martin Balsam and Robert Shaw, capable of investing their slight roles with characterizations that stood out even in their disguises.The strangest change is in the main characters. Rather than mere cops-and-robbers fare (as in the book and the 1974 movie, where Walter Matthau was the cop tracking down the bad guys who are willing to kill innocents for money, the "good guy" (Denzel Washington) is some sort of dispatcher (not being a New Yorker and never having ridden on a subway, I don't know the proper terminology). And the script, and the characters, keep blurring the lines between the "good guy" and the "bad guy." But whereas Robert Shaw in the original movie (I don't remember what he was in the book) was a mercenary soldier who teamed with a disgruntled and unfairly fired transit. And here is where it gets interesting. The movie makers raised the point of 9/11. On 9/11 New York and Washington were bombed by extremist Islamic terrorists, killing innocents in two cities who had done no worse crime than going to work in the morning. In this version of "Pelham" the lead baddie, who takes over the train and threatens to kill, is a Catholic, who likes to debate a perverted version of Original Sin. He's so philosophic you'd think he'd have boned up on it and got it right (I wonder how Travolta would have liked it if the lead terrorist had been a Scientologist debating a twisted notion of what L. Ron Hubbard said).Not only is the bad guy Catholic, he's also no longer a soldier of fortune teamed up with a disgruntled former worker. The worker unfairly fired by the government is no longer an important part of the story. The leader is a former Wall Street investing bigwig who did time and who is cleverly manipulating the stock market.While protesting that the update is a post 9/11 take on the story Hollywood has managed to plug in their bigotries (Christians, Wall Street types, etc.). Though no expert on the matter, I'm not even sure a devout Christian would be a Wall Street type at all, much less a dishonest one. The whole thing makes sense only in Hollywood.Or in New York, apparently. Living out in the wholesome, fresh-aired, clean countryside I don't enjoy "gritty city" movies. It's hardly an advertisement for New York and it only makes anyone dwelling on the other side of the George Washington Bridge wonder why folks want to live in such a hellhole.</fullReview>

Really bad music selection.Secondly, there were parts on the film that the camera would - i don't know how to say it - "lagged", moving slowly, shaking and ruined the whole part. Its like watching a horror movie and at the point where the door slowly opens, the camera man shakes the camera for like 5 seconds and you miss everything.Travolta and Washington were really great in that movie and I believe that if the team behind the scenes was better, it could have hit an 7.5-8 overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel Washington has to deal with subway-hijacker, John Travolta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This second version of "The Taking of Pelham 123" doesn't have as good a story as the first. The plot is simpler and less developed with fewer plot points or twists. On the other hand, it develops the Denzel Washington character in greater depth while not developing the secondary hijackers as well. The two leads, Washington and Travolta, are solid in their roles. Travolta really shades his character nicely through a range of emotions.The direction and film-editing are hyper-kinetic. I can see the virtue of certain editing techniques in advancing story by quick cuts that show a character's reaction in a different location. When almost every scene is subjected to dizzying camera motion, the effect is eventually to numb the viewer. At some point, be it 60 minutes, 70 minutes, 80 minutes, or whatever, it becomes too much. The rush to get the money to the hijackers on time becomes too overdone. The subway climaxes are not handled as well as in the first version. The effect of all the motion is to cut off emotional reaction and actually make the movie slower and less involving, ironically. Human beings need a bit of time to understand logic of action and to sense the emotional narrative. We do feel this at times for Washington's character, which is a plus. His conflict over bribery is handled well. His wife's reaction is very good, especially the line about bringing home a gallon of milk. Good writing there.It's a worthwhile remake and has some strong points. I really like the two leads. The writing for Travolta's part was very good. Luis Guzman was wasted. The plot was what seemed lacking, and too much hyper-activity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009 Remake) A review by sjwaltonThe makers of the original decided a stone pillar cast, original camera work and general creativity would get this flimsy story into theatres, and it did. I can still recall Walter Mathau, Robert Shaw and Martin Balsam's sweaty performances. All completely convincing, and exciting. This thing borrows all the tricks from the original, except of course split-screen shots, adds some contemporary stuff, hires three major stars, runs itself out of money, momentum and script ideas as fast as you can say New York subway, and fully earns my sixteenth of a star. Turturro, Washington and Travolta are capable of producing enough magic to energize anything, their acting was restrained, resentful and sulky as if they'd been recently scolded. Updating the audience frequently with satellite position images is not necessary, unless there is concern that we may forget, or not care, about the urgency of the situation. More casualties were sustained during the wildly elaborate traffic accidents in the streets above than were possible in the subway car below, making the whole thing seem pointless. The absence of any emotional reaction whatsoever from the innocents aboard Pelham 123 witnessing randomly selected hostages machine-gunned at point blank range was strange, a problem, perhaps a contractual dispute with the extras? A lapse of direction? Silly, goofy stuff, fun to pee on. Sjw</fullReview>

We have seen this premise many times. But scott's making gave new dimension. Visually stunning and so are the performances by lead and supporting cast. Another drawback apart from old story is, characters of washington and travolta especially travolta. He is the antagonist but not at all cruel or cruel enough for this premise. As far as the plot is concerned, the movie lost its grip in the middle when we learn that Travolta is not at all dangerous even though he did kill passenger. The character of washington is also not well developed and hence the climax doesn't seem obvious. Still, this is a better watch due to above mentioned positive reasons</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the Taking of Pelham 123 remake was an OK thriller. The face- off between the down-on-his-luck executive, Denzel Washington, and the crazed lunatic Travolta, was riveting. I think the only other actor who could have played the lunatic as well would be maybe Colin Farrell, or Jack Nicholson in his prime...but I digress.There are some mysteries that keep you guessing till the end. Did Denzel really take a bribe? Why did Travolta even do this in the first place? What's up with his stock market thing? Some questions get answered, others do not. Those mysteries made this an OK thriller.Otherwise, your standard death, mayhem, and craziness, in other words, another average day in NYC (I can say that since I grew up there :)) Seriously, if you are looking for a deep, provoking, thought-filled thriller, see LA Confidential or The Usual Suspects for example. But with TOP123, you will get standard action, hence my pedestrian B grade movie rating of 6. Denzel-Travolta ignite to a slow burn an otherwise lackadaisical film that in the end falls short of blowing you away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not all remakes are terrible, some like the late Tony Scott's 'The Taking of Pelham 123' are perfectly serviceable action thrillers. Granted, it doesn't have the weight of expectation that accompanies big budget remakes like Robocop or Dawn Of The Dead, but it never strives to be more than a straightforward, ninety minute beer and pizza movie. And it succeeds, helped in no small part by a truly unhinged performance from John Travolta.Set in the surprisingly macho world of the New York City subway system, the titular Pelham 123 is a train that Travolta's foul-mouthed criminal hijacks. Soon, he's on the radio to Denzel Washington's headquarters controller and the two become involved in a battle of wits to keep the hostages alive and resolve a tense situation before the body count increases too far. With a tattooed neck, an itchy trigger finger and a rabid temper, Travolta is undoubtedly the star of the show while the increasingly frustrated Washington makes for a reliable foil. With these two stars butting heads, the rest of the cast - including John Turturro's Police Chief and James Gandolfini's Mayor - are inevitably relegated to the sidelines. There's also a distinct lack of female characters and one of those is reduced to little more than an exposed cleavage on a webcam.Combine that with the near constant bad language, bullet riddled corpses and taxi smashing car chases and there can be no doubt that this is a man's film. For manly men who tell it like it is, wear bandannas and like steak, UFC and Hatebreed, but while that may instantly alienate a significant number of movie-goers, if that's what you want then it succeeds nicely. It's an hour and a half of angry men shouting about prisons, money and taking ass models to Iceland, with a healthy dose of violence to round it all off. And Travolta is so deliriously over the top you can't take your eyes off him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>$100million budget, poorly acted action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The supporting roles in this movie are horrible, starting with the black lady who is the subway driver that gets orders from JT after her co- worker subway driver gets two slugs buried in his chest by the hostage taker JT. She is covered in his blood and she does not even tremble in fear, or show any emotion at all after when taking orders from JT to tell the passengers to clear out of the train. Where do they get these actors? Wheenever you have a bad acting job by anyone of the lesser actors in a movie, it ruins the whole movie. JT was good in the villain role, I watched the whole movie through just for that. Some parts were a bit over the top, but it's a brain-numbed action movie so what do you expect. DW was the same as always in all his movies, where he plays the hard-done -by good guy/turned hero (see DW in John Q for the replica role just off the top of my head). Any way, what ruins the movie is the acting of the supporting cast, they are just bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In New York, four criminals led by 'Ryder' (John Trevolta) hijack the subway train Pelham 123, stopping the first car with 19 hostages in a tunnel in Manhattan. In the subway control centre the operator is Walter Garber (Denzel Washington). Ryder tells him he wants $10M within one hour to be delivered to the City Hall or the hostages die, one per minute.The Mayor (James Gandolfini) agrees to pay the ransom while the professional negotiator Camonnetti (John Turturro) continues the negotiation. However, Ryder demands that Garber continues to be his contact person.I have not seen the original 1974 film so cannot compare versions, which is probably a good thing. If you have, my advice is not to compare, just enjoy. This is a great script from Brian Helgeland, and great performances from Travolta and Washington. Tony Scott's direction is a little busy but not overly so. He clearly understands how to build tension. This is a high quality tense thriller.What makes it special is the unfolding relationship between the two main characters. Ryder is the smart psycho mastermind (surprisingly not played with a British accent ? well done) and Garber is the honest family man with a question mark over his character and in danger of losing his job. Meanwhile Camonnetti is the professional whose professional training is turning out to be pretty useless in the actual event. And the police seem incapable of driving through New York with the money without having a series of spectacular accidents.So how will this end? Interesting day, huh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just any typical Denzel action thriller except I was confused with the bad guy's greater motives. I kept thinking that there had to be ulterior motives than the obvious ransom. It wasn't about $10 million. Or was it? They added some element where the bad guy kept checking the stock market and was happy to see gold jump in worth. Why? Was he hoping to keep it? Wouldn't his identity being found out cause his investment/money to be seized? Why did he have such a death wish? Why work so hard to make a ransom work only to be glad that he dies in the end? It makes ZERO sense.I kept thinking that he was wanting to die deliberately and had some life insurance policy or something that was backed by the price of gold or something - and had children who would receive a death benefit or something - but none of this was even mentioned. It just made no sense for him to care about making a ton of money if he was actually inviting himself to be killed. I suppose that there is a limitation of what sort of potential can come of this, given the base material to base off of (a novel).... But perhaps the novel simply does not follow a conventional story arc, either. It feels like there are simply things brought up that hint at greater ideas that the screenwriters just dropped out of nowhere.If you can ignore that, then it's a decent hour and a half to watch. A bit cliché at moments, but generally I still think there was simply not enough character development with the main bad guy. He was very erratic and some clues as to his source of bitterness were given, but either the story has a huge hole (why he cared about investing in gold) or the final resolution of his capture/death came totally out of the blue and doesn't fit within a conventional story arc. Bummer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the original in so many ways for so many reasons for which I will not review here. I had no intentions of ever bothering to watch the remake. I did of course out of mild curiosity and the other reason was that I was a guest at a friend's place and that was the movie of choice. I try to go into things with an open mind, open heart not withstanding. I tried very hard not to be biased but it didn't take long into the movie that my prejudiced had reached a boiling point. This movie was awful! Standing totally alone and without the benefit of the original, it was a very bad movie, for those who had never seen the original, even they would have said the movie was awful and that's the awful truth.John Travolta and Denzel Washington should have both been taking onto the subway tracks of IRT 123 line and forced to electrocute themselves as late great Robert Shaw's character did in the original film. I was spitting mad which actually became pure delight for my friends. Who found my tirade more entertaining than the movie. Which isn't saying much.Lastly, I love films, from time to time I consider myself a filmmaker having worked in and out of the industry as I still do. I can easily list some of my favorite films as proof I know a thing or two about good films. Catch-22, The Gradute Mike Nicholas, The Ninth Configuration William Blatty Jr, almost all Kubric's work as well as Woody Allen, Alien, Blade Runner Ridley Scott who should join Travolta and Washington on the tracks for that god awful "Prometheus" Rififi Jules Dassin, Delicatessen Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet. There are countless more, I study ever subtle nuance of a film like some sort of mutant beast. I tried not to do that with this film but I couldn't control my inner rage and savage attack on this movie.David Shire Score for the original alone was better than the entire remake of this version of The Taking Of Pelham 123...Enough already!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining enough. Scott throws out all of the tension from the original in favor of his loud and obnoxious editing. Washington is having a bad work day, he should stay away from trains, as a gang of terrorists take control of a subway train. It's nice to see Travolta as the villain again, but Shaw had a gentlemanly persuasion to his performance. Washington plays it bloated, as he should, but the script calls for dramatic action in the end. Unfortunate, considering the originals wonderfully comic final scene. If you are a fan of Scott's recent output, then you'll certainly find lots to enjoy here. Washington and Travolta are strong and having fun, which does allow us to also enjoy there performances.

		<fullReview>Armed men hijack a New York City subway train, holding the passengers hostage in return for a ransom, and turning an ordinary day's work for dispatcher Walter Garber into a face-off with the mastermind behind the crime.Walked in, no expectations except for my entertainment. But what I got in return is, in fact, a good movie! I read the novel quite a few months back before I even heard of the movie. The book was amazing but as we all know, movie adaptations of books will turn out much worse than the book. But in this film, sit back and enjoy because it actually surpasses the book! With the leading stars being that of Denzel Washington and John Travolta, you may have some mixed expectations. With Denzel Washington being the hero, this wouldn't be a surprise. But with John Travolta as the enemy, you most definitely would want to see the outcome. With fast paced action, loads on intensity, and times where you will be at the edge of your seat, I was completely satisfied. Of course, I'm not leading this out to be the best movie ever. In fact, there was a lot of flaws and times where I lost that feeling. But after thinking about the redeeming qualities, I've came to the honest conclusion that The Talking of Pelham 1 2 3 is, in fact, a pretty good movie. So walk in expecting a good movie, because that is surely what it is. But do not walk in expecting the greatest movie of all time, of course. The Talking of Pelham 1 2 3... 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a good movie. I read a bunch of the other reviews on here, and found out that apparently, not many people think like me. Now, I didn't see the original movie, so maybe that's why I liked this one. Maybe if I had seen the first one before this one, I wouldn't have cared for it as much. Still, it was fun, and I enjoyed watching it the whole time. A lot of people complain that, for example, the scene where a bunch of cars and motorcycles are driving through the streets of Manhattan, is an unnecessary scene. Now, that's probably true. It was kinda weird that they crashed as much as they did, but I don't see the big deal. I, for one, wanted action, and that's what I got from that scene. I didn't really care that they could have done something to improve the storyline there instead of just having a bunch of motorized vehicles fly through the streets, but what movie doesn't have a little unnecessary action in it, huh? Anyway, yes, it wasn't perfect in every way, but I still loved it. Both Denzel and Travolta were great, and the movie was really thrilling, according to me. I'd definitely recommend this movie to everyone who likes a little action, and a better than average storyline.</fullReview>

I don't even know what the producers, screen writes (who did a horrible job at this actually), or director was thinking when they decided to re-make this 1974 original which is in reality based on a book of the same name. I was always suspicious of re-makes, they almost always are worse than the original and this movie haven't changed my mind it just proved me right ! Denzil Washington is ( I don't even know what's his job cuz he ain't a cop, let's just say a white collar worker in the Train station shall we ?) he was doing his duty when suddenly the Pelham 1 2 3 train is hijacked by a group of criminals/bad guys whatever who of course are working for their heartless and evil jerk of a villain who in this case would be John Travolta. At first when I was watching this movie, I was thinking that Why would anyone want to hijack a train and in such a cheesy way is beyond me ! But sooner we discover that the Kidnappers have a demand "Either pay us Money or we'll kill the train passengers who are Hostages" oh, and of course the money has to be in within a ridiculous period of time or all these innocent people will lose their lives. And then.... Haven't You Guessed the ending yet ? This movie was boring, dull and cliché in every way possible ! The dead guy gets killed eventually and only our Hero, the studious white collar job "Denzel Washington" can stop him, not the cops, not the Mayor cuz he's the anti hero not anyone just the good guy who's so good in a matter of fact he can't even hurt a fly. Bad Bad Bad ! Leave it to Hollywood to make such a cheesy movie ! This re-make has no excuse but to give big pay-checks to the actors ! Who didn't convince me once in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 is a good paced action thriller. It is based on a novel about a hostage situation in the NYC Metro, with dispatcher Garber getting caught in the middle of it. The hostage taker Ryder is a intelligent but ruthless that has a detailed plan for the coming events. The suspense is thick which makes the Taking of Pelham a very entertaining thriller.But what gives the movie an extra edge is that both Ryder and more surprisingly Garber has a shady past, and a tentative and tense, but an interesting relationship between them evolve. Garber and Ryder is played by Denzel Washington and John Travolta respectively. Both of whom is no newcomer to the genre and rely on their experience to give their characters both depth and weight. That piece of casting is a very good one, and the Taking of Pelham would not have been near as good without them.7/10</fullReview>

Many scenarios or sub plots go no where, nor do they serve any purpose. Action scenes seem to be there only to add drama, but do not assist in the storyline or plot.By the end of the movie, you do not connect or feel a bias towards any of the characters and realize they all just had a pointless day.Dialog was just ridiculous and many characters offered nothing to move the story.For as much money was spent on this and for what it offered, well it's just another Hollywood Blockbuster letdown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and a lot of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure if it's in my best interest to watch remakes of films I've never seen, but I did it anyways. The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is a remake of the 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One Two Three starring Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. Why they changed One Two Three to 1 2 3 eludes me but oh well. I don't know how closely this remake follows the original but I do know that it gives the story a much more up to date twist, throwing in technology and other modernized factors into the mix. The film is about a gang of armed who hijack a subway train and demand money for the hostages they take on the train. Walter Garber, a train dispatcher, has one of the unluckiest encounters with fate he'll ever have and ends up being the one who has to communicate with the armed robbers, namely their boss Ryder, played by John Travolta. The exchanges between these two are thrilling, as is the whole movie which is a race against time to save the hostages this deranged sociopath holds for ransom on Pelham 123.The film is directed by Tony Scott. I like Scott's work and can usually take something good out of any of his films. He'll never make a film better than True Romance (1993) but The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 serves as an exciting addition to his body of work. The man undeniably knows how to shoot an action film and he does a great job here. The movie is tightly edited and the cinematography puts a very exciting action edge on the film. It's nothing we haven't seen before, but it works to a great effect here.The action never overtakes the story though, and that is something that is rare and great. The storyline in this film is fantastic and thrilling. Every moment keeps you engaged and there is very little that will take you out of this film. Denzel Washington and John Travolta play their characters extremely well, and they play characters that work on multiple levels. Travolta's Ryder is surprisingly threatening. He's a disillusioned and controlling sociopath that loses it if he doesn't maintain complete and utter control over the situation. Washington's Garber is the everyman who just came into work like it was any other day having no idea what would be on the other end of the line going to Pelham 123. Everything that happens between these two is great and everything else is still a lot of fun.Now, I do have to slap the wrists of the writer, Brian Helgeland, for not holding up as well as everyone else. The dialouge in this film is actually very good and it provides a lot of the great tension that upholds well through the film. Unfortunately there are some moments of the film that are facepalm worthy. There are some pretty bad plot holes that don't really annoy so much as distract just for a moment. The plot holes don't really detract from the overall story, thus I found them excusable. I would rather have not had them in there at all, but they're really only things that bother you in retrospect of the film. Helgeland even tries to write himself out of a few, like when the New York government has to transport the ransom money from the federal reserve because Ryder wants it in cash, they transport it by car. I asked myself, 'why don't they take a helicopter?' A few moments later James Gandolfini exclaims, "Why didn't they use the helicopter?" But these little issues were not enough for me to hate, or even dislike, this film.The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 doesn't offer anything extremely new, but it is an intensely exciting film that I don't regret watching at all. There are a lot of great things about it, and only a few bad things that are minuscule in comparison to the rest of the film. This film kept me compelled and entertained for its entire duration, and I have to commend it for that. It's a lot of fun and well worth the watch, plus it has a gripping ending that is unforgettable. It left me very pleased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen the original 1974 title or read the book both movies are based upon before I saw this movie, so it was a whole new experience for me. This movie kept me gripped throughout the entire time. Denzel Washington plays a excellent role as Walter Garber, a temporarily demoted supervisor while John Travolta played brilliantly as the ruthless yet smart minded Ryder, if you can withstand his excessive use of the words "mother f**ker"The movie follows Travolta's character as he and his team attempt to hijack a subway train, holding the passengers for a 10million dollar ransom. Communicating only with the downed Washington who still can't comprehend how they plan to get away with the money.For the most part Tony Scott's direction was amazing, a mix of fast action, suspense and beautiful cuts in sequence to quick paced music. However, there are times in which the camera work becomes rather dodgy.. Scott uses the effect of slow motion and slight motion blur in some scenes which I felt unnecessary and rather annoying. Also, toward the end of the movie, as the action is heightened, the camera work becomes shaky and disorienting in part, yet nothing I couldn't handle.Brian Helgeland's screenplay was well written, introducing the odd funny one liners from Ryder (Travolta) which only added to his psychotic appeal. Also the bumbling appearance written for the James Gandolfini as the mayor of New York.Overall, this movie is a action packed thrill ride, combined with underlying humour and the occasional unnecessary use of profanities and stunts. However, it's well worth a watch.</fullReview>

The ultimatum is ideal: Kill hostages unless money is delivered. But, this isn't so much a villain as a merely angry guy going through a crisis. And worst of all, there's no suspense. Nobody is really at stake, because the Travolta doesn't do anything stupid other than make threats (unless you count the guy who urinates out of the train door). And the movie ends with a pointless chase sequence.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

Having not watched the original i thought, why not. With both Washington and travolta starring it may perhaps be a good pop corn thriller.In some aspects it is. The first half an hour sets up things nicely. Your thrown into the story from the get go. No farty love scenes, no hugging wife and sentimental bull crap. Straight into Travolta hijacking a subway train. As much as i love Travolta, i couldn't bare to watch him almost in this. After each one of his rages, he had to come out with the Mother F'er word. I nearly choked on my M&amp;M. it didn't come off hard enough. He was weak as the main antagonist.Washington, as always, gives a reasonable performance. Like Travolta's character, you never get to understand him. But with the script he had to work with, he did a good job.From the middle up to the end, it was poor. The rubbish between laptop boy and his girl. The cops crashing not once, not twice, but three times was ridiculous and the milk conversation,didn't need it. The worst thing of all was, how did the terrorists expect to escape. They get the dosh and walk out onto the streets of New York. Smart move.For what it is, it decent and at times entertaining.

Since I was watching this on the computer and chatting with a friend on my other monitor about movies, I hadn't turned it off yet. Had I not been doing that, I would have stopped the movie and sent it back and missed the good parts.A character driven film should NOT take that long to create a connection between the viewer and the protagonist and antagonist. The action sequences, as they try to get the money to the train on time, don't seem to fit into the film very well.Once I got interested in the film, I kept hoping it would get really good, it always seemed to be on the verge of doing so, but never reached that point.

		<fullReview>I LOVED the old Walter Matthau film from 1974 -- one of my all time favorites. Wit, tension, drama -- everything this movie lacks.First off is the directing. Why can't directors trust their actors any more? What happened to the long take? This was edited with many quick cuts -- as if the director and editor thinks everyone in the audience suffers from ADD.Travolta is over the top -- not menacing or calculating like Robert Shaw in the original, just yelling and running around like a jerk. Denzel is in the Matthau role, and he's OK, but Matthau was a transit cop while Denzel is a train dispatcher. Two very different jobs -- so why does Travolta want to talk to Denzel? I didn't quite understand the plot point where, by hijacking a subway car, Travolta will increase his fortune. Stocks go down during hostage crises, but the price of gold goes up? I didn't see the connection.This movie isn't a total waste of time, only about half of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surrender to the Post-Domino Recovery of Tony Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A possible testament to the notion that Tony Scott relies too heavily on shock and gimmick may lie in the fact that in his star-filled remake of The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, when characters are on the screen taking care of the hostage crisis, the movie is absolutely gripping in that fast-paced, bantering, exciting Hollywood action way, and when they're not, we get some of the dumbest and most artificially inflated scenes I've seen from that very action cycle. The special effects are much more unnervingly vivacious and meaningless than ever, which is neither an intriguing enhancement or a good ole throwback. When a squad car has a high-speed crash, the consequences are generally coherent with the principles of gravity and the nature of matter and motion, nothing like in this film. It does not disperse and gyrate headlong aloft.And unfortunately, the dialogue scenes are intended more as bridges between or above these meaningless demolitions and chases, because sure, John Travolta is loud and brash and Denzel Washington is firm and decisive, except you don't feel inner life in the performances. For days beyond recall, vehicular hostage-situation thrillers---Speed, Executive Decision, Die Hard 2, Air Force One---have relied upon interesting and clearly recalled supporting commuters: sensationalist reporters leaking the big story to the press, attendants working surreptitiously in cahoots with the rescue team in finding the detonator, a pregnant woman about to go into labor, a wounded child, and the like, all affecting the story on behalf of increasing suspense and tension. This time, the Pelham line's rail users are akin to props. The flashy, attention span-less movie inhabits a watered-down action-movie backcloth, with no time for regional character, and a transit system headquarters that humbles Mission Control.I think I'll echo Ebert that there's not a great deal amiss in Tony Scott's Taking of Pelham, apart from that there's not a great deal especially good about it. Scott used to be a director who could promise a wild fiery roller coaster of a movie, good or bad. This is the guy who made True Romance and The Last Boy Scout. But I'm sure that the commercial and critical failure of Domino scared him into going to the very opposite extreme to which he went with that extraordinarily over-the-top film, not wanting to color outside the lines in any way, playing it as safe as possible. The film he made before Pelham and the first he made after Domino, Déj? Vu, was his first PG-13 effort ever. And like that film, we find in Pelham a shocking turn for Scott, who used to be so endlessly edgy: the use of hackneyed worried-wife tropes, corny comic relief and other stale two-dimensional characterizations that are little to nowhere to be found in his pre-Domino oeuvre. True Romance is the diametric opposite of this tendency, for instance.I keep wanting to make my next paragraph about how the other side of the coin is that what Scott hasn't sacrificed is his ability to keep an action thriller moving so rapidly that we couldn't turn it off if we tried, and how at least Travolta's forcibly over-the-top villain is legitimately interesting owing to his significant hang-up when it comes to his brutal enforcement of honesty, but I just keep coming back to those friggin' cop cars chasing the train. Look at what Friedkin did in The French Connection; there's the blueprint for the chases we've become so accustomed to that they've become the retarded mess we see in films like this. Everyone knows that the NYPD, probably more than any other American police department, knows how to get from A to B in a hostage situation. Has Scott sunk this low to appeal to the billionaires upstairs? I am certain that before Domino, he could've made such a better Taking of Pelham 1 2 3. And at least he's crafted a nominally gratifying, ultimately absorbing one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Modern Thriller With Two Big Star Names</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I have not seen the original "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" from 1974 so I didn't know what to expect. From family and old timers I was told the original was quite good, so I expected the usual rehash of an original film told in a modern big budget way. Now when I first head of this remake, I read immediately that two big names would be starring in it; Denzel Washington and John Travolta.I hadn't watched a recent or modern film with Travolta in some time, so I wondered how he would be in this film. The pair work well together, as the entwined characters who are for the part of the film stuck together. As the film progresses we are given a developing relationship between the pair, its not the most original of relationships and certainly not one of the best of its kind but its solid which makes it watchable.The action was well paced, so were some of the more drama-based scenes that of course Travolta and Washington do so well. This remake isn't something that is gonna be remembered through film history, but it makes a fun Saturday night in treat. You have the subtle action, drama and characters to get into. The cast also makes it an enjoyable treat, with some strong performances from James Gandolfini and John Turturro. I enjoyed it, and it makes a good film to simply watch and enjoy with a modern style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie almost had it all till they made an inadvertent mockery of John Travolta's presence. Disappointing to see him given a weak, negative role, considering his star status &amp; the many author-backed roles he has essayed in Hollywood. Well, I see that as the only flip side of the movie. The good side? Travolta still does a menacing, baddie act. Denzel Washington shines too. A noteworthy scene is the fleet of police cars &amp; bikes rushing through mid-day traffic to get the millions of cash to Travolta. That was wonderfully shot. This move has engaging action &amp; intense performances. But the story still could have been made stronger, at least for Travolta's character. Verdict: Good viewing, but try not to feel bad for Johnny dear...</fullReview>

Unfortunately, He has strayed from his earlier triumphs; such as, "Crimson Tide"; "Enemy of The State" &amp; "Spy Game". For me, Tony's films easily surpass Michael Bay's work which is monumental at the least.ToP 123 is purely held together by Denzel &amp; John's Performances. Tony, S's Trademark Filmography are always an Action Delight!!! However, he seems to be stuck in a "Recycling Mode". Don't get me wrong! Tony excels in this Genre, but he seems to have lost some of his innovative ability. I look forward to he &amp; Ridley back together. Their collaboration on a $150-$300 million film would undoubtedly be AMAZING!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Connor Macgregor Reviews...The Taking Of Pelham 123 Travolta Vs Washington...At first i didn't fancy seeing this film because it would be the same old action film where one film star is a hero and the other is a villain so i put it off.But seeing that it was a Friday and I didn't have anything else to do i decided to see it.And boy was i wrong about this film.The story is Denzil Washington playing a MTA Dispatcher who is ongoing investigation on taking a bribe.He then is thrown in a scenario when a bunch of Crooks take control of a subway train and ask for 10 million dollars for the lives of the passengers.It then turns into one thrilling ride of chasing,shooting and suspense which leaves Denzil Washington and John Travolta fighting for their lives.My thoughts on the film were as follows.I haven't seen the original Taking Of Pelham 123 and I don't plan to.After walking out of the cinema i was satisfied with the end result.It wasn't that noisy as I thought it would be,but still loud.They do take it too far with the stunts a bit but it is pretty hardcore with what they do.Acting is also pretty decent to watch as well.Directing was a bit dodgy in it.There was a lot of circles in the film where it feels like Denzil Washington is going round in circles.Tony Scott is a decent director and i think he did a pretty OK job with this film but there were some flaws with it.It was a bit shaky as predicted because a lot of directors like to use shaky shots these days.However Overall Tony Scott did do a good job directing this film.Writing and story was OK but i felt that they could have improved a lot.You had a character that could have been developed way into the film,but really they cast him to the side.I am talking about the guy with the computer with the sexy girlfriend on it.As well as that the girlfriend could have also had more screen time.So that was disappointing.It was also focused on Denzil &amp; John,they didn't go into the other characters and tell a bit about their stories.Star Of The Film has to go to John Travolta.I felt his performance was dead serious but i wish he would stop saying swear words because he kept saying that word ON AND ON AND ON AND ON..Denzil is also good in this and the guy from The Sopranos and the guy from Transformers(who plays the same role he played in Transformers although it is less comedic).In conclusion its a good film so go see it if you like good action.Grade 66% - B - A Good Film. - *** Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Travolta and Denzel Washington fill the screen very well (especially Mr. too many pork chops lately Travolta). The problem with this film is the events are so damned outrageous that one sits back in awe of how stupid it can be. I have never seen a more incompetent network of negotiators and police. They knew where the train was, they had a SWAT team. When they start just blowing away hostages, it's time to move. These guys have nor moral sense or approachability and because of this you take them out. The charm of the bad guy works at first, but he is really a monomaniac so there is no way he's going to talk in a sensible way. The runaway train thing is passe (although I see Denzel is about to get on board again). Then, of course, there's the absolutely awful ending (I won't say a word and spoil it for anyone). How could such a finely honed plan have such a miserable endgame. Oh well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every Minute Counts!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in New York City, MTA employee Walter Garber's (Denzel Washington) day started as a typical day in the Rail Control Center. The day to day routines were drastically changed the train Pelham 123 was hijacked by group of gunman, led by Ryder (John Travolta). The gunmen take the train and its passengers hostage and demand a ransom of 10 million dollars to be paid within one hour. Every minute past the one hour deadline will result a hostage being killed.The theme of the movie is about the redemption of Garber, who holds an executive position with the MTA, and is working in the Rail Control Center while under investigation for receiving a bribe on a contract for purchasing new trains. Walter is being accused of and in jeopardy of losing his job because of allegedly taking a bribe of thirty-five thousand dollars for awarding a contact to a Japanese train manufacturer over a Canadian train manufacturer. Walter tells Ryder that he had already decided to award the contact to the Japanese company before taking the bribe. Garber took the bribe to pay his two children's college tuition Garber is hesitant to admit to Ryder that he did take the bribe because of the likely outcome of admitting his guilt. This is the first scene where the development of Garber is evident by the use of dialog and the tone of voice. The use of an indirect-subjective point of view is also used to show the internal conflict and the development of Garber's character. Because of Walter's heroic efforts in ultimately putting an end to Ryder and his crew's ransom efforts, Garber receives praise from the Mayor (James Gandolfini). The Mayor tells Garber that the city will aid him in the pending investigation by the MTA.In the scene where Camonetti (John Turturro) the hostage negotiator arrived to the Rail Control Center, Garber's boss instructs him to go home. Gerber was initially hesitant to leave, but eventually Garber gives in and leaves work for the day. After Garber leaves, Ryder refuses to talk to Camonetti; he only wants to talk to Garber. Ryder is adamant that his demands are met. Ryder shoots Jerry Pollard (Gary Basaraba), the motorman who is being held hostage. Garber is tracked down on his way home from work and brought back to the Rail Control Center to talk to Ryder.When the 10 million dollar ransom is to be delivered, Ryder demands that Garber delivers the money. Ryder makes this demand because he needs Garber to drive the train, and he knows that Garber is not a cop. Garber was given the opportunity to refuse and not go through with delivering the money. Garber's character is redeemed after his heroic efforts to save others, which are similar to Karl (Billy Bob Thornton) in Sling Blade. In The Taking of Pelham 123 and Sling Blade, the characters were able to overcome haunting events of the past and help to save the lives of others. The efforts that he made in bringing down the four hijackers, helps to restore Garber's character and put his questionable past behind him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not viewed the 1974 original so my review will be based on what I see here.Considering there are an infinite number hostage-situation film this one really has no reason of being made. The only possible novelty this film delivers is having Washington and Travolta on the same screen. However the interactions these two have are trivial at best and their dialogs are mostly shallow chitchat and insignificant to the plot. Something to note is that the movie showcases some of the most pathetic and random attempts of generating tension. The cops fail to deliver the ransom on time because cop cars and motor-cops with sirens screaming just had to collide with regular civilians driving (the pacing of this part of the film makes it look like a high-speed chase, but no, it's just cops running into things). And a sniping cop misfires because a rat bit him in the leg. Both these accident do not build up to anything memorable or interesting in any case. The film also repeatedly dwells on one of the young hostages who is using a laptop to live-stream with his girl friend. But this eventually leads up to a 3-5 second scene where one of the criminals smiles and turns it off, and that's it. Makes you wonder if the purpose of these scenes are no other than to occupy screen time, because making Travolta and Washington chat for 2-hours straight would be too tiresome. At the end of the film this regular government employee (Washington)takes it upon himself to chase this armed criminal (Travolta) down. The movie gives him no motives to do so so the only reason it looks acceptable it's because it's Wasington and we're all used to seeing Washington ending the movie as a hero. In the end it feels like a movie with no story to tell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As my title suggests, I am posting this review to demonstrate that there is some measure of authenticity to my other reviews. I don't like everything and this is a classic case in point.I know that The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3 was a remake of a seventies film. I know that this required some updating and action additions. What I didn't count on was being assaulted by the editing and director's need to move the camera in every shot. I have seen a number of low budget horror films where this was excusable. Please note that I did not say it was enjoyable. The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3 took this to a completely different level. Like an out of control CSI episode the camera seemed to move and spin and rise and fall and jump for no apparent reason. Which would be annoying enough but just in case our attention was not distracted enough the editor then decided to cut these shots into the smallest pieces he could before pasting them together.It is really a shame that so much money and so many good actors were wasted on such a badly assembled film. There might have been a good film lurking in there but I will be darned if I could find it. I was too busy getting sick from all the jumping around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Replete with the usual bravado and profanity-laced dialog and violence, " The Taking of Pelham 123" has little interesting or new to add to the hostage movie genre save for a display of the inner workings of the NY Subway system. Indeed, having big-name actors cannot singularly hold up a bad script and that's the problem. Director Scott throws in ADD type cuts between scenes, and employs awful generic music. We have Travolta with a stamped goony looking tattoo to somehow validate his thugginess. And Denzel Washington has pretty much mailed in his role here. He's taking it to the bank. Dialog meanders and features a lot of meaningless details. This movie is a gobble gobble turkey - made for the masses meant to herd the viewers who shun thinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do people have a morbid fixation for the old? I was asking myself this question because half the reviews that hammered Pelham 2009 are dotted with comparisons to the 1974 version. Well, I didn't watch the old film, so the 2009 remake was as good as new to me. The conversation between Johan Travolta and Denziel Washington was sheer poetry and kept the movie alive right till the end where the two protagonists come to face each other. Washington was at his vintage best in his role of the corrupt rail man Walter Garber who lands in the hot seat of the negotiator with the merciless hijacker John Travolta, by accident. I was sold out on the scene where Washington is forced to face his demons in public when Travolta challenges him to rise above himself or be responsible for the death of a passenger! Phew. I wont give away the ending but the look on Washington's face when the credits start rolling is priceless! Don't go by the rating if you haven't watched the old Pelham. Watch it!

		<shortDescription>Did I miss something?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I found the movie compelling enough to get me through my elliptical workout, I wonder if I missed something by not reading the book or seeing the original movie? Denzel Washington's character was apparently supposed to be a real good guy just trying to support his family, even if it caused him to bend the rules to do it. But was that true, or was there something much more sinister going on with him? It would have been a much better movie if it turned out that he was in on "it" with Travolta's character the whole time and got away with some if the money while everyone figured him for a hero and forgave him for his bribery mistake. After all, he got the gun from the duffel bag - they didn't show if he took any money to go with it. Then, for no apparent reason, he chases down Travolta's character on foot and puts his own life in jeopardy rather than staying back and saving the passengers on the train. He says he doesn't want to shoot, but then he does and does not seem to suffer any horror or grief over what he just was forced to do to protect his own life. Also, for some reason, I did not understand - perhaps someone could explain it to me - he kept telling his wife that he would bring home a half gallon of milk despite the fact that she kept insisting it be a whole gallon. Was this some kind of code he was trying to relay to her? Was he talking code for bringing home a fortune or something like that? Finally, in the very last scene of the movie, Washington returns home with two bags in his hands. One probably had that half gallon of milk he insisted on and there was no way to know what was in the other bag. He entered his house with a smirk on his face. What was in that bag? A brick of cash from one of the bags? Did he have investments in gold in the market? I really hope some or all of this is true because my imagined version of the movie makes it much more interesting than if Washington's character was really a straight forward good guy - if that is so - then many of his actions made no sense at all!!! If someone who read the book or saw the first movie knows the truth, I'd be interested to know!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>New York City subway dispatcher Walter Garber's ordinary day is thrown into chaos by an audacious crime: the hijacking of a subway. Ryder, the criminal mastermind who, as leader of a highly-armed gang of four, threatens to execute the train's passengers unless a large ransom is paid within one hour. As the tension mounts beneath his feet, Garber employs his vast knowledge of the subway system in a battle to outwit Ryder and save the hostages. --© Sony PicturesA lot has changed after 35 years since the last ToP123 film. Technology has taken over and the city of New York has changed, especially after the 9/11 attacks. In this way, the remake of ToP123 doesn't seem like such a bad idea compared to other remakes, and it isn't. In fact, while the remake generally hits the same spots in the original film, it's a completely different film overall.Let's start with the most obvious change: The tone. While the original ToP123 played out more like a dark comedy, the remake is far more serious, and I prefer it that way. No matter how much I enjoyed the original's comedy, I will always prefer the more realistic serious tone for the remake. I mean, after all, a hostage situation shouldn't be taken very lightly, especially when there are lives involved.I also liked Denzel Washington's performance a lot. I haven't seen a lot of his films but this is my first time seeing him play a vulnerable and flawed human being. There's a subtlety about his performance, someone who's trying to keep his emotions from affecting his job. I wish I could say the same about John Travolta, who's more of a hit and miss type of character. In some scenes, he's good, while in others, he was laughable because of how over the top he plays his character. I can't keep a straight face whenever he dropped the f-bomb. John Turturro is pretty good, which is great because I could not stand him in the Transformers films.Another thing I liked is the addition of technology in the story. It's sometimes used for moving the plot and sometimes used to develop a character. However, one main thing I don't like about the film is Tony Scott's direction. It's kinetic and jumpy rather than coherent and suspenseful. The film has a hard time building up tension because of how the film is shot and edited. I didn't like the whole blurriness and the ongoing slow motion used throughout the film at all.The film also meanders around the third act, especially during the climax, where it's supposed to be the most exciting part. There's also a lot of plot contrivances that happens in the third act that bothered me because they were so ridiculous.Although with the many flaws the remake has, it's still a good thriller, mostly due to Washington's performance. I liked the transition to a modern New York setting as well as the straight forward serious tone. Give it a watch if you're interested or skip the ride if you think the remake is unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A solid movie. Good action flick, good drama, characters feel real, motivations are transparent, rocks along at a fairly good pace. Not so over the top that it breaks the fourth wall (by comparison, had the misfortune of watching Transformers 2 last night, which is so outrageous it may as well be shouting "this is a movie" at you for 2 and a half hours.) Anyway Pelham 123 is a good 1,5 hour ride. GREAT performances by the two leads Denzel Washington and John Travolta. Supporting cast backs them up well. The movie is not pretentious - sets out to be a tense action flick, and delivers. Negative points would be a bit too much us of the slow-mo blur effect and a LOT of swearing (not one for the whole family!). Compares well to the original. One Two Three is, of course, a lot slower - the pace of 123 is a lot faster, characters get established quicker, more camera movement, quicker editing.</fullReview>

The special effects and action was spectacular. A lot of people say this wasn't as great as then the original but I cant say that because I haven't seen the original. But even though they say the original was better. I think the new one is better.. I was also surprised that they were able to shoot this great film in Manhattan which is one of the busiest places in the world. Somehow they were able to do it. Denzel and Travolta should definitely team up for another film soon. I never actually saw the first one. I guarantee you that the new one is probably way better than the original.

Why the bad guys could have such an elaborate plan until that point, and then leave the final steps completely to chance with no escape plan, is beyond belief.IMHO it went from an 8 to a 6 and changed it from amazing to stupid - essentially to avoid a bad guys win scenario, which could have been avoided, without any problems, with a realistic ending.Sad, sad, sad, but I guess the bad guys aren't allowed to win and there was no point in figuring out an alternative ending that would preserve the integrity of all the characters while still assuring they got what was coming to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remaking classics is usually a bad idea. They are classics because they contain fine acting, directing etc etc. Following in the footsteps of Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw will always cast a long shadow.The inspired casting of the reliable Denzil Washington will always compensate any limitations in a film. This film needs that since reels on computer techniques and as often happens with modern films these techniques push aside such elementary matters like acting, directing, script. This is an enjoyable film unless you have already seen the original, in which case it leaves a sour taste.The 70's original like many of the films of the period evoke th e grittiness and realism. It also contained political commentary of the state of New York in a witty script which this film is need of.Travolta who should have been perfect for his role appears to be badly directed. See the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some great dialogue in this taut thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One Two Three which starred Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw as the two main protagonists. This, updated version, changes aspects the story to fit modern tastes, but the guts of it are the same. I'll try not to do a direct comparison with the original, partly because I haven't seen it in a very long time, and partly because I don't think it's fair.Walter Garber is an official of the MTA who, as punishment for accepting a bribe, has been demoted to dispatcher. Towards the end of his shift he notices that a train has become stationary in a tunnel. Calling the driver he gets no reply. Eventually, it becomes clear that a gang of hijackers, lead by a man known as Ryder has taken the train. It eventually separates and one car moves a few hundred yards down the tunnel. Left to negotiate with Ryder, Garber forms a kind of rapport with the hijacker. Ryder demands ten million dollars within an hour or he will start to shoot the hostages. The mayor is informed and he arranges for the money to be prepared. It's clear that Ryder is quite volatile and when the police negotiator, Camonetti, tries to take over he shoots one of the hostages. A sniper accidentally shoots the hijacker's driver, Phil Ramos, and another hostage is killed. Eventually the money arrives and Garber is told he must deliver it, putting him face to face with Ryder. I'll leave my summary there, don't want to give the ending away!It's a very well made film with some good dialogue and very good performances from both of the major stars. So,special mentions for both Denzel Washington as Walter Garber and John Travolta as Ryder. Honourable mentions go to Luis Guzmán as Phil Ramos, John Turturro as Camonetti and James Gandolfini as the Mayor.One of the main problems I had with this film was the cinematography. In one scene we are meeting the mayor for the first time and the camera keeps moving round and around him, it made me feel dizzy! There were also a couple of plot holes that didn't help. But for all that it's pretty entertaining stuff. For the most part it kept me gripped, although it did start to drag a little towards the end. Over all, not bad: recommended.My score: 6.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham 123 is definitely not a must see because the story is far away from a fast paced and adrenalin pushed thriller. From start to end the movie is predictable. I didn't see the original one from the year 1974 but this remake didn't convince me at all. It was slow paced and sometimes somebody had to be killed to keep the attention high and so on. The action scenes were except of two parts poorly executed and the picture one more time very disappointing. John Travolta delivered a very cool performance and he saved this film from a complete disaster. 6/10 See instead Red Eye or Air Force One. I don't know what I can write more to reach the minimum length of 10 lines.Denzel Washington and James Gandolfini played their parts as usual solid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unresolved genre piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Taking Of Pelham 123 sees John Travlta reprising his Swordfish role and Denzel Washington playing Denzel Washington, again. Travolta's motley crew hijack a subway train full of passengers, park it up in the tunnel and demand 10 million dollars within an hour. Of course 10 million dollars is the maximum sum the mayor can call upon, but no one seems to follow why the terrorists know this. Later in the film it takes the mayor himself to work out in one short conversation with his aide more than the NYPD had worked out in the previous hour. I for one would re-elect that kind of intellect. The scenes on the train are alright, the green lighting gives it a distinct identity separate from the control room but then there's no real effort made to create any tension or sense of claustrophobia. Once Travolta starts shooting you can pretty much assume there are going to be more victims. Then there's the question of how the terrorists are going to escape - a question which is answered far far far too simply and in defiance of all pervading logic. At the very end the film gives up all semblance of credibility, forgetting the many plot lines that its left untied and simply stops mid-shot in a way i haven't seen since Cross Of Iron. As the credits rolled i had to pinch myself because i really couldn't believe how brazenly it had just stopped mid-sentence with so much left unresolved. Looking back, not worth watching at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Thriller, but felt like a B-movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The taking of Pelham 123 was a decent re-make and I enjoyed it overall. However, I'll break down the film's flaws and positives and surprisingly realized the film's strengths were responsible for its weaknesses. Nowadays a Hollywood B-movie is nothing short of low budget. B-movies today have high budgets. The Problem with this film is that most of the budget went to the cast; who were all excellent and had great chemistry. The action was terrible in this film, mostly because it served as scene filler material. But oh what fine acting in this film! The show stealer was Gandolfini in my mind, adding some humor here and there; although Travolta stole a few scenes, whenever he wasn't cursing, or being overly-mad. He sounded a bit cartoon-ish for an R-rated film.Now the directing was way too choppy and unnecessary. Some elements were not needed, and didn't add to the film. I liked the pacing of the film since it's plot depended on a timer. For example, 5 minutes in the movie was 5 minutes long. The tension was felt in some scenes, helped by the fine acting of course. Denzel did a great job, even though he was so reserved. He really felt like a NY'er, they all did, of course, that's because most of the actors are from the area. It helped create a better atmosphere, and the one thing I liked about Tony Scott's camera work was his choices of urban cinematography. As a New Yorker myself, I really appreciated the unique vantage points taken from helicopters, it captured the city beautifully. Too bad it felt like a music video at times. Unique directing yes, But no Tony, you're not as good as you're brother for sure.One good thing about this movie is the Shakespearean elements in the film. I loved the dialog between Travolta and Denzel. It was a story taken out of a super hero comic. It wasn't a boring old cat and mouse chase like the original. Overall, It was nothing like the original, especially the ending. That's all I'm going to say about it. In a movie like this, it's hard to take it serious like a thriller should feel. I never thought a situation like this could ever take place in real life. I really think they should have rated this film PG-13.7/10 for the good acting by an A-list cast. Unfortunately, all the action felt forced, and unnecessary at times. But it's sure to entertain if you're looking for a good thriller, but might disappoint some action movie fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging Thriller With A So-So Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cool, sophisticated John Travolta as Gabriel Shear in SWORDFISH (2001), he is not. Travolta's subsequent attempt as a mastermind in THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1-2-3 as Ryder seems a bit of a step down from his earlier role. Overall, this thriller remains engaging, with a great sense of pacing and action and interest almost all the way through the movie. Tony Scott's attempts at fancy camera work, however, for some may be a bit too video game, music video, faddish. His unnecessarily hyper-energetic attempts with zooming and slo-mo and other fancy images at some point seem more distracting and annoying than compellingly interesting. The end of the movie seems to fall apart some with an ending that really doesn't blow the socks off...sort of a soft landing not consistent with the rest of the intelligent, high-octane burn of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not very good. I don't know if it's possible to win a lawsuit in which I can recover the two hours I spent watching this movie but I would like to try. Basically this movie is where John Travolta is always angry and wants to make money. John Travolta is super into being buddy buddy with Denzel Washington who operates a subway. Denzel is angry because he was demoted from manager to a grunt. There is no explanation why John Travolta is always angry but he is not angry at the same time. Luiz Guzman has a small role in this movie and there are no scary scenes. The only good part is when they are all on the Subway and John Travolta shoots this one guy for no reason. I will never suggest you see this movie. John Travolta is over acting in many of the scenes and thinks that he is cool. He stopped being cool in the 80s and I am not sure why John Travolta thinks he can be a bad guy. Face off was far better than this movie. John Travolta needs to stick to other roles.</fullReview>

I was expecting an adrenaline-pumping edge of your seat ride,a cat and mouse thriller by two box office heavy weights, but was given a dog and duck chase with some smart one liners.John Travolta's emotional role is heightened giving his real life tragedy and you really feel deeply for him when interacting with the child hostage. But that's it, just another New York City showcase action-ish thriller, it's no Hunger or Man on fire. Mr Scott, Tony gives us a poor mans Collateral.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this remake lacked the strength of characterization that makes the original one such a success. It is a Tour De Force of an artistic lack of vision. The colours are cool and the images are of NYC, but there is no sense of looking into areas that are normally out of bounds. It is like the music of Carlos Santana's brother-it is music, but it just isn't very inspiring music. This film was made by your Daddy-for you Son. That is the feeling that comes across to me-made by people who think of themselves as gifted for no reason other than they are not so bright. It is a cheap gift from someone who doesn't know you but likes to think they do. It is an attempt at mental camaraderie from an unknown quantity. John Ravioli is loud and obnoxious and all in all not much of a pleasure to watch on screen. The plot is more basic the the original, and the vision of NYC is claustrophobic and is an ode to crap cool that nobody really cares about. I think many people will either see this or buy this as a DVD based on the initial film. Denzel is good but not excellent in this, and smallish part was given to James Gandolfini-who was effective. John Latraviata-try doing a part of someone with an IQ equal or greater than your own. We all know you are more than just a high tech thug.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four armed men hijack a subway train in Manhattan. They stop on a slight incline, decoupling the first car to let the rest of the train coast back.Their leader is Ryder; he connects by phone with Walter Garber, the dispatcher watching that line. Garber is a supervisor temporarily demoted while being investigated for bribery.Ryder demands $10 million within an hour, or he'll start shooting hostages. He'll deal only with Garber.The mayor okays the payoff, the news of the hostage situation sends the stock market tumbling, and it's unclear what Ryder really wants or if Garber is part of the deal.I thought the original was okay, but not a masterpiece as many people say, the ending was good though......Sue me. I love Scott movies, because they offer a lot of the time, big bangs and a couple of hours in a cinema, where you can switch off and enjoy some flashy editing.Now with this movie, where most of the action is 'talking' via an intercom, you wouldn't expect a lot of flashy editing would you? think again, this has more than any other re-make (hee hee) this year.But the main point of this film is to see Travolta in Face/Off mode once more, and while he is considerably menacing, even with a handle bar moustache, he feels more Dr. Evil than truly evil.The banter between the two leads is good, but not as good when you consider the screenplay is by Helgeland. There is way too much swearing from Travolta, and a silly sub-plot involving wall street, is sniffed at.So basically it's Washingtons straight man to the over acting of Travolta, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but then there are so many plot holes and bad lines in the film, that they cannot be ignored, and thus, make the film irritating.Not your typical Tony Scott movie.If you Love Travolta circa Face/off, and Washington as the everyman, there is something in it....just</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty well the first lines spoken in the movie are so vile with profanities that I almost turned off the DVD right then. I didn't have much hope that the rest of the movie was going to have any intelligent dialogue. I persevered, though, and generally enjoyed the story.The characters are believable, the storyline interesting, the cinematography average, the performances are good, but the dialogue is annoyingly mostly swearing.I'm not against swearing in general and am open minded about it (I swear all the time). Swearing has its place for emphasis and can fit in with a story and character occasionally. When a script is this full of swearing, though, it is just too much. I guess the writers figured that they would lose the interest of some of the audience if they didn't have obscenities yelled every other line. To me, it just seemed pointlessly crass and over-the-top.If the language had been toned down to more normal/real/average levels, I would have rated this movie much higher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travolta and Wahington save this thriller from being a below par pop corn flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its almost as if Tony Scott and Denzel Washington just can't keep their hands off each other! And since their last outing 'Deja Vu' was such an epic fail, Pelham 123 didn't look at a promising, but is saved by its two leads! The first hour of this movie plays out as a very tight, tense, ticking clock thriller. Washington and Travolta bring this fairly average affair to something much more appealing. Watching these two actors play off each other is the movies strongest point and there given a sharp script to work with. When the movies tense, the film really works but in the last 45 minutes or so it just takes a wrong direction and becomes your typical by-the-book action flick. Pelham almost becomes a comic book style blockbuster, and all the cringable one liners prevent this movie for being at all believable. Many unnecessary and irrelevant explosions and car chases that just drive the audience away from the plot and the direction is really quite poor. Its great how they actually keep to the time, so you really feel involved in the situation, but many of the direction techniques just fall flat. The execution is also very week and unimaginative that you almost feel cheated. For the most part its a very enjoyable thriller, but the last act just drags out and there are many scenes that just weren't needed. Better than Tony Scotts other recent efforts, but he really needs to find something new. If your a fan of these race against time thrillers then its worth a watch, but it doesn't do anything original to the genre.Overall: A train wreck without Travolta and Denzel. It's dumb, poorly directed, but for the most part a enjoyable thriller. 6/10 3/5-Simpson reviews</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent acting by Washington but poor performance by Travolta and a bad script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if Tony Scott, Travolta, and Washington were hard up for money or what, but that is what this movie felt like. The basic plot is that Washington is happens to be on duty at the New York subway authority when Travolta highjacks a train with innocent civilians on it. Travolta holds the hostages for ransom and Washington serves as the intermediary between the NYPD hostage negotiator (John Turturro) and Travolta (who goes by the name Ryder in the movie). The remainder of the movie is spent over the one hour that Travolta gives the NYPD to deliver the ransom money. The characters are horribly developed and the audiences is forced to make rather bland inferences on the motivations of Washington and Travolta. The cinematography is standard Tony Scott, so if you have scene "Man on Fire" or "Deja Vu," it will be rather familiar. Travolta's character lacks any sort of decency or reason so it is tough to identify with any of the criminals. The climax of the movie is more of plateau due to the poorly written resolution. Bottom line, this movie would have gone straight to DVD if it weren't for the names of Scott, Washington and Travolta. See it if you must.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suitably good remake of the 1974 movie, I just wish Travolta's character had not been so profane. But I suppose it was "in character."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 6 months ago I watched the 1974 version of this movie, in anticipation of this one coming out on DVD about now. I am glad I did, both use the same basic premise and story, but the newer version has many changes to update to modern times. Like the internet, which plays a key role in this remake. Also the original ransom request was $1Million, in this one the ante had been upped to $10Million, making the logistics to transport 100,000 $100 bills a bit different.Denzel Washington is Walter Garber, a NYC subway system manager who had been demoted to dispatcher while he awaited facing charges of taking bribes on a car procurement deal with Japan. He claims he is innocent. On a routine day something abnormal happens inside the tunnels, a train stops for no apparent reason.Inside that train are gunmen led by John Travolta as Ryder. He gets into a conversation with Garber, telling him the city will get them $10Million within 60 minutes or they will begin executing hostages, one each minute the money is late.James Gandolfini is good as the Mayor who must face the difficult task of dealing with this.MAJOR SPOILERS: In this version a transit police was identified and killed early. In the original a transit police was undetected and followed the crooks as they made their getaway in the tunnel. In this one Garber was sent with the 4 flight bags of money, one with a gun in a false bottom. He manages to follow and corner Ryder on a NYC bridge, and had to shoot him. Turns out Ryder was a Wall Street type who had served time for money fraud, and he was using this episode and the ensuing panic to make money by manipulating the market. Much more than the $10Million, but he didn't get to see any of it. Outsmarted by Garber.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Aboard for the latest from Tony Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like it's a stigma at best or a mark of certain death at worst to have the word "remake" attached to any picture, especially when trudging into "classic" territory; Psycho's remake is the poster child of all that can go wrong, and while 1974's The Taking of Pelham One Two Three isn't exactly Hitchcock, it's still something of a fan favorite and a fine example of memorable 1970s-style film-making. Replacing Walter Matthau with Denzel Washington and Robert Shaw with John Travolta, Director Tony Scott's 2009 take on the story is surprisingly engaging despite its particularly predictable nature. Still, for as unremarkable as The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 may be in the grand scheme of things, Scott, Washington, and Travolta manage to make the unremarkable rather remarkable. Though the ending comes as no surprise, the talented trio deliver a film packed with intense tit-for-tat dialogue, remarkably real performances, and the director somehow squeezes every last ounce of life out a film that banks heavily on two rather dull locations and minimal action but maximum tension.Mild-mannered transit authority dispatcher Walter Garber (Washington) is about to have his otherwise monotonous workday routine turned upside down when several heavily armed men -- led by a man that eventually comes to be known as "Ryder" (Travolta) -- hijack a subway car from Pelham station. Garber finds himself the man communicating with Ryder, and it is to Garber that Ryder makes his demands known: $10,000,000 in cash in 60 minutes, delivered to his location. For every minute thereafter that the money is not in his possession, he will kill one hostage. When Garber is taken off the microphone, replaced by hostage negotiator Camonetti (John Turturro), Ryder violently demands Garber return. Matters are further complicated when Garber's shady past is exposed, a revelation that allows Ryder to seize the initiative in the tit-for-tat game in which the two find themselves engaged as the clock quickly counts down towards zero.Director Tony Scott brings some much-needed visual verve and vigor to a picture that's otherwise necessarily stagnant throughout; the film finds the vast majority of its action in either a stopped subway car or in an office setting, neither of which allow for much in the way of visual stimulation, despite the latter's clean lines, bright lights, and wall of computer monitors that tracks the subway cars. The Tony Scott style is in full effect here, the film featuring a frenetic look that's punctuated by quick edits, fast zooms, a mixture of slow- and fast-motion photography, and plenty of hand-held work, and that's just the film's title sequence. It does slow down just a bit once the film gets going, but it keeps things fluid when there would otherwise be no fluidity to the dialogue-heavy action. The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, as a requirement of the story, necessitates a tight script to maintain tension, and even though the film's somewhat clichéd "bad guy demands money and if he doesn't get it he'll start offing hostages" routine is the centerpiece of the story, Brian Helgeland's script features exceptional dialogue, particularly those conversations between Ryder and Garber as they feel one another out and fish for weaknesses while simultaneously -- but slowly -- developing their back stories. All that's left are two actors to pull it off, and Travolta and Washington share brilliant chemistry as two men on opposite sides of both the microphone and the law.The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 delivers dialogue-driven drama at its finest. The film works because of Washington's and Travolta's ability to take rather standard stuff and make it personal, important, dangerous, serious, and real. Tony Scott's frenetic direction adds urgency to the tone, but it's the chemistry between the leads that makes Pelham work so well. The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 features another stalwart performance from Denzel Washington, but his character is a far cry from the sorts he portrayed in his previous collaborations with Tony Scott, namely Déj? Vu and Man on Fire. Here, Washington sports a hint of gray hair, wears a sweater and glasses, and is thereby painted as more of an everyman rather than as a force to be reckoned with. As such, it's much easier for the audience to connect with the hero on a personal level as he learns on the fly how to deal with a crisis situation. The one trait he shares in common with his character from Man on Fire is that Garber is a flawed -- albeit modestly -- character himself, though it's a trait that seems to work to his benefit in his relationship with Ryder. On the other side of the coin, John Travolta plays his part with a delicious and lively deviousness and a hint of insanity lurking behind the professionally-executed hijacking, but at the same time emitting an aura of danger and deadly seriousness that ups the ante considerably. It seems unreal that there was a pre-Pulp Fiction Travolta that seemed long since forgotten, but The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 features the actor at the top of his game and showing that he still has some gas in the tank. The film also features strong performances from James Gandolfini and John Turturro.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pretty decent suspense thriller that mostly gets the job done.Denzel Washington is the civil servant working in the control center of New York's public transit system. John Travolta is the nut job who takes a subway car hostage until his demands for copious amounts of money are met. Both men have histories that the film spends far too much time developing; what really matters in a film like this is the action, and there's enough of it to make the the thudding plot exposition tolerable.If I had to pick one major flaw of the film, it's the casting. Washington has too much movie star charisma -- even under an extra 15 pounds or so of paunch -- to ever be totally believable as Joe Public, but he's a good enough actor to pull it off. But Travolta isn't believable for one second as a former Wall Street executive gone off the deep end and turned terrorist. Every time he was on screen, I couldn't stop thinking about Edna Turnblad, and that doesn't make for a very effective movie villain.Now Edna Turnblad as a terrorist on the other hand....THAT could be terrifying.....Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie of two halves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite excited about this movie when i found out about it. Seemed to have it all the director, lead star actors, set in NY which is star actor itself. then i read first critics and they said it to be just average and now after watching it I must agree. For me the first half of the movie is great, it's tense, exciting the dialogues between Denzel and Travolta are first class and the director starts the characterization Michael Mann style. but when the stage is set and the plot has to start unraveling it takes a bad turn. From then on it's just action and some senseless scriptwriting, some thing just made me laugh and I don't't mean that in a good way. the second part is full of clichés and what is even more frustrating is that you get a sense it was easy to make it a great movie. The actors are the highlight of the film and they make it worth watching. Denzel easily pulls off the average guy in special circumstances and Travolta is on the money with his no bullshit bring me the money hijacker, Gandolfini is fine as the mayor and Torturro is good as well although should have been more used.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subpar Subway Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh where to start (at the end credits would be my suggestion). The movie (a remake) is about a high-jacked subway, and the entertainment value (in the original at least) comes from the conversations between the cold-blooded ex-merc played by Travolta (Robert Shaw in the original) and the transit worker played by Denzel (Walter Mathau in the original.) However, this movie has no tension because everything is so absurdly over-the-top. The dialog is not profound, it is profane. If you went to three aspiring writers who were, maybe seventeen, and told them to write some dialog that a very intense highjacker would say, then there's your movie. Every stereotypical theme of conversation from a cool super villain is thrown in, without the insight or wit, and every other sentence ends in "you got me mother-f***er!" It becomes laughable they try so hard. Rent the original and save yourself the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocking the remake rails.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An organized gang of criminals led by Ryder (John Travolta) takes hostage a New York subway train, and train dispatcher Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) must talk them down.Brian Helgeland screenwrites and Tony Scott (TOP GUN, TRUE ROMANCE, MAN ON FIRE) directs this remake of the 1974 film of the same name, THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3, from the book by John Godey. In the original (starring Walter Matthau), the gang members used code names Mr. Brown, Mr. Green, Mr. Blue, etc. Tarantino never got called a copycat for using this exact naming of his thieves in RESERVOIR DOGS (1992), yet these color epithets have now become so associated with Tarantino's breakout cultie that to use them even in this remake would, ironically, make PELHAM look like it was copycatting - Tarantino! And director Scott goes one better on the gang members - by casting actual gang members! Having real hardcore Albanian mafia as his gang (Victor Gojcaj and Robert Vataj), we sympathize with Travolta for interacting with them as if from a ten foot pole. In the original PELHAM, Robert Shaw ruled his gang with an iron fist, condescendingly barking orders, shooting those who disobeyed him or staring them down with his British accent, but no way was babyface Travolta gonna treat his young thugs with the same disrespect - no matter how many fake jail tattoos he sported. He says maybe two words to them, just letting them go hellspit shooting up the carriages, killing an undercover cop, manhandling people, and when they part ways after the heist, he simply shakes one of their hands. Then he's breathing a sigh of relief into Kelly Preston's breasts that night...Despite that haziness over his co-stars, Travolta has really crept into the mind of that bad guy he tried so hard to convey in John Woo's cheesy BROKEN ARROW. And Denzel never once pulls out his star quality; he is heart and soul the broken ex-motorman he is playing, caught in the wrong place (dispatching Pelham station) at the wrong time (1:23 p.m.).Since the filming of PELHAM 1974, technology has run rampant, so taking a subway train hostage would not only be impossible in this age, but also very very stupid. So this PELHAM necessarily had to build in updated elements: online chatting, cell phones, computer graphic readouts, digital security measures.Ryder has a computer with him, constantly checking stock prices, even during his tirades. And the heist is not the simple money game it originally was in 1974. Ryder asks for a ransom of ten million in cash but that is a diversion - he is playing on the much larger canvas of the stock market, that fluctuates with every event that impacts the evening news, in this case, his taking of the subway train Pelham 123.Whereas PELHAM 1974 was a psychological battle played out over the radio between the thief and the policeman, PELHAM 2009 has upped the psychological stakes, making Denzel's Garber merely a dispatcher, but with a dubious background, which Ryder exploits to humiliate him publicly.James Gandolfini (forever Tony Soprano) is the New York Mayor. Michael Rispoli (Jackie Aprile in THE SOPRANOS Season One) is Denzel's boss. Watch for Frank Wood (forever Greg from FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS) in a serious role as Gando's adviser. John Turturro studiously underplays his hostage negotiator character and ends up adding another element to this remake - he obtusely accuses Garber of being in cahoots with Ryder, for the coincidence of being the dispatcher Ryder negotiates with.I've made the point many times that in all big budget American movies, when a car crashes it has to flip over. (Makes perfect sense when you see the way Americans drive.) Here, they give us a bonus: when the ransom car races through New York's idiot streets, not only does it flip over from a simple head-on collision, it tumbles off an overpass and lands upside down. Too bad it didn't explode - or we would have had the trifecta! Besides the opening scenes (in which director Scott seems to be trying for some kind of skateboard-punk urgency, with his ramped film, strobed shots and crash-cuts), in all respects, the filmmakers have taken this PELHAM remake off the rails and done it justice.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining enough, but 's been done before (not just in the remake)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is arguably Denzel's first official typecast movie. He's spiraling into, or at least hanging around the fringes of, that realm that Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro have become all too familiar with: Movies that really aren't that deep, that thick, or even that good, that pretty much rely on star power and the main actors' ability to create drama via facial expressions and vocal inflections, rather than on depth of story line alone. It was a showcase for two popular actors, Travolta and Washington (see "Righteous Kill"). This movie is good only because these two are sharing the same screen. The plot isn't all that thick. Travolta steels a train. 2/3 of this flick is just phone dialogue between two really good actors (or one really good actor, and one who's kinda an honorary member of the Really Good Actor's Guild). Travolta puts on a clinic for anybody aspiring to play a narcissistic, semi-phsychotic criminal. Denzel takes you to school- if you want to play a convincing little guy who's having a really bad day. The supporting cast is surprisingly famous- James Gandolfini, John Tutura, John Guzman, etc. But this movie has been made a million times before, and Denzel starred in half a million of them. Gritty, bouncy, choppy camera angles. Dark, gloomy NYC imagery. Thick, New York cop mustaches. The F' bomb everywhere. Quick shots of smooth skinned, tough, hip-hoppish Puerto Ricans wearing headphones and bookbags walking through subway stations. Echoing rap music. It was Inside Man, Bone Collector, Fallen, Training Day, John Q, Out Of Time, Man On Fire, Déj? vu, The Siege, Heat, Righteous Kill, Swordfish, Sixteen Blocks all over again. Nothing happened in this movie that you haven't seen in a NYC movie a thousand times before. Yaaaaawn. But- it was still pretty good. That's how good these actors are. They took a basic plot that you and I could have written this afternoon- and made it a pretty good 90 minutes. Fair enough. Denzel gets off the hook with this one- but I expect a brilliant, challenging blockbuster next time out buster, or you're in big trouble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to the money?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I found this movie quite a bit more entertaining than I thought it would be. I have never read the book, so I had no idea what to expect. I thought this movie had no potential, a suspense movie about a highjacked subway car, sounds dull to me. But I think they developed the character of Ryder pretty good. I like the little hints throughout the movie of what he did in his previous line of work. I felt that they didn't really develop Denzel Washingtons character enough. They didn't really go into his back story except for the couple of minutes he talked to Ryder about it. I felt as if they killed Denzel Washington's character I wouldn't have cared as much as I should have. I was actually feeling for Ryder, the bad guy, much more than anyone else in the movie. I ended up hoping for Ryder to get away with the whole thing. The one part of the movie I did like, the twist that he was a broker and played the stock market, was not really explained AT ALL in the end. It just showed that he made the money, but it never showed where the money went. I mean did he have a family that it went to? Did it go to a friend of his? Where the hell did that $300 mill go when he got killed in the end? But other than that I thought it was a well made movie and much better than I thought it would be.</fullReview>

Direction is not very tight. THere is a deadline countdown scene in the movie, but it just doesn't carry the right amount of intensity. John Travolta is ever so good, Denzel Washington not so good. Screenplay is a culprit here. By switching the focus between the train and the control room, the viewer is not able to totally grasp the gravity of the situation, in either place, the control room or the train.I'll give it a 5, it can be watched once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually, "take" your time finding a better hostage movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I haven't seen the original 'Pelham' first, something I make a goal to do prior to seeing a remake, however in this case, it gives me a complete open mind to view the 2009 update. Although I have nothing incredibly bad to say about 'The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3,' I really don't have too much positive either. It's about dead-even on positives/negatives. At times, there was some pretty good tension and somewhat good interactions over the radio between the two leads. Probably the best positive, was Washington's down-acting. At least for once, I didn't think he was trying for another Oscar as I have seen in 90% of his movies (see: 'American Gangster,') so that was pleasant to see him actually act human. Travolta, on the other hand, was only so-so ? I've seen so much better from him and from hostage takers in movies. Also, watching the movie, at times, was like watching a speeding subway, though the title car barely moves. Sure, it's director Scott's fashion to SPEED up, SLOW down, up, down, all over the place. If you like that, strap in and enjoy this ride, but for me, it's gets tedious after awhile. Finally, the ending is kinda anticlimactic; though it appears they tried their best to excite us. I felt it was extremely convenient and when Travolta's motives are made clear, they seem like at the last possible minute completely irrelevant. Demoted dispatcher Garber happens upon the call from hostage taker Ryder and the games begin for the next hour. Will the passengers on said title survive? Will anyone care? (FYI, these extras on the car are basically flies on the wall, we get virtually no information other and 4 of the 19.) Final note: Ironically, the title mirrors the plot's direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a necessary remake, but a good one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is like the original "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" except on steroids. The story is like the original wit it starting out just like an ordinary day for subway dispatcher Walter Garbe(Densel Washington), until a vicious gang of criminals led by the mysterious Ryder(John Travolta) hijacks one of the city's train cars. But instead of just a million dollars, this time around they want 10 million dollars. While the original was a bit clean and neat, this one was a bit messy in a good way. Now some critics claim the original is better, maybe cause it's just the way they have to review it, cause they get the mentality if they talk good about a remake it's blasphemy. Or it's nostalgia getting in the way of there judgment or they really do feel that the original is better. Now I have to agree in a lot of cases the original is way superior to the remake, but in this case I liked the remake a bit better. Despite it being a bit too Hollywood, it was suspenseful and thrilling. Now I get how the technological advances can be a part of why this is, but I usually don't have nostalgia getting in the way of my judgment most of the time. And the technological advances made the movie better, despite the really Hollywood style ending. I liked the ending from the original more better than the ending in this one. This film is also way more fast faced than the original as well although it had more of the annoying characters. Denzel Washinton was good but nothing more than you would expect from him, he played his character who is just a normal man quite fine. John Travolta was charismatic with his role and versatile, but he was a bit obnoxious compared to how Robert Shaw played his character. And the constant motherf***er got a bit annoying after a while. The dialogue between the two was good, it is clever and cool at the same time. But the interactions with other characters wasn't as good. The hostages are way more annoying this time around and there decisions don't make any sense, even if they don't have a loud mouth this time around. The hostage I prayed would get killed was that skater boy wannabe douche, just about everything about him was annoying. To his douche face, to his douche personality, to his douche girlfriend which is just perfect from him, to his probably douche children and grandchildren. I hope he enjoyed his 5 min of fame cause he is a lousy actor and has a douche face to go with it. He was just irritating to watch with his presence on screen. Anyways this was not a necessary remake, but a good one even if it's a bit formulaic. It isn't something your have to rush out to theaters and see, but it most definitely is a good rental, it was a good heist movie and that is the bottom line. Tony Scott also used a real deal criminal who is trying to turn his life around, which was a nice touch to the film as well and it sort of showed.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Scott lavishes his directorial style on this remake of THE TAKING OF PELHAM 123, based on John Godey's novel and adapted for the screen by Brian Helgeland. For some viewers this ruins the gold standard of the original film: for this viewer it heightens the mass, faceless, rapidly paced anonymity of life on the New York subways and makes the pace of the story almost breathless. This time around Denzel Washington is the demoted dispatcher who must deal directly with the insane John Travolta and his gang of hostage takers demanding $10,000,000.01 to avoid killing the isolated carload of people on the Pelham 123 train. The police of course get involved under the guidance of the chief (played with appropriate dignity by John Turturro) who in turn must involve the Mayor of New York, again well enacted by James Gandolfini. The story may be obvious but the final twists and turns of humanity and forgiveness and destiny are well portrayed by Washington and Travolta.There are numerous very brief but well polished cameos by actors such as Luis Guzman and especially by Alex Kaluzhsky playing a young kid whose laptop conversation with his girlfriend opens up the entire story for the world to watch. The camera work is a bit dizzy at times but for this viewer it creates a mood of tension that matches the story. a fast paced entertaining thriller.Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Denzel Washington once more gives all he can to a movie. Great acting, even to support a script with flaws and unnecessary heroism acts. He even manages to get through some really annoying and unjustified dialogs. But off-course his performance can't be enough to save this movie from being a mediocrity. Because the plot turnovers and the reasons to justify such turnovers, especially after the first half are completely not understandable. So is the profiling of each character. What is understandable however is the participation of Travolta in this movie. Suitable to his level of acting. There's only one way to conclude all that, and that's an advise to Denzel Washington: when you see Travolta in the cast, you gotta walk out man! He ruined this movie for you.</fullReview>

Because that's what this movie is.The Taking of Pelham 123 is a pretty simple operation movie which basically is driven (for me anyways) by two awesome actors. Denzel and Travolta. Granted, Travolta's character is weak compared to his many other rolls. Denzel is spot on though.The story isn't anything grabby. As the description reads, a subway train is hi-jacked. And that's pretty much the movie. They have some side-bar which I won't go into for both reasons that I don't wanna place in any spoilers and it has almost no weight on the story.I have no clue what the point of this movie was really. I didn't mind watching it. I mean, I enjoyed it. But I was really disappointed at the end. Just - when you go see this movie, don't expect much of a thrill ride.

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington plays (Walter Garber) a MTA Dispatcher who finds himself in a Subway high-jack. John Tutorro plays a NYPD Hostage negotiator (Detective Camonetti) who try's to reason with the hijackers who are lead by Ryder (John Travolta). When being forced to Negotiate with Ryder, Mayor (James Gandolfini) is forced to pay ten million dollars to the hijackers. When in the process of bringing the money, the NYPD is being timed to bring the money to the subway station. It lasts longer than usual and when the time is up he is going to kill one passenger every minute past the time. Tension is rising and Ryder wants Garber to bring the money himself to the Subway car. With a plan from the NYPD, Garber's long time work with the Subway, he try's to outwit Ryder and his guys to put an end these criminals. With two great actors like Travolta and Washington this makes it a great movie to watch. Also starring Luis Guzmán, Victor Gojcaj, Michael Rispoli, Ramon Rodriguez, John Benjamin Hickey, and Saidah Arrika Ekulona. Trilling and one of those grip of your seat movies should keep you interested to the end. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agreeable Tough-Guy Remake Of Classic New York Hijack Robbery Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Garber is a dispatcher for the NYC subway system when an armed gang hijack a train and demand ten million dollars for the passengers. He must keep the kidnappers talking while the Mayor and the cops figure out what to do.This remake of Joseph Sargent's gritty 1974 crime classic is not as tense or well observed as the original but is flashy, lots of fun and has a great hero/villain vibe in Washington and Travolta's performances. It also plays some interesting variations on the story, such as Garber's crucial admission of guilt, the broker/commodities metaphor, and the whole New York City as the hottest, hippest, happening place theme. The story has two core elements - the relationship between Garber and Ryder, who share guilt and grievance at their treatment by City Hall but have radically different core values (family man and greedy capitalist), and the clock-is-ticking action stylings as the authorities race to get the money or shoot the crooks, depending on how things go. In some ways the latter is an unwelcome distraction from the former, although as always with Scott's movies the stuntwork and pacing are punchy and exciting. Washington is a solid, believable good guy, with strong support from Turturro as the police negotiator. Travolta is big on histrionics but makes his otherwise irredeemable villain intelligent, and so the contrast between him and Washington works well. The movie rushes past, the filmmaking style mirroring the speeding trains and cars, and the conclusion is both exciting and satisfying. A solid thriller, but as is usually the case with remakes, check out the superior original. Tony Scott passed away recently in tragic circumstances. I like several of his films (True Romance and Crimson Tide particularly) and don't care so much for some others, but what they all share is a distinct style and visual flair which is unique to him. Like all truly talented filmmakers, his work is his and his alone, take it or leave it. His legacy is sixteen fine movies we can all enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Travoltas latest choice of films prior to Pelham 123, I was rather skeptical going into this one but it has to be said he pulls out one his best performances since as far back as face off. Not to take anything away from the rest of a great cast, particularly Denzels usual emotionally gripping persona, but Travolta steals the show in my opinion. Pair this together with Tony Scott's genius being the lens, great use of fast paced camera shots to create the tense and suspenseful scene required, the result is a fairly decent thriller. The script wasn't brilliant although funny at times and the story leaves much to be desired but its a film that makes you want to sit down to see how it all pans out, which brings any film up a point or two. I'll give this film a 6/10 worth a watch for any film fan, don't expect to be blown away and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great film...I really enjoyed it. It's an action film about a group of people that take a train hostage and ask for a ransom of $10 million, and they will only talk to the first person they spoke to in the rail control centre.It stars John Travolta and Denzel Washington... 2 of the greatest actors around right now.The story is pretty basic... it's a typical action film. There are no big surprises really, but this does not stop you from enjoying the movie. It was full of action and keeps you entertained and concentrating on the movie throughout. Most of the film is set in the call centre of the rail office and the train cart where the hostages are held in a tunnel... but this is great. I like the fact that most of the film is in one place.John Travolta plays a great bad guy... the thing I like about John is he can play just about anything... good guy, bad guy, musical, romantic etc... He is just a good actor all round.I have never before now had any criticism about Denzel, but there was one scene in this movie that was so badly acted that I even rewound the movie to see it again because I was laughing at how bad it was. There is a scene right at the beginning of the movie where Denzel "accidently" spills coffee over himself... Accidentally??? He might as well have just poured it over his head. J Haha! It was so blatant that he did it on purpose that he really didn't get away with it... very bad timing and the director should have noticed that and reshot it. Apart from that one moment, Denzel did a good job throughout.The Taking of Pelham 123 has been bled dry really... it was originally a novel by Morgan Freedgood, then made into a film in 1974, then remade in 1998 and then this version was made in 2009. I have not seen any of the other versions yet, but I might watch them if they come on TV.All in all I really enjoyed the movie, but wish so much that Hollywood would stop remaking movies and come up with some new ideas.I give this film 7 out of 10 and I will be buying this on DVD if I find it at a decent price.For more reviews check out my facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incongruous film mechanics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unstoppable is great, a film of perfectly aligned mechanics.Not so here and it's all the difference between a good film and a more or less useless one. It doesn't matter what the plot is about, usually it doesn't. There's a set number of stories you can embellish from anyway. No, it's all about anchors and camera-flow. With Scott, you can always expect an action plot of frantic energy-motion, and another level for the controllers having to administer life-and-death decisions from a distance. Usually we race against the clock. A helo-camera flies over a dozen locations.The notion that Scott likes to tease, is that all of it is happening because we want to see, we want to see a movie about it. In Unstoppable, this was rendered as crowds gathered along the route with cell-phone cameras at hand, as people anxiously watching the news.It's a similar thing here, but has a deeper function. The entire plot depends on people seeing.It depends on our visual culture being so ubiquitous that people are going to see, no matter what, people are going to see the news, panicked watchers are going to cause Wall Street to tumble down. The ransom is only the decoy, only there because the police were going to expect something like that from a hostage plot. But all of it was chaos staged by the bad guy to exploit unstable vision.So the film is shot so that we share perspective with everyone else watching a screen, unstable vision that is, in itself, wanting-to-see. You will note a getaway that is at all possible because the controllers cannot see and instincts fail them.The problem is that Scott wants to work close to the machinery of perception, but has flaky instincts about a story and anchors in a story. One anchor is that we are the people watching this, causing this to happen. It works. The other that he trusted was that we could buy the Washington character on a redemptive journey, the Travolta character on having banked on being able to foresee all of this.It doesn't work, not quite. All of it feels contrived and lazy on that end, for example the gallon of milk scene. The action heroics seem daft. Travolta looks the part but plays it thuggishly. Suddenly, even the ubiquitous flow begins to feel like affectation, because it's not adequately supported inside the drama.The mechanics partly have congruous motion but are off-center, so when they spin they spin all over the place. It's a mildly interesting pain-in-the-ass to watch a film like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was just watching this one on the SHOWCASE CHANNEL here in Canada.I wound up turning it off halfway thru. Normally i have a soft spot for Tony Scott's stuff, but this one is simply over-directed. Seems like Tony was trying too hard.Toooooo many pointless "QUICK ZOOM = INTENSITY" shots, if you know what i mean. It really got annoying when they used the same quick zoom effect 3 times in a row each time they cut to some random extra on the phone.Too bad, cause the actors are in place for a really good movie.Maybe the pressure of directing a remake of such a classic film got to Scott?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perverse Waste of Time and Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of the original I decided to watch this "new" version with an open mind. I guess I expected something a little bit different. This was not to be.For a studio to have actually spent the money to remake this film is perverse. I wonder how many bowls of rice the budget would have bought for the World's starving. This new version ends up being watch-able and even exciting in places but only because almost all of it has been stolen; plot and dialogue (almost word for word). If you never knew that "The Beatles" existed then you'd think that a Beatles cover band was good. Same deal here. You owe it to yourself to give this prolefeed a miss, get the 1974 version and treat yourself to a far superior film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning! Washington and Travolta do a stellar job!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to the theater to see this film I thought it would be another horrible film that got a lot of publicity. I was wrong. This movie was amazing. You were literally on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. I like the fact that Denzel Washington isn't playing his usual character (a man with a gun who can kill everyone), and that he was a normal guy. I like Travolta's character. Travolta doesn't often play a villain, and to see him in this role was amazing. Travolta brings an air to the film that very few actors can achieve. I especially like when Travolta is facing off with Denzel in the end, and when Denzel shoots Travolta the only thing that comes out of his mouth is "Your my hero man." (though Travolta uses different wording) Overall, this is definitely worth watching. One of the better movies of the decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Better Remake Than Might Be Expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original, with Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw in the leads, was a decent crime thriller leavened with humor. A subway car is hijacked by a handful of bandidos who want a load of money from the city and give the dispatcher and the mayor an hour to deliver it in an underground tunnel.This version is a little different. Instead of a military plan with a stern and unyielding Shaw in charge of the hijackers, we have John Travolta acting like a good-natured but mercurial lunatic. The window for the delivery of the ransom money is still inviolable and a couple of hostages are dispatched but Travolta is talkative on the radio, whereas Shaw was taciturn.Matthau's role as dispatcher is altered greatly. Travolta delivers the wisecracks here, not Denzel Washington as the dispatcher. Washington plays it as a reluctant, uncertain bureaucrat with a worried wife at home.If this version lacks Matthau's slouchy humor, it has some crackling exchanges of its own. (Screenwriter Helgeland also wrote L.A. Confidential.) Travolta has demanded that his "buddy" Washington deliver the ransom in person, so the cops prep Washington. They give him a reflective vest, hide a gun in a false compartment of one of the suitcases, tell him to be careful, and ask, "Who did you **** to get this job?" Washington: "Myself." Later, Travolta and Washington sit in the cab of the hijacked car and Travolta asks the dispatcher how his wife reacted to the $38,000 that he recently took as a bribe. "She didn't approve," says Washington, "but then said she'd go along with me." Travolta: "That's true love." Washington: "No, that's marriage. It's a whole different thing." Minus points. I'm getting tired of high contrast, ghoul-green photography. And Tony Scott uses MTV techniques to zap up the pace -- step motion, instantaneous inserts, flashing images -- so the screen goes berserk during action scenes. And when, oh, when, will cameras stop their wobbling? Are the camera operators drunk? And where the original had three of the perps quietly die on screen, they do so extravagantly here. Some are caught in a traffic jam, surrounded by armed police, and they decide to shoot it out. Of course they die, smothered in a slow-motion explosion of squibs, but they deserve to. They hold their pistols sideways, as criminals only do in movies. There's another thing. In a way, it's a stupid movie, with every touch of originality sold out for its commercial value. There are three -count 'em -- three count downs in the movie. Each is spoken aloud while the tension builds. And each stops at the count of "one" just before the dramatic event occurs. I'd have had more respect for the movie if one of them had stopped at "two" -- or even "three."The performances hold up, though, even with newly introduced characters like the NYPD negotiator (John Turturro), and the story runs at speed along the rails with tension at every point. Not as poor as most remakes. Most of them stink beyond endurance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love staying up all night watching movies until four a.m., it was when I viewed the Taking Of Pelham 123 I found out why I liked movies so much. The Taking of Pelham 123 is a remake of the original but the story is still the same but the characters are a little bit different. In the original there was no Ryder, villain who hijacks train, played by John Travolta, but they didn't need him anyway because the villain in the original was fine. Ryder is my favorite character in the whole movie and I rooted for him all the way to the end. John Travolta plays rider perfectly and his performance is truly mesmerizing and should never be forgotten. The Plot in this movie is so simple that a three-year old could understand it. Denzel Washington plays the unlikely hero who negotiates and talk with Ryder throughout the whole movie and he is a important character in the movie. The humor will have you laughing out loud and that mainly comes from Ryder. Every time he says mother**ker, I laughed and laughed and laughed. Tony Scott does an amazing job in directing and I realized right now that he has worked with Denzel quite a few times and that's why Denzel looks comfortable. The bad thing about the film is the two villain sidekicks and they completely bore me to death. It's like they don't even understand what they are doing and instead are prancing around like idiots. The movie was too short and that sucks because it had me captivated so much that I wanted more. It is definitely a must-buy for me! After Ryder and his two friends hijack a train full of hostages, Walter Garber is the unlucky man who is at the wrong place at the wrong time. Ryder demands ten million dollars within one hour and if they don't bring it to him within that time limit, Ryder will start killing people each minute until he gets his money. As the story progresses it looks like that Ryder and Garber form a strange friendship. the truth will be told,people will die, the ride begins.The action is satisfactory but that is all right because the story will have you immersed into a game of cat and mouse. The ending scene does contain lots of action and for the first time you will see the outside for more than thirty seconds. Viewing it in Blu-Ray will make the experience better that it already is. Don't expect too much from this film and believe me when I say that it does not deserve an Oscar. It is nowhere near as good as some other movies. A must watch for people who like movies that have a plot containing hijacking. 8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small group of men hijacks a subway and holds everyone hostage. The city of New York has merely one hour to respond with a ransom. Media quickly responds to it as if it is an act of terror, and the whole country is watching while the Mayor and police tries to resolve the situation.In the middle of it all lands a sympathetic and intelligent dispatcher, Walter Garber (Denzel Washington), who despite of being a complete nobody tries his best to step up and negotiate as the hijackings mastermind Ryder (John Travolta) insists on only talking to him.The setting is good for an interesting story, as Ryder is very Charismatic and he is a complex character which is both good and evil. Which makes him connect with Walter, which at first appears to be his exact opposite. Unfortunately it never really pulls through, and the interesting mix feels like it is carrying too much weight from it's original 1974 version from a time where badguys should be bad, and goodguys should be good. It seems like the actors wants to go in one direction, while the old fashioned story is predetermined to go another.There's plenty of room for twists and turns in the movie, but sadly they never appear. I was in fact surprised by the lack of twists rather than surprised by twists. It all feels a bit outdated, only with some Internet and some cell phones thrown in, but I am sure it was quite fresh back in the '70s.Travolta delivers a pretty good performance though, although his character fails to be believable, it is like it is meant for another story. You'd think that with big actor names the movie would have some spectacular moments, like massive mayhem and destruction CG of some sort, but instead it all looks pretty much budget. They even used some animations with flyovers in Manhattan that seems to be captured from Google Earth. That's something I would expect to find on YouTube.If no big name actors in it, you would never think twice calling this a B-movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>style over content...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The combination Scott/Helgeland worked great during "Man on Fire" not long ago. Therefore I'd expected something good considering. Sadly this time from my point of view both, writer and director, fail to make this project work.Tony Scott has been known as a very style oriented director for some time now. Considering "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" I think he overdid it. His stylish impulses are more distracting than helpful, overpowering the story. Helgeland on the other hand kept the story very much mainstream. So we got a simple storyline packed with IMHO too many style-elements (so it doesn't have much air to breathe). After all I do not see any point in doing this film. There already is a decent adaption of the book. Why waste the money with a hollow one?!In short: Seen from my perspective an uninspired 08/15 Hollywood mainstream adaption. Not terrible but it doesn't seem necessary (that's why my rating is one point lower than it would be if there wasn't any other adaption) and Scott and Helgeland can do much better !!</fullReview>

There are plot holes such as internet access on the hijacked carriage as well as Ryder giving away so much personal information. Nevetheless the script and the frenzy direction elevate this to a high level. Denzel Washington acts convincingly handling the superman that gets to make the right moves in this above-ground climax. Nevertheless the man of the match is John Travolta, that lands his first proper bad-guy role since the movie Face/Off. He clearly gets to show his insanity and his determination. The film is worth a ticket in my view, it's certainly an enjoyable pulse-racer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really bad action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a dog who urinates the tree which is in front of its home, director Tony Scott marks the remake of The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 with his frenetic style, which does not only produce epilepsy in this case, but which also erases all the positive elements from the original film, which is not particularly famous, but is, by my point of view, an excellent thriller with solid performances and a realistic urban "taste".The remake, on the contrary, could not have been more artificial and forced because of its hollow screenplay, irritating edition tricks and an over-the-top drama which replaces the genuine suspense from the original film.On its most basic shape, the screenplay from this film is reduced to an extensive phone conversation between a worker and a kidnapper (the two main characters).Ideally, the force of the characters and the fight of intellects should have been enough for keeping the spectator's interest.But the screenplay is so poor that it is far from getting it, not to mention it also has a lot of peripheral elements which are designed for expanding the story and showing twists.However, none of those things work, because they all feel as irrelevant filler.The screenplay was so weak that I did not care about what was happening.One of the very few things I liked on this film is Denzel Washington's competent performance; I would have liked to see it on a much better movie.John Travolta is horribly exaggerated on his role; he never feels natural at all.As I said before, Scott's edition tricks on this movie are irritating.That technique of film-making reminds me of the comedians who make a lot of fuss, shout and say rudeness while telling a bad joke; some people laugh because of the spectacle; and other ones impatiently wait the conclusion to see if the joke deserves an applause.In movies like this, there are some people who enjoy the visual spectacle, and other people who get tired of so many tricks and hope them to have a point.Well, I belong to the second group of people.As an excellent alternative to this horrible action film, I can recommend the TV mini-series The Kill Point; it also shows the struggle of freeing hostages during an assault (but in a bank instead of a subway), but the intelligent characters development, the solid screenplay and the motivation from the robbers show authentic ingenuity, instead of the absolutely hollow and ridiculous delirium The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 makes us feel with its arbitrary shootouts and tedious chases.This movie is the fourth collaboration between Scott and Washington and it is clearly the worst one, something which explains the magnitude of the problem when one of those collaborations was the tedious Man on Fire.Instead of watching this insipid and terribly boring remake, I suggest you to watch the original film, which is exciting and hugely entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When entering the cinema I expected to see the thrilling and full-of-action movie, having in mind hitherto Tony Scott's great achievements, like Spy Game, Enemy of the State, Crimson Tide.Unfortunately, I found "Pelham" very disappointing.It is a very boring movie, with some ridiculous and thus funny scenes and very "poor" dialogs. There is no action, no Tony Scott-like suspense. The only advantage of this film are some really great actors (Travolta, Washington, Turturro). Nevertheless, due to horrible script, they did not even have an opportunity to present their great acting skills.On the whole, I recommend not to visit cinema to see this movie. It would be less annoying to see 1974 "Pelham" once again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I completed disagree with "C-Younkin from United States".I'd rather watch Swordfish or Passenger 57 which are better movies. I was expecting something different with a twist ending but there isn't anything special about this movie.I've seen many movies in my lifetime and I don't understand how someone can write a good review about this movie. This movie has been done before.Here is the real synopsis: An average Joe is working as a subway dispatcher when he encounters a hostage situation. The 'bag guy' {relative} demands 10 million dollars. Obviously there are snipers/cops that will surround the parameter so where else does a subway have to go - straight. You can predict the rest. The subway takes off and it eventually stops at an expected stop area. They bad guys rig the subway to place it in auto-pilot while they get off with D. Washington, the 'good guy'. They escape through a hotel and D. Washington, who I remind you is just an average Joe, decides to follow the bad guy by stealing a truck and luckily following a can in downtown traffic (how original). He eventually catches up to the bad guy after calling 911 and shoots the 'bad guy'. The end.There is nothing original about this movie. Again, I'd rather watch the aforementioned movies or a movie like Arlington Road that has an ending with a twist.Don't waste your money on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wifey and I finally got another chance to hit the movies this week, and made "The Taking of Pelham 123" our choice to see. I didn't know much about it going in, but the 30second trailer seemed to lay it out pretty clearly.The film is about a crazy finance guy called Ryder (Travolta, in his best work since "Look Who's Talking") who takes a train over and therefore a bunch of hostages. He soon gets onto train dispatcher Garber (Washington) and explains the situation and demands. Ryder gets comfortable with Garber and deals with him instead of the traditional hostage negotiator (played by John Turturro, from "Mr Deeds"). Ryder wants $10mil in an hour or he'll kill a hostage every minute they are late. Will Garber and the city save the day? See it to find out.Reasonably enjoyable, except it dragged a little in the second half due to the confusing end. Some good dialogue and Washington and Travolta are excellent. Shot really well as you'd expect from a Tony Scott movie. Pretty decent as action films go.*Not a great choice to take a 2 week old baby to as we did, due to the loud noises and potty mouth of Travolta's character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated summer gem that might not be astounding but a solid action thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham 123 is one of those films that seems to get a lot of backlash and some people love it and others ignore it or even hate it and I always wonder why it doesn't do better than it does. This film is a terrific thriller with some great performances, award worthy? No definitely not, but it still entertains and keeps you on the edge of your seat and is the perfect distraction for an hour and a half. There is nothing wrong with that!! Director Tony Scott is something of a legend of course and has done some amazing films and in my opinion has done some real stinkers but his style is almost always the same. He films like a chaotic moving freight train (no pun intended) and sometimes it works better than other times. The story is simplistic and solid and doesn't try to complicate anything which sometimes when a story is simple it makes people dislike it but sometimes it also makes an entertaining movie. Considering most of the film takes place in the communication room for the subway and on the subway itself everything moves perfectly. The film is also gritty and violent while the language in the film is (as pointed out by other reviewers) gratuitous.Denzel Washington takes the lead role in the third Tony Scott film for him. I used to enjoy Washington in all his roles but over the last few years I find his performances bloated and egotistical but finally in this film of all things he tones it down and gives a far better and more balanced performance that makes us forget he is Denzel and that he is meek Subway employee Walter Garber. John Travolta gives a powerful performance as Ryder who goes through a variety of character flaws and moments. One moment you're terrified of him and the next you feel sympathy and you wonder how his character will turn in the end. He's definitely a multi-faceted character and you don't know a lot about him. James Gandolfini is decent as the mayor although he doesn't get a lot of chance to really give a lot with the character. Character actor Luis Guzmán also has a small role as a joint conspirator with Travolta's Ryder. This film definitely is not about the supporting cast. It's about the barrage of banter between superstars Washington and Travolta and that works for the most part. I'm not saying its enough but it works.Despite my comment that the plot is simple there is definitely a decent sub plot involving Garber and a potential scandal and the indirect relationship between Garber and Ryder keeps the pace of the film strong. Basically this is one of those movies that won't for a moment last in the minds of most and it'll be written off in the summer heap of hits but I recommend you ignoring the bad press and the poor box office turn out and check this film out because it will entertain above all else and that is what movies should be all about. If you're looking for a solid thriller, action, some very violent scenes then you won't need to look elsewhere. You will enjoy it!! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, could have been great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't watched either of the other versions of this story, nor read the novel. The trailers promised cool-ness, a hijacking, and Travolta and Washington in the leads. It delivered that and more. The stylized bits are awesome, with bad-ass music and nifty visuals, and it never goes overboard, and there aren't too many of them, either. This wastes no time getting to the "taking" that the title promises, and it holds the tension nicely a lot of the way. At a certain point, that I won't detail because it would spoil it, it kind of loses the initial excitement and "wow" factor, and it doesn't fully regain it after that. Don't get me wrong, there are thrilling moments throughout. This has excellent cinematography and editing, they may be argued to be flashy, but I disagree, they're that way for a reason, and it works. It's not distracting. Tony didn't "Man on Fire" out on this one. The production value is incredible. Every acting performance is spot-on. There is a child, it is given a couple of lines, and it isn't obnoxious! Whoever made that happen deserves a promotion, an Oscar, some reward. However, it's not all positive. What characterization there is, is well-done, meanwhile, should there maybe have been additional roles fleshed out? In fact, that's not the only area where it feels like they're building towards something, only to abandon it completely later. Here's my theory as to what happened: They intended for this to avoid clichés entirely, and that wound up biting them you know where in the long run. Yes, there are definite surprises in this, when it goes against what we expect, and it most certainly isn't as bad as in Paul W.S. Anderson's flicks, if the anti-climaxes are still felt. I'd say Helgeland was trying to repeat the success of Payback. That went against the conventional route, and it was an impeccable piece. Only, that was an original twist("I just want my money") on the old "guy's been wronged, wants to get even" plot. I think the problem here is, you can boil this movie down to a formulaic concept. Where's the new angle? You can't do a standard hostage situation story, especially in Hollywood, avoiding all the infamous stereotypes, and entirely avoid backlash. When something is repeated time and again, there's a reason. The way you always see the handsome hero solve the crisis we've seen before isn't so familiar simply because no one has bothered to think of an alternate way to do it. It's also because it, at least at one point, made sense, to at least some extent. You can't always get away with going against the flock, especially when you're retelling what we've all heard a thousand times before. This feature, overall, is interesting. It's fairly effective, and it's entertaining. Well-made. I didn't feel cheated out of a fun time at the cinema. It is perhaps not wholly unpredictable. There is plenty of strong language, and a moderate amount of graphic and bloody violence. I recommend this to any fan of the genres. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes are normally sad affairs but, by most accounts (I missed the 1974 original), this one is more exciting than the original. Of course, it's in the hands of British director Tony Scott whose utterly frenetic style is such than he rarely makes one cut when he can impose three and, for this style of thriller, Scott's energy and excitement work well, providing us with a genuinely entertaining ride. The two-hour movie opens strong and maintains a breathless pace, so the final few minutes are uncharacteristically slow and weak.John Travolta is commanding as the leader of the gang who take over a New York subway train, whereas charismatic Denzel Washington is somewhat low-key in this performance as a senior rail manager temporarily required to act as a controller. James Gandolfini as the mayor and John Turturro are fine, if underused, in the support roles. The original plot is followed closely except that the ransom demand is raised from $1M to ?10M and broadband communication makes a useful contribution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie in terms of it being a good, Saturday night popcorn movie. Not the case, I'm afraid. The plot was predictable and the characters - despite the best efforts of Washington and Travolta - were one-dimensional. Normally when a film concentrates on a hostage scenario then we find out a little about the people involved and that can sometimes give rise to some interesting sub-plots. Not so. It was simply Denzel and John having a chat with a few folk getting shot. If you like subways then this may be the movie for you but if you like your Saturday night movie packed with excitement, thrills and some cheesy humour then don't take the Pelham 1,2,3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Matthau/Shaw version but it was many years ago, so I'm not going to make a comparison - I'm taking this version on its own merits.It's a good thriller, filled with incident from start to finish. The hijack/ransom plot is enhanced by a couple of sideways tweaks, one involving Washington's character's demotion, the other involving Travolta's character's real motive.There were several elements I didn't care for. One - there is a lot of bad language and, with the exception of one good gag as Washington moves towards the train, much of it is completely gratuitous. Two, for a large part of the early stages of the movie the camera is constantly tracking round and round in circles, to the extent that I started to feel dizzy after a while. Three, I can't believe that these subway experts, covering every exit, forgot about the disused one.Washington and Travolta are both very good, but neither strays very far from archetypes they have already established in a number of other movies - Washington is the fundamentally decent everyman and Travolta is the nutjob scenery-chewing criminal. Both have a lot of fun.My quibbles weren't enough to spoil my enjoyment - this is a movie which holds your attention throughout and leaves you satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1973,a novel about a subway car hijacking,called 'The Taking Of Pelham One,Two,Three',by an author named John Godey was published,and the following year,was made into a big budget film staring Walter Matheau. In 1998,an ill fated TV remake was released &amp; fell into a black hole in space,pretty much forever. In 2009,Tony Scott directed a re-re-make of this nail biting psychological thriller,this time staring Denzil Washington &amp; John Travolta,with a script by Brian Helgeland,based on the original novel. I saw the 1974 original (but not until years later at a video get together at a friend's house),and admired it somewhat. When I heard that a remake was promised for sometime in 2009,I thought, I wonder if it'll be up to the same standards of the original. Well, I can now say that it,for the most part,worked. A disgruntled Wall Street financier,who made some bad choices that ended him up in a jail term,named Ryder (Travolta),with the help of others,hijacks a New York subway car &amp; demands millions,as restitution for jail time. A former engineer,turned office flunky,named Walter Gruber (Denzil Washington)tries to reason with Ryder to turn over the hostages. What follows is a cat and mouse thriller that will have most at the edge of their seats. John Turturro shines (as usual)as a high profile cop who tries to deal with Ryder on his own terms. James Gandolfini (The Sopranos)has some nice screen time as the Mayor of New York. My only real complaint about this version of the film is that director Tony Scott (Top Gun),can't seem to rise above the usual Hollywood bombast that seems to be the centre of just about every Hollywood blockbuster (did there really have to be as many car crashes depicted as there was?). Okay as Saturday night fodder for the action/adventure crowd,but I would not want to make a career out of too many films like it. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains pervasive strong language, and some point blank execution style violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make a Stop at this Subway Movie action delight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And a 1, and a 2, and a 3! Here we go: 5 dollar, 5 dollar, 5 dollar footlong. Oops! Wrong Subway intro! The subway intro I meant to refer to was the action thriller remake "The Taking of Pelham 123"; although this redux is definitely worth more than $5. John Travolta stars as deranged madman Ryder who with his team of hijackers takeover the New York City subway Pelham 123. Denzel Washington co-stars as Walter Garber, the tranquil dispatcher who Ryder communicates with to obtain his demands. Supporting roles are nicely turned out by John Turturro playing the overconfident hostage negotiator Carmonetti, and James Gandolfini playing the New York City Mayor. But the ultimate faceoff of "The Taking of Pelham 123" is primarily between the hypocritical religious zealot Ryder and the everyday New York City man Garber. Like what happened on September 11, 2001, Poor Walter had no idea on what started as a routine New York City day was later going to deliver. Ryder is portrayed as a vengeful "man with a plan" who will stop at nothing for nobody to derail his subway takeover in order to take retribution on the New York bureaucracy &amp; the city itself; and also be on the right track to obtain his financial demands. Beam Me Up Scotty! Seasoned action Director Tony Scott listened to my request by beaming up the suspenseful action of "The Taking of Pelham 123". There were not too many mundane scenes in the film. The action pace of "The Taking of Pelham 123" was for the taking! My only cinematic demand to Director Scott on the film was to extend the character of Ramos (one of Ryder's men) who was very intriguing but yet underdeveloped; and what a showcase it would have been for fantastic character actor Luis Guzman who portrayed Ramos. Brian Helgeland's screenplay did a have a few verbal subway stops that were irrelevant, but its strength was on the verbal interaction between Ryder and Garver, so it was far from being a written train wreck. Travolta's maniacal thespian performance as Ryder was a bit over the top, but nevertheless quite "popcorn entertainment" enjoyable. Washington did not "dis" his acting proficiency as dispatcher Garber. So for much of the aforementioned, I think you should be in the viewing taking of "The Taking of Pelham 123". **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with rating a movie with a five here at IMDb is that your comment slash review probably isn't going to be seen by a lot of people, since people usually search these comments with the criteria of either loved it or hated it. But . . . an average movie is an average movie. What's with Johm Travolta trying to play the bad guy again? He did it in a couple of John Woo films and pulled it off quite successfully as a smarmy bad guy in a Quentine Tarintino film, but do any of us fear Vinnie Babarino? I know I saw the original Taking of the Pelham in the movies when I was like seven years old or something and I have to admit the only part I remember is when they viciously killed one of the hostages, but I doubt I'll remember anything thirty or forty years from now from this version. Okay, I have been known to try to invest in a few stock market schemes here and there, and I truly want to know how these guys turned 2 million into 200 million by hijacking a subway train. I just didn't get that part at all. Trust me, I watched this movie twice just to make sure, and it was okay, average, a five star movie at most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but left me wondering...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the movie don't read. For having most of the movie take place in an MTA station and a single subway car, I thought Scott did a great job of keeping the audience's attention. I know the Ryder's character 'related' to Walter's character, but why did he need him to pull the trigger, and why did he give up so easy. After all that planning he and his men didn't really have an exit strategy once they got to the Roosevelt station. Everything else was so well planned and to the money, but he knew when he'd be reaching the station, why such an unplanned moment? Anyway, with the exception of that, really dug the movie, but that just left me saying, 'mmm, is that the best they can do for the ending?" and did he really want to get caught to pay his debt or death to God? And why? He did his time in prison. So to me, even though Travolta's acting was excellent and compelling, some of his motivations ? besides driving up the price of Gold and profiting from it - were not clear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lapses in Credibility Derail The Second Remake of "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the second remake of "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3," the latest version starring Denzel Washington and John Travolta manages to be a slick and suspenseful white-knuckler. Nevertheless, this glossy new epic with its numerous narrative changes doesn't surpass director Joseph Sargent's 1974 original that toplined Walter Matthau &amp; Robert Shaw. "Top Gun" director Tony Scott and Oscar-winning "L.A. Confidential" scenarist Brian Helgeland have cherry picked scenes and ideas from both author John Godey's bestselling novel and Sargent's original. Sadly, Scott and Helgeland have altered irreparably the characters of hero and villain in the name of political correctness. Not only have they changed the hero from a Transit Authority lieutenant to a corrupt subway employee, but they have also altered the villain from an out-of-work mercenary to a sleazy Wall Street crook.Furthermore, the second remake of "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" suffers from a dire lack of credibility. Denzel Washington's last minute transformation from a non-violent subway dispatcher to a gun-toting crusader who can commandeer a vehicle so he can pursue the villain isn't persuasive enough to pass muster. Additionally, the new technology that the film features is marginal when you consider either what Scott and Helgeland have omitted or ignored as solid story elements. Mind you, Scott generates more than enough tension to make you put you on the edge of yours seat while the villains hold hostages, but the surprises are few and far between in this R-rated actioneer. Consequently, we have a tainted hero who isn't a professional like Walter Matthau's Transit Cop in the original. Incidentally, I missed the 1989 made-for-TV remake with "Miami Vice" star James Edward Olmos. Anyway, an ordinary guy is now the hero, while the villain is an egotistical lout. Happily, actor John Travolta delivers a strong, wholly believable performance as the unhinged maniac who planned this hijacking.As Garber's murderous adversary, Ryder (John Travolta) is two weeks out of prison with a tattoo on his neck, a bandit mustache, and a willingness to blow the brains out of hostages at point blank range. He is an ex-Wall Street broker who tampered with the city of New York's pension fund, and he is using the hijacking incident to play the stock market for bigger gains. Helgeland has concocted some good ideas, such as Ryder's stock market scheme, but he has provided some bad things, too. For example, heroic subway dispatcher Walter Garber (Denzel Washington of "Man on Fire") is suspected of accepting a $35-thousand dollar bribe during a business trip to Japan and has been demoted. The day that Ryder (John Travolta of "Wild Hogs") occupies the eponymous subway train with his three fellow conspirators and demands $10-million from NYC, Garber is working as the dispatcher. Ryder contacts him and makes his demands. When Garber's supervisor relieves him, Ryder threatens to kill a hostage if they don't recall Garber. Ryder simply doesn't trust anybody, but he believes Garber because the latter admitted that he took a bribe in the presence of eye-witnesses.The villains, a quartet of submachine gun toting goons, hijack the subway train and stop it in the middle of a busy tunnel. They disconnect all the cars from the engine car and let the motorman and the passengers trudge back to the last platform. A cop tries to intervene as the transfer is going down, and the badguys riddle him with a hail of bullets. Now, the badguys hold the 17 passengers and the conductor from the first car, shut the power off to the tracks, and establish their own wireless access so that they can monitor the Internet as news about them develops in the city. During this interval, Ryder surfs the web and discovers that Garber has been accused of bribery.One of Helgeland's bad ideas is a teenage passenger with a lap-top computer. When Ryder brings the subway train to a jarring halt, the computer flies out of the kid's hands and slides underneath the seats across the aisle from him. The kid can clearly see his idiotic girlfriend on the 16-inch monitor begging to know what has happened. Initially, after the train halts, the Internet connection between the kid and his girlfriend is disrupted. Later, after the villains establish power so that Ryder can monitor the stock market, the kid's lap-top comes back on-line. Eventually, the girlfriend arranges things up so that her boyfriend's computer is streaming live video from the train that apparently nobody else but the cops can view. Moreover, Ryder's cretinous cohorts patrol the aisle but cannot spot a lap-top computer with its glowing picture screen. Talk about a serious lapse in credibility! Naturally, everything above ground goes amok in New York City. The unhappy NYC mayor (James Gandolfini of "The Sopranos") rushes to the subway command center to assure Ryder that New York will pay the ransom. Incredibly, the city has a short length of time to count the cash and deliver by police couriers with motorcycle patrolmen blocking intersections across the city as the couriers race as breakneck speed. At one point, an accident occurs and the courier vehicle is smashed and sent flying off a bridge to crash into on-coming traffic in the lanes under the bridge! Scott does a good job of ramping up the action and keeping things tense both above and below ground as Ryder's clock ticks to a dangerous deadline. Travolta makes a solid villain, unstable as all get-out, but Robert Shaw was better in the first film. Prepare yourself for a great deal of profanity in "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" and several violent shoot-outs, especially one street shoot-out where two men perish in a barrage of gunfire. Altogether, Scott's "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" isn't a bad movie, but it isn't half as good as Joseph Sargent's original nail-biter. If you haven't seen the 1974 original, then you don't know what you are missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Enough Thriller, But Nothing New</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Taking of Pelham 123" 2009 is a good enough thriller. You've got all the necessary ingredients: a flawed good guy, Denzel Washington's Walter Garber, facing off with a scary but charismatic bad guy, John Travolta's Ryder. You've got high stakes: innocent hostages will be killed if Garber fails to deliver a ten million dollar ransom. You've got the technical aspects of a hostage situation: how to manipulate a subway train, hostage negotiators, the mayor and his role. You've got a touch of "contemporary relevance": a salute to Wall Street's woes.Yes, the movie is gripping while it's on the screen, but there is nothing new here, not only nothing new for the genre, but also nothing new for the actors. We've seen the flawed good man singlehandedly facing off against bad guys and thus proving his mettle; "High Noon" anyone? We've seen Travolta play the scary bad guy before: "Face Off," etc. We've seen Denzel be decent and tormented by demons (too many films to mention.) James Gandolfini, as New York's mayor, John Turturro, as a hostage negotiator, Luis Guzman, hidden behind a bandaged nose, and Michael Rispoli as Washington's coworker, are all interesting actors who are given absolutely nothing to do. Their wasted screen time is obvious, slows the movie down, and is frustrating. None of the hostages are given any life, including two who are provided with a few more character details than others. The audience can't much care when they are violently slaughtered. It's as if the filmmakers only had time and attention for Washington and Travolta.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whats the deal with Travolta and Wall Street?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm confused about travolta being involved in wall street, and why towards the end when he gets in the taxi cab and checks his laptop he has over 350,000,000? Maybe i missed something or maybe because i live in louisiana and i don't know much about wall street. All that aside i thought this movie was really good. I really liked the fast paced camera shots and the editing. I also love to see travolta play a villain. His performance was a little better than denzels in my opinion even though denzel is one of my favorite actors of all time. I've also grown to love tony scott/denzel washington films. I think they collaborate perfectly and have a really good understanding of the direction they both want to take their films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trouble on the line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Scott's lively, moderately engaging new blockbuster starring John Travolta as the villain and Denzel Washington as the tarnished hero is a remake of Joseph Sargent's 1974 actioner featuring Robert Shaw and Walter Matthau. Both concern a group of ex-cons who commandeer a New York subway train car on the Number 6 (Lexington Avenue) line, holding the passengers hostage for ransom money. In both cases it's a calm MTA hub dispatcher who negotiates with the lead hijacker. The city is supposed to cough up a large sum, a million then and ten million now, and the chief bad guy proves himself willing to carry out his threat to kill a hostage for every minute the delivery's past the 60-minute deadline. If Sargent's movie is a relic of a grimier New York and dated Seventies film-making, Scott's, with its pumped up visual style, obsession with money and financial markets, and somewhat tacky exploitation of the idea of a terrorist scare, is just as likely to read in future as an artifact of our era.Scott has a tendency to get too kinetic and he threatens to go over the top right away in a blurry, over-edited opening sequence that, however, serves narrative purposes efficiently as it cleverly sets up the hijacking and establishes the personalities of the two principals before the opening credits are even done. Not surprising if you've been to the movies in the past decade or so that here everything is more gonzo -- bigger, louder, faster, more expensive and more technologically complicated, with helicopters buzzing overhead, computer screens large and small flashing a mile a minute, and hundreds of cops and cop cars with a 'Death Race' style rush to get the cash across town from a Federal Reserve building to the track where Travolta's holding his victims. As so often in today's actioners, all-out efforts to get the bad guys are so violent they seem to cause more casualties (and, as in Will Smith's boorish superhero derring-do in 'Hitchcock') more loss of property by far than the actual crime. The New York subway system is, however, accurately portrayed this time in all its remarkable modern complexity.This is a different bad guy. While Shaw was a cool, calculating Brit, Travolta is a loose canon from Jersey with a prison-tattooed neck and volleys of obscenity-laced anger whose origins, while obscure, seem to trace back to a great and deviously satiated lust for Wall Street wealth. It's a explosive performance full of disturbing and inexplicable venom but little nuance. The dispatch man, however, is cool and collected this time too, as in 1974. Somebody's got to be. Political updating requires a philandering, market-savvy rich-guy New York mayor (James Gandolfini, in a good suit), and this one, who disavows doing a Giuliani, gets taken a tiny bit more seriously than the old Pelham mayor, who was stuck at home with a cold.Sargent's 'Pelham' captured the tarnished down-and-dirty of its era's NYC, fitting it on an honorable shelf with the likes of 'The French Connection,' 'Klute,' 'Born to Win,' 'Dog Day Afternoon,' 'The Warriors,' and 'Taxi Driver.' It's blaxploitation-style score reminds us this is the area of Quentin Tarantino's inspiration: the crook's anonymous monikers as Messers Blue, Gray, Green and Brown of course can't be reused in Brian Helgeland's new script because the device is too famous from the way it was exploited in Reservoir Dogs. These violent wretches wouldn't have time for such niceties anyway. And an accidental video feed and free use of databases allows the good guys to identify the two main perps while the crime is in progress.For all its references to the city and to Brooklyn and Jersey, this reincarnation, by Brit Tony Scott, doesn't do much to capture a distinctive New York feel as the old 'Pelham' does. Much time is spent instead on updated technology. Travolta manages to make wi-fi available down under, and before the heist begins a kid called Geo (Alex Kaluzhsky) has already been (somewhat implausibly) engaged in intimate online audio-visual chatting with his girlfriend on his laptop.Helgeland clunkily injects complexity into the role of Garber (Washington) by making him a self-made man from admin who's been demoted on suspicion of taking a bribe from Japanese train car manufacturers, and there's stagey praying and talk of Catholicism and confessionals. This is (in both versions) a story about a humble operative who manages to save the day when top level guys might have failed. Italian-American Travolta ironically addresses hostage negotiator John Turturro only as "Greaseball," refusing to talk to him. Turturro's supercilious manner makes him impossible to believe as a negotiator; there are plenty more implausibilities added into this more frantic version. Nonetheless, perhaps surprisingly, the new movie follows through the basic action plot line to the same finale as the original's.Compare this to 'Dog Day Afternoon' (for example), that superb vehicle for Al Pacino at his most virtuosic, and you'll see a shortcoming of both versions, which goes back to John Godey's source novel. Despite information about hijacker and negotiator, they remain essentially generic, without complex back stories. Above all Travolta's motivation remains unclear. What is he really trying to do? And for all his vitriolic verbiage, does he even care?Scott is best known for loud fast action movies like 'Top Gun' and blockbuster star vehicles like 'Crimson Tide' (Gene Hackman) and 'Enemy of the State' (Will Smith). But his best job was to shoot faithfully and with panache Tarantino's terrifically enjoyable extravaganza 'True Romance,' including a pre-"Sopranos" Gandolfini in a memorable cameo, not to mention classic turns by Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, even Brad Pitt. For once Scott had a great screenplay and didn't get in its way. Neither writing nor directing in this 'Pelham' remake remotely approaches that level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long awaited, but disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of Pehlam hit the big screen today and was not worth all the hype it's received. The plot follows the same formula as it's predecessor, but has neither the polish or sophistication.What was originally an action/adventure flick in 1974 has now become a droning talkathon between it's two main characters Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) and psychopath "Ryder" (John Travolta). They engage in a numbing exchange that will have you slumping in your seat in short order.Granted, the script is passable, but I think most viewers were expecting more action and excitement, rather than verbal judo and will be sorely disappointed.In the 1974 version Walter Matthau was self assured and confident while Robert Shaw cold and calculating. The two characters complemented each other. Now we have Washington as a panic stricken 'what do I do now' type and Travolta a homicidal lunatic who occasionally blasts a passenger just to rouse us from our slumber.As far as character development, there is none. We don't care about the hostages because they are strangers to us throughout. Even the other hijackers are just props wandering about the set while Washington and Travolta engage in small talk.The two high points of the movie are when the subway car is unleashed for a high speed ride after being abandoned by the hijackers and the killing of two of the hijackers in a volley of bullets reminiscent of The Wild Bunch. Other than that, the flick is pretty tame.One glaring error sure to be noticed by todays savvy viewers is when Garber is handed a gun by a cop who then demonstrates the manual safety, incorrectly at that. Later the gun morphs into the type with no manual safety. Oh well, that's Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Bad As I Anticipated But...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...it lacks two things that made the original a brilliant film: the gallows humor and the taste of New York.The dialog of the original 1974 film was snarky, sardonic, and filled with irony and a touch of film noir. While there was swearing in the original, it was realistic and not over the top. The repeated use of the f- and mf-words in the current version add nothing to the tension and merely make us think the writer had no further motive beyond making this story more appealing to a less educated audience.The original gave us a sea of characters -- major and minor -- to sink our teeth into. The passengers were New York stereotypes we all knew: Hookers, a pimp, an activist, an executive, a passed-out drunk, a sharp senior, a mother and her two boys, and gave them an ethnic mix realistic for the city. The passengers have so little dialog we get no real sense of that in the current version. What is perhaps most disturbing about this remake is the degree to which the violence acted out in front of the passengers appears not to affect the 8-year-old boy. How realistic is this, even today? Travolta's Ryder is the only one of the criminals to have any character development; the others barely have dialog and we lose the conflict between them, which made the original story have more tension.The focus of this version is the mind game played entirely between Garber and Ryder, with questionable assistance from Camonetti. There is no conflict between the mayor and his staff, no sarcastic humor about the city's financial issues and no conflict regarding the mayor's vulnerable position with his city. While I like James Gandolfini very much I feel that the NYC mayor of this story should have resembled Rudi Giuliani in both appearance and attitude. I was expecting him to want to get tougher with the hijackers.Updating the story to include modern technology and equally modern motives and methods for committing this crime was to be expected and that worked. It gave an interesting twist for Ryder's motive for the crime. However, the writers didn't research the subway well: Any New Yorker knows the Lexington Avenue line does not go to Coney Island. Decent performances by Washingtonn and Travolta combine with the updated look to move this film along for a generation who weren't yet born when the brilliant original came out. The hyper-kinetic chases emphasize the critical nature of the situation, but do not provide information or character nuance. Finally, the music provided no New York flavor, but only the hostility of Ryder as he planned and committed this crime. The score of the original expressed the kinetic energy of New York, the movement of the train, and the story dynamic. I got no sense of these things from it here.If you've never seen the original, watch this one first, then watch the original with Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. When you compare the above items and the two endings, you'll see why the original -- for all its dated appearance -- is the superior film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Travolta puts Pelham over the top: best heist film in decades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't love all of Tony Scott's direction, except for the wonderful Domino (2005),Crimson Tide (1995), True Romance (1993), and of course, Top Gun (1986).I do love all of Denzel Washington's work, including The Great Debaters (2007), American Gangster (2007), Training Day (2001), Crimson Tide (1995) and Malcolm X (1992). I think he is better in this than Inside Man (2006), although the parts are very similar. I also like him better in this than Deja Vu (2006) and the predictable Man on Fire (2004).But it is the wonderful performance of John Travolta that puts Pelham 123 over the top. He is wonderful in Be Cool (2005, Chili Palmer again!), Swordfish (2001), The General's Daughter (1999), Primary Colors (1998, as Bill Clinton), Phenomenon (1996), Broken Arrow (1996), Get Shorty (1995, Chili Palmer), Pulp Fiction (1994), Look Who's Talking series (1989, 1990, 1993), Blow Out (1981), Urban Cowboy (1980), Grease (1978), and of course, Saturday Night Fever (1977).I saw Star Trek and X-Men: Wolverine. I did not see the 1974 version. This action thriller is better: the script is tighter, the dialogue more realistic and integral to the plot, the pace, although not fast, never lets up, there is a lot less fake CGI imagery, and of course, terrorism is never far from the news these days. This is the best heist film I have seen in decades.I rate it 10 dollars ? worth seeing in the movie theaters, certainly worth renting. I am not a movie buyer - only a few movies that I want to watch often enough to own (U-571, Master &amp; Commander, Total Recall) -but it maybe worth owning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to Cinema last night to see The Taking of Pelham 123 starring Denzel Washington and John Travolta with John Turturo (Transformers/O Brother Where Art Thou) and James Gandolfini (Sopranos) also in the cast. Directed by Tony Scott (Enemy of The State - Top Gun - The Last Boy Scout etc) so you know what you are going to get - flashy camera work - loud action music - car crashes and explosions but hey what is wrong with that on a Saturday night and who does them better? The original film starred Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw and was much more slow paced, building the suspense up patiently and I loved it. This one follows the same lines, basically a New York subway hostage/ransom situation with Washington the good guy and Travolta the bad guy. The leads are both brilliantly played with Travolta seeming to particularly enjoy his role. Not a straight remake and highly recommended even if you have seen the original - great way to spend a Saturday night for us guys and even the wives and girlfriends will not complain!</fullReview>

I don't mind bad writing sometimes, as when I go to what I know is going to be a "B" movie. This thought was really disappointing. And I have major quibbles: 1. There's a hostage situation on a train that has been stopped on the tracks. And yet express trains keep whizzing by. The MTA would have stopped all traffic in both directions on both local and express tracks. 2. At one point, someone announces that all intersections are clear between Brooklyn and Midtown. And yet cars are wrecked, motorcycles go flying, and the ransom is delayed. I could come up with more, but my head hurts remembering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually re-makes seem to be very pale compared to the original. This new take on THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3(ONE TWO THREE)is kick ass super unleaded. The 1974 version starred Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw and Martin Balsam. Of course, pretty tame up against John Travolta leading a small group of armed men who hijack a New York City subway train and holding passengers hostage for a small fortune. Denzel Washington is the dispatcher that tries to talk sense with mastermind Travolta. Most of the movie is their banter back and forth; and for a bad guy, Travolta has an edgy sense of humor.A terrific car crash scene. And real suspenseful face to face with Washington and Travolta. The finale is well choreographed and the movie's pace fuels anxiety. Possibly Travolta's best character in a long time. An action movie that has everything you want. Others in the cast: John Turturro, James Gandolfini and Luis Guzman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a true "FILM" its well made, and its based on a top quality script, and the BEST acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't want to comment too much about the film, as words cannot do justice to the well rounded film "the taking of Pelham 123" Simply if you love films that are realistic, and are good films because of theirs script, and solely the acting, then this is the perfect film. It is based on a novel but is well expanded upon to be made into this film. I've heard there have been 2 other versions of this film, but haven't seen either. Judging this film solely on itself, I must say it is extremely well written script. There is very little plot holes, there is maybe one involving a laptop, but I wont say anymore as its just a tiny inconsistency.But what really makes this film, for me at least, is the acting, considering John travolta hasn't made a particularly highlighted good film in years, I must say he is back on form in this film, he plays a crazed care free politically criminal who hijacks the train with intentions to not only make money, but to make a statement about the politics and standing of himself and the citizens and the way they are treated, obviously this is all twisted to support his own cause, but what criminal doesn't. He leaves you liking the criminal, but also with a loathing feeling because of his "no mercy" attitude. But an extremely good portrayal and enjoyable performance by John travolta, definitely one of the highlights of the movie.Denzel Washington, not much needs to be said about this mans acting ability, he plays a slightly overweight older character, who is fairly insignificant, he's not an ex-cop or any sort of hero, but is an everyday citizen, that gets dragged into this situation, and becomes an everyday hero, once again he is likable and thorough in his performance, also an extreme joy to watch on the big screen.The chemistry between the two actors is top quality, and the script and direction by tony Scott once again flawless in its thoroughly and conviction. A great film without going over the top with explosions, and trying to make a big statement, lets the acting and script talk for itself, and prove it to be a quality film. No less than what you expect form 3 movie proved men, this film owes itself to Denzel Washington, John travolta and Tony Scott, the scriptwriters and novelist also need praise for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful photographic effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Could possibly get the Razzie for the worst photography in the most incredible scenery in the world. Hand held, zip this way, rip that way, jiggle, flash, focus, unfocus, ............. what is wrong with the director and his photographer and film editor. Absolutely spoiled the film for the headache causing no end of nonsense of jiggle and spinning camera work.Otherwise rent the original, much better use of time and money. Sorry Denzel, John, John and James.We went on a matinée with a group of viewers who wanted to enjoy this movie, but all commented on the terrible photographic "effects".One could tear apart the screen writing and the gaps in the story and the never ending car and motorcycle crashes. John Trav and John Tort deserve more. So did we.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was fantastic! I recently watched the original film with Walter Matthau and was worried that I was not going to enjoy this one. I think that Travolta plays an even bigger bad ass than when he was Castor Troy playing Sean Archer in Face Off. Great performance once again to Denzel Washington. I don't think he is capable of doing a bad job. There are quite a few minor things that they changed from the original film, but nothing they did takes away from the experience. The main change of the movie is the role of Garber. (Denzel Washington) In the original film, Garber is a veteran detective trying to capture the hijackers. The new version Garber is simply a transit dispatcher in the wrong place at the wrong time. If you pay close attention you will pick up several tributes to the original film. The reason I did not give this film a 10 out of 10 is because of the dialog. There are enough "f bombs" to compete with Goodfellas or Casino when they could of simply said something else. I am not one to censor movies, but the phrase mother "f" is used too many times by Travolta when he could of cursed in a different phrase and gotten the same reaction. I do think that Travolta will get a nomination or at least a head nod for his performance. It really was a great performance and all this happened around the same time his son was killed. I hope he doesn't win because of his son, but I do think he deserves recognition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well it's the Taking of Pelham 123, now with more Tony Scott! yeah...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more I think about this "new-and-improved Joker product" of a Hollywood summer popcorn flick for the R-rated crowd, Taking of Pelham 123, the less I think of it. If I end up comparing it a bit much to the original 1974 adaptation of John Godoy's thriller, then it's because, in my sort of humble opinion, it's because it's inferior to the original. It's not that it's entirely a "bad" movie. It wasn't made with incredibly poor intentions. Just the ones that, no pun intended, keep the wheels of the train moving along for the money-makers that need to pilfer what is already fine and dandy on the video shelves. It's an ultimately unnecessary take on a tidy-but-way above average 70s *sleeper* (look it up) about hijackers on a subway line and the back-and-forth negotiating that ensues.And some of the blame can be put on Tony Scott and new writer Brian Hegeland's shoulders. Scott is a director that, for me, is all over the place; he can deliver some excellent material (True Romance, Crimson Tide), genre material that is decent, sometimes very good, but not memorable (Enemy of the State, Man of Fire), or just total pig manure (Domino). And Brian Hegeland, also writer on Man on Fire, their previous remake collaboration, has had his good days. But what they set out to do on Taking of Pelham 123 is to not go back to the book and take another stab at familiar material, as they did with trippy and bloody glee on MOF. They go back to the original movie and decide "let's make THIS hipper, and that a little more 'deep', and add complexity where it need not be and strip this here and there of some solid satire - oh, and yeah, I'm Tony Scott, so dolly tracks, Google maps, etc etc".There's a part of me that kind of wishes that I could rip apart this movie even more. I didn't go into it expecting a whole lot, save perhaps for some good performances from the leads and one or two supporting characters, and get a lot of noise and extra bells and whistles to make it Pelham 123.2 1/2. I guess I did get that, up to a point; Washington does his usual good work, and when Travolta doesn't lay down 'motherf*****' like he's Sam Jackson trying to return soup at a deli he's decent enough in a two-dimensional "performance". But where before it seemed impossible to see anyone else except a gruff but oddly charming hero Walter Matthau and a stone-cold sophisticated psycho-criminal played by Robert Shaw, this time the stars veer on the edge of phoning it in. They're still good at what they do (hell, there's even a couple of bits of VERY predictable jokes from Gandolfini as the mayor that aren't too bad), but it doesn't seem like Scott will let them fill in the shoes they need to.Oh yeah, and Tony Scott. Give this guy a budget and he'll go to town on just moving the camera. A lot. Repeatedly. In the same back and forth and circular motions. You thought some of those 360 degree camera moves went on a bit much in the Dark Knight? Wait till you see this! There's something to be said for "old" movies like the 74 Pelham 123: they were suspenseful and tense without having to go to town in the technical department. Scott has skill, but he seems to be of the nervous artistic mindset that if he doesn't go all out and ratchet up with the camera gimmicks and high-flying angles that it won't hit a nerve. Ironically he already hit his peaks for good (MOF) and really worst (Domino), but he keeps plugging away, like an old man version of the Crank directors. At this point, he wishes to just keep up with those guys, and who can blame him? Well, maybe me.One might hope that at least some of the local minor parts might work. After all that was one of the highlights of the 74 film, characterizing these subway riders who had differing ethnicity and even could crack a few good jokes. There was satire there, going alongside those later-Reservoir-Dogs inspired criminals with colors for names. Here, we get some dumb kid talking to another dumb kid on his computer, whose computer-camera is capturing the entire events as they unfold in the subway car (again, updating, but not in any way that seems to make sense since only one TV station, apparently, is broadcasting the feed), a quick bit with a "heroic" army guy, and that's about it. I should also mention, you know, basic logical flaws that glare out like a desert sunbeam- such as the fact that subways keep going by and going by when in the "real" world they would all be grounded during such a hostage scene- but that's a given here.So yeah, I suppose if you're that handful of moviegoers or critics that will eat up with a ridiculous-spoon everything Tony Scott does (and I'm sure there are since there's a director's cut of Revenge floating around there), or just need to turn off some brain cells, this might suffice. Otherwise, stay at home watch something good. Like the original movie. If there's any lesson to take away from this tale it's to not let money-grabbers peering at the stock market every five minutes ruin the movie-party. Especially with a lack of 'gesundheit'. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today, I had a double feature at my theatre and saw this along with Land of the Lost! The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is an awesome action film filled to the brim with suspense and great actors, great storyline, and a great movie altogether. A man by the name of Ryder and some armed men hijack a subway train and take hostages. Ryder communicates with an MTA dispatcher named Walter Garber who tries to reason with him. If the city does not pay Ryder 10 million dollars within the hour, he will kill a hostage. I have not yet seen the original film from the 70's, so I can't compare the two. I highly recommend THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly Off The Rail, But Remakes Have Come Far Worse Than This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even more so than sequels, remakes of older films have their own build-in pratfalls. The pratfalls are just a lot more noticeable if the original film was a classic or extremely well regarded.Such are the complications that faced director Tony Scott (MAN ON FIRE; TOP GUN) and screenwriter Brian Helgeland as they took on their remake of THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1-2-3, which had already made for an incredibly suspenseful film back in 1974 under the hands of experienced journeyman director Joseph Sargent. Based on John Godey's 1973 novel, that film's story of a New York City subway hijacking in which eighteen people were threatened with violent execution at the hands of heavily armed gunmen if a million-dollar ransom wasn't paid in exactly one hour had not only the particular NYC grit of the mid-1970s, but also a fair bit of jet-black comedy as well, ratcheting up the tension even more. With audience attention spans shrunk considerably in the ensuing thirty-five years, not to mention the expectations of car crashes and explosions, Scott and Helgeland not surprisingly fall somewhat short by substituting subtlety for sound and fury; headache-inducing freeze frame and montage gimmickry; rap and heavy metal on the soundtrack; and far more crude language and bloodshed than is really necessary.Still, there have been remakes that have been far worse than this one; and at least, Scott had the good sense of placing Denzel Washington in the role essayed by Walter Matthau in the original; here, he is a transit official with a slightly shady past (and whereas he was named Zachary Garber in the original, as a favor to the great actor who played Garber in '74, in 2009 he's named Walter Garber). Times being different, the ransom is now up to $10 million, but the idea of making NYC deliver the money in one hour wisely remains the same, giving the remake the same HIGH NOON-style level of tension that informed the 1974 original. Veteran actors John Turturro (as a hostage negotiator) and James Gandolfini (as the NYC mayor) also do good supporting turns, trying to help Washington's cool, calm, collected transit official.Where I felt the film went slightly askew, however, was in a decision typical of many Hollywood directors these days with respect to actors who play villains: allowing them to go so far overboard early on that there's more ham in their performances than there is in any Hormel factory. And this is what Scott does with John Travolta; he allows the actor to play the lead hijacker John Ryder with far too much zeal and insanity to be anything other than a typical Hollywood nut job, this in total contrast to Robert Shaw in the original film, where the late, great British actor portrayed Ryder with a certain low-key viciousness and a clipped delivery. Indeed, what the film misses the most is the witty over-the-radio repartee between Matthau and Shaw that was present in the original. Both Helgeland and Scott missed the boat on that one.And yet, despite all the bloodshed, profanity, and headache-inducing sound and fury thrown at the viewer, it is really the plot itself that makes this film work as well as it does; and it is fortunate that, thanks to Washington's presence, Scott and Helgeland aren't allowed to completely trash that. This PELHAM stops a couple of stations short of the masterpiece status accorded to the original, but one could do much worse in terms of classic films that 21st century Hollywood has somehow decided need a reworking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though nowhere near as good as the original, it makes for a good summer heist film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been burned by so many remakes of classic films, I decided to have an open mind. True, it is fact that remakes can never be better or equal to their original counterpart (The Day The Earth Stood Still and The Wicker Man are good examples) but this one was entertaining, although it sometimes has that bloated, Hollywood feel that is so prevalent in movies and totally unnecessary because story and acting alone should be more important. Both Denzel Washington and John Travolta give good performances, especially Travolta with his cold demeanor and charismatic personality with a surprising touch of black comedy that I didn't expect from this remake. To be fair, I was thrilled at some points in the film( I won't give anything away) but since I saw the original many years ago, I can say that this is a good summer heist flick that while not as gripping as the original Taking of Pelham 123, more than makes up for it in the entertainment value which I cannot say for most remakes (although some have come close) but with two strong leads, I would like to see both Washington and Travolta in future films that are not remakes but entirely fresh roles altogether.</fullReview>

The film stars are Denzel Washington and John Travolta.Like the film's name says it is a story about taking the Pelham number 123. The guy is taking over the Pelham and asking for money to release the people in train.John Travolta is acting like Ryder and Denzel Washington like Walter Garber who is employee of MTA. Ryder and Walker built good friendship. The characters are interesting because we found many information and character's history. Dialogue between these characters is amazing because their attitude.In my opinion this is very gripping film, although it is an action movie. Overall, it is a really enjoyable action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth watching, nothing special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was tempted to give this film a 7/10 just for the performances of Travolta and Washington, but I expect nothing less than great acting from those two anyway, so settled with a 6 because the film itself, whilst definitely watchable, doesn't carry a huge deal of substance. I haven't seen the original, so I'm judging it from an outsider's perspective. As mentioned, Travolta is great, and Denzel plays his usual self, a worried, yet seemingly always in-control and reassured bloke (possibly a bit overdone in this instance?). We aren't really presented with any twists or ultimately exciting variants in plot, other than what can be expected from a film like this. It's a decent thriller, will keep you interested until the end, but that's only for Washington and Travolta value. The plot itself is mediocre and plays out very predictably. Negotiator or Fugitive, this ain't. Certain people (the young guy and girl on the laptop) are annoying but most of the cast hold up as believable and compelling enough to watch. You won't count this up there in your favourite films of all time, but it's worth a go if you see it on TV or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining But Not A Classic As The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham 123 is a thriller that features Denzel Washington and John Travolta together with Luis Guzmán,Victor Gojcaj,James Gandolfini and John Turturro. It is a film adaptation of the novel by Morton Freedgood, writing under the pseudonym John Godey, and is a remake of the original 1974 film adaptation of the same title. It was written by Brian Helgeland and directed by Tony Scott.A New York City subway dispatcher draws on his extensive knowledge of the subway system in order to outsmart a dangerous criminal mastermind who's hijacked a subway train. Walter Garber is drifting through his daily routine when he receives word that a heavily armed gang of four has hijacked a subway train and is holding all of the passengers hostage. Led by cunning master thief Ryder, the gunmen will begin executing everyone aboard should the authorities fail in delivering ten million dollars in the space of just one hour. With the tension in the tunnels rising, Walter races to save the hostages before the shootings start. But through it all, there's one part of Ryder's plan that Walter can't quite comprehend: even if the thieves do succeed in getting their money, how could they possibly get out of the tunnels undetected? The remake of the 1974 classic is definitely not short in entertainment as the direction of Tony Scott is characterized by energy,tension and vitality as the film was bristling with high-tech gimcrackery and over- the-top camera flourishes.The performance led by Washington and Travolta also makes the film highly emotional as both stars portray their characters realistically and honestly. However,the screenplay was somehow predictable and formulaic in the sense that the viewer does not second guess what is going to happen next. In other words, the film becomes more of an exercise of Scott's direction rather than a narrative of a good story unlike the original movie wherein people get involved with the characters and personalities involved in the screenplay. Viewers who love action films would be delighted watching this film. No question about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't look at it as a remake and you will like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd never seen the original version of this, so thankfully I had nothing to compare it to, which seems to be bringing this film down.Easily the best thing about this film is the interaction between Washington and Travolta. Their performances are truly brilliant. Especially Travolta, who really creates some atmosphere of insanity with his instant, hugely effective switches between a calm conversation and threatening to blow someone's brains out. However the film can be marked down in the acting category, aside from the two front-men (and in some cases the Mayor, who provided some comedic relief) the rest of the performances were less than memorable.The story is good, it's impressive how the entire film is set in two locations and yet the pace is still high throughout and it never seems to drag or get boring. The sounds helped the pace of the film a lot too, with quick drum and bass songs accompanying a high speed car/bike scene and the everyday rumble of trains passing by elsewhere to really create the feel of how this is occurring in an everyday scenario. The dialogue is good, aside from the often pointless abundance of the 'f' word, and I think the characters are believable and are developed well, especially in Washington's case. One small problem that cost the film half a star for me was a very over the top shootout that occurs in the film, if you watch it you'll know what I mean, it just derailed the reality of the film for me slightly.Overall though, a good thriller that should please most viewers, that's presuming you haven't seen the original, apparently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7.5 Stars to be exact.Review in a nutshell- no spoilers here:Denzel and Travolta were great, though I would have liked Travolta's character to have a better saying than 'Motherf**ker'. I loved the mental cat and mouse between the two stars but I would have liked to have seen that mental cat and mouse continue through the entire movie including through the un-thrilling chase scenes.What could have been done. . . * Minor Spoilers Ahead* In many movies the bad guy tempts the good guy to join his side, and Pelham briefly uses this temptation as well; I just wish they pursued this angle further for in this movie Denzel's character, unlike other good guys, may have actually been tempted by a pay out- perhaps Travolta gives Denzel the bag of money with the gun in it and Denzel has to make a choice to either walk away with the cash or pull the gun, or something like that; just don't end the movie with the lame cab chase that ends fairly tamely (though did I like Travolta's final power play).There are other plot devices in the movie that are barely used that as well could have been better exploited: the laptop/internet feed; the Waldorf Hotel underground, Gandolfini's liaisons, etc. Also, the 'sewer rat incident' could have been made more believable as well as Denzel's escape- not enough time to find him?- He's right around the corner! In conclusion. . . (no more spoilers)All in all Pelham 123 is still an entertaining movie: Tony Scott's direction took some criticism from the mainstream and non-mainstream reviewers, but I liked the look, feel and sound of the movie including the obligatory car crashes (they maybe overdone but they are not overbearing). The plot needed to be tightened up a bit, the minor characters developed beyond saying "I F**king Love You!" (including my friend's bit character!), and for God's Sake let Denzel and Travolta finish this movie in style: Ryder deserved so much better (or worse)!- go back and re-shoot the ending if you have to; 20-30 new minutes would straighten this almost-great-film out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a disgraced employee at the metro control centre, and his efforts to negotiate with people who hijacked a metro train in downtown New York.For an action and thriller, it is very dialog heavy. However, the short time limits imposed on the film makes everything rushed and immediate, as if things are happening right now. It manages to provide viewers with a sense of urgency and adrenaline, but I think the emotional side is underdeveloped, especially with Walter Garber's wife and family. His wife seems to be such a disposable character, when in fact she could have evoked the sympathy of viewers."The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" is a tense thriller.

		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is a thriller movie that keeps its audience on the edge of their seats the throughout the entire movie. It has many exciting moments that will keep them guessing the outcome of the movie. This movie keeps viewers involved because some events actually take place throughout the world.Subways do get high jacked, and people do get held hostage or killed. Also some people are traitors like "Phil Ramos" who used to drive a subway, but then helped high jack one. He knew just where to stop the subway so that there would be no connections to the outside.Yes media has come a long way but there are still flaws such as this where the connection is lost in the tunnel. This is a good movie to see media working, such as watching the news on a laptop. Also the use of webcams like between the two teenagers, one who is a hostage on the subway. More media that takes place is the use of the internet to watch the stock market. Overall, this is a good movie that shows many types of media in real life encounters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I viewed this version of Pelham 123 with some trepidation. I had originally read the novel and enjoyed the first version which was fairly faithful to the book. I also enjoyed Walter Matthau's performance in the first film. But I have to admit that Tony Scott, Denzel Washington, and John Travolta pull this off in convincing fashion. The playing off off Washington's Garber against Travolta's Ryder is extremely compelling. Scott keeps the film focused on this battle of wits and does so effectively. My only criticism of the film is as a native New Yorker. They completely misrepresent the geography of the subway system (There's no way a Lexington Avenue Local is going from 41st Street to Coney Island). But this I can forgive. I would be remiss if I didn't also mention a couple of excellent supporting roles. John Turturro's hostage negotiator is a fine empathetic character, who seems to have researched his role well. And it was extremely refreshing to see James Gandolfini play the Mayor without making him into a buffoon. Gandolfini plays the Mayor as being smart enough to know when to back out of the situation and let the professionals do their job. I liked this a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I wanted to like this movie. At first it wasn't bad, even though scott's direction style is getting a little old. For a while I was pretty intrigued, right up until a major plot point happened because a subway rat got a little curious. Could barely believe it. Where are the writers? Is that how the original happens or something? I hope they didn't spend good money for a Hollywood writer to come up with that one. Awful. I kept watching...travolta tells someone to "kiss his bum hole," and I decided the movie had already hit its peak. The getaway scene was kinda lame, and the very end sucked. Im not even going to speculate on why travola is so fine with his plan allowing for such a slim chance of escape. It needed another storyline for travolta or a serious rewrite. Even though hes always pretty cheesy, at least travolta was better than I expected.Denzels character was alright, except his decisions at the end. Why does he go after travolta? He had gotten the hostages away from the guys with guns, and had even run off himself. I get taking them the money, he has some lives to save, but putting his life at risk for travolta's imprisonment doesn't seem denzels style in this movie. Maybe he wants his old job back and thinks this is the way to do it. Maybe hes willing to let his wife become a milkless widow because his bribe taking sense of right, wrong, and justice is overwhelming. Maybe it was just time for another bad movie from the scott team. As I was writing this I decided to change my vote from a five to a four. This movie was not good, but if your willing to dig for a scene or want to poke some fun, go for it. At least Luis Guzman is always awesome</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, a confession (two, actually): I have seen the original 1974 version, and the only thing I remember about it is the runaway subway train. Don't get me wrong: the movie was GOOD. It's just that it's so long ago.This remake has the same exciting runaway subway train with no one in control, plus high-tension hostage situation, massive ransom-delivery and rescue action, mild violence (in today's standard)?.all in the action department. But then, over the years of development of action thrillers, it becomes exceedingly difficult to really impress a seasoned audience, even though this remake has no problem meeting passing-grade. What is more enduring is actors' performance, when you have good actors. Here, they certainly do.The easier role is the eccentric financial market wiz turned criminal, played previously by Robert Shaw. There is no point in comparing. John Travolta brings to this re-created role his style of explosive charisma that is wisely kept from going over the top. Also wisely, there is no excessive exploitation into complex Freudian psychology. Let the character remain an enigma, with sufficient hints to make his mental workings interesting at a level to sustain the action.Denzel Washington's role is more difficult because it is a character that is by definition dull ? a paint-by-number civil servant. True, he is very capable in his area of specialty ? the subway transit system, and he is even presently under a shady situation of an alleged bribe-taking investigation. But even that doesn't make him a fraction as exciting and intriguing as Travolta's character. Doesn't seem an easy job to pitch them in a heavy-weight bout of blow-by-blow, nail-biting confrontation. But in this movie, it works ? because it is Washington, who can take any role and almost immediately command the audience's full attention.Good, entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great proof of why some remakes are necessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoided for a long time this third version of John Godey's "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" thinking of hat kind of innovations another remake would bring to my life. Well, there was improvement and big ones. Relevant to our time and very well adjusted into Tony Scott's technique in action films, "The Taking of..." not only is an exciting entertainment but also an poignant urban tale about virtues and a certain sense of loyalty. Yet the same old movie about a group of men taking over a train, the Pelham One Two Three, and yet there's variations in this story. And we have one good guy dealing with the groups demands for millions of dollars, trying to make the best in his work controlling the subway's traffic and what he thought he couldn't do: save the passengers lives. It's not just a case of seeing Denzel Washington taking the role previously played by Walter Matthau and Edward James Olmos that is a key factor here; The character played by Denzel has an background story involving unproven corruption charges that put him in the current position (he was on an upper level making foreign contacts involving buying trains) and this greatly used for powerful dramatic effects when the leader (John Travolta) uses this in his favor to show how much he's in control of the situation.Exciting like most of Scott's films, electrifying and thrilling like very few action pictures can be these days, "The Taking of..." us a case of a remake that needed to be made because of the context in which we live, the technologies of the moment, inexistent in 1974 and 1998 (years of both versions). Brian Helgeland's script is smart not only in its dialogs but also in showing internet, computers, mobile phones, etc. into the action, it's almost like a propaganda demonstrating how important technology is. The best thing this remake ignored from the old versions was the "sneeze factor" (those who seen it knows what I'm talking about) and this is a far more violent film than the previous one, to me an improvement in the way of making me surprised since the other films were quite light in this issue.My only small problem with this was seeing this concept again for a third time. Yes, there were big changes in it but this is still stuck with John Godey's material and that might be a problem for those who already seen the other versions. Those unknown to them will enjoy ten times more than I did. And I liked it a lot! But it's just another proof that isn't just a case of Hollywood running out of ideas but also they prove here that movies are remade time and time again to present updates concerning a certain period of time. Who knows if maybe in 2055 they'll make a fourth remake of this adding new stuff to it that weren't present in 2009? Time will tell. Scott's fast technique to provide action through scenes that rarely last more than seven seconds, his impeccable work with actors, all that are infallible. Nervous, sharp and very humored, it doesn't stop or slow down its rhythm at any moment. And there's a good time to make an study on men under pressure, having to decide what's best in order to save lives and get what one wants, whether get the money in a short period of time, or to bring the hostages in safety or to arrest the criminals.Washington and Travolta were safe bets to make this project an must-see film, they're a nice team even sharing the same screen for brief moments, but it's James Gandolfini (as NY's mayor), John Turturro (playing a negotiator), Luis Guzman and Michael Rispoli who stand on their own to make this far more enjoyable it could be. You can't go wrong with that! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Remake - Maybe The Best I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes often disappoint. This one most definitely does not. The original movie version of this story (from 1974) was a good, pretty tense movie. Where it often fell down was in its inexplicable attempts to add some unnecessary "funny stuff" to the story which served only to distract. Those problems are all solved here. This is a tense movie from beginning to end. The basic outline of the story is the same as that told in the '74 version: a New York City subway train is hijacked and the passengers are held hostage unless the City agrees to pay a ransom (in '74 it was $1 million; in this it's $10 million - inflation hits everything!) The suspense is in what's going to happen to the passengers, and how the bad guys are finally going to get caught, which you assume will happen. While that basic outline is the same, there are enough twists to keep this interesting - the primary one being the character of Garber. In '74 (played by Walter Matthau) he was a transit cop who took control of the situation; in this version, Garber (played by Denzel Washington) is a former Transit executive accused of bribery who's been demoted to dispatcher and happens to be on duty to take the calls from the hijackers. Washington was superb. Another difference was the character of the Mayor. In the '74 version the Mayor was a ridiculously weak character; now, played by James Gandolfini, he's competent and perfectly capable of taking charge when he has to. John Travolta was also impressive as the leader of the hijackers. The original chose to end on one of those unnecessary funny moments, which weakened it in my eyes; the ending to this one is far more appropriate to the story. It may have been a bit over the top to have the kid's laptop broadcasting the goings on on the train over the internet, and I could have done without his rather silly webcam exchanges with his girlfriend. Aside from that, though, this is really an excellent movie. 9/10</fullReview>

While I can't speak to the film's fealty to the source material, I do know enough to know when I've been entertained, and THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 was satisfactory entertainment. Denzel Washington and John Travolta interact well and director Tony Scott doesn't let the film lag (despite the fact that this is a movie about an unmoving train). It's so rare to come across a big budget movie that's worth the money that's been spent on it that a movie like this one deserves kudos. Solid cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't remember the earlier Pelham 123 movie and I don't advise anyone that it is necessary to dig back to compare. No need. Assume this is THE Pelham movie and go on happily with your life. In fact, the director has done a great job bringing this story up to date and should generally be congratulated on his work. This movie is well-crafted and reaches to its audience with strong characters, fast moving action and a flowing plot.The two leads (Denzel Washington and John Travolta) put in excellent performances and carry the movie through to the end. Though I have to take issue with Denzel's rapid and sometimes mumbled speech which makes it very hard for non-USA viewers, and John's considerable over-use of the 'F word' - totally unnecessary Mr. Director.The camera angles, clever editing and 'time-line' freeze frames adds to the experience, and the action, for the most part, is well in keeping with the story (but the NYPD delivery scene is stupidly excessive and makes the cops look even more incompetent than usual). Mr. Director - you wasted a good portion of the budget in those scenes! We understood the urgency, believe me!Overall - very good, watchable, gripping and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham 123 is an excellent film. I understand how some people might not like it that much because it's not really an action film and there isn't much to boil your blood. On the other hand get ready to spend the film at the edge of your seat because this is one of Tony Scott's best films.Screenplay adaptation is fantastic, it's not entirely like the book but the script is intense and the dialogs are very good. Denzel Washington's acting is superb, that man literally nailed it. Travolta's acting is also good but don't expect his performance to be brilliant.Something about this movie that makes it incredible is the great directing, and certain scenes are splendid. This movie sure offers great entertainment.I'm more of a Ridley Scott fan than Tony Scott but with films like this Tony has nothing to envy his brother.Take my advice and watch this excellent Scott Free production, you will not regret the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The twist is: there aren't any</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say, I haven't seen the original from 1974. But when it comes to this version: It's not a bad movie, per se. It's just that you expect so much more. When both director Tony Scott and actors like Denzel Washington, John Travolta, John Turturro and James Gandolfini are involved, you expect the script to have an intelligent plot with some surprises along the way. I read several places before watching it that it would have "plot twists". I'm afraid there aren't any. Anyone with half a brain will suspect early on that 10 million dollars is way too low a sum to ask for in this context, and on cue, not that far into the movie, we of course discover he's aiming to get the "real" money from somewhere else.I kept watching half in disbelief, and I gotta say I was pretty disappointed when the end credits started. It's just a very straight-forward, 13-a-dozen action thriller with very little actual suspense. The whole premise seems to rest on us being worried for the hostages. But at no point do we get to know any of them even remotely well enough to care much. (I'm not saying I wouldn't care if 18 people I don't know are killed, but let's be honest, in a movie like this it doesn't really raise your heartbeat).It's not an awful movie in any way, it's just shockingly plain and devoid of plot for a movie this big and with names that huge both sides of the camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pelham 1 2 3: A pretty awesome thrill ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Travolta and Denzel Washington star in the excellent remake of The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3. Directed by Tony Scott(Domino, DeJa Vu). I will start my review by saying a few things.#1: Never before have I seen John Travolta play such a foul mouthed badass. His last role was a fat chick in Hairspray. I didn't want to believe he was a villain, though I got used to it. His character cusses over three dozen times saying Mother F*cker time and time again. There is even one scene where he says"He sounds sexy... I want him to be my bitch in prison". So maybe Travolta is a little over the top here, but he's still a pretty convincing bad guy.#2: John Turturro stars in this film as the same character it seems that he plays in every film. It seems like in every film he's in, he plays the same role. I know Mr. Deeds and Secret Window were different, but try something different next time, Mr. Turturro. You're a great actor, try something new.#3: Luis Guzman from dozens of films doesn't have much to do here. He's only supposed to be a side character, but why couldn't he have more screen time. Though I know he has a side character, I think he should've got more for his role.Denzel Washington is pretty good in this film. The film kept me pinned to my seat. The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is a great Summer thrill ride. John Travolta is funny even though he's a psycho. The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 will blow you away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crazed ex-con John Travolta takes 19 passengers of a subway car hostage and wants $10 million within the hour. Difficult, demanding, and somewhat delusional, Travolta does all his negotiations through radio with demoted dispatcher Denzel Washington in this more than adequate summer blockbuster which works due to its frenetic pacing and its war of words between its two stars. A slight rethinking of the 1970s version which starred Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw in the principle roles, "The Taking of Pelham 123" has a difficult start and equally hard ending, but reaches high in the middle and this makes it a winner overall. Luis Guzman, James Gandolfini, and John Turturro do well in well-calculated supporting roles. Tony Scott's direction is wild, ambitious, and in-your-face (as usual), but it still succeeds with the help of screenwriter Brian Helgeland's intelligent adaptation of the material. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travolta shows that hijacking is as easy as 123.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington plays Walter Garber, one of the men responsible for making sure that New York city's subway system runs smoothly. Unfortunately, that is not going to happen on this particular day as John Travolta's character, Ryder, is taking over the Pelham vehicle and holding everyone hostage until his demands are met. Having established a connection with Garber, he does not want to deal with anyone else even when a professional enters the situation (hostage negotiator Camonetti played by John Turturro). Lives are most definitely on the line and Garber can only do his best, even if that means exposing his own weaknesses to a man threatening to kill people if he senses any dishonesty. While it may be seen by many as a left-handed compliment, I must confess that this is the best Tony Scott movie I have seen in years. Okay, so it's a remake but while I don't know how it compares to the original (sadly a film I have yet to watch) it certainly stands well enough on it's own two feet thanks to the consistently enjoyable performances (alongside Travolta, Washington and Turturro we also have the likes of James Gandolfini and Luis Guzman, even if only for a very short amount of screen time), a sharp script from Brian Helgeland and kinetic direction from Scott that does feature a lot of his standard fast-editing techniques but also remains surprisingly restrained for him at times. Even the cutting and pacing of the movie are in fact helpful in keeping us on edge as the deadline for Ryder's ransom demands approaches.Stand-offs and negotiations like this have been seen many times before in the movies but this film works better than most thanks to the relationship that unfolds between the two leads. Travolta plays a man who knows all the possible outcomes of his situation while Washington plays a man who never saw anything like this on the horizon and doesn't even realise it when he's showing immense bravery.I would recommend this film to fans of the "hostage situation" thriller and even if you dislike Tony Scott movies as much as I sometimes do I would also suggest that others give it a try and perhaps end up being as pleasantly surprised as I was.See this if you like: The Negotiator, Mad City, Collateral.</fullReview>

The tension from the dialogue between John Travolta and Denzil Washington was nail-biting and edge of your seat. The film is well made and keeps us well aware that there is a deadline for the hostages.The original film meandered with many subplots, like those Japanese visitors and the mayor of New York being lambasted by most everyone. This one stuck to the hostage situation and what was going on in the traffic control centre. It was serious stuff and to use a cliché, John Travolta was one 'Bad Dude' who meant business. He out-does Robert Shaw who I felt seemed a little too surreal and cold.The tension kind of fades after the subway car moves along the tracks and the hostage takers make their exit. But the ending is conclusive. Also New York looks a lot better in 2009 then in the Walter Matthau version in 1974.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the original, but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the original (1974) version, starring Walter Matthau, I ignored the title and pretended this remake wasn't a remake. This was a good decision, for it helped me to appreciate what the film offers, rather than compare it to a great first effort. So, I can safely say, save for a few of distractions, the film is entertaining.The first distraction was the prolific profanity by John Travolta's character, Ryder, the leader of the hijackers. His limited vocabulary belies the character, a former stock trader, recently released from prison for white-collar crime. Ryder is supposed to be brilliant, but he never stops talking like a deranged longshoreman. It just doesn't add up. This lack of believability nags at the film from beginning to end.Another distraction is director Scott's heavy-handed action and violence scenes. Scott's over-exaggerating approach makes what is suppose to be tension-building scenes, comical. This is especially evident in the film's "anti-climatic" climatic end (which also could have used a little script polishing before filming).The good news about the film is its great cast. Denzel Washington wonderfully plays Walter Garber, the hero of the film. Garber is the dispatcher responsible for the smooth operation of Pelham 123 who becomes liaison between the hijackers and New York City's leaders. Garber's own integrity flaw twists the plot to a higher tension level while allowing him to become a flawed, and thus more believable, hero. As stated earlier, John Travolta plays Ryder, leader of the hijackers. A psychopath one minute and a brilliant criminal the next, Ryder's actions continually remind the audience they are in a theater watching a movie.The supporting cast does an admirable job of playing believable characters. Of note are John Turturro, who does an excellent job as the police department's hostage negotiator and James Gandolfini, who plays New York City's lame duck mayor. The supporting characters offer most of the tension-releasing humor in the film. These moments are nicely timed and in some cases, laugh-out-loud funny.Pelham 123 should have been much better than it was. Tony Scott should not give into the temptation to over blow action scenes to the extent that they harm a good story. If you can overlook this harm, the film offers some fine moments and respectable performances.written by: Vincent for www.overcranked.net</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than Was Promised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a remake, The Taking of Pelham 123" was regarded as another typical remake of a classic that would be most likely stupid. I was surprised however, to find that it was a lot more than promised.The movie's storyline is about a man, Ryder, who takes a section of a train hostage for ransom. Subway dispatcher, Garber, has his boring days flipped around when Ryder goes to communicate with him, in order to demand his money. Ryder demands a ransom of $ 10 000 000, and threatening to kill one passenger every minute the money's late after an hour. Throughout the frequent calls to each other, Ryder and Garber's personalities are reviled.One of the main reasons people may go to see The Taking of Pelham 123", is because of the two big names of actors: Denzel Washington and John Travolta. Both displayed a significant amount of acting skill, but there may have been a bit of flaws. Travolta, as Ryder, keeps screaming through the microphone. Is he over-acting? Or is Ryder simply a hot tempered guy? Washington as Garber always seems to calm. Couldn't he have showed a bit more emotion with all of Ryder's kills and threats? Otherwise, ignoring this, they were great.The Taking of Pelham 123" won't become a to be classic like the previous one, but I do think this film is great, but underrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HBCU247.com writes The Taking of Pelham 123 is a remake of the 1974 movie adaptation of Morton Freedgood's novel The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. This movie was FaNtAsTiC with its action, intense drama, and the running dialogue between Denzel Washington and John Travolta. Pelham is the type of thriller that is suspenseful and will keep you engaged until the end?like Man on Fire (another great movie starring Denzel Washington). Although Garber (Denzel Washington)'s wife Therese (Aunjanue Ellis) doesn't have much face time in the movie, but when she is on screen, she delivers a convincing performance as a devoted wife who displays concern and hopefulness. Travolta played a semi-manic hijacker very well; his character was reminiscent of another character, Castor Troy, Face off. John Turturro (Camonetti) and James Gandolfini (Mayor) were very well suited for their characters in this movie, but Luis Guzmán (Ramos) with very face time and even less speaking lines, could have been played someone else. Even though I am of no authority of how good this movie is in comparison to the book or the first Pelham, this is a really good summer flick?so ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travolta takes this one to the Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham 123 is a non-stop thrill ride under the city of New York, and maybe even into outer space. A criminal mastermind (Travolta) hijacks a subway train with one simple goal in mind: he wants to take Pelham 123 all the way to the moon. He doesn't want any money; he has no political agenda. All he wants to do is get that subway train with himself, and the hijacked passengers, onto the Earth's moon.The main plot is broken up with a series of flashbacks, in which a young Travolta stares longingly at the moon, establishing the lunar obsession that will one day cause him to hijack a train. "Papa" the moonstruck boy says, "One day, I want to ride a subway up there, up there on the moon!" "You shut your yapper about all this moon mumbo jumbo," his father slurs. The heavy stench of dessert wine practically wafts off the screen. "Ain't no subway ever going to be on the moon." Then his father beats him. He beats him for dreaming the same dreams he himself once dreamt as a young boy. Dreams that could never be more than dreams. He wants his son to forget these silly dreams of subways and moons.But the boy never forgets them. If anything, the beatings only harden his will to succeed.A simple man (Washington) goes work at his simple job of controlling New York's subways. It's not the most exciting job in the world, and that's just the way he likes it. He has several cop buddies who go after the real bad guys. The only "bad guy" Washington has to deal with is the occasional late train. Speaking of which, it looks like Pelham 123 is stuck."Pelham 123, respond," says Washington into the phone, expecting the train's operator to respond with something about signal problems, or perhaps a joke about molemen blocking the tracks.Instead there is only a sinister laugh."Who is this?" demands Washington."This is the man who is going to take this subway to the moon! If I don't get on the moon in 59 minutes, in this train, I'm going to start killing hostages!" Negotiations begin as the clock runs down. Washington offers money, but Travolta will not compromise on his one demand."I've spoken to NASA," says Washington. "There's going to be a moon mission in three months. We've worked out an agreement that if you give yourself up peacefully, we can put you on that shuttle, under police custody of course." "You don't understand, do you?" screams Travolta. "This isn't about getting to the moon in one of your fancy space shuttles. This is about getting to the moon on the subway." "I'm trying to work with you," pleads Washington "But there are no tracks that go to the moon. Subways go underground; the moon is in outer space. Please, listen to me!" "Life is simple now. You just have to get this train on the moon," Travolta screams, and then hangs up.*Spoiler Alert* Washington comes up with a plan that's just crazy enough to work. Local residents cooperate, as they transform Pelham 123's next stop to look like the moon. They even remove the tile lettering of "34th Street" and replace them with "The Moon." Washington announces over the train intercom, "Next stop- the moon!" The subway pulls into Moon Station. A euphoric Travolta exits the train, and is promptly tackled by the "moon police" and dragged off to "moon jail." Travolta doesn't even care; his dream has come true. But his cell-mate, Travis, reveals the disturbing truth to Travolta in a poignant final scene."This ain't no moon jail, man. This is just jail. We on Earth. Look around you, man. We on Earth." We on Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really sucked. I would say its terrible but actually considering a lot of the crap that comes out of Hollywood its probably more like average. I read one or two reviews giving it fairly positive responses which made me think it would be worth killing time on, but its almost like no one aspires to anything half decent anymore as this was like a sub par action movie from the mid-90s when this format was new and therefore somewhat entertaining, ie in no way deserving of any praise.Tony Scott strings together an incredibly predictable action story with almost no interest in anything human and engaging- The main characters are clichéd and boring. This is potentially the scripts fault since Travoltas psychopath is just a standard bad guy role with any interesting backdtory only hinted at and never followed up. Denzel has presence but he still seems far too cool to be the slightly loserish character hes meant to be playing (which could of been more interesting).The supporting ones either given no screen time (eg Luis Guzman or John Tuttoro- why even employ the former, if only to appeal to an indie demographic since he has about 3 lines?) or are clichéd to the max- witness the hostages who appear to be extras with little acting abilities. Scott gives the hostages zero screen time too- you never relate to these guys- you never see their fear, and their reactions seem far too muted to be realistic.The plot is just there so Scott can mess about with some flashy camera work which gets incredibly irritating. He does these slow mo shots of helecopters and trains so often at the start you just want one image to go at normal speed. He also does these freeze frames of how much time is left which become laughable after a while as they come at really odd moments, and are a very obvious way of forcing suspense.Spoilers- So much of it is unrealistic- the girlfriend on the webcam demanding her hostage boyfriend to say he loves her; the fact that the goons don't notice the laptop with a teenage girl on; the amount of bullets the police fire at the henchmen when they get caught; the car that carries the money racing through town just so it can cause some nice flashy car crashes for the trailer, why not helicopter it? And the 'big twist' about him doing it for gold or 'put offs', I guessed immediately and I don't even have much of an interest in economics...Tony Scott has done some decent movies- True Romance is one that springs to mind. This one seemed to have been made by the guy who shoots the stunts as that seems to be the whole point to the unrealistic, entirely predictable storyline and paperthin characters. Hell Im not judging this compared to deep artsy movies, just decent popcorn flicks, eitherway it falls so short and I cant fathom how this has got even one good review, any help? Sorry for the rant, I just expected more....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Cast but Direction a Let-down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Scott began life as a director of television adverts and while that, in itself, is no bad thing there's no escaping the fact that, to my mind at least, most of his films have had less heart than an advert, the one notable exception being TRUE ROMANCE (1993).True Romance was, of course, written by Quentin Tarantino and whatever your view of QT there's no denying his early scripts revolutionized film-making. And they had more heart than you could shake a stick at.QT is also quite a fan of the original THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE (1974), which starred Walther Matthau and Robert Shaw, using its central theme of colour coded bad guys to wonderful effect in RESERVOIR DOGS (1992).Denzel Washington stars as New York City subway dispatcher Walter Garber, the role originally played by Walter Mathau, whose day is thrown into chaos by an audacious crime ? the hijacking of a subway train. John Travolta stars as the criminal mastermind behind the plot, the leader of a highly armed gang of four who threaten to execute the train's passengers unless a ransom of $10 million is paid within the hour. The role was originally played by Robert Shaw, who is best known for his flinty character Quint in Steven Spielberg's JAWS (1975).As the tension mounts Denzel Washington, who is as always fantastically charismatic and watchable, uses his vast knowledge of the subway system in a battle of wits with Travolta to save the hostages.But there's one riddle even Washington can't solve ? even if the thieves get their blood money, how in the hell can they escape? Tony Scott does a pretty little job ? the film is as slick as any TV advert, is wonderfully well edited and he draws fantastic performances from his two principles ? but the film is lacking heart. It's all sound and fury and it signifies nothing. We're hit from the opening with thumping music and speeded up film, the camera swirls while overall the film is flash, brash and loud. But there's something missing. It's a rock video instead of a movie.Having said that, it isn't a total loss ? both Travolta and Washington are fantastic and watch out for John Turturro as a hostage negotiator and James Gandolfini as mayor of New York. So the casting of the actors is near perfect. It's just a pity that the director isn't. It's a pity Tarantino didn't sign up to direct it. He used John Travolta so brilliantly in PULP FICTION (1994) and is an absolute master of simple dialogue scenes. I bet his film would have been less frantic and way more watchable than this. I bet it would have had heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood isn't running out of ideas, it's just they are trying to take something successful and make it better. This movie in my opinion was a success at that task. Travolta honestly made the movie for me. He was deep into his character and released an extreme performance, and Washington did the same as well. Everyone before this movie was worried about Travolta being the bad guy well as he did in "Swordfish" and semi in "Face-off" and also "Broken Arrow" he does it here as well. This movie definitely was an attention grabber from the start and left everyone on the edge of their seats until the final moments. This movie really was a success because it at times brought new things to the table while sticking to its roots. Overall the acting was phenomenal and I thought this was a superb remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Taking of Pelham 123</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Scott and Denzel Washington together have three collaborations under their belt (Crimson Tide, Man on Fire, Deja Vu), and given that I've enjoyed every single one of their outing, there's no reason why I shouldn't with The Taking of Pelham 123, especially with John Travolta contributing as an over the top villain sporting mean tattoos, a goatee and a foul mouth. A remake of a 1974 film by the same name, this one's pretty much updated with the fusion of the Wall Street fallout and plenty of New Yorker tributes, from the mayor (James Gandolfini) to the average salaryman Waler (Washington) earning his keep.Those familiar with Tony Scott's films will know what you're up for stylistically, with the dizzying camera work spinning wildly in and around New York City from the bird's eye helicopter view, to the darkened subway tunnels, and the numerous nauseating inducing quick edits to bring about this semblance of urgency and concurrentness. Add some alternative music - Jay-Z's 99 Problems during the opening credits sounds just apt of the situation at hand - at full blast just about puts Tony's fingerprints all over this movie.The draw of the film is manifold, and firstly, I'm a sucker for control room type of drama where operators are thrust into positions that call for exemplary leadership and thinking out of the box, cutting at the bureaucracy bullshit. It offers the big board and a glimpse of how intricate a rail network is, and seriously I'm always interested for that chance to have a sneak peek at Singapore's own MRT control room. Here the MTA is faced with a terrorist situation that looks so deceptively simple to pull off - a bunch of heavily armed men boarding the same train at separate points, before taking over at a predetermined point. With the help of insiders, logistics are all easily obtained and intimate operational knowledge exploited. And the other draw is of course Washington and Travolta playing off each other. You can imagine just how this film is shot, where one imagines the other being at the other end of the line. For the most parts the actors do not share the same frame on screen, but you can feel the energy still as they play psychological games with each other over the phone, slowly chipping away at confidence, and gamble with many bluffs. What's particularly enjoyable is how their characters get to play one-up against the other, and through some intense conversations, reveal a lot more about their characters, through topics such as religion, the system, and demonstrating that they have probably a lot more in common, except the methods that they chose to get back at their experience of personal injustice by the state.Surprisingly for a Tony Scott film, The Taking of Pelham 123 is quite short on set action sequences. There's the usual complimentary shoot them ups from one-sided street battles to sniper action, though one thing's for sure, the NYPD show of force is something to be reckoned with, being the last resort should the tactics of chief negotiator Camonetti (John Turturro) fail to get through. There's a relatively long sequence of a race-against-time car and motorcycle screaming through the busy streets of New York which I felt was unnecessary, if only for Tony Scott to use as an excuse to shoot something of high velocity, and to pile up on scrap vehicles.The Taking of Pelham 123 is quite standard fare with some instances which peaked thanks to Washington's and Travolta's charismatic presence which were keenly felt. The two carry a lot of the movie on their shoulders despite being apart most of the time, but as all good hostage negotiation-crisis control room movie goes, this one's still recommended stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another okay movie with gratuitous violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Denzel Washington, young, old, plump or fit he always gives his all to a part. So that is why I saw The taking of Pelham 123. I don't remember the original at all, maybe I saw it , maybe I didn't. So I didn't go into this movie with any preconceived expectations. Well besides Denzel and may Gandolfino as the Mayor of New York this was just another okay film by Hollywood. I would like to point out one particular thing that almost made me rate this movie lower- the camera. All of this jumping around causes you to lose perspective on the characters and the plot. It seizure inducing and just doesn't work. Also this is one time that it would have been nice to maybe change a story alittle. I am of course assuming that the original was pretty much like this but they could have updated it alittle for our times. Security in the New York Subway system, I assume, is better than its portrayed in this movie; if not I'm never going to NYC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking of Pelham 1 2 3: Drama is back on track</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another movie that I just about did not see because trailers really made it seem bland. However, a movie with Travolta AND Washington just has to be seen. I have to mention, Tony Scott is at the helm so that helps, too. If the trailer had been a little more enticing, there never would have been a doubt dwelling in the brain train. So I bought the ticket just because of the "riders".Did Travolta sell himself as the bad guy? - YES! He was a whacked out weirdo, bad guy who had a vendetta that was well within reach of his greasy, greedy grasp. Stand in his way and he looks right through you because he can see only one thing, his goal, and he will have it no matter what.Washington was just as interesting but we never know what he will do because he does not have control of himself or his destiny. Being the nice guy he has issues, guidelines and orders from numerous levels. Having had a few bosses myself, I had been hoping for a different result but I was not disappointed in the movie at all. I did however, have some doubt in a certain confession he made which supposedly cleared one mystery. I didn't buy the confession and I didn't like the reaction it got, but it did not affect the movie as far as I was concerned.While most of the action satisfied me, there was some artificial and unnecessary wham-bam-glam-action which didn't move me. Most of what I enjoyed was the drama and tension along with characterizations. I recommend this movie for anyone who cares for the near-lost art of drama. Matter of fact, I recommend it for anyone who can sit and admire thoughtful direction and acting.Great job Tony Scott! You get an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Taking of Pelham 123 Movie Review from The Massie Twins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though Scott's uniquely frenetic editing has been toned down from his previous films, his unmistakable style still frequents the action and accentuates the tension-filled premise. Denzel Washington's quick-witted and moderately corrupt dispatcher plays off of John Travolta's Wall Street savvy sociopath with plenty of clever exchanges, and the dark humor and suspense that find its way into the bloodshed culminates in an engaging game of cat and mouse. Not quite as slick as the original, and perhaps a little too conspicuous in its efforts at exuding cool, this latest take on the subway heist story still accomplishes entertainment at break-neck speed.When a New York City subway train is hijacked, Rail Control Center dispatcher Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) becomes an unwitting negotiator for the ruthless criminals aboard. Led by the uncontainable Ryder (John Travolta), the hijackers demand ten million dollars in exchange for the seventeen hostages and offer only one hour to deliver the ransom. As minutes quickly count down, Garber must utilize his cunning and resourcefulness to buy time and catch the mercenary off guard as the situation goes from bad to catastrophic.The unusual, highly stylized, frenzied editing is assuredly a now permanent technique for Tony Scott films - it's a signature method that he ceaselessly experiments with, frequently going overboard, and only occasionally able to harness. In Pelham it looks familiar but doesn't detract from the story, even if some moments of suspense are dulled by the blurred colors of slow-motion and missing frames. The remaining stunt sequences are exciting and tense, but hardly necessary. The car chases are never about catching someone, but rather beating the clock. It's action for action's sake, and while enjoyably destructive, it's entirely apparent.Most audiences will not know that The Taking of Pelham 123 is based on a John Godey novel, or that it's been adapted into a movie twice before with the same name. While Scott's version stands on its own as a big-budget action movie, the purpose of specifically remaking this story is puzzling. Shouldn't the reasoning behind the revisiting of a popular plot be to improve upon some outstanding aspect? The use of the internet, cell phones, snipers, bloodshed, crude language and more give this new vision a sparklingly modernized feel, but when the movie draws to a close, it just can't compete with the 1974 version. Washington and Travolta have an intriguing chemistry, but even that can't outdo the cat-and-mouse mindgames between Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw, who played their counterparts in the first feature adaptation. Perhaps a title change could have appropriately distanced Scott's take from being endlessly compared to an infinitely superior film.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You a Yankees fan? ? The Taking of Pelham 123</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Go as far back to Top Gun and as far forward to the gem Déj? Vu and there are few blatant blemishes on Tony Scott's resume. Truthfully, Spy Game, Man on Fire, Domino, and Déj? Vu are a high-octane run of real winners in my opinion. So, I went into the new version of The Taking of Pelham 123, (adapted from the original novel and not the previous film), with a mix of excitement and cautiousness that the streak may come to an end. Don't get me wrong, the new flick is fun, however, it is the first time I actually thought to myself that the flash was too much?visceral overkill. I never thought I'd say it, but Tony's style over substance knock finally showed face.What do I love about Tony's films? Mostly his unabashed approach to using hyper cuts, loud beats, and a no-holds-barred, knock me upside the head, execution. His films are more a ride than a journey; strap yourself in and let the imagery flow over you. Generally this works wonders as his films take place in multiple locales with many story lines and or timelines playing out simultaneously. With Pelham, however, we are given a pretty straightforward hostage situation, only two locations, (the hijacked subway car and base control), and really no twists or surprises to be had. Frankly, Ridley may have been better suited to this material as he is the storyteller of the duo. I love Tony's use of text and moving subtitles, but here, the minutes of a deadline being our only vested interest, it becomes a gimmick. We know time is running out, we don't need the freeze-frames telling us again and again. I also understand his want to utilize the speed of the train as a means to show motion and MTV-generation style, but honestly, I think it was utilized more successfully in his Amazon.com short Agent Orange. The flash and trademark style sadly becomes fluff. My God, I sound like all those Tony detractors I despise.The story itself is an intriguing one, if not original. We have a man out for money, taking hostages in a well-thought out plan. With an inside man who knows the tunnels and workings of the subway, his own keen sense of the way the world works, and a remorseless mind when it comes to innocent civilians, (each death is at the hands of NYC, not him; "we all owe God a death"), John Travolta's Ryder is a sick cookie just waiting to blow and completely unafraid to die. He is forever joined with Denzel Washington's dispatcher Walter Garber, the one man he is willing to trust and use for his benefit. Will the terrorist get his spoils or will the unlikely man?the only one with the ability to stop him?rise to the occasion and save the day? Unfortunately, that question is not very hard to solve since the thriller aspects of the film are pretty paint-by-numbers. If there is one thing to take from the movie, it is the performances of our two leads. One for his understated verité and the other for his over-the-top antics.Pelham is truly all about Washington vs. Travolta; simple civil servant against the crazed, tattooed villain. If you are to single out a "twist" it is in the backgrounds of these two men, both of which get uncovered as the plot progresses. While the truths of their pasts may help propel the story to its conclusion, they do very little to enhance the roles or bring more interest to the story. In fact, the multiple tidbits of information or sprinkling of convenient props around the sets are mere contrivances and nothing more. The blatant positioning of a laptop aboard the train could have been a key piece to the puzzle, causing major distraction, changing the whole film in fact. Instead, it is a tool used to identify the captors, discoveries that add nothing to the plot. Actually, the only thing they add is to include even more examples of lazy writing on how everyone is somehow connected, whether to our leads, to the mayor, to the transit system, etc. I so wanted the underlying topic of Wall Street and the Stock Market to mean something, but again, all it did was help uncover the name of the assailant, a minor point that is brushed aside without further relevance.Again, though, Washington and Travolta are great together, whether side by side or on the other end of a microphone. You cannot deny the craft of Denzel and his ability to become a character, allowing us to see the tragedy behind the eyes of his composed exterior. His Garber is a man at a crossroads; unknowing what his future holds?either a return to his old position, a career demotion, or a jail cell. But he keeps his wits and does his best job to become a hostage negotiator with Travolta's Ryder. The courage and fortitude of this man may be the only things that could save the nineteen innocents on that train. As for Mr. Travolta, although he may have just one notch on the gauge?that being wild and over-the-top?he is having fun and plays the bad guy perfectly. Whereas his manic demeanor elicits laughs in serious, heroic roles, he really does hit villainy out of the park. Whether his Ryder is in this thing for the money or just to prove that he can do it, we may never know. However, the ride?there's that word again?he takes us on is worth the admission. I just wish it would have warranted a second ticket, but alas, I believe one trip may be enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travolta: great actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not until I'd watched through this film and started reading these reviews did I fully understand that it was a remake, although I was dimly aware that Matthau had been in something similar. Anyway, seeing Travolta in this was something of a revelation. I think I've seen Grease, but don't remember it too well. Recently watched Saturday Night Fever, and, natch, Pulp Fiction. That's about it, as regards Travolta. Watching this I kept asking myself: "Is that really John Travolta?" What a great performance ! That's what I call acting, when someone immerses himself so deeply in the part you can't recognise him.Not having seen the previous version(s) I found this story entertaining and enjoyable to watch. First time I'd seen Denzel, and he was good too, although his character turned rather American-type corny, dumb and shallow towards the end. Tony Scott was a very good, professional director, poor fellow. True Romance is truly a great movie. Here things got a bit erratic at times: Denzel flitting all over the place, in the control room, in the tunnel, on the street, up in the copter. Couldn't really swallow the logistics of this. Some of the plot escaped me, moneywise. Anyway, I recommend this film. Nice cameos by Turturro and Gandolfini. Now I'll have to pick up the Matthau/Shaw version.17 Feb. Now that I've seen the 1974 version I realize this is not a remake. Also, it's a much better, grittier, more genuine piece of work. Tony Scott was criminally underrated as a director. Maybe that's what depressed him.</fullReview>

James Gandolfini from Sopranos who plays the mayor in this movie was pretty good as well.

		<shortDescription>Efficient, Visceral but Cold and Humourless Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a stand alone heist movie this is perfectly adequate. But if you are going to remake a genre classic you either have to succeed in doing it better, or differently, and this does not. The plot is straight forwards. A criminal gang hijacks a New York subway train and starts killing hostages whilst a $10m ransom is delivered. John Travolta stars as Ryder the psychopathic gang leader, Denzel Washington plays the train controller who takes his call.A one hour deadline in a two hour running time provides plenty of opportunity for real time excitement. But Director Tony Scott delivers exaggerated peripheral action at the expense of the intensity of the story. The ransom delivery run is converted into a chance to play out some ludicrous car crash stunts, and the obligatory closing shoot out involves a circle of gun toting cops blazing away at the bad guys in the middle - and each other.Ryder is played as a profane, mad thug,in the manner of Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsleys performances in "Sexy Beast" and "In Bruges". This has the downside that he has no redeeming features. A "back story" for controller Gruber ultimately goes nowhere and adds little to plot development. The addition of a two way laptop interface as a nod to the 21st century has great dramatic potential, but is wasted.The original shone for two reasons. Firrstly grainy, gritty, realistic cinematography, and secondly a compelling chemistry between the two leads. Director Tony Scott produces glossy "action hero" dramatic sequences and Ryder's character allows no space for empathy.But what is also missing is the dry, laconic humour which underpinned the original. The Mayor's part is cruelly underwritten in this regard.An intrusive, raucous hip hop sound track sits awkwardly with the strings that signal a rare "mellow moment". But the story unfolds at a cracking pace and those unfamiliar with the superior original will not walk away disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the kind of movies that you rent to have such a lovely night, the one you watch on TV to have a nice afternoon, or the one that you go and watch in cinema Not To Think, but to have some cinema ! I love action movies. Yet I love it when it's made so well. And I even love it more and more when it got, after that, something to say or anything profound. Here, it's entertaining, with nothing to say. And why not? Hollywood used to make this kind best. And we want it too ! However this time, little points here and there bugged me very. The largest of them was the matter of the hijackers not wearing any disguise or whatsoever ?? So all the passengers can look at them freely and recognize them easily after ??? (at the original they were a gang of coats, hates, glasses, obscure aliases and BIG mustaches !). Plus some questions like How the police negotiator didn't consider at all the main hijacker's reminiscing about Fenland and dating the Ass model to know what character they deal with ?? (while the lazy mayor did !!), How the young passenger's girlfriend put the transmission of his cam on line while she didn't bother herself calling the police ?, How the police didn't use the laptop's camera fine to know more information, being so late to discover the identity of the criminals ? Or How (Travolta) himself didn't know about this camera since he has a laptop which he uses to search during the whole process ??!! (I believe this very transmission was on the head of news at all the sites back then !). But who said that this movie is about thinking ? It's utterly the other way around !The characters fitted the movie as Bang Bang flick only. I mean com' on (John Travolta) looked like a mafia guy, being a walking catholic festival more than a wall street man ! A respectable actor who can do anything like (John Turturro) fell into the trap of a non-detailed role where he does the job as poor as it is, for the money, being there, whatever ! Concentrate well when a reporter asks (James Gandolfini)'s character as the mayor about the last one's divorce; he must be the stupidest reporter in the universe, forgetting all about the matter of hijacked train?Yet No, it was made just to justify that this mayor isn't another natural jackass but a wounded man or a person with family problem, however that was something standing in the air, and obviously fabricated for the sake of a star named (Gandolfini), not for the sake of making a real character. So, as you see, there was no time for character-study, character's details or real character because things like that are pure nonsense in a movie of the aforementioned kind!(Tony Scott) is one of the most brilliant sons out of Hollywood and MTV's marriage. But here, a few of his toying were juvenile (writing the time on-screen, freezing the frame then fading out!) or provocative (the endless rotation of the camera at the subway's control center gives the dizziness before the bore !). However he's still dear Tony after all (the police cars' race with time all over New York, the whole third act, etc..). Just compare the background behind (Walter Matthau) at the subway's control center in the original movie and then the flashy colorful and dazzling one behind (Washington) this time; IT'S Tony-man-on-fire-Scott ladies and gentlemen ! In this kind of movies, I detest to say "Hey, the performance was super !" as that would make me the ultimate goofy. Here, it's a game of charisma and a quest of stardom. Not the 2 leads but the whole cast delivered very good time on-screen, but don't you ever forget that there weren't very good written characters in the first place ! The cinematography, the editing executed well the famous Scott's extravaganza (the rampant video clip style) while I didn't see much creativity this time. The music score was a melody of repeating beats with hard pace, without any addition to the story or the events, or putting a human sense to it, being just thrilling and in non-memorable way! The script got its moments : (Travolta needs badly Washington as the one to talk with otherwise he'll kill someone for it in 60 seconds, so they try to bring back the departed Washington in at the kill ! Washington confesses a crime publicly then fully purges with a very *cinematic* alteration into hero at the end!, or how the bad guy dies thanking the good guy; the audience always weep the evil man when dies touchingly at the end) but away from these spices that was it! And I hated the dialog; aside from unnecessary filth like Travolta's line "I'll make him my bitch in jail !", it's DAMN USUAL. Nevertheless, again and forever, in this kind of movies.. don't search for more.When the mayor's character asks about why they didn't transport the money into the helicopter (which's surely faster then the cars) ?!! I answered logically : to enjoy such a big car chase instead ! This question, which's inserted from the movie makers in a smart and funny way, can summarize all what their movie is about. It's the third adaptation of a novel after a cinematic movie at the 1970s and a TV one at the 1990s. I wish for a fourth one already where the conversations between the 2 leads are deep and the situation can say anything serious beside being Hollywood fair fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man John Travolta must be getting desperate for roles. This is not one of his best. I don't know why but it seems that he is taking only what his agent requests, and not browsing scripts to find that one good one that can make his career bounce back. As for denzel Washington, he did fit the role perfectly. The story lacked some more action and the idea of hostage negotiations have been overdone in so many ways. The last time John was in a hostage film was one called swordfish. That was one good film for action and story line. This was a little off in some way. But still, both actors had some good dialogue, although John's character could have used less language. I don't know why script writers always have to use the most foul language imaginable. Most people don't use it except only for the younger gap generation teenagers. It was too vulgar for my taste to watch, but the two actors made up for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pelham 123 derailed by Travolta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was at the cinemas last week undecided and confused on which movie to watch. The toss up was between 17 again and Taking of Pelham and I must admit that i succumbed to watching the latter only because it boasted such a stellar cast. Also, because I hoped there would be some breathtaking underground action scenes. I should have known better when my brother sniggered at the idea of how two washed up celebs could offer any stunts. I agree with the reviewers here on how galling the opening titles had been. The supposedly stylish motion blur continued throughout the movie leaving my eyes sore. I hated the cluttered starting as well when the camera followed through too many actors. It seemed the only intention was to obfuscate as a cover up for the weak plot. For the plot does no justice at all to the initial build up. That point however shall be discussed later on in this review. So as I was writing, the introduction of too many characters ruined what might otherwise have been been a good start had the story been presented through a single character. That the writers grossly neglected John Travolta's character had seemed like a big blow to the movie. His sudden befriending of Denzel's character seems unreasonable and unjustified. For instance, why does he give a chance to Denzel to pull the trigger on him in the climax? No reason to probe into any 'logic' you say well you are probably right( if you watched the movie in the same light as a scrutinizer) The most exciting twist to the plot could have been if Denzel had been presented as the mastermind of the plot instead of Travolta. Would you agree? Now I haven't read the novel, but this plot would have required some crafty storytelling and presentation. Suffice to say, Travolta's character was replete with errors and short on acting. Swearing constantly, doesn't make you a villain! Denzel as a train dispatcher was the only saving grace in my opinion. Why Travolta's character needs to raise hell by plotting a hostage scene in a metro isn't answered convincingly. Finally in the promise of some action come car crashes when the police travel through the busy streets of New York to deliver the ransom to Ryder but these scenes seem like last minute additions to a racy ending. The ending also includes a tear filled wife who takes a promise of her husband( Denzel) to come back home after he has delivered money to the 'terrorist'(Travolta) with a can of milk. Was this scene supposed to be perceived as comic or sentimental crap? Either ways, I am with the director on this one.It exposes the true psyche of women-"we care only about things!" Hope men got that message right. Over all the movie lacks substance if it was aimed at being a character driven movie and action if it was intentioned to be racy and fast paced. Probably then I wouldn't have begrudged the 30 dirhams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of the original had some very thoughtful twists that the earlier film did not. John Trabolta's character having a wall street background and really making much more money playing the downturn of the market caused by the news of the highjacking is one such twist. Abother is Denzel Washington's flawed character, having been accused of accepting a bribe in the recent past. It would have been such a totally more enjoyable experience for me if they didn't pepper the movie with the F word in almost every other sentence and throw in a couple of GD's as well. This is not necessary for authenticity as is evident if you watch the original 1974 version of the film.Come on Hollywood, con't you be more original and less like a high schooler when you write your dialogue?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pelham" is good enough thanks to Washington</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Your ability to enjoy "Pelham," Tony Scott's slight but serviceable thriller remake, depends on how much you can stand John Travolta hamming it up as The Villain. He's bad. Real bad. You can tell by the fact that he has evil facial hair and has a tendency to switch from gleefully ironic line readings to uncontrolled rage at a moment's notice. When Travolta plays villains he always appears to be having a ton of fun. Usually more fun than the audience. His "Pelham" baddie is almost tolerable and falls on the Travolta villain spectrum between "Battlefield Earth"--awful--and "Face/Off"--actually menacing.He shares screen time with Denzel Washington as a somewhat paunchy transit worker forced into a hostage situation he would rather avoid. There are some great scenes in the early going when we get to see Washington behind his desk directing the many trains of the New York City subway system through the use of a giant electronic display. At one point he is referred to as maestro and it's a pleasure to see someone doing a complicated, demanding job well as he directs the cars steadily on their way. These scenes are important to the film and endear you to a character that gets satisfyingly more complicated as the film wears on.Washington soon finds himself trying to negotiate on behalf of Travolta's subway hostages. The scenes at the train station are tight, interesting, and offer compelling character moments while Travolta's subway menace moments are flabby and rote. We are seeing two different films and Washington's is substantially more interesting. When the two films merge, the film speeds on to a violent climax that will not surprise any seasoned moviegoer. Tony Scott's direction is frequently distracting as his use of freeze frame and slow motion do little to heighten tension. Washington is enough of a force to keep the movie interesting and he keeps it chugging along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing movie, with great performances from its two leads!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, it would be hard to manage to pull off an adaptation of source material with not much to it like "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3". I mean, I have read the book and I thought it was pretty cool, but nothing amazing, and in the end it was just a time passer. However, one day, my girlfriend and I went to go see "The Hangover". After being unable to get tickets due to it being sold out, we decided to see "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" instead. It was opening weekend for this movie, and so we thought "if not for The Hangover, why not TTOP123?" We gave it a chance. I was a bit skeptical, since the book was satisfactory at best. I thought it had a lot of good parts, but for the most part, felt rather more like a series of explanations of characters than a story. And I thought that ending was a total WTF moment. However, much to my surprised, I ended up really loving the movie more than I thought I would! When you take a story that's disjointed, it's hard to turn it into something substantial; however Tony Scott managed to do just that. Let it be said that I am in no shape or form a fan of Scott, I enjoyed films like "Enemy of the Sate" and "Domino", but I was ultimately let down by "Déj? vu". It just felt totally dumb and lopsided, and way too complicated for its own good. Passengers on an afternoon train, Pelham 1 2 3, are just having an easy and laid-back day- that is, until Ryder and 3 other baddies come in and hijack it. They disconnect the train, leave one car on the tracks and take everyone on the train hostage. Ryder keeps in constant contact with Walter Garber, who is in the control center. Through radio, they keep in contact, and Ryder comes up with an unrealistic request- that they must have exactly $10,000,000 to them in an hour. If it doesn't get there on time, they will shoot one passenger for every minute that goes by. The Mayor, The deputy of the police dep't, and even a hostage named George (A.K.A. Geo) get involved, and lucky Geo has a laptop with a webcam, thus allowing his girlfriend who he's chatting with to get the network to tap into the connection so that this footage can be broadcast live. This movie is for 3 audiences: 1. People who love Tony Scott 2. People who are action/thriller junkies (like me) 3. People who love Denzel and/or John And if you are any of the above, it is recommended that you see this movie! Of course it's not perfect, but it's a brainless and totally fun action thriller with tons of suspense, excitement and action. However, the best things about this movie are the two leads- Denzel Washington and John Travolta. They offer amazing performances! Denzel continues his awesome acting streak as Walter Garber. He ditches his usual "Cool bad guy" style for a family man and desperate business man style and he does well, whereas Travolta manages to play a psycho very well! This has been called his "comeback role", I am not surprised. He did extremely well. So don't expect anything deep and just go in there expecting a totally fun brainless action thriller that will keep you hooked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 (2009) *** Denzel Washington, John Travolta, Luis Guzman, John Turturro, James Gandolfini, Michael Rispoli. Pretty decent remake of the '70s classic about a NYC subway hijacked by a madman (Travolta chewing up the scenery, sporting a '70s porn 'stache, neck tatts and major attitude) whose only connection to his demands of $10M ransom is a recently disgraced transit dispatcher (Washington giving fine thrust and parry with his antagonist), who must meet a one-hour deadline as the clock ticks to city-wide tension. While filmmaker Tony Scott surprisingly low-keys his usual hyperkinetic camera-work/editing of epileptic seizure heights, the screenplay- based again on John Godey's best-seller - by usually reliable Brian Helgeland has a lot of holes you could run the captured train thru (i.e. would it have killed him to give some personality to either the criminal gang and/or the hostages?!?) Despite its pitfalls including a ludicrous final act, the film runs on full-steam action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little flawed, but a good thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It begins in New York City, where subway dispatcher Walter Garber(Denzel Washington) feels he is just having an ordinary day like any other, that is until when Pelham 123 is taking over by a couple of gun crazy hoodlums led by Ryder(John Travolta) and demands if 10 millions dollars is not delivered to where they in about an hour, he will kill a passenger for every minute after the hour passes. But Ryder suddenly grows interested in Garbers background, and feels that there alike in many ways. And Garber tries to keep Ryder talking, trying to outwit him, in hopes to save the passengers, before it's too late.I didn't think anybody could steal a movie from Denzel Washington, but John travolta pulled that off. Denzel was good in his role, but Travolta really took the picture, his character was menacing, scary, and a little witty. John Turturro and James Gandolfini are also great in there supporting roles. Now this movie has its flaws, namely the tensions keeps dropping and going, one second I'm on the edge of my seat, the next minute i'm bored out of my mind. Another is the humor,now I understand some of the humor, but they brought it in at times in scenes that wasn't even needed. But still a good film none the less. I did not the original 1974 film, but I'm sure it was just as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Remake Should Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another month, another remake. Between franchise revivals and remakes, audiences are being bombarded with these flashes of the past with new twists. Well which film has been remade this time? Well the 1974 classic "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" of course! Is it better than the slew of awful remakes that have been released lately? If you haven't seen the original film, then let me brief you with a quick synopsis. A team of hijackers take over a subway car in the tunnels of New York City and demand a ransom, otherwise the hostages will die. Sounds pretty simple enough on the exterior, but what makes the film so unique is how it takes place in underground, in which the hijackers have nowhere to run. Unlike a film like Air Force One or Speed where the madmen have options if their respective plans fail, here, it appears as if the hijackers are either the stupidest criminals alive, or if they have devised the most brilliant scheme in history.As far as the remake is concerned, Denzel Washington plays the role of the subway control operator, who is forced to reason with the leader of the hijacking plan, played by John Travolta. Both actors are perfect in their roles, and the performances are both genuine and realistic. It truly feels like the events on-screen could happen in real life, and at some moments, the film is so immersive that it truly feels like it is actually happening. Even the supporting actors like the victims in the subway car seem truly authentic, and not a single character feels out of place or lacking in acting skills.What this film does have over its predecessor is action, and a helluva lot more of it. It's really hard to explain the action without giving any elements of the story away, so I'll just say that if you are an action fan, while it isn't full-fledged action and mayhem, there should be plenty to satisfy. The cinematography is also great, seeing as scenes between the hostages and the subway operator are intertwined with brilliantly executed scenes of action on the city streets and wonderful broad shots of the city. Maybe part of the reason why I love it is because I grew up near NYC, and can familiarize myself with some of the locations and settings. That's not to say though that people who live elsewhere won't get a similar experience, seeing as it's a great movie on its own. True, sometimes the camera gets overly shaky, but hey, it's a pretty fair trade for otherwise great camera shots.Pelham 123 is simply one of those films that is hard to discuss without giving things away, and since that would be a crime, I'll just leave you with my recommendation. No, it's not a perfect movie, but I think this is as good as a remake of the classic film could have ever been. It boasts a great blend of drama and action, and is entertaining and enjoyable until the nail-biting finale. Watch it, see it, view it, whatever.......Pelham 123 is worth the wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay action thriller of cat and mouse chase that's done with wit high tech intelligence and tease.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not see the original "Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" back in the 1970's, still anyway I wasn't wanting to see this new one for a classic feel of tradition. The previews and the teaming of Travolta and Washington made the film want to see combined with it's plot of a cat and mouse game of train chasing terror involving hostages. Plus the direction from Tony Scott was well done from the shooting and quotes that makes this a popcorn summer film treat to see.Set in New York City on the trains of the subway system with groups full of passengers the film teases us in a light hearted way as a young man is communicating to his girlfriend by a laptop web cam in which he can see and talk with her. And it was nice as she flashes herself to him as she looked so fine wearing a dark silk blue colored bra. Anyway as it opened with the light hearted and feel good teenage geek hormone tease. Still right away you find a group of terrorists have overtook the trains that are on the railway line of Pelham 1 2 3. As John Travolta who's criminal looking as ever is ex con Ryder who leads the rail of terror ride. As one by one his demands become more and more serious as his use of wit and charm negotiations are catchy with Denzel Washington as a mild and down on his luck dispatcher who's conflicted with the city politics of the job and he misses being away from his wife.Still as this film plots and teases well it still leads up to the action and high anticipated chasing of the film that gives the viewers some suspense and drama. It was to nice to see ex "Sopranos" star James Gandolfini as the New York city mayor who's team of advice people help lead the money negotiations with the criminals so the hostages can be set free. In the end it's your typical good guy who's conflicted(the Washington character)who saves the day from bad guy(Travolta) and the city is all at peace for the moment. Overall this film is an okay wild action ride that's a little believable as it's relevant with the terror issue still the way it's teases with wit and the action scenes are a little far drawn. Still director Tony Scott scores for his use of laptop web cams and map quest and high tech gadgets that help play out this thrill ride. "Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" is nothing great still it'a a fun ride thrill movie that has both elements of believe and disbelief in it's own way as this take was neither to raw nor nostalgic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid, nail-biting, on the edge of your seat action thriller! John Travolta is electrifying!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because I am a maniac of new technology, when re-makes of old movies come out, I have a tendency to watch the re-makes first because I like better visual effects (ex: Friday the 13th, Pelham 1 2 3, Dawn of the Dead). Now that I know that the Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is good, I will probably rent the original if I can come across a copy of it. Besides having a solid script, the actors do a magnificent job in this movie: Denzel Washington and John Turtorro are naturally skilled actors who are true to themselves in those roles, but John Travolta is just electrifying as Ryder. In fact, if I was an Oscar jury I would nominate him in the 82nd Oscar ceremony as Best supporting actor, but judging by the average reviews this movie has got, it's pretty unlikely to happen.The visual effects themselves were cool, though I have seen better. I know we are comparing two different types of movies, but Transformers Revenge of the Fallen or Terminator Salvation had much better visual effects. Still, don't watch Pelham 1 2 3 in the hopes of seeing big shooting scenes: It is a well-made thriller that has enough action to captivate you and get you on the edge-of your seat. People, it is shocking to know that this movie is not making more money than it is right now...Go watch it RIGHT NOW! P-S: don't leave your brain at home, keep it with you for once. Have Fun!</fullReview>

As civil service employee Walter Garber, Denzel Washington does a good job of alternating between cool guy and hero of the day. John Travolta is excellent as Ryder, the guy who hijacks the train, is absolutely spectacular. Both Washington and Travolta are thrilling, and also their own honesty. The movie takes a refreshing turn from the 1974 version. In the 1974 version, it was like old-fashioned social satire. Now they made it into a hip, new action thriller. This is a truly excellent film with a great twist. The true delight of this film is watching these two exchange words not knowing who the other really is. They make for some touching moments in which Walter is forced to sacrifice a little something to be the hero of the day. The small parts such as James Gandolfini as the distressed mayor and John Turturro as Camonetti as well as the always reliable Luis Guzman as fellow hi-jacker Phil Ramos make the movie count. A great movie... go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but does not eclipse the 1973 original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one has not seen the original 1973 edition of this remake of a remake, then you will probably like this movie very much. The problem is that this movie IS a remake of a remake, and shows it. Trying to update the story for a contemporary audience just cheapens the plot and makes it seems contrived, unlike the original that did not require all the noise and chaos shown in this movie to sustain the plot. The major problem with this story is that the main criminal, played convincingly by John Travolta in one of his better performances, actually has a reasonable rationale for wanting to terrorize the city. Okay, the crime is outrageous but he has a motive for doing what he does, unlike in the original movie where motive is irrelevant and where the crime itself is the story and where the players are anonymous, making their audacious crime seem that much more perplexing and sinister. In this movie the audience soon finds out the identity of the terrorists which takes away their aura of invincibility. In the original, the audience is told very little about the identities of the bad guys (with the exception of the motorman, and even with him, all the audience finds out is that he's a motorman, period). One part of the movie that is an improvement over the original is the portrayal of the mayor, ably played by James Gandofini. Here the mayor becomes much more directly involved in the story which actually strengthens the plot as the mayor is soon revealed as being utterly powerlessness to do anything despite his authority, thus further empowering the John Travolta character. Denzel Washington plays a lead role but surprisingly does not dominate this movie, which is actually dominated by John Travolta whose strong performance raises this movie from the level of mediocrity to good. But in no way does this remake of a remake eclipse the 1973 original, starring Robert Shaw, Walter Matthau, Martin Balsam and Hector Elizondo, which remains a classic. By the way, although a wonderful actor and despite winning the Academy Award for Best Actor, Denzel Washington is no Walter Matthau and John Travolta, despite his strong performance in this movie, is no Robert Shaw, whose performances set the standard for this genre of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A real thriller, it has been a long time that I could say a movie had me on the edge of my seat. The Taking of Pelham 123 did just that and much more. It re-affirmed my belief in the acting abilities of Denzel Washington and John Travolta. I was truly impressed with the humanity that they brought to their characters and the chemistry between the two.And how about that kick-ass makeup on old Johnny boy huh? Travolta looked every bit like a convict, I was amazed by it. Weathered face as if he has been through it a few times, prison tat, and the eyes, yes the "I don't trust any one of you mother----s" eyes, what a movie! Director Tony Scott is new to me so when the film began with Jay-Z's 99 Problems and the framing being similar to that of a comic book movie, I got a bit concerned. Action was contrasted against blurry backgrounds, the cast of characters were flashed frame by frame and it was all so strange to me I really did not know what to expect. Fortunately once Jay-Z finished, the imagery slowed down and we are introduced to Mr. Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) and the beginning of what will be the longest day of his life.Synopsis (Skip this paragraph if you hate spoilers) Ryder (John Travolta) is a hardened criminal who has teamed up with some friends to hi-jack a train. His plans are to hold the people on board hostage and demand a large sum of money from the city. To do this, he singles out a cab, detaches it from the rest and makes a phone call to the controllers in order to place his demands. Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) is the man who receives the call. Garber is a seasoned officer of the Subway system, recently demoted to being a comptroller. The two men engage in conversation that goes beyond hostage demands and into a form of familiarity and bonding that turns into a mental Chess match. This is because Ryder isn't a dumb criminal, far from it, he is a brilliant man and this fact makes his demands even more dangerous. None of the police's strategies in hostage negotiation, or tactics in special operations are above his methodology. When the heat gets turned up and three people are dead on the train, Ryder demands one last thing, he wants Garber to bring him the money personally. And this is just half of the movie.The entire movie is a mental game, Ryder is beyond intelligent and Garber has a way with words. Their conversations were so well done I felt it could only be better if Travolta didn't insist on saying mother----r so many times. It just didn't sound natural coming from him (he is no Samuel L.), he was seriously in character the entire time though and his little quips and racial epithets were enough to break your tension with a chuckle or two. Denzel Washington was outside of the "cool Denzel" we have seen so many times and was clumsy, overweight and seemed genuinely disturbed when talking to Ryder. There was one scene that stood out to me when he called his wife to coolly try and explain to her why he was in the middle of a hostage negotiation, bumbling his way through it but getting it done nonetheless.The supporting cast was nothing to ignore either, with John Turturro playing Officer Camonetti, the hostage negotiator and James Gandolfini playing the nameless mayor. With this many Italian actors you would think that the pizza jokes would be spared but Travolta's Ryder is apparently not a fan of Italians at all. Throwing around slurs and jokes at Camonetti any time the two were on the phone together. The cinematography was solid, music fit the situation and the plot easy to follow. The Direction was spot on and not once did I feel taken astray from the task at hand.Listen, if you really, really like smart movies with a sprinkling of action thrown in (think Heat or The Departed) then you need to see The Taking of Pelham 123. It seems to be a growing trend these days to pair up large actors and it is a good one since if everything fails, you still get good character portraits. This movie delivered in suspense, good direction and most of all entertainment. Aside from Travolta's dialogue throwing me off at times, it is damn near flawless in anything I can say about it. A very "human" movie, I recommend you go see it yourself, it will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Adversaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story about the hijacking of a subway train is getting its third telling. The two succeeding ones have had plot differences with the original classic that pitted Transit cop Walter Matthau with head hijacker Robert Shaw.This version of The Taking of Pelham 123 has Denzel Washington not as a transit cop, but the station manager and the Grand Central command headquarters. As he's the one who answers the call from hijacker John Travolta, Travolta fixates on Washington and tries to develop a relationship with him of sorts. I'm sure this wasn't what Washington had in mind when he went to work that day.Washington's in a bad situation, the Transit Authority has no confidence in him because of charges pending, but Transit Cop John Turturro has to deal with him, play the hand Travolta is dealing so to speak.The biggest difference between this and the original Pelham was in the hijacker's character. Robert Shaw was one cool operator under pressure, the rest of his team less so, but he doesn't let anything rattle him. Even when he kills it's a matter of purely business.Travolta is one loose cannon who flies off the handle with little discernible provocation. That's the main problem with this version. The plot goes well beyond this hijacking, in fact the key to the film is who Travolta is and what he did in his past. And someone that crazy would not be doing what he did before. Nevertheless Travolta and Washington make an interesting pair of adversaries. And the action sequences are well done with the computer graphics not available for the first one.Still I miss Walter Matthau and that never to be forgotten expression on his face as the first Pelham ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Will "Train" You-Taking of Pelham 123 ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Highest rating to this taut thriller involving a psycho (John Travolta) who has a grudge against the city government and society and therefore takes a train hostage with 18 passengers on board.Denzel Washington also stars as demoted dispatcher who is under suspicion for taking a bribe.My one flaw with this film is how a hostage negotiator would let Washington leave after he established a rapport with Travolta.That being said, we have a very fast paced film as the police zoom to deliver the $10 million ransom demanded by Travolta and his gang.What makes the film so good is that with Washington being under suspicion, you think at times that he may have been in cahoots with the hostage taker.The hostages themselves are pretty calm considering the gravity of the situation. Only some mayhem occurs when the train is left in motion unattended.At a time like this, this may have not been the best time to make a film about this;however, it was made and it is exciting, a nail biter all the way to the unpredictable ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, bad script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not expect anything from this movie and I'm glad I didn't. Otherwise I would be extremely disappointed. Also, I haven't seen the original.The acting is really good. John Travolta is extremely believable as this really violent and coldblooded maniac who doesn't hesitate to kill the hostages. Denzel Washington does also a great job as Garber, although Travolta definitely steals the show. Travolta and Washington have a good "chemistry" between them and I would definitely want to see more movies with them in the lead.But the script is bad. Firstly, what's the point of James Gandolfini's character? His NYC major was just plain irritating with his attitude and comments. Okay, maybe you don't care about NYC and all you really want to do is drink cocktails on a tropical island, but there's should be enough humanity in everybody to care about the hostages. Well, he didn't care. Secondly, what's with the coincidences? At the end of the movie when Garber is chasing Ryder he accidentally sees him walking just past him. The bridge is who-knows-how-long and they happen to be in the same place at the same time? I don't think so. Thirdly, Ryder was an intelligent man. No way he would have let Garber just shoot him. So the ending was extremely disappointing. And Garber - okay, he wanted to redeem himself after taking the bribe, but run around in NYC with a gun and chase a homicidal maniac? And lastly, when I read the plot summary, the movie seemed to be about the mysterious way they are going to escape, but there was nothing special there. I kept waiting for some kind of twist that never came. Maybe I'm not used to "simple" films anymore.Watch it if you are a big fan of Travolta or Washington, but otherwise skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A exciting, on the edge of your seat thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignore the bad publicity about this movie. I have seen it twice in two days. Haven't seen the original Pelham 123 so it was new to me. The best part they showed the original on a local TV channel this weekend and there is no comparison. The new Pelham is hip and cool. And the great cast just put it over the top. If you want to sit on the edge of your seats and cheer for the good guys just take a few hours off and gather your popcorn and drink...choose a good theater with comfy chairs but be prepared not to sit on them long...(I sat on the edge of mine many times) love it love it...Travolta is mean and smart..Washington is cool and brave....it is all very possible.....If I were a subway rider I would take a second look at the folks riding with me...friend or foe?....what a brilliant idea....I hope it doesn't happen.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining nothing more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall kind of disappointing movie. I was definitely expecting more from a remake, especially with John Travolta and Denzel Washington as main characters. I was however impressed by the way it was filmed. Jagged camera, blurry shots, more like a documentary. Special effects are good as well and worth seeing, especially that police car running through the city of New York, very impressive. Overall entertaining nothing more, the kind of movie which is good enough for a Friday night if you do have nothing else to do in town... the movie end is kind of obvious no big surprises. A movie for rent, no need to go to a movie theater for that...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting and movie updated to 21st C</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Travolta and Washington made this movie work. Their acting was superb. Some say they were miscast; I say no, they acted out their parts. I almost did NOT see this movie for I really do not like to see Travolta as the bad guy. YET,he was so unbelievably great in this movie I am so glad I saw it. The plot was updated to fit the 21st century technology, which made it where we could relate to it and it was believable. The ending was so different from the original 70s movie. I see so many negative reviews, however, I feel one should ignore the reviews and see it for themselves and then make a judgment. If nothing else you will enjoy Travolta and Washington.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked this much better than the original 1974 version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did my summary surprise you.I will tell you why. The original film had stereotypical, and embarrassing offensive characters. The settings were unrealistic overly neat &amp; clean.It was neither suspenseful nor exciting.Now many are saying the same thing about the current film.NOTE-my rating is only a 7, which means its a good but not a great film, It does have its own faults. ( see below for rating note)Tony Scott a known director of this type film does himself proud with Brian Hedgeland screenplay, which was taken from John Godoy's novel.Its the same story, a few bad guys hi-jack a subway train for ransom &amp; the MTA team trying to save the passengers. This basic outline has been done since Movies first appeared.It still holds your interest.Denzel Washington creates a much deeper character than Walter Matthau did the first time, John Travolta is more psychotic &amp; more profane than Robert Shaw was in the original.I felt that both Denzel &amp; John were somewhat more interesting.(They always are.)The ever reliable John Turturro is great as the Hostage team investigator.(this role was not in the original).James Gandolfini is the Mayor of New York &amp; is nowhere as stupid as the character was in the 1974 film.Tony Scott moves the actors &amp; action at a fast clip, which is his usual style. There are a few needless lines,&amp; situations.As mentioned earlier there is much profanity mostly from John Travolta's mouth.This could have been a better film, BUT it still is more interesting than the needless comic moments in the 1974 film,Ratings: *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)**NOTE: 84 points needed for an 8 rating. On my scoring system .a rating of 7 can be either a **1/2 or a *** film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, Great plot - Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" (2009) is an absolutely brilliant film. I truly enjoyed watching every minute of it. I have only rated seven movies 10/10 so far and this is one of them - certainly up there as one of the best movies ever. John Travolta and Denzel Washington play their parts brilliantly. If it weren't for the great acting in this movie then the movie would obviously not be as good. The direction was also good. For a movie to get 10/10 you need the movie to be good all round (plot, acting, effects, direction etc.) - and this movie is definitely great all round.This movie is about a group of four criminals who hijack a New York City Subway train and holds the passengers in one of the carriages as hostages. The criminals demand $10 million by 3:13pm or they will kill one passenger every minute the money is late.I really enjoyed this movie and I think anyone who loves a good thrill and enjoys movies about crime and action will. I would definitely recommend anyone to give this movie a watch. I am definitely going to buy the DVD for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsatisfactory remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What did I expect. Hollywood hasn't really produced a good remake in awhile. Maybe they should stop? Originality always helps! Denzel and Travolta give okay performances and Tony Scott puts in a few tense moments, but where is the danger and the action? About 30 minutes into the film I stopped caring about any of the characters. After MAN ON FIRE &amp; DEJA VU, I really expected something that puts us in the story and keeps the thrills and guesses coming. Oh well. Not every Denzel flick is going to be great right? I liked how Travolta's story could relate to our economic troubles, but beyond his motives were too many subplots that didn't make PELHAM very exciting. And I've always relied on Tony Scott to deliver a powerhouse film. But, like I said, not every film can be perfect. I still look forward to the next Denzel/Scott collaboration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Taking of Pelham 123</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Tony Scott (Top Gun, True Romance, Enemy of the State), brother of Sir Ridley, I saw the trailer for this remake of the classic Robert Shaw/Walter Matthau film, and I quite looked forward to seeing it actually. Basically it follows the same plot line, where four criminals (not using colour names like Reservoir Dogs, like in the original) led by Ryder (John Travolta) hijacking New York, Manhattan subway train Pelham 123, which they stop on its journey, and disconnect into two carriages. Train dispatcher Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) gets into contact with the criminal leader, who is demanding $10,000,000 within an hour to release the seventeen passengers they are holding hostage, and one dies every minute past the deadline. While the authorities get the Mayor (James Gandolfini) both to get the money and to talk to Ryder, they try to find out more about him, and he will only talk to Garber. The money is going to be paid, causing the stock market to collapse, and it does eventually arrive, with Ryder changing his plan and demanding to meet and have Garber deliver the cash bags. So Garber heads down and delivers the money, but manages to sneak a gun out of one of the bags, and after all the other criminals have been killed, only Ryder remains for Garber to deal with. Also starring Luis Guzmán as Phil Ramos, Victor Gojcaj as Bashkim, Gbenga Akinnagbe as Lieutenant Wallace, John Turturro as Camonetti and Ramon Rodriguez as Delgado. Washington isn't too bad, and obviously Travolta storms as the villain, I think the critics got this a little wrong, obviously this isn't as fun as the original, but more hype and some good thrilling moments can't fail. Worth watching!</fullReview>
