		<shortDescription>film student's action picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many disappointing action pictures out there ? this is not one of them. The genius of the film is there is no wasted motion. The picture starts right with the plot ? no introduction or character development. The characters are allowed to develop as the plot moves along.Which brings us to pacing ? the pacing in this picture is excellent. It moves right along and never stops, never slows, never goes too fast. This is the strongest element of its success.Another strength is its economy of motion. Many action pictures bore us with unneeded car chase scenes, shoot-em-ups, explosions and other mayhems that are used as filler when true creativity comes up short. This film needs none of that. Only that which is necessary is shown. Only that which needs speaking is spoken. This film is deftly written and crafted with great economy and this underpins the excellent pacing. It moves right along because there is no wasted motion as there is in most other action pictures.This does not mean there is no action, there is fabulous action, but only such action as is necessary to move the plot along. There is no action simply to occupy time until the requisite 90 minutes are up.The directing is equally economical. No fancy shots, shaky cameras, or special effects ? just good, straight forward directing.I doubt this picture could be made today for the above reasons. The script readers would reject it for 'lack of development'; 'not enough action'; 'no romantic interest'; and all the other brainless formulas script readers dole out. The producers would demand 'more action' and 'camera work' from the directors. And, of course, a romantic interest (in some state of undress) would have to be shoe horned in.Film students should study this picture. From it they will learn that brevity is a virtue and mindless formulas are just that - mindless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filled with exciting moments and heart-pounding suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sharp and fast-paced thriller that follows an easy-going N.Y.C. transit cop (Walter Matthau) who's forced to out-match the wits of four well-armed gunmen and their resilient leader (Robert Shaw) who are holding eighteen passengers on a subway train and demand one million dollars within the hour.Made in the era of smart, stylish, and ingenius thrillers ('70s), this film didn't fail to loose my attention at all. In addition to Matthau and Shaw, the supporting cast (Hector Elizondo, Martin Balsam, Jerry Stiller, Tony Roberts, and so forth) is are just as excellent as the two unflappable leads. This well-polished crime movie is filled with exciting moments and heart-pounding suspense. Plus, there are some quirky one-liners thrown into the story as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite crime drama of the '70s. Maybe ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the other plot summaries written here, I won't go into what this film is all about. I just want to say that I don't believe this genre has been done better, either before or since. I first saw "Pelham 1,2,3" when I was 14 at a drive-in theater in Northern CA. It holds a memorable place for me as the first R rated movie I ever saw, as well as the first time I ever heard the "F" word in a movie. But way beyond that, I was so completely sucked into the story even at my young age. Now all these years later, I still am. I own the movie and must see it periodically. I'm so glad, reading all the other user comments, to find that I'm just one of many who absolutely love this film. Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw, Martin Balsam, and the rest of the cast are all brilliant. The comedy in the film is also outstanding and never out of place within the storyline. It simply serves to make the film more realistic. And last but not least, David Shire's score is the coolest. I only wish they had put a soundtrack out for this film. When I watch this movie, the music must be cranked.Don't bother catching this film on TV. It's always completely hacked up. Rent it or buy the DVD. It will remind you just how much fun movies used to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Thrill!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I put this one on and watch it, I feel like I'm sitting in the front seat of a bad-a** roller coaster about to go on the ride of my life. This movie grabs you by the neck and forces you down into the dirty, dank subway and onto that terror-filled car. New York City in the '70s; what joy! This movie feels gritty and almost has a semi-documentary smell to it. The acting is top-notch; Matthau's Garber and Shaw's 'Mr. Blue' play a nice little game of mental cat-and-mouse that will please even the most cynical viewer. Oh, one more thing... the theme music rocks out loud!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best heist film of all time!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of heavily armed men, all wearing the same disguises board a subway train underneath the streets of New York. They quickly take over the train and hold seventeen passengers hostage. They look and talk like professionals. They use codenames. Their ransom demand is One Million Dollars. Are these just maniacs without a plan? And if they do have a plan, how are they all going to escape alive while the world watches?Right away, this film grabs you and doesn't let go. Every character plays their role remakably and memorably. Enough suspense to keep you chewing your nails until they are stubs...and most of all, a realistic and engrossing storyline. You will literally be on the edge of your seat, wondering where the next plot twist will take you.You can easily see where Quentin Tarantino borrowed ideas from this movie to make Reservoir Dogs...and in my opinion, this film makes Reservior Dogs look like a second rate film. Its truly a shame most people aren't familiar with this movie and it doesn't have the allure or big star power to draw in new fans seeking out a great film to watchIf you happen to run across The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three though, do not pass it up! This is honestly the best heist movie I've ever seen. 10 out of 10 Rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much imitated, never bettered.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern tough-guy filmmakers like Quentin Tarentino acknowledge their debt to this pedal-to-the-metal thriller, directed by Joseph Sargent from John Godey's bestseller. Walter Matthau is a hoot as the savvy NY transit cop who's smarter than he looks, well-matched by Robert Shaw as the icy mercenary whose gang has hijacked a subway car for a one-million-dollar ransom. This film's been imitated so often because its makers were really at the top of their game. Owen Roizman (THE FRENCH CONNECTION) handled the gritty location photography; scripter Peter Stone contributed terse, funny dialogue; scene-stealers like Martin Balsam, Jerry Stiller, Dick O'Neill and others made their roles indelible; and David Shire's percussive score set a standard for the genre.The ending is classic. When you have Matthau as your star, this is how to end your movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another example of why the 70's was the finest decade for films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is my belief that the finest era for films was the 1970's. Consider all the classics that were produced in that era (Godfather I and II, Patton, The Sting, Jaws, Mean Streets, The Exorcist, The French Connection, Star Wars etc). My belief was recently validated by Jodie Foster, who essentially said the same thing. One of the reasons why the films were great was that the directors were ostensibly in control of the films, rather than by a committee of the usual Hollywood "insiders" who think they know what people want to see, but rarely make the correct decisions.I know that this film was re-made( for TV)--God knows why--but I'm sure if they attempted another film version Matt Damon would be playing the grizzled transit police cop (Matthau's role) and Jude Law would be playing the Robert Shaw role. That's another reason why the original and other films of the 70's were so great: the casting was more believable. Today Hollywood is so incredibly youth-obsessed that actors are completely miscast.I am not stating that this is another 70's classic, but even this film is far superior to many of today's films. And yet, I'll bet you couldn't find "Pelham" in your local video store.I love several things about this film. The first thing to hit you is that wonderful, funky score that in some parts sounds like controlled chaos. I love the script, which is not completely dark despite the underlying theme, as there are some very funny moments throughout the film: for instance, the chagrined look on Matthau's face when he discovers the Japanese visitors can speak English. There are many examples of mistaken identity in this film: the supervisor who is gunned down is called "goombah", but he isn't Italian; Matthau thinks the black police captain is white over the radio; Matthau mistakes the long-haired undercover cop (who was shot on the train tracks) for a female. I also love the character who plays the mayor, who unbelievably bears a striking resemblance to Mayor Koch, who was elected 3 years later!!!! All in all a great action film, and one that will hold up for years.Addendum: Well, they're doing it--they're re-making this film because Hollywood is almost completely bereft of new ideas (see "Josie and the Pussycats" "Bewitched" the upcoming "I Dream of Jeannie"). I half-expect they will remake "The Paper Chase" next with P.Diddy as Professor Kingsfield.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was meant to be Carry On At Your Convenience...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... Thank Goodness it wasn't!I switched on me TV last night after an evening out and the opening credits of Pelham was just finishing. Not knowing the name of this film (the Carry On listing was clearly not being shown, perhaps the Producer-dude had a revelation of taste!) I began to watch it half-heartedly, whilst prostrate on the sofa.By the end of the movie, and that glorious last look from Matthau, I was sitting blot-upright with the biggest grin I've had on my face at 2am for a long time!What a flick! What a film! How good was this simple, little, under-rated, under-stated movie? Very.See this film, forgive it for being written in the 70-ties, in fact revel in that non-PC fact (the Chinese/Lady jokes are, retrospectively, quite amusing, in a non-Carry On way).They just don't make 'um like this anymore. Simple, sweet, suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pelham 1-2-3 is in motion"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite films from the seventies is The Taking of Pelham One, Two Three because it's so New York. Of course the film was shot entirely on location in The Big Apple including the interiors which helped greatly. But more than that, the characters have all the New York flavor about them with one exception.The cat of course is led by Walter Matthau who plays a Transit Police Lieutenant. His character is a kind of combination of Archie Bunker and Detective Lennie Briscoe from Law and Order, in many ways not terribly admirable. He's also a transit cop and at that time the Transit Police were a separate entity. They were merged into the regular NYPD during the Giuliani administration. There's no real glory in the Transit Police, these guys were mostly charged with dealing with drunks and kids with loud boom boxes. If a homicide ever occurred the NYPD quickly took it over as they would in most situations. But this ongoing crisis on a train on the Lexington Avenue Local occurs on his watch and it's career make or break case that Matthau is very aware of. And he proves fully capable during the crisis.The crisis is four men, Robert Shaw, Earl Hindman, Hector Elizondo, and Martin Balsam mount a carefully planned assault on a subway train out of Pelham Bay station in the Bronx in mid-Manhattan and hold it and the passengers for ransom for a million dollars. The outsider to New York is Robert Shaw in one of his best roles, a former British army officer and mercenary. During the course of the robbery they kill a station supervisor played by roly poly Tom Pedi, one very quintessential New Yorker and their coldblooded villainy is established.In fact the whole cast is a microcosm of the ethnic strains of New York City which makes the film so enjoyable, especially to one who lived there, the first 49 years of his life. Even the mayor is portrayed as a weak, fumbling nonentity and back then our mayor was one Abraham D. Beame who was just that, probably one of the worst mayors the city ever had. Tony Roberts has a very good role as the tough as nails Deputy Mayor concerned about both his boss's political career and resolving the crisis.The Taking of Pelham One Two Three once the hijack is done is suspense filled and doesn't let up for a moment. I can't give the ending away, but the final shot of Walter Matthau's face as the end title music starts and the credits begin to roll is priceless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great NYC flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am biased a little with this film to begin with, as I live in NYC and am a big subway fan. So a gritty 70's flick that takes place in a NYC subway sounds good to me! But the truth is, this film is a great film full of extremely talented actors with a dynamite story. Shaw and Matthau are the obvious stars with everyone else putting in a good co-starring role.The story takes place on the "6" train no less, which happens to be my fave subway line! It was a great surprise when I found the DVD for only ten bucks, I would have paid a normal price. And the quality of the DVD transfer is VERY nice. The film, though a bit brutal sometimes, even has some decent humor, even the ending is kinda funny, but perfect. I recently watched this on TV, just to compare the two versions and see where all the cuts and edits were. You can't go wrong with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to convince anybody today that they could make a thriller/hijack movie with a bunch of middle age actors all men, with a lot of dialog, no cute women wearing tank tops and most of it being seen in either a dull looking subway carriage or else a grim looking New York city subway dispatchers office, ----- they would say that your out of your mind! Well they did way back in 1974, of course it would have to be that far back! All in all absorbing viewing with a great bunch of 70's character actors.Four men dressed very much in a similar fashion, i.e. horn rim glasses, trilbies, khaki gabardine raincoats and a fake mustache decide to hold hostage a carriage full of bewildered passengers who resemble New York finest type of freak show. A pimp, a foul mouthed hooker, a drunk, a bag lady, a wino well I could go on, you know what I mean! They were led by Mr. Blue played by Robert Shaw a cool no nonsense and ruthless former British army type/mercenary who when his lucrative work dried up decided to use his skills to rob or extort one-million dollars to keep up with the lifestyle he had become accustomed to. He was backed up by a mafia reject, the crazed and unpredictable Mr. Gray who couldn't wait to show who was boss and was keen to rack up a body count, or as he put it "get on the scoreboard"! He didn't like to take orders and it took a lot to keep him in line. There was Mr. Brown and lastly Mr Blue who was a former transit employee who held a grudge against the authority and wasn't satisfied with his pension.Lieutenant Garber was the head of the transit security played by Walter Matthau who found himself the unfortunate go between or negotiator during the hostage stage. His New York dialect and humor was a great contrast to the methodical leader of the gang with the English accent who took himself very seriously and was prepared to kill anybody at any time in cold blood. Admittedly this type of negotiation would be ridiculous today, he wasn't even in anyway qualified to negotiate with the hijackers. Also, Garber not only had deal with Mr. Green but also found himself up against one of the head dispatchers who couldn't care less about the predicament of the hijacked passengers but was more concerned about getting his trains running on time. This approach would not cut it today 30 years on, hostage taking requires a more professional approach. However, he does his best and on a couple of occasions his quick thinking is able to save the lives of some the hostages.Anyway the crooks only wanted money, there was no political reason, but were highly motivated, very well organized and determined. This was understood very quickly when one of the subway station managers Caz Dolowicz or known as "fat Caz" took exception to these upstarts and decided berate the hijackers and board the train. Just to prove that the hijackers meant business they gave him a 'lead breakfast' and he was ripped apart by the hail of bullets discharged from an automatic weapon which made him look like a swiss cheese! It's great viewing, quite entertaining and has a very typical but jazzy 1970's music score that accompanies the movie. I would highly recommend this film, 70's movies don't get more interesting or as watch able as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly gripping despite glum production...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Shaw leads a group of stooges in the violent hijacking of a New York subway train; Walter Matthau is the acerbic transit police officer who assigns himself to the case. Nearly-perfect urban thriller adapted by the ingenious Peter Stone from John Godey's book. The atmosphere is charged with tension; one can almost taste the grit in the air and sense the palpable dread, though the film isn't quite the downer its beige-and-gray production makes it appear to be. Screenwriter Stone displays his darkly comedic sense of humor in several instances, leading to a fabulous conclusion. Curiously, some professionals critics were put off by the film, yet the suspense is sustained remarkably by director Joseph Sargent, and Matthau is priceless. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Aboard for this Classic Riveting Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolute classic thriller from the 1970's. Walter Matthau headlines a superb cast in this adrenaline charged, roller coaster ride. Matthau is excellent as an everyman thrust into the pivotal position of negotiating with a lunatic who along with his cohorts has hijacked a New York City subway train.Robert Shaw is truly magnificent as the villainous mastermind behind the subway train takeover. But, the magic truly starts to simmer in the high tension interplay between Matthau and Shaw as the ruthless killer demands his money while Matthau attempts to achieve the safe release of the victims.Each of the heavies in this picture are identified by colors Mr. Green, Grey and so on; a plot point which inspired director Quentin Tarantino in his debut film Reservoir DOGS. A solid crew of character actors round out this picture including Jerry Stiller as a transit worker in Matthau's department, Martin Balsam is terrific as one of the hijackers with a terrible case of the sniffles. Hector Elizondo, in a very early role, really makes an impression as an unhinged thug who is more than eager to execute anyone who crosses him.Character actor Lee Wallace is memorable as the New York Mayor particularly for his striking resemblance to New York Mayor Ed Koch. New York City is used to great effect here especially during a frantic sequence featuring a police car making a crucial delivery. The back and forth plotting between the stalled train and the pressure ridden Transit Authority headquarters with Matthau attempting to appease the hijackers is crisply edited and creates wonderful balance in this high stakes thriller. During a decade that featured some of the best movies ever made, this one is a jewel not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling heist movie and a love letter to the New York City of our imaginations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a splendid film from a time when exciting movies still tried to mirror the real world instead of mimicking amusement park rides.On an ordinary day in that most extraordinary city of New York, 4 men hijack a subway car. Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw) is the leader of the gang, a precise and icy military man with no war to fight anymore. Mr. Brown (Earl Hindman) is one of his old comrades-in-arms. Mr. Green (Martin Balsam) is a disgraced subway motorman. Mr. Grey (Hector Elizondo) is a foolish and cocky former mob hit-man. They plan to hold the subway car and its 17 passengers hostage until the city gives them one million dollars. Opposing them are New York City transit police lieutenants Zachary Garber and Rico Patrone (Walter Matthau and Jerry Stiller), whose goals are to keep the hostages alive and figure out how the hijackers plan to escape from an underground tunnel surrounded by dozens and dozens of cops. But the dangerous and deadly crime drama has to share equal billing with a sprawling cast that embodies 1970s New York.That cast and their marvelous performances are really the standout element of The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. It's not just Robert Shaw's cerebral precision as Mr. Blue or Walter Matthau's street smart practicality as Garber, virtually ever actor shines like a star when they're on screen. They're not just playing individual roles. They're playing the entire city of New York in all its facets - bold, angry, jaded, fearless, racist, profane, impatient, selfish, selfless, sometimes broken but never bowed. This is the New York that everyone loves, even the people who wouldn't want to live there. This is a New York where every day is a battle and every New Yorker is a battler. Even if the rest of the film was terrible, the atmosphere and personality of these characters would be worth seeing by itself.But the rest of it is just as good. The plot is clever, well thought out and fast moving. The direction is unpretentious but affecting. Many big screen films from the 70s look like TV movies by today's standards. That's not the case with The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. The story generates tension and suspense without having to resort to cartoonish levels of violence or emotional hysteria. This is also a pretty funny movie, though none of the humor is jammed into the script just to get a laugh. It's the humor that real people use as a shield and a sword against the challenges they face in real life.As you may know, they did a remake of this. I haven't seen it and I certainly don't plan on it now after having seen the original. I'd bet money that the remake is bigger, louder, faster and more extravagant in every way than its predecessor. But I'd also bet money the remake is harsh everywhere the original is smooth, overwrought everywhere it's refined and aggressive everywhere it's inviting. Hollywood still tells good stories, but it seems to have lost the talent for telling this sort of story well. Action movies are now spectacles that assault you as you sit in the theater. The Taking of Pelham One Two Three creates a fuller and more varied experience that excites you without requiring you to turn off your brain.When people say they don't make movies like that any more, this is the kind of movie they're talking about. If you've never understood what that saying meant, watch this film and be enlightened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three (1974) is one of the best movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three (1974) is one of the best movies ever made.It has everything.Great acting, great writing, great music, great camera work, great direction, and a setting in what in 1974 was definitely the world's greatest city (since changed, and not at all as good or as important for many different reasons....this is written in 2009).Counting all the ways this movie is good, and going into detail about why it's good would (and should) take volumes not appropriate to this WWW.IMDb.Com "Comments" section of the IMDb.Com page for the movie. The movie deserves its own book, and ranks right up there with Citizen Kane (1941) as a movie so good, there's no way to say how good it is.The use of comedy inter-cut with tension and true tragedy was never done better in any movie, and highlights how important the unlikely marriage of comedy and horror is when it's done well.The James Whale 1930's horror movies (two Frankenstein movies and the Invisible Man movie) do this well, and so did better class sci-fi space travel movies (Destination Moon in 1950 had a comic passenger very important to the film).I was born in New York City, and lived there several times in my life, and I'm partial to the unique wise-guy, one-oneupmanship humor found nowhere else, and brilliant when it's done well.In The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three (1974), New York City wise-guy humor is done well....the timing, the straight face delivery of outrageous blandness, the irony, the put-down humor.....only New Yorkers could and have come up with comedy like this.They did it when New York City was truly a city which included people of all backgrounds and income levels, all part of the city's life, all players. Sadly, that is no longer true.New York City in the 21st century has become a city made of up permanent residents who include embarrassingly rich people and desperately poor people who live in the non-Manhattan boroughs, except for Staten Island, also known on maps as "Richmond" (New York City is, collectively, made up of five different "boroughs" including Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and "Richmond" also known as Staten Island, for non-New Yorkers who may not know). A commuter population mostly from northern New Jersy south of the Hudson River pour into Manhattan daily to do working class jobs once done relatively recently by Manhattan and other NYC borough residents.The movie's funniest and best actor is Tom Pedi, famous for the late 1950's "Dash" soap commercials on TV, and a great character actor. He plays an outrageous, outraged long time supervisor worker on the New York subway system named "Cas Dolowitz," and his performance is incredible.Tom Pedi as "Cas Dolowitz" plays a proletarian character of dignity, importance, interest, and charisma....not just a piece of background actor scenery decorating scenes dominated by "beautiful people" main actors.The is a proletarian movie in very important and unusual ways few other films ever are.In a sense, every one of the actors in The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three (1974) are character actors, and this defines the movie importantly, and makes it one of the greatest movies about common people in one of the world's biggest cities ever made.---------------------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

		<shortDescription>Classic 70's thriller with a edge of comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of criminals highjack a subway train and demand $1 million from New York City. Transit cop, Lt. Garber tries to work the situation out, but it seems the gang have planned everything to the second and are running the show. Garber tries to get one step ahead of the gang.Of course now everyone knows this film because of the supposed connection to Reservoir Dogs, in that the criminals are colour coded instead of names. However even without this cult reference this film deserves to be watched and enjoyed. The story exists on two levels. First we have the setup ? it also acknowledges that it is the usual disaster movie setup?.the majority of characters are listed in the credits as stereotypes instead of people (ie, `the pimp' `the junkie' etc). However this is not a weakness as the thriller story is solid enough to carry the film. It isn't all action but it's very tense and interesting. What really tops it off is the thick vein of humour that runs through it ? mostly coming from Matthau.Matthau shows how wonderful he is and how he manages to do well in so many different film styles. His world-weary act is great and his Brooklyn accent is pushed to the fore. Roberts Shaw is also good, but has less of a character and is working hard to sound English. The cast is actually deep in faces ? we have an almost unrecognisable Elizondo, Woody Allen actor Tony Roberts, a fantastic Mayor from Wallace and Jerry Stiller (Ben's dad), who doesn't look much older today than he did then!Overall this is very enjoyable, but it is made by Matthau. The thriller plot stands up well despite the lack of modern fireworks. A cult classic in the making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The print I always manage to catch is tinted a gloomy blue but that's okay. The movie is worth watching anyway. The story line is familiar enough that I won't bother going over it much. The notion that the thieves should name themselves after colors -- Mr. Brown, Mr. Green -- was adopted by Tarantino for "Reservoir Dogs," of course, as every Turturro addict knows. I should point out that the novel is at least as good as the film because the author occasionally uses an omniscient point of view and we get some better notion of what the participants in this caper are feeling. The confrontation between the African-American kid and Robert Shaw on the subway platform is more amusing, for instance. In the film, the kid glares at Shaw, and Shaw can only smile back. In the novel we are taken inside the kid's head and invited to play with him the game that he plays with people like Shaw. He has this idea, you see, that if he stares at some stranger with this particularly menacing expression, "he HYPMOTIZE him!" As it turns out, Shaw is nobody to play games with. In deciding whom to execute, Shaw looks around the car and thinks about the flat-out drunken woman. She'd be the least missed. But on the other hand, "who am I to play God." The exposition in the novel is clumsy but adds to our understanding of what's going on. We get more information about how many cars there are on a subway train, how long the train is, how many transit cops are around, and how they relate to the NYPD. Kind of interesting, in a touristy way. The Japanese "monkeys" in the movie serve their comedic purpose. Anyone who has seen footage of the real Tokyo subway system in operation must suspect that they view the New York City subway system as a paragon of order and good taste. (In Tokyo, they use "pushers" to squeeze as many innocent passengers as possible into each car; what happens if one of them wants to release some Sirin gas?) Walter Mathau is at his slouching New-Yorkese best, grumbling, kwetching, outfitted in a droopy suit with a startling canary yellow tie. And -- well, look at the movie. Here we are given a story about the hijacking of a subway train -- and there is not a single exploding fireball.There is some shooting with automatic weapons and pistols, but not much of that, and nobody wields two Uzzis at once. Nobody's head balloons into jelly. There is no blood, and no final shoot out in an unused deadend tunnel or empty warehouse. Mathau doesn't even carry a gun. The movie ends with a sneeze and an ironically polite German blessing. The acting is up to snuff, the narrative easy enough to follow, and exciting, if not entirely believable. The villains are neatly differentiated. The low-brow greedy ex-motorman of Martin Balsam, who practically embodies New York City in its grittier aspects; Shaw's icy disdain; Elizondo's angry psychopathy. It's an enjoyable movie, all around. The fact that it was made when it was, in 1974, helps in understanding why the story and characters weren't overwhelmed by special effects. Cf., Stallone's movie about the Holland Tunnel. (Everyone in that movie should have been drowned; who would want to go to New Jersey anyway? The state smells like somebody's old sweatshirt.)It ought to be mentioned that despite the tension and occasional violence this is a pretty funny movie. Much of the humor grows out of urban, ethnic cynicism and vulgarity. Yiddish is flung around profligately -- "Mishigas," "putz." The transit supervisor, a Polish-American, is accosted by a released hostage who shouts, "I'm gonna SUE you! Hear me? I'm gonna SUE your a**." Cas Dolowitz bellows back an obscene Italian expression that can be roughly rendered as "fanablagotz!" It would be nice to turn back the clock and be able to watch a film like "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" on a regular basis. It engages your interest with no pretensions at attempting to do anything else. It leaves your eardrums intact. Did you realize that one of the membranes in your inner ear is so sensitive that it transmits sound by vibrating only the diameter of a hydrogen atom? If you want to treat your ears like a temple instead of a pool room, see this movie and avoid "action-movie gap." Do it now. Offer ends at midnight. Not sold in stores.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tense thriller concerning a gang of four heavily armed extortionists, who systematically hijack a subway train and hold its passengers hostage for one million dollars. Robert Shaw is the cold blooded clinician who leads the motley crew, including Martin Balsam (I'd regard this as his best role) as an almost reluctant participant, Earl Hindman (pre "Home Improvement") as the compliant thug, and Hector Elizondo as the trigger happy psychopath. Walter Matthau is also good, albeit somewhat contained, as the transit detective negotiating for the hostages release.The supporting cast is first rate with Julius Harris, Dick O'Neill, Tony Roberts, Rudy Bond, Kenneth McMillan and Nathan George just to name a few. David Shire's frenetic score is memorable and director Joseph Sargent (his best film) keeps the action and suspense high throughout. Witty dialogue contains plenty of laughs (uniform to dispatcher "they just shot him with a machine gun", dispatcher "is he dead?", uniform "wouldn't you be lieutenant?") but the tone is never compromised - both Elizondo and in particular Shaw, create chilling characters promising to execute one hostage for every minute the ransom is late; e.g. Shaw's execution of one of the hostages as retribution for a sniper strike is performed with merciless efficiency.I initially responded to the idea of remaking this film with contempt - akin to turning this train thriller into a train wreck. And while the subsequent remakes (Vince Vaughn and John Travolta versions) have both been inferior, if they promote the original and introduce a new legion of fans, then it's a worthwhile exercise. From the NY pop culture, wardrobe and trends of the era, to the unique group of actors assembled, there's so much you can't replicate that the original can never be surpassed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original's always the best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Considering how recently I'd seen the re-make, I had my eye on a copy of the original film which could be brought quite cheaply in the shops. But it was gone the next time I went there, so how lucky was it that Channel 5 chose to show it on telly today for free. And for all the publicity and build up the new film's received, guess which version is the better one? Like the re-make (which I'm always seeing first these days) this has a neat (if less stylish) opening, with a cool, funky soundtrack, but unlike the new film, this original version maintains an air of genuine suspense and tension, with a neat sense of claustrophobia to it. Robert Shaw's calm, reserved euro bad guy makes far more of an impression than John Travolta's chaotic, angry villain, genuinely striking you as a man with a plan who's thought things through and no less psychotic than Travolta's Ryder. Likewise, Walter Matthau seems well cast as the good guy, doing his usual gruff, quietly sarcastic thing to great effect in one of his crankier roles. The air of a 'real time' thriller is in the air, making it seem a bit ahead of it's time, not to mention getting to see where Quentin Tarantino got his inspiration for giving villains clever 'colour codenames' in his classic Reservoir Dogs.One thing that does bother you is the ending, which is very sudden and leaves you without a definite climax where everything is resolved. But this is actually cleverer, as it leaves the ending open to suggestion, letting the viewer decide it for themselves, as it's clear the one crook has been rumbled. For all the flashiness and style of the new one, in this case once again the original's the winner hands down. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty Subway Thriller That Could Only Be set in New York!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roller-coaster story about a quartet of mustachioed, eye-glassed, mack-wearing gunmen that heist a New York subway train - Pelham 1, 2, and 3 - in order to blackmail the city for one million in cash. We see the whole story from everyone's perspective: the gunmen, the victims, the cops, the mayor and his cronies, and, most importantly, from the transit authority police and various officials. This movie is one gritty film as New York is presented in all its 70s grandeur. Crime. Filth. Corruption. Yet, despite all this, the men serving the city work hard to protect the lives of those 17 passengers on Pelham 1, 2, and 3. At its roots this film is a story of two men - Mr. Blue(all the gunmen have color-coded names that Quentin Tarrantino borrowed in Reservoir Dogs)played with his usual aplomb by Robert Shaw as the leader of the gang and Walter Matthau as the Transit detective out to do what he can to remedy the situation. we get action, suspense, and some witty dialog as well as some subtle and not so subtle humor(loved the Matthau guest-touring scenes!). We also get drama with a real edge. The film like the situations it mimics feel explosive. There are some fine performances in here. Shaw, his voice is awesome, plays the evil, ruthless, and calm Mr. Blue to perfection. Martin Balsam and Hector Elizondo are very good as two other gunmen. Matthau is excellent and has always been overlooked for his dramatic value as an actor. Sure, he is funny in the film but it is a realistic kind of funny. it is like he is a real person - we call that acting I guess. Watch for Tony Roberts, Doris Roberts, Dick O'Neill, Jerry Stiller, and many other familiar faces throughout. I have not yet seen the remake, but the original will be hard to beat if for no other reason than it is a time capsule in its own right of a New York that no longer exists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Shaw and his small gang hijack a New York City subway and demand $1,000,000 in ransom. Walter Matthau is Lt. Zachary Garber who must deal with the situation.I recommend this film. Although somewhat dated looking, the film moves along at a brisk pace, it's believable and gritty, the acting, script, direction and music are excellent and the ending is cool. The film does have somewhat of a made-for-TV feel but don't let that deter you from seeing it.As always, Robert Shaw gives an excellent performance. His companions in crime are equally good: Martin Balsam, Hector Elizondo (especially good) and Earl Hindman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Denzel Washington be a better Lt. Garber than Walter Matthau? That is the question to be asked next month when the remake of this film hits movie screens.With some 40 horror films scheduled to be remade, and much discussion over whether they should or should not be done, the question paramount in my mind is how you can possibly improve this film? Matthau was right on spot in this film. He took charge and negotiated with the kidnappers, led by Robert Shaw. The back and forth was crisp and to the point. No wasted words. Shaw was also perfect, and one has to wonder how John Travolta will play this role out.This movie was tightly directed by Joseph Sargent without special effects and gadgets. It was a crime thriller that focused on the crime. It remains to be seen how Tony Scott can improve on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic 1970s NYC noir about a subway hijacking (the number 6 train, between Grand Central and South Ferry). It perfectly captures the paranoia of the times, when the Big Apple seemed on the brink of the Big Apocalypse. With an all-star-cast, great shot-on-location scenes, a pulsating score, and enough racial, ethnic, and sexual slurs to make Archie Bunker blush. Anchored by a gritty performance by Walter Matthau as a transit police lieutenant, a long, long way from The Odd Couple and Hello, Dolly! (For another example of Matthau in a tough guy role, see Charlie Varrick.) Historical note: Quentin Tarantino "borrowed" several motifs from this film for Reservoir Dogs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a longtime film buff I'm now prepared to deliver my verdict: film never was better than in the 70's. And especially cop and suspense movies. Today the screw it all up by adding love stories that go nowhere to try to cater to the dating crowd. Ends up pleasing nobody. Like a chocolate covered cheese burger. Just watch when they do remakes of great 70's classics: Get Carter, Gone in 60 Seconds and so on. They just don't have a clue these days. Back then they trusted that a simple single goal script could suffice in keeping audiences glued to their seats for 2 hours, which it did. The Taking of Pelham 1, 2, 3 is a perfect example of near-perfect 70's filmmaking, do not miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No dreary long expositions, no lengthy bonding scenes, no reaction shots of the masses waiting to find out what happens; just take your music case down those steps into the subway and wait for your train. My God, what an hellacious way to make a movie. And there is one other miracle here: the funny quips are thrown into the noise, and come across as what people under such stress might say, rather than being snarky lines given to Mr. and Mrs. Pitt or Bruce or Mel and Danny. The latter spout dialog usually complete with a smirk; Matthau and the rest are in too big a hurry to deal with the problem at hand. Read the quotes in the header above; none are followed by a reaction shot but rather the film flows around them. And how nice it is to see the head cop not be a rogue, but rather a simple slob just doing his job. He doesn't out-sherlock them and if it was not for one undercover man, he would be a failure, but he gets the job done. Great flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New York State Of Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a rough town to host a tough crime caper. New York City in its bankrupt "Ford To City: Drop Dead" period offers a compelling backdrop to the story of four desperate men who launch a scheme to make the city pay a million dollars by taking a subway car and its passengers hostage. It's a fascinating story with a lot of local color and a perfect distillation of suspense.Funny lines, too, not clever sitcom banter but real-life wisecracks from people used to living their lives in constant tension, delivered with all the electricity of New York Post headlines."Never say you're sorry," a senior conductor warns a young trainee. "Someone might come out here and hit you in your damn nose."An angry trainmaster (Dick O'Neill), when reminded about the 18 hostages, replies: "What do they expect for their lousy 35 cents, to live forever?"When a senior transit cop named Lt. Garber (Walter Matthau) asks a colleague played by Jerry Stiller to tell some Japanese visitors about the kind of crime they have to deal with, Stiller's character replies: "We had a bomb scare in the Bronx yesterday, but it turned out to be a cantaloupe."Matthau's role isn't the most challenging of his career, mostly he pushes a lot of buttons and talks into a microphone, but he throws up an array of great reaction shots, from his first moment of being woken from a catnap to his last, one of the most memorable of any 1970s film. I love his reaction when Stiller's Lt. Patrone character offers his theory of how the hijackers plan to get away with the loot by flying the subway to Cuba: "You're a sick man, Rico."The real sick man in this movie is the great Robert Shaw as the lead hijacker, who goes by the alias Mr. Blue. Shaw excelled at playing functional psychopaths, not to mention dangerous train passengers, and here he keeps the suspense on a low boil throughout. He doesn't want to kill anyone, not because he's a nice guy, but because he's a perfectionist who doesn't want anything to upset his plans. This sets him at odds with his trigger-happy associate, Mr. Grey (Hctor Elizondo).Matthau's got his own problem associate, the trainmaster who's probably feeling guilty about the subordinate he sent to visit the endangered car, and their back-and-forth makes clear this is a shaky bit of business for all concerned.Director Joseph Sargent makes a very dynamic, functional story hum with minimal drag. Another New York director of more artistic pedigree, say Sidney Lumet, would have made a great film from this John Godey novel, but he would have paused a bit for "what-it-all-means" moments. There's none of that here, but there are still many fine touches in the execution of this movie. I suspect Lumet got the idea for shooting his Washington Post interiors in "All The President's Men" from the gritty way the Transit Authority office is shot here, with those hot florescent lights that contrast so wonderfully with the dark subway scenes.What else to say? David Shire's masterful score will keep you on the edge of your seat whenever it starts up, and the editing by Gerald B. Greenberg and Robert Q. Lovett is up to the level of the scheming bad guys.If you want to see a movie that celebrates the Big Apple when all goes wrong, this is a place to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Upbeat Crime Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first notes of David Shire's groovy score playing at the movie's start, you know you're in for a treat. The Taking of Pelham 123 is one of the most enjoyable and upbeat movies I've seen in a while. This is a gritty crime movie, with deaths, and yet it's also light and humorous in a way action movies no longer are. To find such lightness in a crime movie I have to go back in time, back to The Thomas Crown Affair, the only crime movie I know that exudes so much elegance and coolness.Four armed men hijack a subway train and demand a ransom for its passengers. In charge is Mr. Blue, a courteous, serene but implacable mastermind who will not negotiate or change one item in his plans. He gives the authorities one hour to deliver 1,000,000 dollars, and if they're one minute late, Mr. Blue and his associates, will start killing hostages.Opposing Mr. Blue is Lt. Zachary Garber, of the Transit Police. In this role, which traditionally should have gone to an action actor, is the unlikely Walter Matthau. But for Mr. Blue they chose an actor that matches the role: the great Robert Shaw. He's such a bastard playing a hero in Jaws, imagine what he can be when he plays an actual villain.Matthau and Shaw are pretty good in their roles. Matthau was especially delightful: he brings humour and a humanity that is rare in this type of role. He's not a fighter, he's a thinker, and a damn good one; he not only negotiates with Mr. Blue but also manages to crack the mystery that is at the center of the movie: how will four armed men escape an underground tunnel blocked by policemen on both exits? Although in the history of cinema, this movie is insignificant, I think that in its own genre it's a masterpiece, so tightly plotted and efficient in the use of resources to tell the story, it's a joy to watch. And it has David Shire's score, which is one of the best I've ever heard in my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool heist movie from the 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a cool movie from the 70's, it is a good hijack/hostage film. The casting was believable and the criminals were actually well developed to the point you sort of get there characteristics down. The funky score was cool, but the script was well written as well. And for the budget, they really did a great job with it. The mistaken identities over the radio was a nice touch as well. Basically in New York City, 4 men wearing trench coats and rimmed glasses hijack a Pelham 123 subway train and for the hostage to go free, they want a million dollars. The deadline is almost an hr and every minute it's late with the criminals request, they will kill a hostage. The person on the other line the criminal leader communicate about what they want and how they want it done, is Zachary Garber(Walter Matthau) who's job is help run the subways, and they both put on a good performance. The leader of the hijacking(Robert Shaw) was ominous while keeping his cool about everything, in another words he is a charismatic criminal, while Garber was amusing to watch and realistic at the same time how he deals with the situation of being the negotiator. The mayor was annoying to watch, but that is just his character and it fit quite nicely. The hostages in this movie weren't that believable though, they all seem to have a loud mouth, except the motorman. The kids that were taken hostage was really annoying and wished they were killed off or something, but it just showed that the criminals had a heart(being sarcastic), maybe I just hate kids. Even if there is lack of action, it kept my attention from beginning to end. It wasn't a exciting or suspenseful heist thriller or anything like that but it kept me entertained, especially how the character interact with one another while dealing with the hostage situation.7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Train kept-a-rollin'...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrific heist-flick from the early 70's, a golden era for me of movie-making, when quality film-making was set in everyday locations amongst identifiably ordinary people but playing out extraordinary situations. The extraordinary situation here, mind you, is up with the best of them, namely the hi-jacking of a New York City underground train, no less, its passengers held for ransom by Robert Shaw and his "rainbow" gang, (Messrs Green, Gray, Brown and Blue), prefiguring a minor plot device Tarantino would re-use in "Reservoir Dogs". Despite lacking a really big name in the cast, (it is just possible to envisage a McQueen or Newman in Walter Matthau's role), this only adds to the everyday mundanity of the scenario presented and enhances the credibility of the situation. It really does look and play like a real-life event, aided in this also by the near-real-time sequence of events depicted. The dialogue is razor-sharp, very much in the local vernacular with much grim humour abounding, the mixture of studio and actual locations wholly convincing and the ensemble acting first-rate. Robert Shaw is very good as the cold calculating mastermind, while Walter Matthau, for whom the phrase "hangdog expression" must have been invented, gets a break from his numerous comedy castings and is even better as the workaday transport cop whose instincts carry the day, even surrounded by dozens of real cops. The narrative is played out tautly, with the tension kept right up, but as stated, isn't afraid to throw in some humour to season the offering here. Thus we get a humorous sub-plot with Lee Wallace as a flu-ridden mayor, unpopular with his electorate, happy to lie in bed watching daytime TV, until goaded into action by a very good Tony Roberts as his deputy. The violence is sparing but effective, the out-of-control train at the end again pre-dates "Speed" by several years, with the concluding denouement handled superbly and even if I saw well in advance Martin Balsam's give-away to Matthau in the last scene, it couldn't have been delivered more crisply or succinctly. Certainly no need for alternative endings here. All in all, I just thought it was a gripping, exhilarating ride of a movie, unfairly overlooked and worthy of plaudits which somehow seemed to pass it by on original release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting 70's action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the main reasons why I love 70's action movies and will always prefer them over their nowadays remakes is because even the 'good guys' back then were often deeply unsympathetic and obnoxious characters. Somehow this makes them much more realistic and plausible. "The Taking of Pelham 123" is a prototypic example to prove this statement. Lieutenant Zachary Garber and his partners aren't a muscular heroic types at all. They're whiny, aggressive and women-unfriendly chauvinist pigs that actually comes across as less sophisticated and intelligent as the villains they're trying to arrest. In this modest 70's action blockbuster, based on the novel by John Godey, a quartet of well- prepared and heavily armed men that address to each other with colors instead of names (I suppose Quentin Tarantino holds a copy in his private film collection as well) hijack a busy New York subway train and demand $1 million ransom from the city council. Lt Garber has one hour to deliver the money, if not the hijackers promise to kill off one hostage per minute of delay. The mayor agrees to pay up the sum, especially because everyone's convinced that the criminals won't ever be able to escape the underground subway network without being caught. Or will they? "The Taking of Pelham 123" is a vastly amusing and unpretentious action flick. The script doesn't waste any time on boring introductions, as the story almost immediately opens with the four hijackers boarding the train at different stations with obvious malignant intentions in their facial expressions. They're horribly disguised as middle-aged men with mustaches, hats and long overcoats. Their hostages are a typical assembly to represent the population of New York, including pimps and Hispanic pregnant girls. The subway control room is, as said, a chauvinist male world where grumpy men don't care about the potential loss of human lives and simply want to kill the terrorists as quick as possible. The first hour of "The Taking of Pelham 123" is fairly slow and talkative, which is understandable since it mostly concerns negotiations between the lieutenant and the leader of the thugs, but the third act is very exhilarating with an unstoppable train raging through NY and a deadly confrontation between police and hijackers. The cast is excellent with a couple of monumental names like Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. Martin Balsam and Jerry Stiller deliver excellent supportive roles, but my personal favorite remains Hector Elizondo as the psychopathic and trigger-happy Mr. Grey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 70's crime film was built on reality: language, violence, filth... with true stories often unfolding in real-time. "The Taking of Pelham 123" is a crisp, dense, real-time crime story so good you won't believe its not more famous.A team of hijackers take over the 1:23 Pelham Bay subway train: they want one million dollars in one hour or they start executing passengers. And we're off... the action doesn't stop until the credits roll. The beautiful thing about films of this era was that they didn't need a "good-guy" protagonist; we see and feel as much for the hijackers as we do the police trying to stop them... no sides are taken by director Joseph Sargent. Our de facto lead is Walter Matthau, that rumpled paper bag, providing a stark contrast to Robert Shaw's icy criminal computer. But no one's playing a character here... these are actors being as "real" as any camera can ever capture.The police are slow-moving slobs mired in attitude and bureaucratic formality... the criminals are nervous, violent, desperate with a clock ticking over their heads. Dick O'Neill as a police dispatcher is so obnoxious you'll throw popcorn at the screen- how would YOU like to be a hostage with him in charge of getting you out alive?- but its an accurate representation of the way law-enforcement officials behaved before the Munich Olympics of 1972 demanded international terrorist policy.Movies like this will not be made again... and they shouldn't be. Today we reside in the omni-media galaxy in which disasters &amp; police chases are played out live via the web &amp; cable news, pulling us into a real-time drama for hours, or days, or more... if we're lucky enough to not be directly involved we're weary with the knowledge of the lives lost, the pain and suffering that is inevitable... That's why "Pelham 123" is necessary... you can sit back, relax, and enjoy a bold caper that brings a city to its knees secure in the knowledge that no human was killed in the making of this motion picture. Funny, smart, and action-packed... this is a must-see.(Makes a great double-feature with "Dog Day Afternoon"!)GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're in the mood for a decent action thriller from the 70s, 'The Taking of Pelham One Two Three' is a good choice. Though it has a rather undeveloped story, the movie is backed by a phenomenal share of performers and spattered with moments of comic relief.This is the story of four men who hijack a New York subway car (Pelham 123). While their motives are never really explained, their demands are simple: one million dollars in exchange for the eighteen passengers being held hostage. Where the idiotic mayor (with a striking resemblance to former New York mayor, Ed Koch) fails to respond to the emergency, the Lueteneit of the New York Transit Authority (Walter Matthau) prepares to negotiate with the men and save as many of the hostages as possible. This is no easy task of course, given the unrelenting "leader" of of the gang of four, Mr. Blue (yes, this serves as the precedent for Tarrantino's 'Resevoir Dogs,' as do many things in 1970s cinema), played by Robert Shaw, who seems to command the show, making seemingly impossible demands on the authorities. The movie does well with maintaining the pace throughout the picture, with the tension being broken moments of comic relief. Although, the story remains somewhat undeveloped, since we never really find out why the hijackers have chosen to take over the train. Other than Robert Shaw's character, the hijackers are men of few words.However, in spite of this, the movie is still entertaining, due in large part to a terrific cast of acting veterans and regulars, including Marty Balsam, Hector Elizando, and Earl Hindmen ("Wilson" on TV's 'Home Improvement') who portray the hijackers, and Jerry Stiller, James Broderick, and many other familiar faces serving as Matthau's support team.Overall, I would recommend seeing this movie, if you're able to find it. Unfortunately, since Hollywood never has any original ideas anymore, 'The Taking of Pelham One Two Three' was remade as a made-for-TV movie in 1998. For maximum enjoyment, catch it in its original form. The cast alone is reason enough to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best 'hostage' movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Taking of Pelham One Two Three' superbly achieves what few other movies do: a successful blend of thrills, style, comedy, drama, suspense and action. The story focuses on four criminals who hijack a subway car and demand one million dollars from the mayor of New York, or else they'll kill a hostage a minute. It's up to transit lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) to stall with the crooks and negotiate while he tries to get their demands met. The hijackers are Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw), the crafty and efficient leader; Mr. Green (Martin Balsam), the train driver; Mr. Gray (Hector Elizondo), the hothead; and Mr. Brown (Earl Hindman), a nervous, stuttering man. Take a look at the four men, armed with machine guns (and all following the same costume theme) and then guess where Quentin Tarantino got the idea for his reservoir dogs.The style and direction of the film is great. It opens with the four criminals boarding the train at different stops, until we finally see Mr. Blue, who is introduced tapping his feet impatiently as he waits for the train. Then we see Matthau, giving a group of Japanese businessmen a tour of the transit station. Some might say this scene was added for mere comic relief, and though it is funny it also shows how not much happens at this transit station, and that the characters aren't used of anything as big as a hostage situation.The film takes place over one day, and considering the circumstances there isn't much room for depth with the characters. Matthau isn't exactly underwritten; it's just that he only serves the purpose as the negotiator. Hindman and Elizondo are underwritten, though. I would've liked to see Elizondo have a bigger part, though I guess he hadn't discovered his coolness until he got old (around the early nineties). Balsam gives another great performance here as a sort of sleazy, sort of noble train driver turned thief.The best performance and deepest character is by far Shaw's Blue. He makes a great, crafty villain, but it goes deeper than that. You get to know him. He's a control freak, he has to be in control of everything or else he freaks out. He's even sort of paranoid. At one point of the movie he tells Green that he doesn't trust Gray because he's a psycho. At first glance he seems right, but most of Gray's bad behavior in the film is somewhat justified and never too extreme (at times he's just being rebellious). At one point he guns down a man who's trying to get onto the car. Gray had reason for this, but Blue exploits it because he doesn't like him and wants to turn the others against him.Spoilers ahead.There is even a hint of nihilism in Shaw's character. He's not upset about being kicked from the British army; he never seems worried throughout the heist. My theory is that Blue just doesn't care about anything, win lose or draw. When Garber finally has him trapped in the subway tunnel at the end Blue asks him if New York still has executions. Garber replies with a no, so Blue simply shrugs and steps on the third rail, frying himself to death, smiling. He doesn't look reluctant in this scene, he doesn't look defeated, and he looks the same as he does in every other scene. Killing himself is no more important than killing someone else or robbing a train. Shaw's performance is so focused and calm, worthy of an Oscar.`The Taking of Pelham One Two Three' is definitely the best hostage movie out there, 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is totally understandable as to why they would do a remake of this film, the flawless itemization to this suspenseful and comedic thriller was absolutely amazing!! The acting in this film is sensational!! Execution of a crime is so often times motivated by egocentric behavior. The film "Taking of Pelham One Two Three" exemplifies that dubious characteristic of egomania to this felonious escapade with an utterly remarkable flair!! Capital crimes, and misdemeanors, are ubiquitous in New York, so when a group of intellectual villains get innovative with the societal nemesis of extortion through bodily harm, it throws the whole metropolitan area into a tailspin!! Politicians, including Mayor Koch, major companies, as well as banks, are put on front street in this film, and suddenly, this precarious cry for attention gets national notoriety!! Made right around the time of New York City facing massive default, in conjunction with seeking a huge Federal bailout from the Ford Administration, this movie articulated the myriad of dilemmas that affected Manhattan's ephemeral functionality!! Anybody who perceived the New York City subway system to be an archaic carnival ride, may have had a healthy dose of vindication served to them when considering what happened!! Their assessment of this mode of cosmopolitan transportation, probably frightened them, especially if they were to be on the Pelham line during this particular fiasco!! By attrition, all of the belligerent reprobates who orchestrated this depraved debacle, wound up being their own undoing while in the process of terrorizing New York City .. It was mere conjecture as to whether or not the law enforcement units of New York would capitulate to such blatant blackmail.. As it turned out, this was a crap shoot that these academic hoodlums won!! So many details related to this crime were convincingly earmarked in their favor, so what went wrong? I'll tell you what went wrong: Of all the days to catch a cold!! This movie dealt with garnering an emerging empathy with the malaise movie-viewer to allow many different walks of life to assert themselves!! Movies and television have always had a knack for glamorizing heinous crimes!! So many criminals have incredibly brilliant minds!! Many hypothetical theories manufacture the distorted contention that "If these criminals used their minds to do something constructive, they would be able to make as much, if not more money, legitimately, than they do by stealing it!!" Unfortuneatly, I have just this analogy to counter that statement with: "All the change that I have found under the cushions of the living room sofa have amounted to enough money to be able to pay off the mortgage" Basically, this is just an exaggerated figure of speech!! The '2009 version of this film has intrigued me, I am very interested in finding out how good it is!! The original 1974 movie is so creative!! One little detail which employs deductive reasoning winds up solving this entire case!!! It becomes a proverbial instance of three strikes and you're out!! Such a scenario makes these visceral components to this sordid incident, the outlaw's ultimate Achilles heal!! This movie keeps you interested from start to finish, not too many movies are capable of doing that!! The acting, the directing, and the fast paced cinematography of New York City in this film were all fantastic!! I give this film five stars... It is on my top 50 list!!! Definitely!!!! See the new one if you want to, however, without question, it goes without saying that you should see the 1974 version first!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretend The Remake Doesn't Exist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This old gem will surprise you with the amount of humor in it. The humor never wrecks the suspense which builds all through the movie. Want to appreciate Robert Shaw? Watch Travolta, in the remake, with those hyper gesticulations like he is still doing From Paris With Love. Shaw is quiet, determined and deadly here. He is as ruthless with his own men as he is with the police and Garber. Matthau steals the movie with his comic talents, though be warned, this is a very non-PC movie. Asian people may not find his humiliation and ridicule of Japanese tourists terribly funny. The joy of the movie is the acting, writing and directing. Garber openly mocks Shaw, sometimes even on the mike when he can hear him. Shaw's motivations are a mystery at first but as the movie progresses we discover this was his retirement plan: death or success with no other options. Watch when Garber catches him, he dispassionately asks if New York has a death penalty. When Matthau says no, he calmly puts his foot on the power railing and electrocutes himself. Balsam is great here showing you why not to commit a crime when you have a noisy head cold. From the beginning, there is tension between Elizondo, a sadist, and Shaw. It builds throughout the movie with them butting heads progressively worse and worse. We know what is coming.This is a sign of great writing; these are complex human beings not all good or bad but a little of both. The exception is Elizondo, who is close to pure Evil, reveling in beating and shooting. The others of Shaw's gang look on this as a purely business venture. Unfortunately, Shaw is strict about his timetable and his rules. When chaos ensues, he retaliates in a cold, creepy way. Look at the expression on the guy's face when Shaw asks him to please leave the train, he knows what's coming. There is more comic relief in a very sick mayor, with the flu, during an election year having to come to work when he is deathly sick. My favorite line is,"I'm not going downtown, they always boo me when I go downtown." There is plenty of tension in the timetables and the deadly hatred between very tenuous partners: Shaw and Elizondo. Matthau shows you his comedic gifts in his sarcastic interchanges with Shaw that are the biggest drop-off in the awful remake of this classic. The way they are caught has more to do with tensions between the group and above all Matthau out-thinking Shaw. I won't spoil the one who almost gets away but you will remember it forever. It happens after he thinks he is completely safe, the door to his apartment has closed behind Matthau and Stiller; then, the idiot gives himself completely away. This is why I like the movie so much: the humor. Yet, unlike modern movies, the humor is isolated from the suspense NOT in the middle of it. This is how to add humor to your movie without mixing genres and making a mess. Many of you might stay away thinking what on earth can they do with people trapped in a subway car, how boring! The movie is as much the sick mayor, Matthau and the subway people, and the search for who they are. The way Matthau unravels their plans seems quite realistic and not contrived. When you watch old classics from the 70's like this one or The Omega Man what you notice right away are two giant changes from today's movies: acting and character development. This is Robert Shaw's movie and he carries it so well. Matthau lightens his grim, ultimately, suicidal retirement plan but Shaw is the star here. Like his tiny part in Man For All Seasons, his ability is so great he simply overwhelms all those around him. Scofield was a great actor but, even he, was towered over by this legendary actor of the 20th century. You will laugh as much as being interested in the crisis which, believe me, is not an easy thing to accomplish. Don't believe me, watch the Last Action Hero, it is so hard to maintain dramatic intensity with humor not weakening it. A Classic. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found an old copy of the original John Godey novel when I was a teenager, and after reading it I immediately sought out the first filmed version of the novel. I remember thinking the movie followed the novel fairly well. Decades later, I found a DVD copy of the movie in my local library, and decided to give it another look. While my memories of the novel have faded, I thought the movie was still a great thriller. There isn't a wasted moment - it gets right to business very quickly, and the rest of the movie unfolds at a brisk (but wisely not TOO fast) speed. The cast is very good, with Robert Shaw finding the right tone to portray a bad guy who is very smart and dangerous. Walter Matthau also does well in a mostly serious role, though he adds some subtle humor to his words on occasion to make sure the movie doesn't get too serious for its own good. Definitely a lot better than the remake with John Travolta, which was too slick and loud for its own good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The IRT subway line of New York City's subway system is the setting for this 1974 thriller which had a recent remake. Directed by Joseph Sargent and based on a novel by John Godey, with an adaptation by Peter Stone, this motion picture remains a much better film in comparison with the recent one. At least, it is much more realistic, even if those were not the days of computer driven special effects.More than anything, "The Taking of the Pelham 123" captured the essence of New York City, as it look in the early 1970s. Those were the days where high crime was rampant, something that has nothing to do with the plot. The four criminals that had planned the hijacking of the subway train running under Park Avenue South, was an act of boldness no one could have imagined.What worked in the film was the amazing cast that was gathered for it. Walter Matthau, was at the top of his career. He gives life to Zach Garber, the police lieutenant negotiating with Mr. Blue, the head of the gang. Robert Shaw proves why he was one of the best actors in whatever he decided to play. Unfortunately, Mr. Shaw died much too young. Martin Balsam appears as the disgruntled former transit authority employee who knows a thing or two about the way the subway was run. Hector Elizondo made a cool Mr. Grey. The supporting cast featured some of New York's best actors in smaller roles. James Broderick, Jerry Stiller, Nathan George, Kenneth McMillan, Tony Roberts and a terrific Doris Roberts as the mayor's wife.The production was shot on the streets of Manhattan with great style and realism by Owen Roizman with a musical score by David Shire. The direction by Joseph Sargent keeps things moving at great speed, reflecting a gritty city that moves so fast, it is hard to keep pace with it. The older Pelham 123 is presently the number 6 line, made famous by J.Lo's song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review Of "The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three" is a 1974 action thriller starring Walter Mathau and Robert Shaw. The movie was directed by Joseph Sargent and it tells the story of a man (Shaw) who, with some other gunmen, hijack a subway train in New York City. The man is soon pitted against a railway police official (Mathau) who, with the help of others, tries to stop him. Now let me start off by saying that I actually saw the 2009 Tony Scott remake before I saw the 1974 original. Is the original better than the 2009 remake? In short - yeah, pretty much. In comparing the two movies, it seemed as though, while the 2009 remake felt more up-to- date, it's more modern approach to elements presented in the original often came off as too over-the-top. I felt that in presenting these certain elements, the 1974 version came off more subtle and pulled it off with a lot more finesse. The 1974 movie has two really impressive actors in the leading roles - Mathau and Shaw. Both of which are really, very entertaining in "Pelham", but I'd have to say that Shaw's performance shines the most in this movie. His demeanor throughout the entire movie is really hilarious. He just comes off as this soulless jerk - a soulless jerk with some pretty hilarious one-liners. That brings me to the script which, as I said, contains some pretty great one-liners not only from Shaw, but from Mathau and others. It's nothing really impressive or Oscar-worthy, but it does have a few gems in it here and there. While I, a Generation-Z kid, found this movie to be very easy to watch, it did at times have a few moments of cheese. That being said, I'm not going to knock the movie for being a little long in the tooth - but it does show sometimes. The movie was really entertaining and I can see why it was well received when it came out. I can also see the immense amount of expectations the 2009 movie had to live up to. Overall, I found "The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three" to be a fairly enjoyable crime thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dynamite film with an outrageous plot that works. A group of mercenaries hijacks a NYC subway train and holds the passengers hostage. It's a rip-roaring suspense film with an unusually strong cast including Walter Matthau as the world-weary transit cop charged with negotiating with the madmen and Robert Shaw as a very nasty villain. Directed at breakneck pace by the efficient Joseph Sargent and featuring a now classic score by David Shire, the movie is full of scares, a good amount of mayhem and a lot of humor. Matthau is priceless and Shaw is pure evil...you don't even need to know his real name (he and his cohorts are color coded...he's Mr. Blue) to get this character's insanity. Shaw is a great actor and has a lot of chemistry with Matthau even though the share little physical screen time together. The supporting cast consists of a slew of terrific character actors including Martin Balsam, Hector Elizondo, Dick O'Neill, Jerry Stiller, Tony Roberts, Julius Harris and Doris Roberts. There's a great performance by Tom Pedi as Caz Dolowicz, a particularly angry transit worker. Owen Roizman, who shot everything from THE FRENCH CONNECTION and THE EXORCIST to THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and NETWORK did the cinematography. The 2009 version is a very loose remake but very worthwhile on its own.</fullReview>

I was surprised to find out it was Wilson from Tool-time as one of the other gunmen(!), knew him but couldn't place him you know. Ditto Dick O'Neill as the spluttering transit authority guy.The movie is dated, sure-it was made in the Watergate era so you have half the cast in leather jackets or wearing bell bottoms or golf pants, but it's how people looked then. You also have to like the nods towards integration of races and sexes in the jobforce and in the world at large that was taking place in that era---'I thought you were-uh, shorter-' was priceless.Check it out, am sure it beats the remake by a mile in quality, acting and interest.

		<fullReview>In this 1974 making of The Taking of Pelham One Two Thee Walter Matthau plays Lt. Zachary Garber of the NYC Transit Police. He shows the Directors of Tokyo Subway transit representative around the Transit Subway Station. When going through a regular day at work until Garber gets wind that Pelham 123 has been taken over by hijackers who are demanding one million dollars from the mayor (Lee Wallace) by 3:13 pm and ever minute after the deadline one hostage will be killed. Unlike in the new Pelham 123 the hijackers go by code names Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw), Mr. Green (Martin Balsam), Mr. Grey (Hector Elizondo), and Mr. Brown (Earl Hindman). Robert Shaw who played Mr. Blue is best remembered as being an accomplished writer and supporting actor. Which you might remember him best in the movie Jaws as Quint (1975). Matthau who you might remember won two Tony Awards: in 1962, as Best Supporting or Featured Actor (Dramatic) for "A Shot in the Dark," and in 1965 as Best Actor (Dramatic) for "The Odd Couple," recreating his part as Oscar Madison in the film version of the same name, The Odd Couple (1968). Matthau had had a excellent career in acting, but dealt with a gambling problem all throughout his life. I wish he could have lived to see the remake of his classic movie The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. It is almost uncanny to me how much this was to the new Pelham 123 and there was not to much difference in the new one. The new Taking of Pelham 123 came out today starring Denzel Washington and John Travolta.</fullReview>

Walter Matthau is just phenomenal, the villains are great, the dialogue is awesome (one liners everywhere you look) ... the only thing really dated in this movie, is the technology. It's a great movie, that seems to be not that very well known (unfortunately), but hopefully people will go and watch this ...

		<shortDescription>A hostage situation on a subway?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe not as well known and remembered, recently reborn through the remake, the 1974 Taking of the Pelham One Two Three is a top notch heist flick.Transit policeman at the NY subway command centre becomes a hostage negotiator, when four armed men take over the Pelham One Two Three and threaten to kill the hostages is the sum of 1 million dollars isn't delivered to them within 60 minutes.Garber, played by Walter Matthaw, is an ordinary man who is doing his job without expecting anything unusual, but still manages to stay calm during tense situations, Matthaw clearly plays his role well. The antagonist, Blue, is a surprisingly interesting one, since he's so mysterious, precise and motive-less. Robert Shaw is brilliant as Blue. The only character on the blacklist is the mayor, played by Lee Wallace. Not that he was bad, but I seriously didn't buy it.The movie's forte point was the suspense it created, the unpredictable turns, which may not seem so special today, but had a powerful effect back then.The plot only lacks some backstory - Garber's, but it's arguably a good point, since everything is centred more around the antagonists.The movie is an excellent pick for fans of robbery/heist movies, the actors mentioned above or just those who want to watch underrated classics.Final Score: 4/5 or 8/10</fullReview>

Also fine are Shaw and Balsam as two of the villains. Though implausible, the film is quite entertaining, as the suspense builds and reaches a satisfactory if unspectacular climax.

		<fullReview>Most likely, the only reason they decided to remake "The Taking of Pelham 1, 2, 3" is because this original version lacked a love story and long action scenes. This film, in my opinion, holds up amazingly well today. That's because it does not rely on action scenes to make it fun to watch. In fact, some of the action scenes may seem cheesy by today's standards, but somehow that doesn't matter here. This film is great because of the characters and how well they function on screen. One of my all-time favorite actors, Walter Matthau, is brilliant here in what is one of his best roles, if not his best. His wisecracks alone make this film worth watching, but that's not the only reason it's good. Robert Shaw also plays the leader of the bad guys very well, without being annoying and over-the-top like most villains. The team of villains is also great in that we really get to know each of them enough to make them interesting to us. The main characters make this film good. It is not, however, a completely perfect film, mainly due to the poor supporting cast. Some characters, such as the guys who work at the train station and police department are good for nothing other than complaining and swearing up a storm! An improvement on these minor characters would have made this film flawless. Nevertheless, an excellent action/suspense movie, especially for its time.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The films premise that a group of armed men hijack a New York City subway train seems a little far fetched. But what we have here a relatively intelligent heist film that doesn't resort to ridiculously complex schemes.The gang of hijackers is led by Robert Shaw and includes Martin Balsam and Hector Elizondo. The hijackers have taken the precaution of only referring to each other by their code names (Mr Blue, Mr Grey, Mr Brown, Mr Gray). Almost 20 years later the gang in Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs would take the same precaution.The man that is leading the official response is Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) of the Transit Police.The cast is uniformly good and there is an interesting supporting cast that includes a number of actors who later become better known for sitcoms; Jerry Stiller (Seinfeld), Doris Roberts (Everybody Loves Raymond), Earl Hindman (Home Improvement), Dick O'Neill.The film very effectively portrays a perceived New York attitude and in particular the New York attitude of the 1970's.The score which is by David Shire (husband at the time of Talia Shire of Rocky and The Godfather fame) is very effective in setting up the mood.The film which has already been re-made once for television has again been re-made this summer by director Tony Scott. This version features such heavy weight talent as; Denzel Washington, John Travolta, James Gandolfini, John Turturro and Luis Guzman. While this is one of those films where I don't see the necessity of a re-make because the original is so good, it will be interesting to see what comes from such talented film makers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the book by John Godey, TAKING OF PELHAM focuses on four criminals who hijack a subway car and demand one million dollars from the mayor of New York, threatening to kill one hostage per minute if their demands aren't met. New York City transit lieutenant Zachary Garber goes above and beyond his call of duty to play negotiator with the hijackers.With the remake coming out this weekend (June 12, 2009), what's a better time than to watch the original film? I guess the film aged well because even at 35 years later, the film doesn't feel dated. What I liked about this film is how easily it blends suspense, comedy, and action. Some films try to blend genres and end up failing horribly but not TAKING OF PELHAM. The blend is smooth, being funny when it needs to be, thrilling when it needs to be, and just plain entertaining from beginning to end.However, I was surprised the movie had some light-hearted scenes. I wasn't expecting that, thinking that it would be a serious gripping film. Well, it actually is, but the subtle humor and the witty dialogue are here too. The relationship between Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw, both playing the main hero and villain respectively, is very fun to see on screen. They do a great job in the movie. The other castmembers did decently in their roles, although there isn't one to shout out about.If there is a negative thing to say about TAKING OF PELHAM, it would be the over-dramatic score that I was never used to. The whole plan turns out to be a bit of a letdown too, after being built so much throughout the film. However, the last scene is pitch perfect, although I saw it coming. It was great to see the inevitable finishing of the movie, though. TAKING OF PELHAM is what you want in a crime thriller. It's funny, gripping, and, most of all, entertaining. Don't be worried to stop for this train. (Sorry, I couldn't resist).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why even attempt to remake this classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a native -- and highly chauvinistic -- New Yorker I am very critical about films that are about my city. This is a magnificent example of a New York-themed film that feels right and looks right (except for the lack of graffiti in the subway train, very common at the time). The film is perfect in every other way, from the clever dialog with its highly appropriate gallows humor to the dark photography that provides the gritty look, to the performances by a stellar cast, to the music.Walter Matthau's Lt. Garber is a New York Everyman unlucky enough to be on duty when this happens. He has prejudices we don't approve of today, but wants to do the right thing. He's also streetwise and savvy enough about the human condition to know what he's dealing with. Robert Shaw's Blue is cold, calculating, and sociopathic. Only we know there's a chink in his armor, but it isn't obvious to Garber who only knows him as a voice over the radio. Blue is perfectly composed most of the time, only losing control very briefly. The vibe between him and his accomplices is fractious, with the potential to explode at any time. This keeps us guessing as to when and how the entire scheme will fall apart. Earl Hindman, Hector Elizondo, and Martin Balsam provide excellent performances as the varied accomplices whom we know could turn on each other at any moment.All the supporting characters are authentically portrayed, from the other MTA employees to the police, to the mayor's staff, down to the hapless mayor himself. Was it coincidence that he bore a great resemblance to Ed Koch, who was elected three years later? If that was a coincidence it was a very lucky one. The passengers are also excellent, mostly sympathetic, and absolute New Yorkers in their diversity from the WASP executive to the hippy, the hooker to the Puerto Rican praying woman, the Jewish senior to the smart-mouthed pimp. The actors were largely unknowns and types who would today populate LAW &amp; ORDER episodes.The music perfectly matched the energy of the story and the feel of New York and the always-in-a-hurry manner of its people. The rhythm of the theme feels like a subway train from the start; even the more romantic break in the closing theme feels like the nicer side of a subway ride as it pulls into a desirable destination when it suddenly returns to its "back to business" tone to remind us of what we just saw. It's a total winner.The 1998 TV remake was a joke with no actor chemistry and no feel of authenticity. The current release is somewhat better in that it provides two good performances and some logical updates in the story details, but it still can't beat this original for anything mentioned in this review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Thriller About the Most Unlikely Crime of the Century!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"White Lightning" director Joseph Sargent's "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" ranks as an exciting, intelligent, white-knuckled suspense thriller about the most unlikely hijacking in criminal history. Walter Matthau heads up the cast as an unlikely but shaggy dog hero while Robert Shaw is extremely focused and ruthless as the nefarious villain. They qualify as brilliant adversaries. Anybody that watches New York based dramas, television shows, and/or movies will recognize the ensemble of seasoned New York City actors that flesh out each scene. The chief drawback of "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is that its protagonist and antagonist stay holed up either in the subway train or in some downtown command center for long periods of time. Nevertheless, Sargent and scenarist Peter Stone manage to keep things pretty taut as this formula fare unfolds with flavorful dialogue, crisp performances, and five-time Oscar nominated lenser Owen Roizman's atmospheric cinematography.A quartet of heavily individuals decked out in disguises with submachine guns occupy the eponymous New York City subway train and hold 17 passengers hostage for a million dollar payday from Gotham. Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw of "Custer of the West") looks like he is on the way to a concert with a musical instrument case, while Mr. Green (Martin Balsam of "Hombre"), Mr. Brown (Earl Hindman of "Silverado") and Mr. Grey (Hector Elizondo of "Valdez Is Coming") climb aboard the Pelham One Two Three at different intervals and take up positions. Mr. Blue sticks a .45 caliber, automatic pistol into the motorman Denny Doyle's face (John Broderick of "Alice's Restaurant") and takes control of the train with the help of Mr. Green, a former motorman who was fired for supposedly participating in a narcotics ring operating on the subway. Initially, nobody wants to believe that they are serious about their demands, until the trigger happy Mr. Grey riddles Transit Authority supervisor Caz Dolowicz (Tom Pedi of "The Naked City") with a burst of machine gun. The irate Dolowicz warns everybody that he is going to get to the bottom of this incident and he winds up face down dead in a subway tunnel. Lt. Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau of "The Odd Couple") passes along their demands to New York City Mayor (Lew Wallace) who is battling a terrible case of the flu. The Mayor's Deputy Mayor (Tony Roberts of "Annie Hall") convinces everybody from the Mayor to the Police Commissioner to cough up the dough. Nevertheless, with the clock ticking, Mr. Blue refuses to accommodate a desperate Garber as the city struggles to meet his demands and get the money to him on time.On route to deliver the ransom, the NYPD cruiser crashes and the authorities have to scramble to deliver the money in the nick of time. Meanwhile, the hijackers kill the conductor and Mr. Green begins to sweat because he doesn't believe that he will survive the ordeal. Meanwhile, the NYPD has assembled an army of snipers and other policemen and they line the subway tunnel twenty yards behind the occupied subway train. The catch is that on board the subway, unknown to the hijackers, is an undercover cop. Nobody knows if the undercover cop is a man or a woman. This revelation adds to the suspense since there are several scenes between the hijackers and the passengers. The former subway motorman Mr. Green has a surprise up his sleeve after the villains receive their million dollars.Academy Award winning scenarist Peter Stone of "Father Goose" as well as "Mirage" and "Arabesque," based his riveting screenplay on author John Godey's bestselling novel. The principal differences between Godey's novel and Stone's screenplay consist of the chief villain's demise, the racial identity of the New York Transient Authority detective, a booby-trapped subway train crash, and a police cruiser crash when delivering the loot to the hijackers. Ostensibly, Stone adheres rather closely to Godey's novel. Instead of being brought in alive, the villain commits suicide by stepping on the third rail and electrocuting himself. The Walter Matthau Transient Authority detective in the novel was an African-American. Moreover, the man who shot the villain in the book was in a subway train trailing the hijackers. As a precursor to Quentin Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs," where the criminals adopted colors as nicknames, the felons in "The Taking of the Pelham One Two Three" use names such as 'Mr. Blue,' 'Mr. Gray,' 'Mr. Green,' and 'Mr. Brown.' Finally, unlike Godey's novel, Sargent and Stone open the movie with the villains occupying the train and the response of the authorities to their demands. In his novel, Godey relied on flashbacks to flesh out the characters. Instead, Stone incorporates important exposition about these characters while they are on the train negotiating with the authorities."The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" isn't the greatest thriller ever made, but it is very good. The sneezing gag is tremendous. Godey didn't have it in his book, but it is truly a stroke of genius. People who want to see more blood and violence may be disappointed because blood and violence is held to a minimum. Indeed, when "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" came out, the MPAA gave it an R-rating, primarily for its profanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not know that I have missed such a great movie so far. I read the reviews of this movie and also knew there is a remake coming this year with Denzel W. I wanted to see the original flick first (this one). This is a kind of movie I wanted to see in a long time! No unnecessary plot developments and story begins immediately. And it picks up pace as it goes along. All the characters are natural and strong, an important thing that we miss in todays movies which are bloated with fake expressions and lingo-jingos.The movie doesn't boast a huge cast but you couldn't notice any bad performance by even supporting artists. No spectacular visual effects or gun-firing but brilliant screenplay keeps you occupied and the editing is so good that there is no single scene that is unnecessary to the movie. Very good classic that has been under-rated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good suspense with a touch of humor, good Matthau role.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, the title. In the New York subway system trains are noted by their location and the time of departure. So the train called "Pelham 1 2 3" left at 1:23PM. But then, what would they call the one leaving at 1:23AM??The new version with Travolta is hitting theaters soon, so I wanted to see the original first. I will see the new one in about 6 months.Walter Matthau, already into his 50s and as seasoned an actor as there was, is transit officer Lt. Garber. The highlight of his day was to be giving a group of Japanese transit executives a tour of the NYC facilities. But that is interrupted when they get word that four unknown gunmen have taken the Pelham 123 hostage, with passengers on board. Their demand is straightforward, deliver to them $1Million by exactly 60 minutes, otherwise a passenger would be executed every minute they were late.All the crooks gave themselves code names, various colors. The leader was Brit Robert Shaw as Blue. The other two key characters were Martin Balsam as Green and Hector Elizondo as the hot-headed Grey. Also Earl Hindman was Brown.What puzzled Garber was how did the crooks expect to get away with this, you can't exactly run away inside a subway!Also good was Garber's coworker, Jerry Stiller as Lt. Rico Patrone.Good action and suspense, but with the usual very cheesy soundtrack that you would expect for the 1970s. SPOILERS: As the money is being packaged and delivered, we see the four crooks had planned to get off the train and rig the dead-man control to run the train without a driver. One of them, Green, had been a train driver formerly, and released for poor performance. But he knew the system and knew where they could surface without being caught, each with one-quarter of the money hidden under their winter coats. But a plainclothes cop on the train jumps off and follows them, and shoots one of them. Blue ends up shooting Grey himself, and Green manages to get away and home. Garber finds his way down to the tracks and traps the mastermind, Blue, who electrocutes himself on the tracks instead of being captured. Then, in the final scene, Garber and Patrone go to the apartment of Green. They didn't discover the money, but as they were leaving Green sneezes, the same sneeze Garber had heard over the radio from the train. Gotcha!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real 70s gem...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies of the 70s which never quite got the credit it deserved. Lots of great performances but the stand outs are Matthau as Lt. Garber struggling to deal with the equally good Robert Shaw as Mr Blue, leader of the hijackers. The contrast between these two characters is one of the highlights of the film. Garber is the wise-cracking, world-weary New Yorker - Mr Blue the intelligent, cool, calculating Englishman who somehow still manages to retain an air of English politeness and good manners while being a ruthless killer. This film combines tension and suspense with laughs along the way - not an easy combination - but it works. By the way, I've noticed some comments about Shaw along the lines of him "working hard to sound English". Shaw WAS English and trained at RADA (the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London) so I think there's a good chance his English accent is pretty good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That's the difference between you and me. I've always done my own killing."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1970s was the decade for the thriller genre. Riding the crest of the American New Wave, emerging filmmakers were free to pursue realism in their pictures, and suddenly the genre was transformed from the stuffy Gothic melodrama of yesteryear into the authentic this-could-happen-to-you urban thriller, often exploiting the Watergate Scandal for some old-fashioned government conspiracy. Though Alan J. Pakula's 'All the President's Men (1976)' is the crowning achievement of this period, 'The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974)' is still among the decade's finest thrillers. The film was adapted from a novel by Morton Freedgood {writing under the pseudonym John Godey}, and features an excellent cast in Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw and Martin Balsam, as well as ? in an unexpected treat for fans of TV comedy ? Jerry Stiller ("Seinfeld") and Earl Hindman ("Home Improvement"). Director Joseph Sargent, despite also having 'Jaws: The Revenge (1987)' to his name, really does know how to maintain the suspense, and Peter Stone's screenplay is laced with darkly-humorous lines of dialogue.The New York subway system is the most complex underground railway system in the world, and, around the clock, hundreds of (theoretically) hard-working employees are labouring to keep the system running smoothly. Every day, members of the New York City Transit Authority must investigate a vast assortment of criminal acts that regularly take place in the subway, including vandalism, theft, murder and sexual assault ? but what about a hostage situation? When a group of four heavily-armed men hijack the 1:23PM train to Pelham Bay Park Station, the entire Transit Authority is sent into a spin, and it falls to grumpy senior lieutenant Zachary Garber (Matthau) to resolve the situation. The leader of the mercenaries, sporting an icily-sinister British accent (Shaw), demands that the cash sum of $1 million be delivered to their locomotive within one hour; failure to adhere to this deadline will force him to execute innocent passengers at a rate of one per minute. However, throughout the entire ordeal, one nagging question plagues the minds of the authorities: how do these men expect to get away.In a perfect Hollywood, all ruthless and calculating villains would speak with intelligent British accents. Robert Shaw is commanding as Mr. Blue, the hijacking operation's primary mastermind, and his cold, commanding exchanges with authorities over the radio possess a chilling finality that suggests he's quite willing to carry out everything he's just threatened to do. Martin Balsam, an actor of whom I am quite fond, was momentarily unnoticed beneath a fake moustache and a hacking cough, but he plays the uncertain criminal with perfect tentativeness. Walter Matthau, who played a similar role completely straight in 'Fail-Safe (1964),' adds some humour to his performance as Lt. Garber, particularly in the way he's consistently deprecating Mr. Blue over the radio, even if the insults appear to bounce off the hijacker as though he doesn't even notice them. For the film's conclusion, the tension finally eases enough to ensure some solid breathing room, and Garber's double-take and final stare, a mixture of surprise and amusement, is pure brilliance.

		<shortDescription>The Best from New York</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of New York City's greatest movies. Number 2 on my all time favorite list (after "The Train"---Burt Lancaster). Includes the greatest music score of all time, in my opinion; studio big band delivers the sounds of the traffic and the pulse of the subways, brilliantly carried off. Walter Matthau's greatest movie, backed by a tremendous supporting cast that captures the mood and fabric of New York at that time. A perfect mix of dark comedy (some scenes of which would end up scrapped today---and in fact have, on a rather poor remake of the movie for TV several years back) and dead serious drama. You need just the right type of people in a movie of this kind, and this one is brilliantly cast, in some cases right down to physical attributes---even the mayor (Lee Wallace) resembles Mayor Koch (before he was elected!). Should you see the picture? Some past demographics imply you'll appreciate it much more if you come from the city of New York. But even if your home is elsewhere, if you like action movies that are as realistic as they can be without "over the top" special effects, this is one you shouldn't pass up. It's unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavily armed men hi-jack a subway train.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The focus of the movie is on how can it be done. How can New York City get 1 million dollars down to a subway car in just 1 hour, then how can the hi-jackers get away. This obviously well planned endeavor executed by intelligent men involves taking a train that can only follow the tracks, in a tunnel, no less. Everyone knows where the tracks go and where all (known) escape routes are.Using the then state of the art technology, the appropriate branches of the New York City Government work together as a well oiled machine. The clunky patching together of their different communications systems allow them to privately snipe at each other while still cooperating to insure every exit is covered.Made in 1974, it has the heavy handed obligatory anti-discrimination dogma crow-barred in to place in an occasionally successful attempt at humor. That emphasizes how the workplace had recently changed with respect to sex, race, and country of origin no longer predicting holders of positions of authority in a large municipality. Like their technology, it is now seems out of place and is an interesting comment on that time in our history.I appreciate how, with few exceptions, the principles involved are good at their job. From the Mayor down to the conductor on the train, they are competent, with no contrived weaknesses added as a mere plot device. I found the story credible, and the politics interesting as to how each level of government try to work with the rest to avoid a bloody massacre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A neglected classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While virtually unknown to today's audiences, the influence of this neglected classic can be seen in Reservoir Dogs, Speed as well as a host of other hit films. From a day before computer generated FX and MTV produced attention span cripples Pelham creates excitement and almost unbearable suspense via memorable characters, crackling dialogue and a wonderfully sly sense of humor.Walter Matthau delivers one of his best performances as a sardonic cynical police detective matching wits with a band of ruthless terrorists who have hijacked a subway car demanding a million dollar ransom for the release of its passengers. Robert Shaw is absolutely unforgettable as the cold-blooded terrorist leader. His British accent and erudite, sophisticated demeanor make for a wonderfully evil villain who hisses his lines like a deadly snake. Shaw's villain is an icy monster who never looses his composure?he even absently mindedly works crossword puzzles while waiting for the ransom to be delivered?and thinks no more of killing innocent hostages than swatting a fly.This is one of the best crime/suspense films of the 1970s and deserves a much wider audience than it has. Fortunately it's now out on a decent?though sadly lacking in extras?DVD package. See it as an example of how suspense films should be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There can be few instances when title music so perfectly suited a movie. It's a big, brash, jazzy number that could almost be an anthem for New York city. Then, if you listen carefully, there's an understated - almost mechanical - riff beneath the blaring brass that is a metaphor for the subway train itself. Somebody knew exactly what they wanted, and got it. It's perfect. (If you want to hear a benchmark of ineptitude - check out 'Ashanti').And the movie lives up to expectations. Most of the people are ignorant, coarse and vulgar in varying degrees, but their characters are funny with it. Walter Mathau plays the world-weary head of railway security, showing a contingent of Japanese visitors around with manifest contempt, referring to them as monkeys, unaware that they can speak English (perhaps I should say 'Manhattanese). His boss is a loud-mouthed fool. The mayor is a cynical vote-counter in bed with the flu. A fulminating supervisor won't take 'No' for an answer, and catches the first bullet.Despite the humour, it is no comedy. A subway train is hijacked and held to ransom. The 4 villains, led by an icy, ruthless ex-Briton, convincingly played by Robert Shaw, also feature an equally ruthless but almost unbalanced mafia hoodlum.They, along with their prisoner-passengers, are a strange mix, creating unpredictable conflicts.It's a solid action-movie, taut and highly original. The passing years haven't dulled its impact. Quite the contrary, recent acts of terrorism have only served to highlight the conspicuous vulnerability of its subject.There's a lot to be said for taking a cab.But take the movie as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic crime film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say. This film is near perfect. It's not filled with pyrotechnics, breathtaking chase scenes, and characters that defy our ability to believe. Despite the lack of these elements which are almost mandatory in recent films (Heat and Speed are wonderful examples)this movie keeps its audience on the edge of its seat.How does it do it? Sheer force of character! Robert Shaw is evil, and we know it from the git go. He conveys this to the audience without shooting anyone, kicking a dog, or beating a woman. Matthau is a transit cop who is a bit worn down and cynical. But under the cynicism you can sense the toughness and determination. These two characters are the perfect protagonists. Much better than DeNiro and Pacino. It is the tension between these two characters that keep you on the edge of your seat - not the action of which there is very little.Add to this a great ensemble cast that includes Martin Balsam, Hector Elizondo, and the city of New York, and a very clever plot with a wonderful little twist at the end, and you have one of the best crime films of the 70s. Hell, you've got one of the best crime films of them all.And best of all, the film translates well to the small screen. But then, any film that relies on its characters to carry it almost always does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film. Walter Matthau is absolutely hilarious in it, and the mixture of droll humour and tension, interspersed with violence works extremely well, none of the moods being affected by the others. The naturalistic style of acting and the unglamourous visuals paint a picture of realism; in fact the movie looks like a Mike Leigh film in places, and shares a feel for New York with The French Connection and Klute in its seedy realism. The scenes with Warren and the Mayor are a delight, and the moment when Gharber snaps and grabs Frank is a scream. One interesting feature is the portrayal of the hostages. There is a sarcastic cartoon of New York people on display here; they are observed with the right degree of caricature without becoming pure stereotypes, despite their descriptions in the credits. The hostages do not strike up friendships or save each other's lives, more they behave as people in these situations ndo...they are not allowed to communicate and when left to their fate they are not comforting or optimistic. The hijackers are excellently portrayed and Hector Elizondo is magnificent. Although I found the escape of the hijackers a little (only a little) implausible- I won't say why in caes it spoils it for people who haven't seen it- the excitement is intense and the professionalism of Zack throughout the whole nightmare situation gives the film a great pivot. He is not a hero, merely a professional who's seen it all and is not fazed by anything. And a word for that score...anyone else noticed how similar it is to the score for McQ (same year)? It is magnificent, heavy and steam roller like with a humour lurking beneath the surface. I've raved enough...this is a great movie which manages to build strong characterisation without any background detail, merely exposing them by their reactions to the situation. Matthau's real strangth comes in his effortless manner of making lines funny by their straight delivery. And finally, look out for that wonderful documentary style camera shot in the last scene when Martin Balsam says "you said you'd tell me why." A gem.</fullReview>

This, for me, is the essence of Shaw's brilliance as an actor. He had a sort of coldness and sarcasm that I can only compare to another great character actor in Claude Rains. Both of them were wonderful villians. When they were the guys, you know they were the bad guys...and in this film you know that Shaw is one bad guy. The way he looks at his watch, as time is of the essence. The precision with how handles his every move. That voice! He had a voice that was almost like a hiss from a snake. It was amazing, his talent and dedication to a character. This was one of his best... see it again and watch closely for Shaw's intense performance.</fullReview>

The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is a masterpiece of a thriller and certainly one that is too-often overlooked. It contains a large dose of humor, much of it by Walter Matthau, that helps the film tremendously. And while its plot may seem formulaic at first, further viewing will show that it is anything but.

		<shortDescription>My Second Favorite Movie Of The 1970's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I try to avoid using words like "the Best" when it comes to movies since it is all so subjective. I feel much more comfortable and poised discussing my personal favorites, and why I love them. Walter Matthau is virtually ideal as the world-weary and sarcastic New York police detective. Capable of interjecting quick wit into the most morbid situations and equally capable of committing numerous faux pas, he nonetheless NEVER loses his humanity and does not let fear of ridicule deter him from taking care of the business at hand. I have never seen a movie portray a cop that, at the same time, is so realistic as a human being, entertaining as a character, and effective as a detective despite inevitable false starts. There is not a false note in Matthau's performance.As a perfect complement to Matthau's tour-de-force, the quartet of crooks (Shaw, Elizondo, Balsam, and Hindman) all present facades of coldly and brutally efficient professionalism as robbers-by-choice but murderers-only-by-necessity. Shaw and Elizondo are superb with the two showier roles, but they are made even more effective by the underplayed professional support supplied by Hindman and Balsam. The latter contributes mightily to the film's unforgettable final scene.The plot, music, photography, background, dialog, and the rest of the supporting cast -- most especially Dick O'Neill as a vengeful city worker, Lee Wallace as the whiny mayor, and Tony Roberts as Wallace's image consultant -- are all equally up to the task.I love many 1970's movies. Probably not coincidentally, my #1 favorite remains the Sting, another caper movie. Some of my other favorites that still hold up well today include: Rocky, Sleuth, Patton, M*A*S*H, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, American Graffiti, Paper Moon, Kramer Vs. Kramer, Star Wars, Taxi Driver, Fiddler On The Roof, Brian's Song, The Godfather, The Last Detail, and Cabaret. Nevertheless, if I'm alone on a rainy day here in New York City, and wish to be entertained, frequently the first movie I will select is The Taking Of Pelham-One-Two-Three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joseph Sargent was a well respected director of mostly television, but he also helmed a number of feature films over the years. This may very well be his best. (I won't hold "Jaws: The Revenge" against him.) It's a masterfully directed, well plotted crime thriller, and one of the finest of that genre to come out of NYC in the 1970s. It doesn't boast wall to wall action, instead focusing on telling an actual story, but when the action scenes do take place, they're utterly gripping and nail biting. Best of all, the movie does have a good sense of humor, paying itself off in a couple of ways.Robert Shaw, Martin Balsam, Hector Elizondo, and Earl Hindman play a quartet of ruthless men who hijack an NYC subway train and hold almost 20 passengers hostage. Their demand? One million dollars in cash (back then, it would have been a lot of money), to be delivered in ONE HOUR. Otherwise, the passengers start getting executed. Intrepid Transit Authority lawman Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) is the calm, level headed Everyman hero who tries to appease the bad guys while ensuring the hostages come out of the situation unscathed.Sargent and his top notch filmmaking team (including such luminaries as cinematographer Owen Roizman and editor Jerry Greenberg) craft a well paced bit of entertainment, enhanced by a dynamic and forceful music score by David Shire. There are some fun quips among the dialogue, and the performances are all right on the money. There's no scenery chewing here - even loose cannon Mr. Grey (Elizondo) is fairly low key while causing an overt amount of trouble for his co-conspirators. Shaw is a smooth villain, while Matthau is as amiable as he's ever been. In addition, there's a steady parade of stars and familiar character actors filling out a great many roles: James Broderick, Dick O'Neill, Lee Wallace, Tom Pedi, Beatrice Winde, Jerry Stiller, Nathan George, Kenneth McMillan, Doris Roberts, Julius Harris, Alex Colon, Michael Gorrin, Christopher Murney, Sal Viscuso, Bill Cobbs, Joe Seneca, and Tony Roberts. Most impressive!"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is a truly great thriller, one that reels you in early on and scarcely takes a breath until its satisfying, blatantly humorous denouement.Remade for TV in 1998, and for theaters in 2009.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>New York City. Four armed men hijack a subway train and hold the passengers hostage for a million dollars ransom. It's up to crusty veteran transit detective Lt. Zachary Garber (a marvelously cantankerous performance by Walter Matthau) to maintain order while pandemonium erupts all around him.Director Joseph Sargent keeps the gripping story racing along at a breathless swift pace, generates plenty of nerve-wracking tension, and offers a pungent evocation of 1970's New York City in all its brash, loud, rude, and seedy glory. Peter Stone's tightly constructed script provides loads of choice cynical humor and has a refreshing dearth of pretense. Robert Shaw as ruthless ringleader Mr. Blue makes for a great coldblooded and calculating villain; he receives sturdy support from Martin Balsam as the antsy Mr. Green, Hector Elizondo as the volatile Mr. Grey, and Earl Hindman as hulking brute Mr. Brown. Moreover, there are sound contributions from Dick O'Neill as huffy desk train master Frank Correll, Lee Wallace as the whiny flu-stricken mayor, Tom Pedi as irascible railroad boss Caz Dolowicz, Jerry Stiller as the laid-back Lt. Rico Patrone, Kenneth McMillan as a no-nonsense borough commander, Tony Roberts as sensible deputy mayor Warren LaSalle, Julius Harris as the hard-nosed Inspector Daniels, and Nathan George as noble patrolman Jones. Further enhanced by Owen Roizman's crisp widescreen cinematography, given an extra kinetic kick by David Shire's driving'n'dynamic score, and topped off by a priceless last image, this honey rates highly as one of the all-time best and most exciting nail-biters from the gloriously gritty 1970's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Who's gonna steal a subway train?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago, make that many decades ago, I stumbled into the middle of this picture and was intrigued enough to watch it to the end. I never bothered to try catching the entire movie until it showed up on cable the other night. I have to say, this is one of those Seventies action flicks that just grabs you and doesn't let go until the red lights come on. Another picture that did the same for me back then was the original "Assault on Precinct 13" with John Carpenter at the helm. You have to catch that one too.Probably the first thing I noticed in the film were the names of the four subway thugs. I had to wonder if this was the source of Tarantino's inspiration for the criminals in "Reservoir Dogs". In fact, there's a Mr. Blue and a Mr. Brown in both pictures. And as for the mayor of New York City (Lee Wallace), I couldn't help thinking that he might have been selected for his resemblance to Ed Koch, until I realized that Koch wasn't mayor until a few years later. So that was interestingly prophetic.Like everyone else who watches the movie while trying to figure out how the hijackers would get away with it, it never occurs that the simplest solution would be the best - just get off at some point along the way. I thought it was just a bit too coincidental the way Garber (Walter Mattthau) second guessed the bad guys, but there was still enough suspense to keep one invested in the story. With nice dollops of humor thrown in every now and then, the picture still holds up pretty well after forty years, and will make you think twice the next time you board a subway train.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How did these 3 misfits first meet to plan such a dastardly action? I just kept wondering about that as I continued to watch this engrossing film regarding terror on the subways.A New Yorker can really identify with some of the characters here- foul mouthed, crass, abusive, but all working together for the common good of trying to save the 18 hostages, innocent victims, all of whom happened to be in the wrong train at the wrong time.Robert Shaw is a standout in a cold-chilling performance as an indifferent conspirator, who shows no regard for human life yet alone decency. Marty Balsam is the former MTA motorman angered over his dismissal and the third culprit, Hector Elizondo, is literally along for the ride, only to be victimized by the vicious Shaw character.A totally realistic view of New York with a mayor concerned with sagging poll numbers and how this event can affect that. Doris Roberts has little to do in the role of his wife.Walter Matthau is the hero transit officer official, who can be common but has the brains to ultimately outwit the culprits.A memorable film showing the darker side of New York City.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Film from the 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always amused by those who wax nostalgic for 1970's New York. Truth be told, it was a chaotic, dreary period in the city's history as it teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. Corruption and street crime were rampant. It was far from paradise.This grittiness, however, inspired some fine movie-making which perfectly captured the atmosphere and culture in the Big City. With its frantic pace and frenzied intensity, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three represents such an effort. It boasts a fine cast and is well-directed. It features an outstanding score by composer David Shire. And it proves that action-thrillers can indeed be effective without massive budgets and an over-reliance on special effects.Four criminals code named Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Brown and Mr. Grey mastermind the hijacking of an NYC subway train. Detaching a single car holding seventeen people, they demand one million dollars from the city, threatening to shoot one hostage for each minute the money is late. NY Transit Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) is tasked with handling the crisis and communicating directly with their leader, the ruthless Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw). Garber is the quintessential New Yorker; cynical yet quick on his feet. With the help of Police Captain Rico Petrone (Jerry Stiller), he matches wits with the criminals in an effort to deliver the money, save the hostages and identify and apprehend the hijackers.The movie never drags and keeps us guessing. Despite its serious theme, Pelham has comedic elements- most notably Garber's early dealings with a visiting Japanese transportation delegation and his interplay with a Head Dispatcher (Dick O'Neill) more concerned with keeping his trains running on time than he is with a hostage crisis. Also funny are scenes with the neurotic Mayor of New York trying to gather the ransom by the deadline. It mirrors the buffoonery of many real life politicians unable to effectively handle a crisis and accurately reflects the very real money woes NYC had at the time.Matthau, Shaw, Stiller &amp; O'Neill all perform their roles well, as do Martin Balsam and Hector Elizondo- two members of the heist crew. And The Taking of Pelham also has maybe the best ending I've ever seen in a film. A super movie. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film about a tough city .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear George Carlin,in one of your shows you spoke about how New York is the toughest city in America and if a hurricane ever came to New York it would show the hurricane its middle finger.Well, The Taking of Pelham 123 is the quintessential New York film I guess. It is about the people who run the city's subway system and how they handle a hostage situation. The film is full of badass characters who don't blink an eyelid even when they learn that a train has been hijacked. John Godey and Peter Stone deserve special mention for writing some really clever, funny and politically incorrect dialog. The dialog really helped in emphasizing the city's tough third world culture that you spoke about, George. The dialog really made this movie. The action mostly takes place inside the train and the offices of the people who run the system.Walter Matthau is effortlessly cool as an efficient detective. The scene where he takes the visiting Japanese officials around was very funny.A terrific rip roaring score by David Shire is perfect for the film's tough characters but it is underused.Best Regards, Pimpin.(8/10)</fullReview>

What you see is all real so forget the 2009 remake and pick this one up even as it is 40 years old.This is an instant classic with excellent performances and even a bit of joking in the beginning with the Japanese people. I remember seen it with my dad back in the days when I was a teenager and nowadays that almost everything is available I ordered it and didn't regret it after all. What starts out as a hijack of a metroline in NY slowly turns into a cat and mouse game. The story is so strong that it never bored me at all. Even as I still remember what did happen you just sit through this action thriller and the ride is over before you know it. earlier I told that there were no effects and before people will say hey, there are, well, speeding up the reel isn't an effect for me, what you see happening above ground and in the metrolines is actually filmed in NY. No shaky camera's or over the top shots, straight in your face as it should be done. Perfect, no go take the ride.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 1/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somebody down there knows how to drive a train. You don't pick that up watching Sesame Street.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is directed by Joseph Sargent, is based on the novel by John Godey, has music by David Shire and stars Robert Shaw, Walter Matthau, Martin Balsam, Earl Hindman, Hector Elizondo, Julius Harris and Lee Wallace.This is one of the best thrillers of the 1970's a film filled with suspense, action, tension and a great deal of humour too.Four heavily armed men(Robert Shaw, Hector Elizondo, Martin Balsam and Earl Hindman)hijack a New York subway train and hold the passengers hostage. The leader of the group Mr Blue(Robert Shaw)contacts the Transit Police and demands payment of one million dollars cash. There is a deadline when the money has to be delivered by or Blue and his men will kill hostages until it's delivered.The Transit Police officer who ends up speaking to Mr Blue over the train radio is Lt. Zachary Garber(Walter Matthau). Garber tries desperately to get the deadline extended knowing that it is not going to be easy persuading the Mayor's office to decide to let them have the money, let alone deliver it to the subway on time. Garber also tries to figure out what nobody else is asking, how do the gang intend to escape the subway if they get the money? An added complication arises when the Garber learns that a Police officer is on the train, Garber doesn't know if it's a man or a woman and worries what will happen if they try and take on the hijackers.Given the subject matter it's a surprise to hear quite a bit of funny dialogue in this. The cast are all superb with Matthau proving he could be a fine dramatic actor as well as a brilliant comic. Shaw is chilling as Mr Blue but is never monstrous, unlike Hector Elizondo as the crazy Mr Grey, who can't wait to start shooting hostages. Martin Balsam is excellent as Mr Green who is responsible for driving for the train, he is suffering from a cold which he will end up wishing he had gotten rid of long before taking on this job. Earl Hindman is also very good as Mr Brown.Lee Wallace is hysterical as the Mayor who is also suffering from a bad cold and must decide whether to allow the payment of the ransom or not. James Bond fans will enjoy seeing Julius Harris in this as a Police Inspector. This is a really good thriller and is there any chance that the gangs colour cover names were an inspiration to Quentin Tarantino when he made Reservoir Dogs?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Confession - I watched the Tony Scott remake of this Sargent flick with Denzel Washington and John Travolta first. Another - that, in no way diminished from my enjoying this on TV recently. Yes, there are those repartees that are more a norm, them being organic and all, though they were rehearsed, of the 70's staple, that could be found in movies of any genre (with a few not-too- notable exceptions, of course). Yes, like many movies of that period, it looks like 'French Connection' (the first one). Yes, 'Payback' got the 70's period soundtrack right. This one has the pounding score throughout, except when it's all silent for us to get the sound design. Very nice.The plot's the same, with the plan being the same, and the dead man's feature being the linchpin of the gig. It's been a while since I watched Robert Shaw man it up as the suave baddie. He does one more fantastic job, that evokes memories of his other good roles, in 'From Russia with love' and 'The Sting', among others. he would have made a great Marlowe, along with the other Robert.Speaking of evocative turns, Matthau pretty much mans it up too, throwing politically incorrect barbs all the way, while Jerry Stiller is very much himself, and Hector Elizondo playing the kind of character we have not seen him play in a long, long time, wishing he'd had more screen time. Balsam is, as always, fantastic, and his 'tic' (Hic) that's used very much for effect, and a key twist as well, is super- endearing.The focus is on the narrative throughout, and this has to be one of the best edited features out there, and does not seem dated a bit. Mattahu plays the kind of reluctant and recalcitrant hero we have seen before, but the way he kind of eases into it allows us to get into his shoes quite a few times, and there's no doubt about who's actually in control in all the exchanges he has with Shaw, even though things on the surface might indicate otherwise.Not to be missed, and worth repeat viewings. The remake's pretty decent too, but if I were asked to choose, in spite of my fondness for Tony Scott movies, and the Washington-Travolta combo, I'd have to say that the original's the better movie of the two, even though I saw it after the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An urban thriller with charisma and a vitality all of its own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We are going to kill one passenger a minute until New York City pays us $1 Million.""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is a perfect example of a tension filled, wonderfully constructed, and extremely entertaining thriller. It's a testament to "Pelham" that it has been remade twice--once as a made-for-TV movie, and the other as a big-budget action picture. However, the decision to produce these remakes hasn't yielded satisfying results. Peter Stone earned an Oscar nomination in 1974 for his screenplay, which is adapted from John Godey's 1973 novel. You can count among its biggest admirers Quentin Tarantino, who borrowed the color-coded nicknames of the villains in the film for his band of thieves in "Reservoir Dogs."Four armed men hijack a New York City subway train and demand $1 million dollars which must be delivered in 1 hour for the release of the passengers held hostage. Lt. Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) of the New York City Transit Police must contend with City Hall, the demands of the hijackers, and the ticking clock in his efforts to save the passengers and bring the hijackers to justice. The initial hijacking plan doesn't seem to make any sense because their options are so limited. At one point Lt. Garber jokingly says: "They're gonna get away by asking every man, woman and child in New York City to close their eyes and count to a hundred." But there is a clever getaway plan coordinated by Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw), who plays a former mercenary soldier. His team members include two professional criminals and a fired motorman (Martin Balsam) with a grudge.The main strength of the film is the acting. Shaw, Balsam, and Elizondo each get to play to their own specific skill set. Shaw is cool, devious, and calculating. Balsam is a working class, somewhat decent, criminal. On the other side of things, Matthau is at his sardonic best as Garber. Little time is spent on the back story, subplots, or exploration of motives. It's about a subway train, the bad guys, the good guys, hostages, and money. That's it. comparing the original to the 2009 Tony Scott- directed remake, where substantial screen time is devoted to such concerns, the movie falls well short. Do yourself a favor: instead of watching the remake, seek out the original. It's an urban thriller with charisma and a vitality all of its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the things that I didn't expect was the HUMOR in THE TAKING OF PELHAM 123: it's off the rails. Walter Matthau was capable of dire drama (see the original FAIL-SAFE) as well as side-splitting comedy (see THE ODD COUPLE); in THE TAKING OF PELHAM 123, he indulges in a bit of BOTH. While everyone around him seems to be taking things in stride (more or less), his character gets caught up in the gravity of the situation early on. Even so, he seems to have a fatalistic sense of humor about it all (though he never belittles the kidnappers or openly makes light of them or the situation); it's a well-balanced performance by a man who's at the top of his game. I enjoyed the remake just as much as this version, but the humor here caught me by surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I say it just doesn't get any better than this I do not speak in jest. The original novel, dealing with the taking of a NY subway by an ex-mercenary and three accomplices for ransom, was a wonderful study of urban American life in the 1970's. That was a really good mainstream novel. I dare say this movie does what few movies of good novels ever do - it tells the story even better. I further dare say it trumps another Robert Shaw movie of 1974, the Oscar winner The Sting. Shaw coldly and coolly plays the mercenary who spars with Matthau, playing Leftenant Gah-ber of the NYC transit police, maybe in his best role ever. The movie takes the best pieces of the novel and then adds a couple of twists of its own, just superb screenplay work. The more recent theatrical version is a good workmanlike telling but does not stand up to the classic. Enjoy.</fullReview>

What it DOES have, is magic. Walter Matthau offers up his usual fantastic acting mixed with a touch of classic comedy lines of that time. A great movie, in my opinion, is one that when you see it on TV, no matter what part is on at the time, you lock into it and watch it. Every time. This movie IS that type of movie. Sadly, I don't think the generations that came after this even have a clue as to what is actually good, as their requirements/expectations for what they call a "movie" is so distorted today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edge-of-the-seat the whole way. It's a single-minded storyline that holds together in nerve- wracking fashion. Four crooks hijack a NY subway car, holding the passengers for a million dollar ransom or they'll be shot one-by-one for each minute the ransom delivery is late. Whew! Mr. Blue (Shaw), the brains of the gang, is calm, cool, and collected. He better be, because it seems every cop in the city is on the case. Meanwhile, back at subway headquarters, transit cop Garber (Matthau) is trying to keep a handle on the chaos the gang's tight schedule has caused. Usually the authorities are portrayed as cool professionals. Here, they're portrayed much more realistically considering the pressure they're under. And for once, movie cursing amounts to more than just a stab at reality. The profanity amounts to a good pressure check as the crisis intensifies. (Speaking of bureaucrats, somebody really has it in for NYC mayors since the movie's mayor is treated as not only hopelessly inept, but buffoonish, as well!)Matthau and Shaw are excellent in the two leads. Matthau registers just the right amount of wavering emotion one would expect in his situation, while Shaw remains calmly dispassionate right up to the end. A mystery man through and through. And I love that final sequence where director Sargent does a typically Hitchcockian turnaround that has us rooting for Mr. Green (Balsam) as he tries to hide evidence from the cops. And what about the very last shot, about as ironically inspired as I've seen in decades of movie watching. I can't believe there are remakes when this first version appears the last word in suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nail biting, tense thriller that makes you laugh in spite of horrible situation....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Head back in time 38 years along Lexington Avenue's 6 Line; You'll notice few changes on that New York City subway line with the exception of the entrances/exits to each station with the various abbreviations (such as IRT) used back then. Still crowded, smelly, too fast paced for some, yet a bit safer and always an adventure. Add on a major crisis, in this case, a hostage situation. "Who'd want to steal a subway?" one person here asks. Someone wanting a million dollars, that's who, and in this case, there are four of them. Walter Matthau plays the head of the subway police whose early part of the afternoon has consisted of showing what he thinks are non-English speaking Japanese members of the Tokyo Metro Board around their office. He's in for two surprises. A little lesson in diplomacy is followed by the worst crisis since a bomb threat turned out only to be a cantaloupe. Four men, dressed almost alike, enter the train at different stops. Since this train left Pelham (the start of the line up in the Bronx) at 1:23, it is in the middle of its journey between 28th and 23rd streets when the train suddenly comes to a stop. The four guys pull out their automatics, and as soon as headquarters notices, the train is contacted without the conductor answering. It isn't until one of them finally calls in that they learn that the remaining people aboard this single car (separated from the others) will be killed unless the city meets their demands.This is certainly not a comedy, but if you feel the tension of what the politicians, police and public transportation people are feeling, you'll understand why they have to crack wise. The unpopular mayor happens to be down with the flu that day; One of the women who works with the transit police has dropped her wedding ring down the john; and another officer is too busy reading the paper to acknowledge the influential Japanese VIP's visiting. There's also the fact that the terrorists don't get along, and one of them (Hector Elizondo) is obviously even more psycho than the rest. The transit police must get the $1000000 from the New Amsterdam Building on Center Street down to 23rd and Lexington within a ridiculously short time. This creates one of the greatest action scenes on NY City Streets covering a good majority of lower-mid Manhattan. It's as exciting as the chase sequence in "Bullitt". There is an excessive amount of violence, but considering the plot, it is absolutely necessary.I found myself riveted to the screen from beginning to end, actually routing for one of the bad guys in spite of the fact he was a crook. There's a really funny brief bit concerning a drunk passenger in the hostage-held car that has a great pay-off. Not one false note to make this a great film. Some reviews complain about the cursing and unlikable characters, but NY City in 1974 (let alone today) is not Disneyand. Tony Roberts, Doris Roberts, and Jerry Stiller are among the recognizable faces in smaller roles. And the ending? A punch-line that will have you in stitches!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a clever yet underrated NY-un-PC thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shining a flashlight on un-politically correct New York City in the 1970's, this film has little bit of everything, much like the city it takes place in. Intelligent and unforgiving, the director captures the dearth of the subway system as Walter Mathau, Robert Shaw, Martin Balsam, Hector Elizonda &amp; Dick O'Neill play nursemaid to it, one way or another. The city is a character above and below the ground and is on parade as the hostage drama plays out while a militant 70's jazz score systematically picks up the pulse. There is as much action as humor, but they do not prey upon ech other like in todays' action thrillers. They are not simply trying to be cool, but seemingly real... So. who's gonna steel a subway car?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast Moving, Exciting Seventies Thriller..What a Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this movie coming on last night on Turner Classic Movies, and not being sleepy, decided to settle back and enjoy a film that I had not seen since I was a boy of eleven when it first came out and my parents took me. I had forgotten what a thrilling, exciting, and often uproariously funny gem of a thriller this movie was, and it still holds up beautifully almost four decades later.I read in the trivia that the producers said that PELHAM was a smash hit in cities with subways but flopped pretty much everywhere else, which I find hard to understand, because you do not need to be familiar with any subway system to enjoy this movie's taut script, edgy direction, brilliant performances, perfect atmospheric score, and the astonishing way it walks the tightrope between nail-biting suspense and laugh-out-loud comedy (The Mayor of New York is a particular joy; looks a bit like Ed Koch and whines about being booed in public, and sure enough, when he makes his obligatory public appearance, the crowd boos. That moment alone is worth the price of the ticket.) Interestingly enough, this film came out four years BEFORE Koch became Mayor; a happy accident, if you will, but one that makes the movie that much more fun. Back to the main plot. I think by now, thanks to the 2009 remake (though God knows why they bothered; you cannot improve on what is already nearly perfect), most people know at least the bare bones of the plot: Four men in disguises hijack a Lexington Avenue line subway train, detaching one car from the rest of the train and demanding a million dollars in one hour or they will begin shooting hostages (a wonderful collection of characters as New York as they can get). The task of dealing with this crisis falls to Transit Authority policeman Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau, brilliant as always), who must rouse the Mayor out of his sickbed (he has the flu), butt heads with MTA official Corell (Dick O'Neill in a splendid performance), and do his usual bellowing and strutting, all with perfectly executed timing, in an effort to get the crisis resolved without the shedding of innocent blood.The villains are a fascinating lot. Led by Robert Shaw in a chilling performance as Mr Blue (they use colors as code names), the crew consists of Mr Grey (Hector Elizondo), a trigger-happy former mobster (is there such a thing?), Mr Brown (Earl Hindman), the group's general gofer, and Mr Green (Martin Balsam in another of the splendid character roles he was so justly famous for), a former subway motorman fired by the MTA and presumably trying to get even, and suffering from a rather noticeable head cold (keep your eye on that).This is one of those great movies that is bigger and better than the sum of its parts. Its parts are nothing to sneeze at (you should excuse the pun), but put together, they create nothing short of cinematic magic; this is easily one of the best suspense thrillers since Hitchcock's heyday, and I think the Master of Suspense would have been proud to claim it as his own.Predictably enough, things do not go as smoothly as Garber would wish; getting a million dollars together in less than an hour is no small feat (demonstrated in a brilliant montage of scenes of hands and machines counting, sorting, and bundling hundred-dollar bills), and Garber's pleas for more time fall on deaf ears. Blue is a cold, calculating killer and completely impossible to turn from his purpose.I won't give away too much more, but at the crisis point the subway car is rigged so that it will go from Times Square to South Ferry (roughly fifty City blocks or so) with nothing but green signals so that it will not only not stop, but will pick up speed and eventually we are faced with a runaway subway car, screaming hostages, police rendered impotent, and a chiller of a denouement that ends at the final moment with an unexpected laugh (I won't tell you what it is; it would be too much of a spoiler).I am a native New Yorker and lived there for more than forty years and rode the subways regularly, so this movie was and is a particular treat for New Yorkers. But you don't have to be from New York, or even familiar with the inner workings of a city subway system, to be captivated by Joseph Sargent's brilliant and exciting creation, with a sensational script by Peter Stone, and Owen Roizman's marvelous camera-work, a particularly notable accomplishment since, this story being set in the subway, much of the action has perforce to take place in the dark or semi-dark.Great ride. Great film. And you don't have to be from New York to love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant 70's thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie again recently after a number of years and thoroughly enjoyed it.Everything about the movie shines- the settings, script, performances and music. It rattles along at a fast pace. A lot happens in the less than 2 hours running time. Nowadays every "serious" film has to be at least 2 hours for some reason. To sell more popcorn perhaps? Matthau is excellent as the deadpan Subway police chief who tries to make the best of a nightmare situation. Shaw excels as the ruthless mercenary who came up with the plan. Supporting performances from Balsam etc are also top notch.I think a native New Yorker would appreciate the film even more as it is full of NY humour. The scenes with the the panic stricken mayor are very funny and examples of the brilliant humour in the film.Undoubtedly an underrated classic from the typically seventies theme music to the brilliant ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Slice of Life from '70s NYC Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid riding the New York City subway in the '70s, my first exposure to this movie was the ominous, black and white billboard showing a subway train moving past the viewer with just one thing out of the ordinary: a man with a machine gun standing at the back door. Jaded as I was by the crime rate in those days, that image freaked me out. Too young to see an R rated movie at the time (by today's standards it's a PG), I saw it when it came out on network TV, and WOW!!! This is a wonderful work of suspense that's totally character-driven, with Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw and all the rest giving outstanding performances. But the main character is New York City, with all the supporting characters and bit players providing a beautiful, tragicomic tableau of NYC as it was in those days. Ten years later after I'd moved to the Midwest, this was the film I watched when I was feeling homesick. It brought it all back to me, and it still does. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (a.k.a Pelham 1-2-3) is a riveting suspense movie that builds on great acting, a fine script, and an amazing story line! Walter Matthau plays a lead Police Lieutenant assigned to stop a group of four men who have hijacked a New York City Subway train. Four hijackers, with characteristics that inspired Quentin Tarentino's Reservoir Dogs, demand a one million dollar ransom within a near impossible to reach time limit, threatening to kill one hostage on the train for each minute that the money is late.An amazing music score captivates the viewer immediately. We are drawn into a character study of people representing diverse New York populations. However the real drama and tension of the movie is watching Walter Matthau and the hijacking leader Robert Shaw communicate and compromise about the hostages and the money in a race against time. Viewers of this film will actually feel as if they are part of this terrible and dramatic experience.The one small spoiler that brings the movie down a bit is in negotiating with the hostages and trying to get the mayor's approval, he says, "This city doesn't have a million dollars." This is one statement that hurts the credibility of this fine film. Even in 1974, when this film was released, New York City had far more than a million dollars if these types of situations were to take place. Having the producers place a higher number for the ransom amount may have helped here.There are other elements of the film that are very real. Authentic subway cars were used during filming, and many of the scenes have very dramatic shootouts in tunnels where you can't be sure who's dead and who has survived after the gunfire has stopped. It are little surprises around every corner that will keep you riveted to this movie till the end.Speaking of the climax, the end of this picture may be one of the most brilliantly written scenes in cinema! Whatever you do, don't bother with the two remakes of this film. There is no way that either of them can hold a candle to this slick action flick!</fullReview>

I was aware that the film was coming out this Friday, but had no idea that it was a remake. I found the original online and watched it. To my surprise I was very entertained, even stunned. Shaw is fantastic as the man who takes the subway train hostage. Matthau is quick and witty as Lt. Garber, the man in charge of the situation. The acting is superb all the way around. It stays very real even though it's a very unbelievable situation, and what an amazing ending!

		<shortDescription>Experienced Pelham at a sneak preview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea what to expect when a friend and me went to see a sneak preview, doubled up with The French Connection, a movie which I had seen a few times prior to that evening. In those days, a "sneak preview" was just that, a movie studio sneaked upcoming releases into the theatres without the benefit of early press reports. It was a tactic used to create early buzz through word of mouth from those who were fortunate enough to witness an early release of what may have gone on to become a hit?thanks, in part, to the "unwitting sneak preview marketing team".That evening's sneak was Pelham and it was exactly what I wanted to see in a movie of that genre type. There was no "early word" no "buzz" no "plot description", just a story that unfolded before my eyes.I loved it! The movie's most worthy accomplishment, in my opinion, was the way in which the movie's combined elements had it being a white-knuckle thriller along with moments of near hilarious tension breaking humor that were brought seamlessly together. I credit the movie-makers simply because the novel was a straight up caper movie.Of course, I fully acknowledge that my experience may not be shared by today's audience because of all the repetition and idea stealing that follows in the footsteps of such a popular movie like a Pelham. For me, the movie had broken new ground for most caper movies and cops &amp; robber movies of the time took themselves fairly seriously.See for yourselves. This link will take you to the 1974 version of Pelham: http://tinyurl.com/9dy6ap and be sure to watch it in full screen mode.Think about it, the movie makers had a lot of balls to introduce the kind of humor into what was to be a very serious storyline...even for today's audiences, particularly with 9/11 fresh in our collective memories. Need I say more? As with all things in our lives we are continually, even at this very moment in time, on the cutting edge of whatever mankind has to offer.All of our current achievements are stepping stones toward future achievements and the current ones could only have happened based on past achievements. This goes for movie-making as well. Far too often older movies are not met with the respect they deserve merely because they are considered "old" or...Oh my God!...in Black &amp; White.For anyone to truly appreciate films from any era one must look at the movie through the eyes of the filmmakers at the time it was made. When King Kong of 1931 was released people ran from the theatres in terror. Those who saw it in theatres at the time of its release and who may still be alive remember Kong's effect on them; still retaining that visceral experience of being one of the first to have seen such cutting edge movie-making...up to that point in time.A good movie with a solid story never loses its appeal. While some movies made today that are held in high esteem may be scoffed at and have us exclaim sometime in the future, "What were we thinking? Was "Out Of Africa" really the best picture of the year of 1985? Likewise, movies dismissed almost immediately upon release may well find an audience in the future. Examples abound of this phenomenon with the likes of Wizard of OZ; It's Wonderful Life; A Christmas Story and many more.Can you tell that I love movies?</fullReview>

Martin Balsam is superb as the mild mannered Mr Green, Hector Elizondo as his not so mild mannered co-Hort, the good guys are led by Walter Matthaua who plays the transit authority official out to try and thwart the villains, and Jerry Stiller as his co worker, also look out genre favorite julias Harris( he played Tee-Hee in live and let die)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mister pick a colour, any colour.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes we know this is where Tarantino got his idea of colour-coding his criminals in his debut crime-feature "Reservoir Dogs (1992)", but this film should be watched for not that reason. For what we get is an authentic looking thriller that might not be spectacular, but it's starkly intense and littered with hard-bitten wit. It doesn't come any anymore down 'n gritty than this! Rather than concentrating on set-pieces or action, it's the grimy character interplay and detailed realism reeling from its New York locations sets it rolling. A bold, tightly plotted story seems constantly busy, even if it doesn't look it. The humour is thick, but the edgy style of it works. There's a whole bunch of cursing and cussing? yep it can be crude, stereotypical and ugly to listen to, but it holds your interest without much trouble. This could be due to a standout cast led magnificently by Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. Matthau is superb as the weathered, but head-smart Lt. Garber. He just has a knack to hold you mesmerised by what was coming off his tongue with those well-timed jibs. Shaw is also quite good in a cunningly cool 'n' collected presentation as the head-honcho of the criminals Mr. Blue. Martin Balsam as the cautious Mr. Green, Hector Elizondo as the hot-wire Mr. Grey and Earl Hindman as the straight-forward Mr. Brown put in fine performances. There are also amusing support bits by Jerry Stiller, Dick O'Neill, Lee Wallace, Doris Roberts, Tom Pedi and a wonderfully humorous Tony Roberts. Director Joseph Sargent makes something that's very exciting, intense and unpredictable from what could look rather ordinarily plain on paper. Its minimal, workmanlike quality just grinds away and effectively balances out the thrills and drama to maximum impact with such perfect pacing. David Shire's forcedly, jive-riddled score gets the heart-beating. A fundamental, but squarely to-the-point and credibly raw crime caper that does what it sets out to achieve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Taking of Pelham One Two Three' is an old school thriller, and none the worse for that. Featuring no special effects, no beautiful people, no square-jawed heroism and no valedictory moralising, it pivots instead around a simple, brilliantly claustrophobic idea: a gang of mysterious criminals (using 'Reservoir Dogs'-style colour coded names) steal a subway train, and hold the prisoners hostage. The acting is hammy, but there's far more real tension here than, for example, in the recent films in the Bourne series, which are superbly slick but which bear no resemblance to real life. By contrast, this a story whose details you can believe; in some ways its primitive, but it works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real good movie that nevertheless could had been way better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one fast paced movie, that also is very pleasant to watch thanks to its light comical undertone and of course excellent actors that are present in this movie. Still its lacking on some fronts, which prevents this movie from being an absolute perfect classic, though it really could had became one, since the right ingredients for it were definitely there.The movie looks like a '70's movie, just mostly because it simply got made in the '70's and technically also got made like one but it yet just doesn't have that typical '70's feeling over it. The movie just doesn't has this typical gritty and realistic kind of atmosphere all over it. The movie also isn't filmed with an awful lot of experimental cinematic tricks, such as you would expect from an '70's movie. Only the editing is totally typical '70's like. The fact that this movie doesn't really feel like an '70's movie might be a disappointing aspect about the movie.Even though the story is well constructed and especially the ending is really great and suitable for the movie as a whole, the actual main plot-line is still lacking. I don't know, the whole hijack to me didn't really seemed like a great and perfect criminal plan. It also is a missed opportunity that you just never get to know one of the hostage, which makes the whole hostage situation kind of emotional shallow and uninvolved. This takes away lots of the tension and surprises in the movie. As a thriller this is just a totally lacking movie. The movie also doesn't feature any big action sequences or chases in it, to make the movie more exciting in parts. The movie features a surprising amount of humor in it. Of course not the hilarious forced kind of humor but more the sort of the same style that also got used in "Dog Day Afternoon", which by the way got released one year after this movie. Especially the dialog is really effective.I won't pretend as if I'm a Robert Shaw expert, since I actually have, as of yet, seen surprisingly few movies with him starring in it (only 4, with this one included) but it seems to me that for every role he learned a different accent, which shows what a great and committed actor he really was! In this movie he uses a very thick English accent. Also Walter Matthau was really well cast. Most of the supporting actors were still fairly unknown at their time and it includes Hector Elizondo and Jerry Stiller.It's a real great and highly enjoyable and recommendable 'in between' movie but just not really a must-see '70's classic in my opinion, even though it still deserves an high rating.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest crime thrillers ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 70s were a truly special time for cinema, action and crime cinema in particular. If this, "The French Connection", or "Dog Day Afternoon" were made after the advent of MTV and Jerry Bruckenheimer proceeded to destroy cinema, they'd be overloaded with flashy special effects, politically correct and free of moral dilemmas, and quickly paced editing to the point where the audience would get a headache. Fortunately, they weren't, and thats why I treasure the 70s crime thrillers over the ones made in any other decade. They aren't afraid to be brutal or politically incorrect, and are all the more compelling because of that. "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is a perfect example. Its direction is minimalist, gritty, and completely no nonsense. It doesn't have epic set pieces or even grandiose settings (for the most part, the whole film takes place on either a subway or a subway station). What it does offer, is plenty of white-knuckle suspense free of the b.s. manipulation that would be found in this kind of flick only ten years later.The film is extremely well made all around. It isn't particularly deep or anything, but its full of suspense, which is what it sets out to do. The acting is phenomenal, including the always watchable Walter Matthau and the simply chilling Robert Shaw. Shaw portrays one of the coldest and compelling villains ever in a film, a far cry from his breakthrough role a year later in "Jaws". Its a shame that he died just as he was hitting his stride, because audiences were really beginning to take notice of what a great actor he was. The direction by Joseph Sargent keeps everything moving at a lightning quick pace and completely unpredictable. The familiar and realistic locations add a degree of credibility to the story. Not once does this seem too far fetched. "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is one of the greatest crime thrillers ever made and a must-see! (9/10)</fullReview>

It was passable on my 27" TV in 16:9 mode but artifacts were still obvious. It has lots of jaggies, fuzzy areas and over-enhanced edges. The gray "shading" on the white opening credits is actually MPEG block artifacts. This was the 2000 MGM widescreen 908375 Region 1 release.

Matthau is great in this is the witty cop -- kind of like a precursor to Jerry Ohrbach's Lenny Briscoe on Law and Order.

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILER COMMENTS ******WARNING****** POSSIBLE SPOILER COMMENTSI saw this movie for the first time this week and enjoyed it immensely.I really liked the cynical, edgy wisecracks that went back and forth, as if the characters were having a harder time believing the plot than any audience members might. This film seems to be the inspiration for later action films that would employ the same formula of action and smart dialogue, "Die Hard" immediately comes to mind.The acting in this movie was top-notch and it was great fun seeing a lot of people that weren't yet names, such as James Broderick, Jerry Stiller and Doris Roberts. I especially enjoyed seeing a favorite actor of mine, Tony Roberts, as a fast-talking, wisecracking Deputy Mayor. (Although I'll admit that I like him only because I once had a deep crush on his breathtakingly gorgeous daughter.)Walter Matthau was at his dry, sarcastic best as Lt. Gerber. His scenes with the Japanese businessmen (I had to snicker at the guy with the large camera-the stereotypical Japanese shutterbug) are classic, especially his "this way, dummies" remark.Robert Shaw was also at his insane best as the leader of the terrorist group, as was Martin Balsam as the sneezing brakeman. One thing that I wondered was how such a disparate group of men could ever have hooked up in the first place. But no matter. One thing that disappointed me was the fate of three of them. After all they did, what happened to them seemed anti-climatic. Particularly Robert Shaw. I was hoping for more than him frying himself on the third rail.The end, when Matthau catches Balsam, is truly classic. The look on Matthau's face when he realizes he has his man is the best shot of the film and and a great closing shot. Gesundheit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other reviewers have said enough about this wonderful witty heist movie that surprised me every step of the way with how good it was. Two things bother me about this movie, however. First, why did they only ask for $1,000,000? I know that things were cheaper then--I was a productive member of society, sort of, at the time--but even so, $250,000 a pop seems like too little reward for all the time and risk they invested in their plan. Even one of the passengers held hostage thought it wasn't enough--why didn't that occur to the merc or the wise guy?Second, how did the makers of this movie know that Ed Koch was going to be mayor of New York? It was 1974 and Abe Beame--who would not have made an interesting character if you had put him in platform shoes and hot pants--was Mayor of New York, yet somehow the makers of this film got someone who looks and acts more like Koch than the Mayor in Ghostbusters.

Walter Matthau and Martin Balsam are superb, but Robert Shaw is the perfect casting choice in this gem. Whatever you do, don't watch it on channel 48 on a Sunday afternoon, it will be cut to shreds, get the video or DVD (if it is available). A true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I just mention a few of the great titles of the same brief period of sheer cinematic genius, you'll know what saddens me now: Network, Parallax View, Magic Christian, Godfather, Day of the Jackal, and so many more.Don't compare this to other thrillers (although it is one) or cop shows (although it resembles one). The vicious black comedy marks this in a league with "Network" more than "French Connection." Like when the "$20 hooker" complains that she charges more than that! Or when the booing starts and the sergeant says, "That must be the mayor!" And how 'bout those guaranteed 18 votes, eh?I am not being nostalgic for my youth; from 1969 to 1978, I never went to the movies, so I never saw these gems in their original runs. I can say that American movies have never been as intelligent, socially critical or meaningful as during that period between "Midnight Cowboy" and the apotheosis of dumbing-down, "Star Wars." "Taking of Pelham 1-2-3" is more proof that this was a brief Golden Age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was good enough for Tarantino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about watching Pelham in 2001 is seeing how many directors have managed to pay homage to it since 1974. Sure Tarantino lifted the color coding of the principles in "Reservoir Dogs" yet Joseph Sargent's expression of the crooks as an organized military unit has been a staple of solid crime films since. Perhaps building on the smooth style of Robert Vaughn from his days working on "Man from U.N.C.L.E.", Sargent has Robert Shaw (Mr. Blue) playing the police like a drum until Mr. Grey throws a wrench into the system. The classic struggle between the "intelligent" versus the "barbaric" villain has played itself out in countless films since. In classic 70's style, this straight forward film is fast moving and doesn't waste a scene. Each character is developed enough to fit their role in the story and not a bit more. Peter Stone's writing not only communicates the Godey novel, but clearly reflects the social attitudes of the time. It only took three scenes and 45 seconds of film to acknowledge the effect of women in the work place and the continuing struggle of minorities in 1974 America. Having not viewed the movie in twenty years, it further reminded me of just how great the 1970s was for film in America and how far we have fallen since. Can you imagine what Jerry Bruckheimer and crew would do with a remake of this one? Hopefully whom ever urged him to butcher "Gone in Sixty Seconds" didn't like classic noire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is a very good film. My only reservation is the language. Even compared to films made in recent years (with the possible exception of "Good Fellas" and "Snatch."), the language is very, very 'spicy'--with tons of G-D this and G-D that (ImBD will not allow me to actually write what they said). This may or may not be realistic for the characters....I dunno. But it certainly is NOT a film to watch with young kids, your mother or Father Jenkins!The film has a very simple plot--four guys hijack a subway train and threaten to kill all the passengers unless they are paid $1,000,000. The problem is that these are VERY smart and ruthless criminals--and they are more than willing to kill passengers and they seem to have thought out all the details very, very well.I appreciate how the mastermind (Robert Shaw) was portrayed and I like how he and his men weren't tripped up because of stupid mistakes. I also like how the man in charge of the case was portrayed--with Walter Matthau putting in a great performance as a man who is competent, smart and also a bit cynical and funny. And, in fact there were LOTS of wonderful performances by the ensemble cast. Well written (very intelligent, VERY tense and darkly funny) exciting and memorable--this is a great film to watch...without your kids!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham 123 is the type of movie that doesn't seem that common anymore. The film is not big and showy, it is simply a great 'caper' film that shows both the criminals and the cops in interesting ways. Walter Matthau is great as usual, but perhaps a touch comedic for the subject matter. His role as a head transit cop brings some levity to the story, without making a mockery of the serious situation. The story concerns a gang of armed men who take a subway car for ransom in New York city, and the police who try to deal with their demands and stop them from carrying out their crime. The cast also includes Robert Shaw(Jaws, From Russia with Love) as the cool but menacing Mr. Blue, leader of the gang; Martin Balsam, one of cinema's best character actors, as the gang member with inside knowledge of the subway; and Hector Elizondo as the unstable and psychotic Mr. Grey. The story is well thought out and very plausible, and the ending is fun, with a touch of irony. Rent it today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film. Pure and simple. It grabs you right from the start and holds on to you tight all through the film. I saw this on television in the 70's and thought it was amazing and then rented it about five years ago.This film is so finely acted by a cast of really great actors. Walter Matthau proves that he's a very versatile actor in this film. I've heard that he didn't like to be described as a comic, that he liked being referred to as an actor and for good reason. He can play anything. Look at this film, "Charade," "The Fortune Cookie," "Fail-Safe," and "The Laughing Policeman," the latter made a year before this film and a really bad and incredibly dull movie in my opinion.Other actors are great in this film. Robert Shaw is great. Tony Roberts has a great part. Jerry Stiller proves he's more than a comic actor. Martin Balsam, an actor whom I can't remember really getting his due, is great in this film. Hector Elizondo doesn't really get a lot to do.The film really captures the sense of a confined space with the subway. Directing a film in a tight space is probably pretty difficult. The music's great. The film's very well made and very well written - plus it's got one of the best endings of any film ever made.I totally recommend this film. I think you'll really enjoy it.</fullReview>

The TV remote stayed on the table, from the first scene to the spectacular last...this film was nothing short of superb.The New York humour was sensational, the characters were completely believable, especially the Underground staff. Walter Matthau was brilliant, the comedy was a compliment to the movie, especially as a serious situation was getting even more critical as the time ran-out.Robert Shaw was great as the criminal mastermind...now we know the United States fascination with english speaking criminal masterminds (Alan Rickman &amp; Jeremy Irons of Die Hard). Also the Mr Blue, Mr Grey for the hijackers...I bet Quentin Tarantino wishes he could acknowlege his debt to the writers of this film.The political machinations were brilliant, when the Mayor was told to get out of bed and support the victims of the hijack..."but they will boo me" as he languishes 20 points behind in the opinion polls. Classic.The final scene. There are many great endings to a film, most Clint Eastwood films get them down pat.War movies never usually go wrong with endings, but this one, this is just top shelf and its the face of Walter Matthau.I cant believe I have missed out all this time. My favourite crime movies in the 70's was films like, Dog Day Afternoon or The Godfather.Now I have to re-evaluate.Spreading the word!A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best thrillers of the 1970s, this gritty urban thriller concerns itself with four extremely dangerous men, led by an incredibly ruthless Robert Shaw, holding seventeen passengers and a conductor hostage on a New York subway train. They phone in their threat at 2:13 P.M., giving the city of New York exactly (and I do mean EXACTLY) one hour to deliver a million-dollar ransom or, starting at 3:13, they will begin executing one hostage for every minute the money is late. It is up to a hard-nosed transit cop (the late, great Walter Matthau) to work his way out of this problem while dealing with, among other things, a loud and foul-mouthed boss (Dick O'Neill).Shaw and Matthau are extremely well-matched adversaries, and there is plenty of hilarious humor and profanity on display here. Joseph Sargent, who directed the underrated 1970 sci-fi drama COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT, directs very efficiently once again; and David Shire's score is top-notch. Not to be missed, especially since it is a precursor to the DIE HARD movies and off-shoots like SPEED.</fullReview>

Also, the hijackers don't allow a lot of time for their demands to be met. This a 1974 movie that is still good today. Contains some foul language, so, if your VCR has the built-in Censor control, you might want to program certain words out.

		<fullReview>A ruthless gang of men dressed as old fellas takes over a single New York City subway, separates it from the rest of the train, and issues a demand to authorities: deliver one million dollars in one hour, or passengers will be killed every minute over the deadline!Walter Matthau plays the crafty transit cop on the case in this psychological crime drama pitting him against the manipulative and single-minded Robert Shaw, the leader of the baddies. This white-knuckle thriller features some of the crispest dialog you'll see in the movies. The characterizations are vivid and intelligent, and the audience is treated to some real crackerjack performances.You see, the best part of this movie isn't guessing whether the authorities are going to submit to Shaw's demands and give the gunmen their money, it's in wondering how he plans on getting away with the crime. You have four gunmen with automatic weapons on a single subway car in the middle of a tunnel. There are cops surrounding them everywhere, although none can quite get close enough to the car to commandeer it. How do they propose to do it?Like some movies that purport to develop in 'real time,' (like High Noon and Nick of Time), this movie seems to take place in precisely the hour or so that Matthau and company try to win the battle of wits with Shaw and company. But it never seems like it, as the rapid pacing of the script take care of any possible lulls. Matthau himself is brilliant, as he offers an award-worthy performance. Shaw matches him move-for-move as his evil counterpart. His character names the men in his gang after colors, much like Quentin Tarantino would later do in Reservoir Dogs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could this be the film that inspired endless numbers of productions that deal with hijackings? One example is the made-for-TV film DETOUR TO TERROR starring O.J. Simpson (remember this one?). PELHAM 1-2-3 might have been ahead of its time for packing up the heavy adrenalin. The hair-gripping suspense is the major element for this type of film, and it may last more than an hour to prepare for the unexpected to happen. Robert Shaw ("Quint" from JAWS) has done fine performances, and his part in leading the hijacking quartet is a sensible role. Little do we know that these "villains" are more stylish and handsome in description, rather than the tackiness. But hang on for the climactic section of the Pelham subway train; the fast-paced editing meant new creativity in 70s movies. I appreciated the comedy relief being added to this exciting film because the feeling turns more episodic for its increased value, and this special blend of formula works. It might actually mistaken the careless viewer for blaming on the corny dialogue spoken by many of the actors! Since PELHAM 1-2-3 continues to receive high praise after twenty-five years, a special collector's edition would be a strong possibility. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

Apart from the short cuts and convenient points that discredit quite a bit the script, the movie as a whole badly lacks suspense and tension ? which is inevitably disappointing considering the kind of story this is ? and this is mainly due to the direction and editing that both lack energy, too flat to be striking. The characters are also a bit disappointing, all being very linear and unidimensional, not deep nor distinguished enough one from another.Despite everything, the movie remains relatively enjoyable: the cast is rather good, the movie is quite dynamic, its outcome arouse a certain curiosity and you even surprise yourself laughing to the few well tought-out touches of humour.</fullReview>

Although a TV remake was made and it was okay, nothing stands up to the original.

		<fullReview>Though it may seem dated by its lack of special effects explosions and testosterone, what the 1974 thriller THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE-TWO-THREE has in abundance is more than sufficient to make it one of the most well-thought-out thrillers on record.The film involves the takeover of a New York City subway train by four very heavily armed men, led by a very ruthless Robert Shaw. Beyond their actions throwing the Big Apple's transit system into a frenzy, they are also holding seventeen passengers and the train's conductor as hostages. At 2:13 PM, the demands are made: $1 million is to be delivered to them in EXACTLY one hour, or they kill one hostage for every minute the money is late. And if any outsiders interfere in any way, the hostages get killed immediately, regardless! It is thus up to a very cagey NYC transit cop (the late, great Walter Matthau) to try and buy some time to not only get the money to the hijackers through the Big Apple gridlock, but to also get a bead on them. He winds up finding two of Shaw's associates (Hector Elizondo, Earl Hindman) already dead; and when he finds Shaw, the mastermind of the hijacking electrocutes himself! One man, however, has escaped detection--the motorman (Martin Balsam). And in order to wrap this caper up, both Matthau and an associate (Jerry Stiller) must find that elusive motorman and, if possible, the money.Full of snappy and rather salty dialogue, plenty of suspense, and black comedy, THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE-TWO-THREE offers up a solid contrast between Matthau and Shaw, which keeps the film moving through the slow spots, what few there are. Joseph Sargent, who directed the 1970 sci-fi drama COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT, really lays the tension on, buoyed by an excellent score by David Shire. This is an absolute must-see for those fans of action and suspense films who believe that you don't need testosterone and explosions to be on the edge of your seat. 10/10 Amazing.</fullReview>

Gratifyingly, we are given in this film the origin of Mr Pink, Mr White etc of Reservoir Dogs, perhaps suggesting a homage by Tarantino, which helps convey the kind of plot-driven genre we are in. As you watch, you sense that the film will allow nothing to interfere with a realistic portrayal: the noises of the underground are deafening, and if he says he's going to shoot, he will.</fullReview>

Laugh yourself silly at the racial epithets, so true-to-life, on mistaking the Japanese for "Chinamen", and calling them monkeys, and when Matthau meets Inspector daniels at the car, how he's at a loss for words because he had envisioned Daniels as a white guy!

		<shortDescription>A thriller with excellent actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pelham 123 is a thriller that benefits mainly from the actors. Walther Matthau as the cop is an extra-ordinary cast, and of course wonderful Robert Shaw is on more time an excellent bad guy.This movie has, although it is a thriller, a touch of humanity, mainly given by Matthau, and this is what separates it from other thrillers.Its atmosphere is dark and dangerous. One more thing more modern thrillers could learn from this one.Of course the biggest reason to watch this movie is Walther Matthau. In a serious role, he shows his abilities of acting. It's a pity this great actor was mainly casted as an comedy role. When you watch this movie, you'll know what he was able to play beside this!</fullReview>

Robert Shaw, Martin Balsam, Hector Elizondo &amp; Walter Matthau are at there finest. This movie is funny, violent and has every possible NYC stereotype know to man in it.Simply one my favorite movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun little hostage thriller featuring not too much blood and good performances.From the vantage point of 2003, when we've all seen dozens of hostage dramas on TV and at the movies, the actual procedural aspects of this movie sometimes seem a little clunky, i.e., it's a little hard to believe that Matthau is still basically running the whole show himself out of the Transit Authority's control room hours after the train has been taken hostage. There are a few other minor plot quibbles, and for some reason, we are never actually shown a key piece of machinery that enables the bad guys to make their escape, but overall, this is a fun, fast-moving thriller. Compared to some of the unbelieveable violations of the laws of physics (not to mention logic) in many modern thrillers, the nit-picks in this movie are pretty minor, and the typical, casually great performances by Matthau and Shaw more than make up for them. A good time if you're looking for a not-too-clever, not-too-stupid action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New York as a character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is, more than any other NYC-set crime film of the '70s, 100% New York. Of course it has to be, since it's about the hijacking of a subway car. It's a terrific film with good performances all around (I especially liked Walter Matthau's take on the weary transit cop who's seen it all--at least he though he'd seen it all). The film finds humor in the most unexpected places and the tension is built from the very first frame. But, once again calling on the New York setting, those hostages have to be the most annoying ones in the history of cinema. There were a few times I was actually rooting for the hijackers because of this! It was somewhat hard to buy Martin Balsam as one of the hijackers, but he's the only one that Robert Shaw's Mr. Blue seems to respect. And I'm not giving away anything by saying that the movie has unusual fates for all of the terrorists. A fantastic, underrated film that would be a perfect "10," had it not been for those unlikeable hostages!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I am sure there was a joke that has now been deleted from later prints that I have seen. Remember that Gruber has been talking to Lt. Daniels by radio up to the point that he meets him and gets into his car. It was here that Gruber comments and stutters something in the lines of "you sounded taller on the radio". What he meant was he was surprised that Daniels was black and in charge.As this film was made in 1974 the world has become more enlightened, but why was this line removed at all. I think that it is just a sign of political correctness gone mad!!!!!!Keep watching the screensSPS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is this film interesting? Not because it's a tough, no nonsense realistic thriller full of great and not overdone action with a completely predictable ending; that's beside the point. Even the most realistic thriller was quite predictable by the early '70s and most have not aged well. And it's to counteract that 'recognition' of something you've seen a hundred times before and sell people the same mediocre product again and again that all we get nowadays are movies with more and more special FX and less attention to holes in plots (which don't make much of a difference in the box-office bottom line anyway). But no special FX extravaganza can come near a film that has geniunly interesting and real characters. "Pelham 1,2,3" is interesting because of the characters, what an Oscar winner like "The French Connection" doesn't have enough of. It is interesting not only because of the fantastic performance of Robert Shaw (only matched by Rutger Hauer's in "NightHawks"), but the many authentic New York characters scattered throughout the movie: not so much Walter Mathau (who's great in his role) but more his hot-headed jerk of a partner or the other hothead who gets shot on the tracks or the police captain played by that Jimmy Cagney-meets-dough-boy Irish guy who later portrayed Barney in "The Pope of Greenwich Village." The city of New York (and the people in it) becomes the main character in the film and keeps it rocking into a more poetic zone. Also, if anyone out there is interested in 'Subway related' films, they should definitely check out "The Incident" starring Martin Sheen and Tony Musante, a great film that's so realistic it's hard to believe it was shot on a soundstage!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Seventies Crime Drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best examples of the 70s crime drama genre. The subway car setting is an excellent personification of NYC in that era. It's gritty, dirty, and dangerous. Matthau is the epitome of the haggard, weary official, another 70s staple for this type of film. Excellent incidental music with a super-70s flatfoot riff that really captures the mood. Perhaps the only flaw I saw in this film were the flat, stereotyped passengers on the subway car. The hippie, the hooker, etc. Matthau's look in the movie's final scene is priceless. This film is a must-see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why this film isn't remembered with other great '70s cop films, I don't know. It's a classic. Walter Mattheu is great as the subway cop who negotiates with Robert Shaw, who is holding a car on the Pelham 1,2,3 line hostage. Quick pacing and excellent casting make this film worth repeated viewings. You can see the Tarantino influence, but don't watch it because of that. Watch it for its clever dialog and excellent performances. It was actually remade as a crappy TV movie (with a woman thug, which defeats the whole purpose of the Mr. White, Mr. Green, etc...). I defy you watch this film and not find yourself humming the David Shire theme, one of the all time greatest cop film musical into/closing pieces. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good old fashion crime movie that rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the 1998 tv version of this movie and neither do I want to. I'm probably guessing but I suppose its got a typical 1990s gloss with added subplots and lots of sanitised political correctness.If I'm incorrect then it still doesn't excuse these feeble 90s excuses for "action" films (Speed, Money Train and a host of others), because they're all about as convincing as the Easter Bunny surfing Niagra Falls standing on one leg while singing "This is the Real thing!"It might humour a lot of younger people when they see how dated this film really is but at least New York (and action films back then - French Connection, Seven Ups) had a gritty, realism about it. People spoke as they wanting to speak (rightly or otherwise), they didn't have to take a breath before making a remark that might be deemed offensive in today's overly sanitised society. Watching Pelham is like watching a microcosm of New York life at street level: in computer terms, What You See is What You Get!It could have been so easy for director, Jo Sargent to cast "beautiful people" instead of the heavily thick-set actors of Matthau, Shaw &amp; Balsam. He could have added a romantic subplot with some pretty young thing being one of the hostages wishing her heroic boyfriend cop will jump over high-speed carriages or leap through windows to save her before the bomb goes off with a second to spare (yawn)!But no, instead Sargent plays it for real. The hostages are all typical New Yorkers, remote, insular and yet real people with ordinary human hearts &amp; mannerisms. The bad guys, too, don't have to try too hard to convince us they mean "we're professionals" and therefore "don't f**k with us".Robert Shaw &amp; Hector Elizondo in particular are not visually handsome actors some might say; yet they carry a natural air of menace that a lot of today's "stars" couldn't create without a lot of makeup, method acting &amp; voice training.I have to say I was somewhat surprised with Matthau's role: I'm not saying that it was above his considerable acting talent because it wasn't; just that we all know he is more familiar with the dry humour &amp; wiseguy comedy role movies with the likes of Jack Lemmon &amp; Billy Wilder.However, he is quite amazing here as the anti-hero transit cop who has to deal not only with the bad guys stealing the train, but also with the subway manager &amp; buddy, Correll, who is trying to keep the remaining train timetables running(excellently played by Dick O'neill). In fact Correll is more of a Lemmon trade-off since there is still plenty of wisecracking remarks being fired off between both men that lightens the tensions somewhat.The action builds at a tactically measured pace: there is no great hurry to move us or the story along too fast. The script is not overworked and the characters (especially the bad guys) are given enough time to develop into something substantial, so that we the audience can get an inkling into the minds of these calculating professionals.The ending (after the dramatic train-run) is a bit of a let down, and perhaps all too obvious and expected. For once, in a movie like this, you got the feeling that these bad guys are way ahead of the cops on a tactical level and would/should win, and yet they....well.....see for yourself.The real bonus though has to be the score by David Shire. Typical 70s anthems with Jazz, moody blues and a really heavy funk theme at the very beginning - talk about throbbing energy - imagine that playing on your car stereo with the bass on number 10 (or number 11 if you like Spinal Tap)!A superb crime film that has all the right ingredients and no CGIs, no overly done special effects, no silly macho men/new age men, no political axe to grind and no 90s superficiality.****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic depiction of 1970's New York.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To some, this film might appear somewhat dated today, but its action is nonetheless vibrant and realistic. Besides, if you aren't in favor of 1970s cinema, why read on? Walter Matthau is a surprisingly tough sleuth, playing a transit cop; Stiller is excellent as well as the laconic police chief, Elizondo and Shaw (both generally under-appreciated) play an edgy ex-mob killer and a former mercenary captain, respectively. Also look out for the excellent Nathan George as a patrolman and Julius Harris as Inspector Daniels. The late Matthau is excellent as usual, balancing wit with a tough, pragmatic and sometimes even effusive edge. The film even manages to make a little bit of fun of the time period's ethics- both a running joke made of Japanese trainmen and one about a police officer being female both are corrected in fine fashion.The Taking of Pelham One Two Three itself is steeped in classic New York flavor- the fashions, the speech, the train culture, the characters, the comebacks, the lampooning of the mayor (not so strange in the Lindsay years) and so on. Filmed in the classic period where so many films were made in NYC, this could be one of the best for seeing the city itself- in one scene, a police cruiser must speed uptown from the financial district; in another, excellent views of the FDR drive.Matched with an exciting score- the 12-tone funk jazz piece by David Shire- this is a classic piece of action cinema. I recommend it very highly for train fans, NYC enthusiasts, 70's film buffs or anyone looking for a great piece of suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3" is an exciting, suspense thriller involving the hijacking of a subway car one afternoon in New York City. The four assailants (headed by the brilliant Robert Shaw) ask for one million dollars in one hour or one hostage will be shot every minute they are late. Walter Matthau as a transit cop turns in one of his best performances as he spends the movie negotiating with Shaw to keep the hostages alive. The film is fast paced and thrilling in this race against time. And the final scene between Matthau and Martin Balsam, playing one of the assailants, is a beauty.Highly recommended to fans of action films or Walter Matthau.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take a simple hijacking plot, mix in some of the finest actors on screen and you get an underrated and exciting action movie that will absorb you to the end. The film is gritty and does not paint a pretty picture of New York, suggesting that everyone is corrupt, bad-tempered and couldn't give a damn about anyone. No one is happy and it is interesting to see that the hijacked portion of the train coincidentally contains a perfect cross section of society (an old man, a young man, a negro, a prostitute, a woman with kids, etc). This is just nitpicking, and the film does have some good characterisations. The film also contains some wonderful New York banter with liberal use of "Goddammit." Added to all this is a brilliantly funky jazz soundtrack that really captures the mood of the film. The casting of Robert Shaw as the leader of the violent hijacking gang perhaps started off a trend for US film makers to employ English actors as baddies. Watch it. And if you don't like what you see you can, as Mr. Blue would say, "blow it outta yer ass."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has been imitated, ripped-off and unsuccessfully remade, and every one of them only serves to further enhance what a wonderful movie this is. Peter Stone's screenplay is vastly superior to the original John Godey novel, adding better characterizations and a healthy dose of wit (the scenes involving the bedridden mayor and his aides is a hilarious indictment of New York City bureaucracy; also priceless is Walter Matthau's reaction when he realizes the Chief Inspector is black). This is one movie where the occasional excesses of profanity seem natural and understandable, and not gratuitous. But then again, this film has an air of pseudo-believability which none of it's imitators like "Speed" have ever possessed. There is no girlfriend or wife of the police lieutenant on the train to complicate things; there is no cliche ridden invented romance on the fly; there is no heroic stopping of the train through a death-defying feat by the lead. You just get the sense of how the real-life professionals would try to respond to a crisis like this.Robert Shaw, in his last role before "Jaws", shows what a wonderful actor he was as the ringleader of the hijackers. It is cold, methodical villainy at its finest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're going to make an action movie, why would you go and clutter it up with sentiment and other non-action mumbo-jumbo? It sometimes makes for a truly awkward and out-of-place break in the action (remember the animal cracker scene in *Armageddon*?). This is a movie that cuts out everything, but the action, suspense, and humor, and is all the better for it; probably one of the best in the genre.Shaw, Balsam, Elizondo, and Hinkman play men who hijack a New York subway train for $1 million, to be delivered in an hour, or the passengers start droppin. I must admit Walter Matthau is an odd choice as the TA cop who is on the case, but he is totally believable in the role. There isn't a really dull moment in this movie; it moves right along a pretty good clip. All the actors are good, especially Shaw as the cool and collected leader; for anyone who's only seen him in *Jaws* or *The Deep*, you'll be surprised to see that he doesn't play a ham sandwich in every movie. Well worth the price of admission, but be careful not to accidently get last year's TV movie version of it; it's got nothin on the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE is a very 1970s heist thriller which means it's dated watching it in 2010 . This is in no way a criticism and truth be told makes it more enjoyable in contemporary times where no one is allowed to upset anyone . Remember Sidney Lumet's heist thriller THE ANDERSON TAPES with its homophobic wisecracks ? PELHAM reinforces what would probably qualify as " hate crime " amongst humourless critics have probably never cracked a joke or a smile in their entire life . PELHAM is awash with New York City stereotypes and ethnic groups which leads to some witty and funny scenes such as Lt Graber referring to a Japanese guided tour party as " A bunch of Jap monkeys " only to have their leader thank him in English . All New Yorkers are loud self centered and the most common job amongst women is prostitution and all Jews are only interested in money:" Excuse me sir do you mind me asking how much you're getting ? " " A million dollars " Oi vey that's not so good " The dialogue by Peter Stone is so enjoyable that the main plot of the heist itself is secondary . It's also interesting to note that the villains give themselves code names involving colours , an idea that Taratino referenced blatantly in RESERVIOR DOGS All in all this is a very enjoyable thriller mainly down to the fact that in the 1970s no one who produced a movie thought along the lines of " Oh we'd better not say that in case we upset anyone " . In my view the only crime a film maker can do is fail to entertain the audience</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not A Dull Moment Anywhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The adventure begins in this movie right from the start. There's no unnecessary lead-ins, no confusing sub-plots that the viewer has to muddle through and keep straight, no particularly complicated characters that we struggle to understand. A group of men hijack a New York City subway train and threaten to kill the passengers unless the city pays them $1 million. It's simple and straightforward and fast-paced and exciting and features excellent performances, particularly from Walter Matthau, who takes control of the situation for the Transit Police as Lt. Garber and from Robert Shaw as "Mr. Blue," the leader of the hijackers.The almost two hours flies by with only a couple of minor weaknesses. There was obviously a feeling that audiences couldn't handle the amount of tension involved and so some unnecessary comedic elements were added. I'm thinking particularly of the portrayal of the lily-livered, indecisive Mayor of New York (played by Lee Wallace) and, although it was only one scene, the reaction of the drunk woman on the train to the hijacking after it was all over. Assuming that they were added to break the tension, neither succeeded - they didn't add much comedy and they were unnecessary add-ons to a very exciting movie. The very last scene of the movie also left me a bit empty. Frankly, I knew what was going to happen from the moment Garber and Lt. Patrone (Jerry Stiller) showed up at the apartment. True, it was only one scene - but it was the last scene, and - again - it seemed to be written with the intention of making the audience laugh, which seemed out of sync with the whole feel of the movie. Still - a great story and a great movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1970s malaise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New York has got a sore head. The mayor is a schmuck and trails 22 points in the polls. Transit cop, Walter Matthau, has the unenviable chore of escorting several 'directors' of the Tokyo subway on a tour of the subway control room who, it turns out, speak perfect English and have understood his every insult. New York is feeling sorry for itself. It's the mid-1970s, and New Yorkers are compulsorily (in films of the day, at least) yelling at and insulting each other... oh, and by the way, armed men have hijacked a train. The film's strong points are its location shooting, a situation in which the audience is kept guessing how the hijackers plan to get away, and a strong finish to the action. Its weak points are its gratuitous anger and incongruous attempts at humor. Robert Shaw is the most convincing performer in a mix of name actors and little-known or second-rate performers. Matthau, in a out-of-type role, cannot help hamming it up; but rather than providing the sort of comic relief that constructively interacts with the suspense, he undercuts it. Many of the bit players also seem unsure whether they are in a spoof or a genuine thriller. A strange film that could have been much more and has not traveled well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 is not one of my favorite sort of hijacker-type thrillers, but it is a professional type of film that gives its audience what it wants on a base level; stone-cold and (perhaps) crazy criminals taking over the wheels, literally; a group of frightened, but realistic, passengers held hostage; cop characters who are smart, and sometimes funny. One can see what must have appealed to Quentin Tarantino for Reservoir Dogs, which he kind of raped &amp; pillaged for his screenplay (not just with the color-coded character names, but also certain aspects of the criminal characteristics, and a little detail about a undercover cop). On its own legs, Taking of Pelham is also sort of a trend-setter; one can also see the influence on the original Die Hard, and other countless B-grade or less thrillers. But the circumstances in the story, the acting, and indeed some of the humanity, bring it up a notch.The story is hard-boiled, but is surrounded by realistic dialog for all involved. When there is humor, its unexpected, but worthwhile. We are given a group of consummate criminals, with Robert Shaw (Mr. Blue) as the steel-eyed, no non-sense leader of the four, who take a subway train with twenty or so passengers hostage. At first the subway company man goes nuts over it, until Lt. Garber (Walter Matthau, a surprise but interesting casting choice) overhears the situation. He becomes the negotiator, having to go between then and City Hall for the ransom money. For a while in the story, until the train starts to move again, not much goes on, but what does go on is meticulous, and therefore even more suspenseful.There are funny characterizations of those who in lessor crime films wouldn't have much to them, like the second-banana to Garber, played to me as a total surprise by Jerry Stiller (one may rewind to check again), plus a couple of notables in the Mayor's office like Tony Roberts. And there is of course Shaw, who gives the kind of performance that's a given if you've seen Jaws (though Jaws is his best). Martin Balsam is very good as the older one of the bunch. Hector Elizondo, with an excellent character-actor career nowadays, is perfect as the un-hinged Mr. Gray. But one thing that is very effective is the cast of those who are held hostage. The director Joseph Sargent knows how to get more interest than in just plain caricatures in them. These are real people, and the audience's interest in their survival is more prominent by the little details that are put in-between the phone tag with Garber, Blue, and the flu-stricken Mayor.There is a sort of expected outcome for what will happen to the villains of the story (and if you've seen Reservoir Dogs before this it might give some of it away), however the grittiness of the story becomes only firmer in the climax; the fates aren't etched in stone, like in the best of the heist pictures of the 40's and 50's. Basically, as a genre picture, you could do a lot worse, even if it isn't necessarily a great movie- it's un-pretentious, New York film-making of a truly 70's order.</fullReview>

Rent Jack Lemmon's "Out of Towners" and Steve Martin's version on the same evening and let's discuss. Something very different was sticking to the emulsion back then that just cannot be equaled. Whether it is pace, framing, soundtrack, script, acting, - who can say for sure? It just all adds up to a better movie. They have much more clarity and vision.

		<shortDescription>A fairy tale of New York?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent thriller. It has a simple, clearly defined plot and tension arises from the interaction of the characters and the tight time-scale insisted on by the hijackers (the hijack is run in almost real-time on screen - the remaining 40 minutes are prologue and epilogue).It may seem simplistic to have a 'cross-section' of New Yorkers in one car of one subway train, but this now seems like a social snap-shot of the New York of the 70's, dilapidated and crime- and strike-ridden. Is it my imagination or does the film's mayor bear a strange, vague resemblance to Ed Koch?I used to work as a tour guide of historic York, England. You could always bet there would be one Japanese tourist wanting a tour at 9 on a wet Sunday morning. People asked if I was ever tempted to talk a load of rubbish. I never was, and Walter Matthau's experience in this film is the reason!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolute gem of a movie. Could so easily have been just another so-so seventies crime thriller that came over like a hyped-up episode of Starsky and Hutch (like Bullit or The French Connection), but stands out on almost every level possible.Excellent story (adapted from a novel) about the hijacking of a subway train, is superbly cast, scripted and paced. Walter Matthau's puts in a superb performance as the subway controller - a lovely mix of hard-nosed, determined professional with a side-order of his usual laconic comedic style. Robert Shaw is convincing as the ruthless leader of the gang. The contrast between the maniacal action at street level as the ransom money is raised and transported, intercut with the dark, quiet, nerve-tingling suspense down in the subway car, is the main directorial coup.My favourite scene is where the flu-ridden mayor is told about what is going on and closes with the line "S**t, F**k, P**s!" - the only time I every recall hearing this line in a movie, but how often does it get used in real life?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Premise, but Doesn't Quite Deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie began strongly and sharply, with a quickly moving plot that grabs you from the start. The filmmakers waste no time in thrusting you into the middle of the action. However, by the time finally ended, I felt that all of this was really much ado about nothing. The ending was very anti-climatic, when it should have been the culmination of an hour and a half of suspense. Instead, we actually kind of have three separate threads that are tied up separately, and that kind of diffuses the bomb somewhat. Perhaps I expected too much though; I rented this film because Entertainment Weekly had said that it had one of the best ending plot twists out of all of the movies in the seventies. Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but I never found out what that plot twist was. There was no single, shocking moment when everything that I thought I knew about the movie turned upside down, as there was in movies like "The Usual Suspects" or "The Sixth Sense." As for the acting: the real gems in this movie are in the supporting players, especially the hostages on the train and the various cops involved. They exhibit strong New York personalities which are fascinating to watch. Walter Matthau also does a fine job, but... Walter Matthau as the hero in an action film?! Maybe I've seen "The Odd Couple" and "Grumpy Old Men" one too many times, but to me he seems to be the last person to star in an action film. I would have given the part to Clint Eastwood. Plus the sight of George Costanza's father (from "Seinfeld") as a tough-talking, Italian cop threw me for a loop. In any event, if you see this movie, you won't be any worse for the wear, and if you don't see it, well, you haven't missed much. I give it a 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard about this film from the Channel 5 countdown of Greatest Disaster Movies (it isn't a disaster movie!), and it looked quite interesting, so I gave it a go. Basically four men, leader Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw), Mr. Green (Psycho's Martin Balsam), Mr. Grey (Hector Elizondo) and Mr. Brown (Earl Hindman) hijack a New York subway train. On the radio they give demands to transport cop Lt. Zachary 'Z' Garber (Walter Matthau), they want $1,000,000 from the Mayor (Batman's Lee Wallace, he is the Mayor in that too), and they have only one hour to deliver it. If they are a minute late, they start killing one hostage (they've got 18) every minute they are overdue. They agree to pay the ransom, and they manage to get off with the train running, and in the end, Mr. Blue electrocutes himself on the train tracks, Mr. Grey and Mr. Brown are gunned down, and the only one that gets away, Mr. Green, is caught by Garber (who managed to gather information about criminals that can drive trains, running it down to nine names, and Green's one of them) when he recognises his sneeze, after saying "gesundheit". Also starring James Broderick as Denny Doyle, Dick O'Neill as Frank Correll, Tom Pedi as Caz Dolowicz, Beatrice Winde as Mrs. Jenkins, Jerry Stiller as Lt. Rico Patrone and Live and Let Die's Julius Harris as Inspector Daniels. It is like an early version of Speed, the anonymous colour code names were obviously borrowed for Reservoir Dogs, and it a well paced, well edited, well acted thrill ride. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Crime Film with Great Dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking of Pelham One Two Three, The (1974)*** 1/2 (out of 4) Four armed men (Robert Shaw, Martin Balsam, Hector Elizondo, Earl Hindman) hijack a subway car in New York City and demand one-million dollars or they will start shooting the hostages. Lt. Garber (Walter Matthau) is working the station when the hijacking starts and it's up to him to figure out their plans, which seems like they haven't a chance of escaping from their situation. The idea of four people actually hijacking a subway is certain far-fetched and a rather stupid idea but the screenplay is smart enough to have several characters in the film say the same thing. What makes this film so special are the performances by the cast as well as some of the best dialogue to come out of any movie in the 70s. Once the laws of "pure" movies were taken off filmmakers we got all sorts of new things. The 70s allowed nudity, sex, gore and violence but the one thing that often gets overlooked is the way profanity was used. I don't think there's a greater example of the power of profanity than this film here. It might sound stupid to highlight cuss words but they really do bring so many of these characters to life. The rawness of the four letter words really puts you right in the middle of the situation and I think it brings a certain reality to the events. The dialogue is often very tight and makes one feel as if they're listening to real people talk but even better is some of the dry humor thrown in. There some terrific bits about the Mayor wondering if they should pay the ransom or not and the debate scene is certainly one of many highlights. The drama in the film is quite high from start to finish as director Sargent knows how to stage a scene and build up the tension even when nothing is happening. The majority of the film takes place on a stopped train or inside an office but these scenes are so perfectly edited together that you get a real sense of danger. The performances are certainly a major plus with Matthau doing a very good job with his role. I'm sure most people will always remember the actor as a comedian and he was so masterful at it that it's easy to forget that he was also terrific at drama. I thought he was very convincing in the part and the way he could deliver the lines to the hostage takers made for some real excitement. Shaw, the leader of the group, is also superb in that certain, laid back way that only he could get away with. Balsam is also a major plus to the film as are supporting players like Jerry Stiller, Tony Roberts and Elizondo. At 104-minutes the film packs the right amount of drama mixed in with the action and comedy. There were quite a few heist films to come from these decade but it's easy to call this here one of the best.</fullReview>

I said to myself "I'm going to have to buy that movie, one day". Well, when I recently found that it was available on DVD, I purchased it.

The profanity really added nothing to the movie. Some of the characters, to me, were overly dramatic with their toilet mouths.

		<fullReview>Maybe I was wrong to view this 1974 version not before, but after seeing the Tony Scott version of 2009. Comparisons are often odious, but I don't think it's as good as his, even though he says so himself, in his own commentary. This one, directed by Joseph Sargent, doesn't seem to know if it's a genuine, gritty thriller or a semi-jokey, wacky but slightly flimsy comedy. Scott is right: these are two quite different films. This one has Shaw, as an Irish (according to Scott) mercenary, named Bernard Ryan, taking the train, and holding the passengers to ransom. He doesn't sound Irish but it's an Irish name. He doesn't seem to be as highly motivated as he ought to be, and not as ruthless as he pretends. He doesn't follow through on his threats with proper conviction, because he gives his targets an extra ten minutes, and he only kills the conductor. In fact, what is his underlying psychological motivation? The story contains a lot of wisecracks, the Mayor is a total dipstick, and it all builds up to a final sneeze. Big laugh. Earlier laughs come at the expense of a bunch of what Matthau calls monkeys, goofily thinking they can't speak English. They are actually Japanese subway executives, although one of the NY subway staff calls them Chinese. There is a wide roster of stereotypes making up the hostages. In fact, there's a kind of sub-current throughout of social minorities being slightly mocked and ridiculed: female staff, homosexual passengers, hooker passengers, bag-lady passengers, Jewish passengers, undercover cops (are they male or female?), black chief of police, who really gives Matthau a double-take. However, Matthau handles it all very well, being alternately tough, smart, cool, weary and witty. It's entertaining, but never remotely believable. In the style of The Sting, or Butch and Sundance. With all those wisecracks, you never feel the hostages are in any serious danger. The Scott version felt dead real, and it seems he thought so too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top New York Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the film was made, I was riding the subways to work on a daily basis. This was just before they hit their all time low (late seventies) when the crime, graffiti, homeless population and broken down equipment made the commute a daily challenge. I would have really enjoyed a "Making of" documentary of this because it was obviously filmed in the subway system and not in one of the unused "ghost" stations. Between the lone car careening though the South Ferry local line, and the cops racing uptown with the bag of money, The production must have been interesting, to say the least. Walter Matthau was great, as usual. The opening tour that he gives the Japanese VIP's is one of his best moments. The casting is right on with one small exception. The actor playing the part of the "Station Master" Caz Dolowicz is overheard saying "Ba fa Napoli" under his breath. I don't think that Dolowicz would have been using that particular phrase. Other then that, it was perfect.This film ranks as one of the top five gritty "New York" movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than average detective/thriller about a subway car that is hijacked by 4 men, for a million dollar ransom. Two things strike me about this movie. The first is its time capsule value in capturing a typical day in the city during the 1970s. Note how incredibly antiquated much of the equipment was, specifically the telecommunications gear which probably hadn't changed for 40 years. Also interesting is the latitude in offensive remarks towards women and minorities that has since been criminalized. The second was the handling of terrorism, which really at that time was a new concept and out of the playbook for the authorities. Remember that in those days, we basically gave the terrorists what they wanted so that they would release their hostages, and then hoped to apprehend them in their escape. Yes the film is therefore dated, but in this case, it's a positive. I don't often feel this way towards films from this era. The cast is fantastic. Robert Shaw is a somewhat forgotten figure in film, even though he appears in some of the biggest movies of the time. Here as always, he is a pleasure to watch. Matthau sort of lead foots the New York accent, but he also gives a first rate performance. The final freeze shot of his unforgettable mug is classic. Good stuff!</fullReview>

I remember this film along with the 7 ups, and Race with the Devil as a few on my mom's nasty list. I thought they were great, but as I watch them now, they seem so dated and do not age well! The Japanese and female comments would never be allowed now, but what really got me was how they did it so over the top with the bad behavior of everyone. I work at the post office, and even there with its new lows every year, no one screams and shouts like that. This made it cornballish, and how could they escape so easily, and the idiot who tries to get on the train, and the other idiot screaming during hostage negotiations is just plain stupid. The great part of the film is the performance by Robert Shaw, and Walter Matthau were exceptional considering the script they had to work with. This film is no God Father, or The Sting, so I gave it a five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin with, Im not impressed by heist films. I do, however, appreciate the humour of this film, with a lead like Walter Matthau and a supporting cast that includes Jerry Stiller... In this regard, the film doesn't take itself too seriously, and I appreciate that. Unfortunately, the film succumbs to a discouraging quantity of racism. One of the black hostages is frequently referred to by the n-word. The Lieutenant (Walter Mattau) leads a tour for a group of visiting Tokyo Metro directors and, after establishing that there English not so good, insults them, calling them "dummies" and "monkeys". One may argue that this was a commentary on the racial climate of New York in the seventies, but this is not a film about racism - the racism is never directly addressed or corrected; it is presented without judgement, as though there were no foreseeable problem with its use. If you like heist films, you might like this. But don't overlook the racism; its not okay.</fullReview>

They want 1 million $ within 60 minutes but cinematographically this movie is really flat. The only thing that will bring you to see it entirely is not knowing how it will end (Matthau in all his splendor).The DVD by the way is rather awful. The colors are not clean and clear.

When I first saw this in the theater almost 35 years ago, I liked it a lot. However, now that the blasphemy part bothers me, this film is a disaster, like the subway-car situation in the story. I don't know if I have heard this much verbal abuse in a 100-minute film as this one, although I can think of a few others that are close. It's too extreme and ruined the movie for me, and it's typical of films made around this time in the mid 1970s. These thrillers had a good "edge" to them but had such a sleazy atmosphere, I can't enjoy them anymore. Also, despite the premise and the trailers, this movie does not have the amount of action you expect you're going to see. Thus, people aren't offended by the language still may be disappointed that this isn't as fast-moving a story as they anticipated.</fullReview>
