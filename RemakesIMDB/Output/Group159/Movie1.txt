		<fullReview>As the roving range detective, battling rustlers with a ghost town hideout, Buck Jones is ideally cast in the first of his four serials for Universal. Madge Bellamy is the feisty heroine and former silent serial stars, William Desmond and Walter Miller, provide excellent support as the crusty rancher and his sneaky foreman. Just about every chapter has Buck and Silver being chased by the bad guys or chasing after them and the plot is enlivened by the ghost town being inhabited by a mystery man. The best line in the movie must be when Buck is trussing up a rustler and says, "I'd rock you to sleep if I could find a rock!" If you like Buck Jones or Western serials, both are combined here to good effect.</fullReview>
