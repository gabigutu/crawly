		<shortDescription>under-estimated sci fi western,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After leaving the James Bond franchise in 1971, Sean Connery gave a number of notable performances in films such as The Offense and The Man Who Would Be King but Outland is really the film that started him on the comeback trail that culminated with his Oscar acceptance speech 6 yrs later for The Untouchables. No one seems to recall this but at the time of Outland's release, no one had seen or heard from Connery for a few years and most of the reviews, while not kind to the film for a variety of reasons--chief among them being the fact that most movie critics (at least back then) harbored serious prejudice against sci fi--the main comment was "It is good to see Sean Connery back in action again".This film has one of the best production designs ever.Phillip Harrison did a superb job. Obviously the look was copped from Alien--blue collar workers in space--but it works remarkably well. I was often reminded of OUTLAND during my seven year prison term; the housing was remarkably similar--as was the company. But I digress...Nothing special about the plot-- it's routine cop show or western movie stuff--but who cares? Sean Connery gives a splendid performance and the whole film moves at a nice clip. Very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it's high noon in space. And what's wrong with that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Connery. A man's man, a woman's sex symbol. Good start! Now let's put him on a remote moon of Jupiter. So how many other films have Io as their center of action? Absolutely excellent in combining the effects that were available at the time with a darn good plot. Well overshadowed by the likes of Alien, this is late 70's/ early 80's sci-fi at it's best. No more is the future in space a Utopia, it is a grimy, nasty everyday world where people carry on their sordid business as they ever did. Except there is always a hero; a flawed hero, as is Connery. A personal crusade, a battle almost against the odds (but not unbelievably so, at all) and the true hallmark of a good sci-fi story: That is, the story would work just as well anywhere, any place, any time, as it does in space in the future. What more do you want (Just check out the shuttle landing)? Essential viewing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic space mining movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is amazingly realistic in regard to the technology used and in regard to the human characters.I totally agree with OP Voutilainen, who wrote a very good comment on this movie on 24 October 2001.The movie is never superficial if you look at its characters: The bad are not simply bad but realistically brutal. The good are not simply heroic, they rather strive to survive and struggle to keep what's left of their personal dignity and values after the school of life.People of the future will possibly wonder why anyone ever liked such a "normal life"-movie. The answer is: Simply because of the everyday life dignity that people emanate in the movie.Really a great positive movie !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie! Outland is without a doubt one of the best sci-fi movies ever made.Or perhaps sci-fi is the wrong term for this one, because where's the fiction? Everything is so realistic.No monsters,no gizmos-just space and man. Mood is just right,nothing looks too good.Mining community is dirty and dangerous,people are deceitful. Models and sets haven't really aged at all.They were once accurately made,and beat computer effects 6-0.Connery acts well and Peter Boyle's role as a twisted manager fits him. All in this movie could well occur in the future,and this is the fact which makes it so enjoyable.I'll give 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well crafted and entertaining film with a good Sean Connery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the near-future, in a space mine set on the Jupiter satellite Io, the new Marshall O'Niel (Sean Connery) discovered a mortal drug trafic. This amphetamine-like drug drives the addicted miners mad and makes them committed suicide. O'Niel encovers the conspiracy, involving the director of the mine, but becomes the target of hitmen, with almost no body helping him. The film is a Science Fiction remake of "High Noon"("le train sifflera trois fois" in French). The train is here replaced by a shuttle from a space station and the Far West by the set on a deep space mining outpost (Not Deep Space Nine).This a well paced film with a solid acting from Sean Connery. The pursuits, especialy the first in the corridors of the space habitat, are gripping. The film was made in 1981, when the CGI effects were not as prevalent as today. For exemple scenes where humans are dwarfed by huge metalic structures, were executed thanks to a then traditional play of mirrors. I have seen this film at the cinema when it played for the first time in 1981. I have recently watched it again on cable TV and I think it has not aged much. Because it is set on a makeshift sleazy outpost and not a shiny white place as too often in science fiction film, it remains realistic enough, twenty two years later. The themes,a bit overlooked, dangerous mind drugs, greedy multinational (or multi-planet, here) companies, the will and courage of one man against the cowardice of all the others, resonate still in our mind, nowadays. But make no mistake, it not a heavy political film but a good suspense and action film with a science fiction flavour.Despite some scientific oddities like heads exploding and weightlessness in a zero pressure atmosphere, where as inside the habitat the gravity is normal (by Earth standards), the script remains coherent enough. The strong performance of Sean Connery is helped by those of a serious Peter Boyle and a pre-ER Frances Sternhagen. Rent this film on your local video store or watch it on TV, it is worth seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not Exactly High Noon In Space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both in the Citadel Film Series book The Films of Sean Connery and a quick survey of the user comments here, everyone seems to be conceding that Outland is simply High Noon transferred to outer space. It's not really, but there are certain plot similarities. Of course there were enough similarities that Fred Zinneman stated that Peter Hyams had ripped off his western classic.For one thing Gary Cooper is a newlywed in High Noon, Sean Connery is a married man with a 12 year old son. His wife however wants him to give up the futuristic law enforcement business, but it's what he knows and because he's such an independent minded fellow who speaks his mind he gets one garbage assignment after another.Here he's on a mining colony on the Jupiter satellite Io. It's a frontier town, not unlike some in the west. But Hadleyburg in High Noon is passed the wild and woolly frontier days and the impending gunfight is not wanted because it will bring those days back. Gary Cooper dealt with ingratitude, what Connery is dealing with on Io is systemic corruption.The boss of the place is Peter Boyle the head of mining operations. One of the things he provides are illegal synthetic narcotics which make the men work like mules and increase his productivity. They also eventually fry your brain and you turn paranoid. Connery notices several suspicious deaths have occurred in the past two years after he's had to deal with some miners who've gone haywire. The presence of narcotics is confirmed by station doctor Frances Sternhagen during an autopsy. When Boyle's confronted with this, bribery doesn't work so he puts out a contract on Connery. His deputies are all on the pad and the miners won't help either. His one friend in the place is Sternhagen.In fact acting honors in Outland go to Frances Sternhagen as the tough old bird of a doctor who's also in a kind of exile on Io. Outland has good special effects and the mining colony on Io is marvelously created with the use of miniatures, much like the Himalayas were in Black Narcissus. But it is better known for a good story and some fine acting by all, especially Sternhagen. It's one of Sean Connery's better films and shouldn't be missed by science fiction fans or Sean Connery's many fans.So what if it took a few bites out of High Noon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this movie not expecting much as i had never really heard much about it and it didn't seem to be particularly acclaimed, but I was pleasantly surprised by it, Connery's performance is solid and the rest of the cast do a good job, there are some exciting scenes in this movie and the settings (outer space,mining colony) are convincing enough to keep you emersed in the story, the story is like a western in space, (which is about all I heard of this before I saw it),though its not particularly original and doesn't try to be spectacular, it is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours and good fun for Connery fans to see him kicking arse back in the days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a look...a different take on sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember wanting to see this when it came out in '81, on the heels of sci-fi classics such as 'Star Wars', 'Alien', and 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Of course because of its 'R' rating I could never see it until it came out on video. I found it offered a different take on sci-fi films as it had no involvement with sinister aliens, and the only alien world explored is the Jupiter moon.***WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!***'Outland' is set on Io, one of Jupiter's moons, in a mining colony. Marshal W.T. O'Niel (Connery) is assigned to the moon colony. Shortly after he arrives he discovers that several miners have been committing suicide in bizarre and ugly ways, such as walking into zero-atmosphere minus a pressure suit. When he investigates he finds that the dead men have been taking an amphetamine-like drug. According to Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen) the drug enables the miners to go for days without sleep and work at extended intervals, thereby increasing the mine's productivity. When O'Niel follows the dealers' trail he discovers that it leads to the head of the mining operation. These men have no intention of letting O'Niel stop their dirty work, and now the marshal has to watch his back at every turn, as a hit contract is put out on his head. O'Niel also finds that his own men are willing to turn on him...***END SPOILER ALERT***Like someone else mentioned, the production design does not show space as a shiny, clean environment - space is 'dirty' here. The mining colony looks like a real operation, in a similar way to the way the Nostromo appeared in 'Alien'. Jerry Goldsmith's music also sounds much like the low, sinister tones of 'Alien' which he had written only 2 years before. While it lacks most of the spectacular effects of the 'Star Wars' trilogy it gives a believable sense of the awesome size of space. The story is not unlike a western set in outer space, only that the crime the marshal is trying to stop is drug-dealing as opposed to train or stagecoach robbery. Not a bad movie, not on the scale of 'Star Wars' or 'Alien' but definitely worth looking into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An impression of the films style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outland is brilliant. So many good moments in the movie -the first time you see someones head explode from change of pressure, the bloodied elevator as it returns from the bottom of the mining shaft and the overall excellent visionary style of the mining colony. Connery is perfectly cast as the marshall who cannot be bought and Frances Sternhagen brings much needed warm relief from the terror with her smart, down-to-earth manner. Hyams directs the film with excellent vigour and his choice of filters and lighting, (especially the scene in the prostitues room which is blood red from the emergency lighting), gives an instant impression of heat, fear and so cool relief from the space shots. It could quite easily be overlooked as just another sci-fi flick but I think it established much more the benefits of bringing earth-realism to outer-space than any other film in it's day.(Probably best to watch it, as I did, when you are 10 years old!!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an entertaining movie this is. The plot is believable; the acting, from the minor characters right up to and including the leads, is excellent; the dialogue is natural and realistic (and intelligible); and the special effects have aged well and are quite good, as good as today's CGI stuff. But unlike today's sf movies, it's not the f/x that play the central role here but rather plot, character, and acting.I can understand some of the comments about some of the movie's science, particularly in the way earth gravity suddenly appears inside buildings and the way people's cranial cavities literally expand like balloons when exposed to near zero pressure, but none of that is central. I'm pleased when I see real science in movies (maybe surprised would be a better term), but if I want science I can read a textbook. Anyway, this shortfall is more than made up for by having a doctor in the movie named Lazarus - over scientific accuracy I'll take a little humor. Or good dialogue, such as when O'Neil, having just chased a perp through half the installation, finally corners him in a kitchen, gets the drop on him, and leveling his shotgun at his desperate kitchen knife-wielding opponent says to him, 'Think it over'.Comparisons have been made to other movies like High Noon and sf classics like Alien and 2001. I'll leave 2001 go at least until I can figure out how that giant fetus got out there in outer space, but as to Alien, well, in my view Outland compares quite well despite Alien's iconic status. Alien conveys all the niceness of a vat of sulfuric acid. What a bunch of dismal characters inhabited that movie. Outland has a different feel to it and portrays more than a few positive human characteristics (the interaction between O'Neil and his wife is quite affecting although, or maybe because, it takes place via a video screen). And as to this being a 'remake' of High Noon set in outer space, well, it really isn't. In fact there's only one aspect of the plot that is similar (the first half of Outland is a whodunit), though the device of periodically showing a clock to countdown when the bad guys will arrive is of course an obvious imitation. Someone else said that this movie is actually a 'western', and that's true if you mean a movie with a real hero who stands virtually alone despite the odds on the side of right vs. wrong (though he does get a little help especially from one particular rather brave woman). Basically though, this is just a very good movie that makes good use of and occasionally even exceeds the limits of its genre. It's got plenty of action and suspense and not a single dead spot. It's worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Hyams' Best Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, let's get the science out of the way. Yes, Jupiter's magnetosphere would have roasted anyone on Io in 5 minutes. Also, the non stop volcanic eruptions would have made mining there impossible. This is a very entertaining, tense, non stop, well made film. Connery's O'Niel is a good piece of acting, very controlled and intimidating. I am not going into the High Noon comparisons that plagued this film in 1981. It has several pop out scares that caused eruptions of popcorn in my theater. When you have two great old pros like Peter Boyle and Sean Connery together with passable effects, a great script and a good supporting cast, you have one great movie. It features the best foot chase in a movie until Casino Royale in 2006, and that was 25 years later. Action movies depend upon their villains and you will love hating the corporate swine Sheppard played very well by Boyle. Frances Sternhagen's Dr. Lazarus provides the only humor in an otherwise very tense, bleak, violent thriller. She and Connery's scenes are among the best in the movie. Hyams made some bad movies: End of Days and 2010 but this was easily his best work. The scripts anti corporate take was derivative of ALIEN but so what? It is tense, suspenseful and well acted. It has great action sequences inside and outside in space. One of the few films to show an audience what happens to a human body exposed to space's zero pressure. People who are fans of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY should watch this to see how terrible that scene of tape boy in space really is. The film has two stars taken away for O Niel's wife and son who are just dreadful actors. Hyams seemed to sense this; he has them leave on the shuttle but, unfortunately, we have to endure some of the worst acting on their taped messages to him. It brings the movie to a screeching halt; I know it is supposed to provide emotional depth but their performances are just abysmal. Also, 34 years later, I can still not make out the blue laser light bar couples simulating sex very odd and unnecessary. Lots of people under 40 may have missed this film, it did not do that well at the box office mainly due to the gore which today is quite tame.If you like Sean Connery, you are in for a real treat. Sternhagen, the only reason to watch Doc Hollywood, steals the film as the world's grumpiest doctor. It is very intense action packed and scary. It has some truly jolting pop out scares that will send your snacks flying across the room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost a great movie...it settles for being an entertaining near-miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer-director Peter Hyams has always shown a love not just for science-fiction stories but an understanding of what makes science-fiction fun. He's not interested in exasperating details or mechanical jargon, he just wants to have a good time. This is both pro and con for his "Outland", a fairly gripping movie set in the 21st Century which has enjoyable ingredients but is too routine overall. Sean Connery plays a cop investigating a mysterious rash of suicides among mining workers on one of Jupiter's moons; Frances Sternhagen is terrific as a cynical doctor who aides in his research. Film begins very well, but Hyams gets bogged down in plot-externals and good guys-vs.-bad guys shtick. Not a bad thriller. It just isn't very special, and that's a shame because Connery is solid (as usual) and the production is highly adept. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superbly gritty and exciting science fiction action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something sinister afoot on Jupitor's third moon of Io. The workers of a bleak mining colony are becoming crazy and killing themselves because they are being fed an amphetamine which not only increases their productivity, but also causes them to become psychotic. It's up to stalwart, morally sound and responsible Marshal William T. O'Niel (a characteristically strong and personable performance by the always dependable Sean Connery) to lay down the law and put a stop to things before they get any worse.Writer/director Peter Hyams creates a plausibly grim'n'grimy future where greed and profit take precedent over morality and human lives, expertly generates plenty of tension from the absorbing premise, maintains a steady quick pace throughout, and deftly stages one cracking corker of a rousing last third with two assassins arriving at Io with the specific intent of killing O'Niel. Connery effortlessly carries the picture with his considerable charismatic presence, receiving terrific support from Frances Sternhagen as a cranky, sarcastic doctor, Kila Markham as his fed-up, long-suffering wife, Peter Boyle as the blithely corrupt general manager, James B. Sikking as a cynical, wisecracking on the take deputy, and Steven Berkoff as a crazed miner who flips out. Jerry Goldsmith's beautifully moody and stirring score, the first-rate special effects (the miniatures in particular are amazing), Stephen Goldblatt's rough, grainy cinematography, and the grungy set design are all likewise uniformly fantastic. Moreover, the film earns bonus accolades for neatly avoiding certain tiresome clichés. For example, the villains never threaten to either kidnap or murder Connery's wife and son. In addition, Sternhagen comes to Connery's aid instead of the other way around. Intelligent, engrossing and above all exciting, "Outland" sizes up as one of the best and most shamefully underrated adult science fiction movies made in the early 80's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often this is regarded as HIGH NOON in space, and to a point it is very western flavored not to mention has elements one might could possibly claim as lifted from that classic Zinnemann film. First, Connery as the marshal of this mining outpost is the only one with enough integrity to stand up against corruption in the name of general manager Peter Boyle on Io, a moon with precious resources near Jupiter. As Cooper was in HIGH NOON, Connery will seek help and find none. The only one willing to stick their neck out is a woman. Sternhagen is the woman here as Kelly was in HIGH NOON for Cooper. Sternhagen(a wonderfully underrated actress;has the best lines in the film and is a joy to watch..the perfect Howard Hawks' archetype)portrays a doctor who tends to everyone who gets hurt and knows how the entire outpost functions. She is there for Connery when no one else will stand up. Connery discovers that Boyle, through two drug suppliers, has been selling amphetamines to labor workers so that they can pull extra hours in order to break productivity records and make big dollars. Boyle is quite a shady character;his reputation is so notorious no one on the outpost dares cross him. Those who offer help are executed..such as one officer under Connery who was taking pay from Boyle to look the other way, but gained guilt and turned to the right side. This was a warning to Connery just how dangerous Boyle could be. When an attempt to kill Connery fails, the marshal discovers where the drugs are hidden and dumps them. Boyle, furious at the money he lost because of this, sends for bounty hunters to execute Connery. The final twenty or so harrowing minutes shows Connery having to find various ways to escape certain harm as the killers arrive and seek him out. The cat and mouse ensues but Connery will have assistance in Sternhagen. This film doesn't show off fancy effects but instead makes this outpost ugly, grimy, and very junk-metallic. I felt the film desires to show you a blue-collar future where workers look like people who actually operate oil-rigs and work in factories. The film utilizes Connery's abilities especially as he waits out the arrival of those killers, his dogged determination to take down corruption, his inner loneliness and longing to be back with his family, and especially his weariness of doing his job the right way with no one appreciating his efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Down to earth cosmic crime fiasco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atmosperic and classy with the great screen presence of Sean Connery this movie suffers from one severe flaw: an utterly uninspiring script.O'Niel (Sean Connery) is the new sheriff in a outland space mining colony renowned for its high efficiency and great production return. He is a new entity in this demoralised place, where money, sex and power rule over common decency. After all the workers need to let loose and go crazy once in a while, since all the hard work they do millions of kilometres from home. Life isn't easy here in space and even O'Niel's wife decides she can no longer continue living so far away from home and leaves with their son to return to Earth (a place which their boy has only read about in books).Depressed from the turn of events O'Niel only strengthens his resolve to do what is right and keep some semblance of justice on the colony. Hence when it occurs to the sheriff that this outer space town suffers from inexplicably high suicide levels he decides to resolve the mystery and will resort to any means necessary to solve this case.Gloomy, gritty and surprisingly realistic (i.e. heads blowing up after decompression) starts off very promisingly acting out as a mystery crime story in outer space with some admirable noire qualities. All this quickly comes to pass, as the mystery is solved within the first 30 minutes of the movie and from then on we receive a hack-job script which some illogical action sequences (not much logic to them actually taking place), poor character motivations and stereotypical plot solutions. In the end you just really feel wanting for much more, as the movie never supplies what it promises.Essentially this could have been a classic sci-fi story, but the writers just got it all wrong. But the credits of the movie you really have no idea whether it has or has not ended. It never acts out to anything resembling ending and you finish the story asking yourself "So what exactly did this mean for the colony and what was the point of O'Niel staying to participate in a blood-bath?" The movie ages nicely and special effects are quite impressive. But with a story like this it won't ever become a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outland has a very good central idea and might have been a great film if handled differently. As it is, it comes across as a simple space retelling of High Noon, with slightly too many darkly lit scenes and a slow burning pace that never quite kicks into a satisfactory gear.Sean Connery toplines as a federal marshall on a distant mining moon. The miners are working flat out to meet their demands, and some are using a work-enhancing drug to push themselves faster than harder than they could perform under normal circumstances. Unfortunately, after a while the drug sends them into a psychotic rage. Connery decides to track down the drug suppliers, but finds himself up against the mine boss. In the end, some hired killers turn up to silence him and he finds that no-one on the entire moon wants to help him.The set design is fabulous. This really does look and sound like a working colony in the far reaches of space. Connery is tough and uncompromising in one of his strongest characterisations. But the film doesn't deliver as much as it could have. For a start, the final shootout is seriously under-developed. The villainous characters don't do much in the film and its hard for the audience to hate them, which undermines Connery's quest to bring them to justice. There are also far too many chunks of meaningless dialogue which don't do much to move the film forward. This must go down as a missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good storyline executed without style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise is very good indeed and easy to pitch: "High Noon on a Space Colony". The storyline is very efficient in planting the characters and the situation. Then, when it boils down to the nitty-gritty, the director is nowhere to be found.Provided the story is powerful we can take the cheap setting, the flat lighting... and above all the fact of having a Space Marshall looking like a 1980 policeman, firing his riffle at villains(!) But all this precarious set atmosphere is brought down by an overall lack of style, of creative intention.Yup, Peter Hyams never shot above average movies. With superior material in Capricorn One and then in Outland, he was only able to dish out forgettable TV-movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is strange for the singular reason that it isn't great but you can watch it multiple times and never seem to get tired of it.It should of been a lot better. High Noon in space starring Sean Connery, great premise. But it isn't great. It is just good. It's one of those movies that isn't too much of anything.  It's story is good. It's acting is good. Everything is good. It is good but that's it.it never reaches the point of being great, but it doesn't really try. It just glides along on in "good" mode.With all the elements you want it to be great. However, at the movie's close you're satisfied so you can't really complain.Let's just call it a competent movie. Which is what Peter Hyams used to do. Now he is a Hollywood hired schlock gun. Still worth a look. You'll probably end up watching it a couple times. It has about a 6 month life span. In six months you'll forget how it was and watch it again thinking it was great. You then be reminded it was just good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outland is a film that has stood the test of time. Though it lacks the CGI and other modern advancements available to more recent films, it continues to make for compelling viewing. Much of that is due to Sean Connery who gives a typically great performance. And the skill of director Peter Hyams who also must get his share of the credit. Outland is basically a futuristic version of High Noon, and more than lives up to the expectations one might have for such a film.Connery plays a lawman assigned to a distant mining colony on the moon of IO. It's a rough and dingy place filed with smarmy characters and run by a corrupt corporate puppet named Shepherd (Peter Boyle). Shepherd points out to Connery in an early scene that the miners on this moon work hard, and they also like to "play hard". In other words he saying, "the men who work here are going to give you some trouble, but as long as the work is getting done, you'd better give them some leeway." Connery can tell from the beginning that Shepherd is a schmuck, and he soon learns it's worse on IO than he ever imagined. Shepherd is supplying many of the workers with a dangerous drug that allows them to do a hell of a lot of work, but makes them psychotic after a few months. Sounds kind of like the meth problem we have around here! Pretty much all of the cops under Connery are paid to look the other way, but Connery makes it his personal mission to stop the flow of this drug into the colony. Needless to say, that makes Connery a target from all sides. Notice in one scene where he is chasing a suspect through the colony past hundreds of onlookers and nobody will even so much as try to get in the guy's way to slow him down.Is there anybody besides Connery who wants this problem solved? We as the audience are never really told enough about the Connery character for us to get a true understanding of his motivation. Why, faced with such tough odds, will he stubbornly not go along with the program? He could probably make a fortune if he was in on it. Is he trying to remain honest for the sake of his wife and child? Perhaps, but they leave him fairly early in the film and go back to Earth. Is it because he personally dislikes Shepherd so much? Perhaps. Anyway, the action unfolds fairly realistically for a science fiction movie as Connery sets out to clean the place up. There is plenty of violence, and a good bit of gore. On more than one occasion, we see people exposed to zero gravity exploding in a gooey mess. The location, though grimy and industrial, is beautifully filmed. A later scene depicting a shuttle landing at the facility is particularly well filmed.Outland is exciting, well-acted, technically compelling. Connery is as good as ever, and the film will be a treat for not only science fiction fans, but regular movie-goers, as well.9 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great future image and already been thought of in the early 80's. Sean Connery (O'Neill) definitely is the best man for a role like this. The though lonely hero fighting the corrupt commercial industry in a great setting, with beautiful sets and a good cast. I really liked it a lot, if you discard the unnecessary dialogues which slowed the movie down. The space setting adds a new dimension to society (the mine-colony) life in the future and it's a real plus that there are no aliens or something supernatural. Many people can see this as something negative, but it's a change and something to think about. Don't think that the movie consists of talking only, Outland has enough action to keep you satisfied!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your usual Hyams failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Connery is great - otherwise this movie blows. In a typical Hyams way the story is too explicit and the rhythm of the film choppy, partly due to bad editing. Some scenes seem to take forever, while chunks of time disappear. Plot holes the size of a crater occur continuously. Dialogue is weak and badly directed and there's absolutely no suspense. You just know what's coming and you just really don't give a damn.Even when Hyams near the end of the story introduces - surprise surprise - an extra bad guy (the two original bad guys were finished off too quickly, I guess) he comes from out of nowhere. I just can't fight off the feeling that the script was written as the filming went along.The physics are badly screwed up, of course. Sound in space. 1G when people walk, 0.6 G when they jump. Sometimes 0 atm environment equals zero G and people explode when exposed to the outside environment.This is so Hyams. His movies always have a really bad flow to them, a too simple storyline and a painfully bad dialog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether he's playing James Bond (Agent 007) on Earth - or - William O'Neil (Federal Marshal) on one of Jupiter's moons - You can be sure that when Sean Connery's no-nonsense character is in charge, he's a dude who means business and will do what he sees as necessary to get the job done right.Featuring some pretty decent visual effects and set designs (for 1981) - Originally Outland was intended to be a standard Western, but, then director/screenwriter, Peter Hyams scrapped that idea and set the whole story, instead, in the future (in outer space).And, as a result, I think Hyams did alright with this tale that deals with restoring law &amp; order (and settling scores) at the point of (what else?) a loaded shotgun.To be totally honest here - I was initially expecting to dislike this 1981, Sci-Fi/Thriller (and, with that, give it no mercy when it came to my review comments) - But, for the most part, this $16 million, British production kept me fairly interested and entertained throughout its 110-minute running time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploding people. Win.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say up front that any film with exploding people advances to the head of the class. "Scanners" ...awesome. "Robocop" ...grossalicious. "Spinal Tap" ...ahh, a moment of silence for Mick Shrimpton."Outland" shines (or should I say 'pops') with the best of them. And it's a great film to boot. More of a western than a scifi--its story has been compared to "High Noon"--it might be light on spaceships and laser battles, but it's definitely heavy on mood and atmosphere. If you like tense, dark, claustrophobic mood films like "Alien", "Das Boot" or even the recent "Pandorum", this is worth checking out.Sean Connery plays a great character, not quite the perfect hero as James Bond whom he had played a few years prior, but instead he plays a very human, fallible and slightly vulnerable (if not scared) character reminiscent of the great Jimmy Stewart or Gregory Peck in their roles as reluctant heroes. So don't expect Sean to clean house the way Schwarzenegger might. Here he's clearly outnumbered and outgunned which adds to the chills of this suspenseful story.Director Peter Hyams was at the peak of his game. Films like this, "Capricorn One" and "2010", all filmed within a 7-year stretch, exhibit the same dark, heavy vibe perfect for science fiction. Again let me repeat, you won't get a ton of flashy action scenes, but what you will get is a thick, suspenseful mood.If you like old school scifi like the films I've mentioned, or if you like westerns, or if you like moody thrillers, I think you'll like this. You might like it so much your head will explode. And then you too will be awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good crime thriller set in space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Connery has been the most successful James Bond at least in my book. His appearances in the Bond films made him very famous but did not require from him to demonstrate serious acting abilities. A few years before De Palma's 'Untouchables, 1987' that earned him an Oscar for a best supporting-actor role Connery starred in 'Outland' and did well, in fact did very well.Marshall William O'Niel arrives in a mining colony in a distant planet where a number of unexplained deaths started to occur. O'Niel begins to investigate and soon discovers that the local administration authorities may well know what's happening. He decides to do something about it despite of the warnings to the opposite.'Outland' is a crime thriller set in space. The scenes portray claustrophobic environments in a planet that has no breathable atmosphere and humans need to stay indoors. As a film is not as ambitious as 'Blade Runner' but creates tension and suspense showing the confrontations of O'Niel and his struggle to solve the puzzle. A 7/10 and a very good acting by Connery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outland is set in the future where Io, one of Jupiter's moon's, has been turned into a lucrative mining colony extracting titanium. The mining facility is called Con-Am 7 where recently transfered federal Marshall William T. O'Niel (Sean Connery) has been settling in, two weeks into his year long stay his wife leaves him &amp; ends up alone investigating the strange death's of two workers whom both died after exposing themselves to the zero atmosphere of Io. Everyone seems convinced that the death's were random incidents of men going crazy, everyone that is except O'Niel who senses a cover-up. After another man attacks &amp; beats up a prostitute while on a powerful drug O'Niel uncovers a plot to supply addictive performance enhancing drugs to the miners, however after long term usage the drug sends the user crazy with unpredictable consequences. The company try to buy O'Niel off but he refuses &amp; promises to put an end to the drug trafficking, the company then send in two professional assassins to kill O'Niel...This English production was written &amp; directed by Peter Hyams &amp; seems to be a somewhat forgotten film, no-one I know seems to have heard of it or seen it which is a shame because I thought it was a very good film &amp; enjoyed it more than I expected to. Often dubbed 'High Moon' by many as a reference to how similar it is to the classic western High Noon (1952) if the truth be told that's a little unfair, I mean sure the basic story of a lone lawman taking a moral stand facing up against a large corrupt organisation the whole setting &amp; feel of Outland is otherwise very different for obvious reasons. The script takes it's time build-up the plot, the character's &amp; the situation as it starts off as a mystery before veering into western territory with a cat &amp; mouse climax set amongst the narrow corridors of the colony that works very well. The story is gripping enough, the character's all fulfil their purpose with conspiracies, betrayal, lies, uneasy friendship's &amp; hatred played out simply yet effectively in a tight &amp; economic script that does what it needs to &amp; little else. At an hour &amp; forty odd minutes long Outland has a slow pace but the time is well spent building up the tension &amp; setting the scene for the final showdown, some may find it slow going (I did) &amp; a little light on action (I did) but if you can get into the story &amp; accept the situation (I did) then Outland is a very good film to watch. Outland is a film about an honest man fighting against seemingly impossible odds for futile reasons, an ordinary man making a moral stance &amp; in that basic sentiment Outland is a winner. There are one or two silly script issues like the hit-man at the end using a projectile shotgun in an environment where breaching the hull or a window would kill everyone in the room, including him.Outland looks great, the production design is fabulous with some incredibly impressive shots of the Io surface, some good model work &amp; great practical effects. Don't forget Outland was made before CGI was available &amp; I am sure it wouldn't look as good if the effects were CGI. A very dark &amp; bleak film the mining colony is both well realised &amp; believable, narrow corridors, lots of exposed machinery, cramped living quarters &amp; dirty rundown equipment paints a convincing picture of a future colony whose only reason to be there is to work &amp; make money for a bigger company. Company funded prostitutes are a nice touch, too. The effects often mix studio footage, miniature work &amp; matte paints all in one shot to great effect &amp; Outland is a very impressive looking film. Having said that it's noticeable how similar it looks to Alien (1979) in terms of technology &amp; costumes, even the opening titles are very similar. Although lacking in big action scenes there's some chases, a few shoot-outs &amp; a couple of fights. O'Niel uses his wits rather than weapons to defeat the assassins at the end. There's a bit of gore as a couple of people's heads explode &amp; a guy is seen with his guts hanging out.With a supposed budget of about $16,000,000 this had a decent budget &amp; most of it ended up on screen with good effects work &amp; impressive production design. Filmed here in the UK at Pinewood Studios. The acting is pretty good with the reliable &amp; watchable Sean Connery livening things up.Outland is a good solid sci-fi action thriller that isn't as action packed or as fast as modern audiences might like but I still enjoyed it for what it is. Outland (2012) the remake has been announced &amp; is in production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Variation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A federal Marshall, O'Neill (Sean Connery), is sent to Io, one of Saturn's moons, to oversee the security of a mining facility. Since the place is not exactly warm and fuzzy, we can all figure out this not a reward for good services rendered.Unfortunately, a feeling shared by O'Neill's wife, who leaves for Earth with their son, tired of being pushed around the solar system because of him.Meanwhile, some very strange happenings start poking around, with workers suddenly reacting hysterically and violently.Doing a little digging, reluctantly helped by the washed up station doctor Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Neill uncovers a scheme to uplift the facility productivity without much regard for labor regulations - and some highly illegal chemical help, for that matter - spearheaded by the slimy and corrupt general manager, Sheppard (Peter Boyle).Striving for redemption, O'Neill will find out how hard a virtue can hit, when he sees himself isolated from the other workers, even marshalls, either too bribed or too scared to help him, and chased by professional goons.This is an effective western rendition in a science fiction set up, with the good cast and the unoriginal yet tight script helping a lot to swallow some of the movie's shortcomings.For instance, the guns used are almost surreal (sawn-off shotguns, for Pete's sake!); the effects of alien atmosphere exposure are so over the top is hard to suspend disbelief (the blowing heads look cool though) and, the worse thing, the exterior on foot with special suits chase (however, the suspense level is pretty decent).If you can put aside those minor peeves, any action/sci-fi/western fan will enjoy this flick.Highly commendable, specially for Connery fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the future, men will mine precious metals on moons off Jupiter, play golf on computers, largely dispense with shaving, and be entertained by the sight of strange men and women writhing naked on lit platforms.Okay, I don't get the shaving part either. Pretty much every male in "Outland" sports beards of varying growths, including Sean Connery as a "federal district marshal" named O'Niel who becomes the target for several bad men when he figures out the rotten secret of a mining operation on the Jovian moon Io."Outland" boasts impressive set design, with the closed-in environment of the mining station looking stressed, dingy, and thoroughly miserable under Jupiter's garish ocher-amber light. "Some people just let this place get to them," O'Niel is told by his deputy Montone (James B. Sikking) when he asks about a gruesome suicide that opens the movie. "Don't worry. You'll get used to it."Connery plays his part in a deliberately stripped-down way, few wisecracks making it past his tightly-wound persona. O'Niel is struck an early blow when his wife and son leave him for home, tired of sharing in his unrewarding peripatetic existence, and from then on he puts on such a hang-dog manner being singled out for killing might seem a relief. Providing able backup for Connery's engagingly off-center performance are Sikking and Frances Sternhagen as a doctor at the mining station whose frequent interactions with O'Niel give the film all it has in the way of charm. I could have watched them banter longer.But there's little else to keep you watching "Outland" beyond the three actors, the scenics and an eerie Jerry Goldsmith score. Writer-director Peter Hyams crafted "Outland" as a space-age variation on the theme of "High Noon," a clever idea, but beyond some MacGuffins about corporate corruption he does little to construct an intriguing story of his own.The mystery O'Niel must solve is as basic as switching on a light, and the action scenes are rather flat and ineptly staged. Entire suspense scenes consist of Connery watching a monitor and furrowing his brow. One chief baddie spends his time sitting either behind a desk or at a table in a bar, telling O'Niel to wise up between slugs of booze.No, physics are not the reason we watch movies, but even a science dolt like me knows if you fire a shotgun at someone in near zero-G conditions, you aren't going to cause a squib to ignite five inches from your target's head. You won't get the buckshot to travel very far from the muzzle. All you will do is launch yourself backward 500 meters.I wound up liking "Outland" mainly for the dystopian setting, for the way Connery plays against this cold and lonely environment with his intriguingly low-key heroics, and for his gently caustic interactions with Sternhagen's doctor character. It feels like an outline for a better film, but at least what's good in it outweighs the bad.</fullReview>

Their situation becomes dangerous when found to have died of a drug designed to increase productivity, but refuses to drop the investigation.All treated with great sense of science, technology and progress possible, feasible in the future where mankind has managed to colonize other worlds.It's a plot of suspense and action classic, quiet rightly, though peppered with sharp, silent and strong dialogues. The film is free of hype, and rightly mixing drugs, western, and outer space. As in any science fiction film should be judged the scientific part and fiction part, and special effects.The science is solid: in a space colony that can not go out on the issue of oxygen and the absence of atmosphere, live workers and police, are all affected by the claustrophobia and the edge of despair. The third aspect is clearly now suffering because in the early 80's that was filmed, was the age of the net "spectrum" and the first games of Mars, so when you recreate the computers of the future with the black screen and green letters, we are surprised by the technical vision of the future that was in that decade.All science fiction is believable atmosphere, with a very tightly woven plot from beginning to end, which keeps the viewer feel claustrophobic about the same characters It's highly recommended this remake of "High Noon" in space. Lovers of science fiction will enjoy the atmosphere; same to the "Alien", dark metallic corridors, loneliness of the protagonist ... However, sci-fi only has that ambiance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set far in the future, Sean Connery plays a marshal who has been transferred to a mining colony on one of Jupiter's moons?a dingy, depressing place akin to a company town where people work with the hopes of eventually escaping.Drugs and corruption abound and people do their jobs and cope with the boredom as best they can. Things appear to be going smoothly until a drug going around starts making people think they can walk in space without a suit.Connery investigates with little help from his department or the general population, as they are paid to look the other way or are too scared to get involved. Despite warnings from the company man in charge (played wonderfully by Peter Boyle) Connery pursues the case.I use Connery's name (rather than his character's) on purpose as this felt like an obvious vehicle for him. I felt like the studio simply did this to make a tense, space-themed crime movie with an action star after the success of Alien. All things considered, this could have turned out a lot worse.It has its moments of effective tension, but they are offset with other attempts that just don't work. There's a ridiculous foot chase through the facility that ends with a less than convincing fight. Then there's the almost Western-style showdown against company-hired thugs. The sets are crude and the models are obvious. So are the stunts. The movie fails to be convincing on several levels. This movie did not age well, either.At the time of writing this, there appears to be a remake in the works with the same writer/director involved (Peter Hyams). I wouldn't mind seeing an updated version of this at all. I'm sure they could do a much better job of it now.</fullReview>

Sure these may seem rather pointless, but I find it help enhances this film because otherwise it might have been rather bland. Also helping this film's cause is Sean Connery as the lead guy playing the Marshall who must face down two hit-man in a do or die struggle as the rest of the frightened citizens of this mining colony do nothing to aid him. Just a case where once again a great actor helps a movie that may have seemed rather cheesy rise to another more significant level. Sure there are no lasers fired or any other futuristic weapons, however one does get the solitude of space and the fun of weightlessness. The action in this one is mainly confined to the end of the film, but once again it is so fun to see Sean Connery act that you will not get to bored in some of the more talky scenes. So I may have enjoyed this one more if there had been a few more futuristic touches, for what it was it was still a rather entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The setting is a corporate mining colony on Io one of Jupiter's moons sometime in the relatively near future. Our protagonist Marshall O'Niel (Sean Connery) has just recently arrived and he has found out that the miner's are dying at an usual rate in unusual ways. When he eventually discovers the cause he is told to look the other way, which he of course does not.Though the story is set in outer-space it is very much a Western in structure, with the small isolated settlement and the Marshall facing off against hired guns. The story was in fact loosely inspired by the classic western High Noon. The tension builds as the inevitable showdown nears, and the backdrop of the mining colony works very well to trap both our protagonist and his foes until it is resolved.The movie was somewhat bold and refreshing for having the major female character Doctor Lazarus(France Sternhagen) being both middle aged and also not a love interest for Connery. The often affable Peter Boyle projects considerable malevolence as the mine boss.The film was written and directed by Peter Hyams who has made mostly action films often in the science fiction genre.Outland was not the first film to depict this kind of gritty vision of the future but it certainly portrays it well and this seems like a believable vision of such an existence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recap: A marshal get to his new assignment, a mining colony on the Jupiter moon Io, far from everything else. Unfortunately he isn't the what the mining company hoped for. He actually has the intention to his work well. For instance he is investigating the strange suicides that has plagued the colony lately. It seems to have something to do with a new drug. But he finds that he is almost alone in wanting to stop it.Comments: I'm not very surprised that High Noon is listed in the references, because this is what that movie would have looked like if it happened in space. A single marshal that have to fight the evil management that hires outside help in professionals that comes to dispose of the marshal.It is a little fun to see how the future has changed in the last decades. Don't misinterpret me, this is very much viewable even now. Actually the part that has most obviously changed is the computers used in the movie, and those have changed drastically. Otherwise the movie relies very little on visual special effects, instead opting for building sets and using lots of extras. Very much of it seems genuinely done, and because of it it doesn't suffer from being technically obsolete. I never got annoyed with bad effects.The story, even if it is a version of a classic, is not that good. The pace is slow, and doesn't speed up much even for what should have been the dramatic end. It is not dull, but not very exciting either.Interesting to see Connery in a little different movie than I am used to.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Noirish atmosphere and superb special effects help compensate for an erratic screenplay that implausibly combines 25th century technology with 19th century law enforcement. Good imaginative setting-- an elaborate mining operation on Io, one of Jupiter's remote moons. It's a real eye-catcher, the massive architecture of the outpost that resembles nothing less than a soaring dark nightmare. No wonder miners are going nutzoid in this bleakly artificial environment. The company tries to provide meagre creature comforts, including a battalion of hookers probably on overtime. But apparently some things never change, such as a bar-scene looks like a transplant from seedy downtown Manhattan. Then too, there's the mining company. Futuristic or not, the company is trying to squeeze the last bit of profit out of the operation, as if there's no end to Wall Street dominance, even in a distant century.Shrewdly, the script portrays the outpost as a last stop for third-rate employees. Thus, the company simply assumes head cop O'Niel (Connery) will go along with their doping scheme. But like a reformed good cop and compromised Western sheriff, O'Niel craves a last chance at honorable service. He won't be bribed, whatever the consequences. It's here at this critical point that the script loses confidence in itself. There's nothing wrong with the idea of O'Niel risking all for self-respect?how else can he deserve the love and respect of his wife and child. The problem is that the screenplay tries to graft 19th century technology and incredible control methods onto a futuristic setting. Are we really to believe that a civilization that can mine titanium in outer space has not yet gotten beyond the shotgun as an enforcement weapon. Are we really supposed to accept that a weapon that can blow a hole in such a fragile environment and threaten the entire station is the weapon of choice among responsible officials.Worse is the idea that the company would opt for such a crude measure as dispatching gun- toting assassins to rid the station of its troublesome cop. My gosh, look at that space station. How believable is it that the company couldn't come up with a less obvious way of removing O'Niel than a gun-toting showdown. Apparently, somebody in production thought a High Noon countdown would mean bigger box office. Probably, it did. But it also came at the expense of credibility. Too bad, those in charge took an easier way out. Had writer Hyams extended his core imagination to include the climax, he might have come up with classic sci-fi. Instead the result stands as an awkward combination of yesterday and ten days after tomorrow as though it's still essentially 1952. Too bad the New Hollywood didn't take a chance on a more imaginative update on the perennial human desire to regain one's honor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely beautiful set design, good plot, no poor performances (OK Connery's kid was annoying but he only had a few lines), good writing. Someone said that there were chunks of dialogue that don't move the plot along but don't listen to them they don't know what they're talking about. First of all, every movie has to have dialogue that doesn't move the plot along otherwise there would only be a handful of lines in any movie. Secondly, the dialogue in this movie that wasn't directed towards plot motion was directed towards character development etc. In fact, there were only a couple of instances where I thought the dialogue was a bit superfluous and the rest was surprisingly (I wasn't expecting much as this movie doesn't seem to get a lot of attention for w/e reason) well written. If you're a fan of sci-fi or just of great movies this is an absolute must see. The people who give this movie poor reviews are probably the same people who think the Bourne Ultimatum is an awesome movie.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Connery as Gary Cooper???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the better sci-fi films of its day it has Connery playing a law man on a mining colony. The film has that gritty "it could really work" quality about everything, much like the ship in Alien. The coolest part of the story is that if you've seen High Noon, you've basically seen this film. The story line is almost a mirror in its basic form. Connery is the law man who wants to put things right. The bad guys don't like that and send for some bad boys to rub him out. The clocks that were in every room in High Noon are replaced by the countdown timer for the shuttle which will bring the killers. Not the best film but well worth a view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... I noticed that this was the phrase on the Marshall's (Connery's) computer every time he received data. Was this a sly dig at his old role, James Bond, that had a new movie of that title released the same year as Outland? Certainly, Connery was wise to leave the role of the two-dimensional secret agent, and went on to make some interesting movies, such as the esoteric Zardoz. Outland, while not as thoughtful as Zardoz, is a worthwhile movie. Set on a mining station orbiting Io (One of Jupiter's moons), it is self-consciously toned down SF, with rifles and knifes taking the place of laser pistols. Direction is above-average, though not art, and the cast are good, especially Frances Sternhagen. Connery is on fine, pensive, sensitive form, though it's still a little strange seeing him kill a villain and not make some wisecrack, a la 007. Only in the final quarter does Connery don a spacesuit and take the narrative to outer space. Yet while the final pay-off may disappoint in a stock movie, Outland does succeed on most counts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a decent enough SF flick, but it's yet another case of the 'everyone other than the hero and his associates being unbelievably dumb' syndrome:1) Why would the Corporation send O'Neil to the Mining Station if he was likely to expose the drug culture there? Don't they know the sort of people they employ in senior positions?2) The supposed 'expert assassins' assemble their weapons in a public corridor in full view of a surveillance camera. What do the other ones do - assemble them in the middle of the crowded mess hall?3) Having done so, they have night vision sights and a clear view of their target - and miss. Where did they learn their target shooting?4) And the last one to die walks into a glass greenhouse next to space with a high powered rifle. Yeah, right, minus twenty out of ten for intelligence for the gunman, and a big minus one hundred out of ten for the architect. Never heard of micrometeorites??I know that in these respects this film is probably no worse than most, but I would for one just like a film without amazingly dumb villains!

		<shortDescription>Some films age well -- this is one of them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Outland first came out, it was surrounded by tough competition. Hence, it was somewhat overlooked. Now, after viewing it again in 2010, I'm astounded by how bleeding-edge this film is. It's prediction of how a mining operation of the future would look strikes one as very plausible (factoring in cost considerations, square footage allowances, fire regulations, etc...). Clearly, a lot of effort was spent getting the look and 'feel' of the story's world nailed down. Then there's the psychological and sociological aspects of working in remote work camps, field sites, or mining operations. Again, there's incredible attention to detail. The sets are remarkable, and the artistry of the weathering and lighting setups is superb. Smart predictions were made for the presentation of server computers, use of fiber-optics, floor plans, and even styles of music. Amazingly, the score for one of the later leisure club scenes contains rhythms that would not appear until a few years later as proto-electro-industrial music.I now realize that I was too young to appreciate the more sophisticated aspects of this film, back in 1981. The subtle nuances of character interaction are much more clear, based on the motivations of each of them. A lot of scenes are played pretty low-key in this film. But -- in reality -- they would be. There's only so much a real person in this sort of situation could do or say. Kudos to the writer for getting this across in a realistic way (much like Dan O'Bannon's writing), and kudos to the actors for living their characters.This is a great late-night film. It takes its time and pulls you into a visually rich world that would fit nicely into the universe of Alien and Blade Runner. Not surprisingly, some of the crew who worked on this film, also worked on Alien and Star Wars : A New Hope. The attention to visual detail, and the aesthetic choices are what led me to dig around for more information on who put together the look, feel, and sound of this film.To those who worked on this, well done. You've made a film that has aged well, and has managed to take a story from one genre (a western) and translate it into another. All this goes to prove that times and technology change, but human motivations do not.For those who haven't seen this in a long time, or at all, be sure to add it to your list of films to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Connery's most interesting interaction with a woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Others have commented at length on the believability and originality of the script (or lack thereof). What really makes this movie interesting, however, is Sean Connery's interaction with the always fascinating Frances Sternhagen.For perhaps the only time in Connery's movie career, Outland pairs him with a female off whom he never attempts to charm the pants. Marshal O'Neil's scenes with Dr. Lazarus start out testy (he threatens to kick her "nasty ass"). As the movie progresses, the two characters treat each other progressively more and more as equals. The scene in which Connery's Marshal is finally forced to put into words why he's staying to confront two killers is one of the strongest and most vulnerable, self-deprecating, and honest of Connery's long career. It is this scene which, appropriately, strikes the only male/female sparks between Connery and Sternhagen, and she does it all with her eyes and her voice.Frances Sternhagen is far more well-known for her stage and television work than for her film appearances. But for once in Sean Connery's career, in Outland he found himself matched with a real equal, with fascinating results.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen Outland since my teenage years, which is a good thirty years ago and frankly I wasn't expecting much. Well even by our 21st century expectations this is actually a decent film. Sci-fi is the chosen genre for the story but it could have been applied to our present time, in a research centre in Antarctica, on an off-shore oil rig or on a ship. Mind you, using one of those environments instead would have avoided us the cringe of hearing sounds, seeing sparks and smoke, and witnessing people and objects fall... in deep space? Fairly entertaining thriller if a bit slow in the first half by our current standards. It was also good to see the ex-007 middle-aged and fit again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think, the movie scores by being gritty, tense, slow and almost "awkward". Connery portrays a man on the edge of retirement, lacking confidence, feeling like a loser. His performance is dead-on. All these together give it a feel of realism, by seeming like such a story as we might observe unfolding in our own time and place.There are some logistical gaps in Hyams' screenplay, and a fair amount of the dialogue is leaden, but Connery is both believable and sympathetic here, giving a finely tuned performance that encompasses the marshal's steadfast pursuit of justice as well as empathic scenes involving his wife and son, the former deciding that Io is no place to raise a kid early on. The pacing is set for suspense and the story keeps you interested. But the things that stick and make this worth checking out are the sets and special effects. "Outland" may not be a classic film but it's still entertaining and compelling.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First those who are looking for comparisons between this and High Noon. This is not that review. Also lets get the science out of the way up front. Jupiter's Magnetosphere reaches from Mars to Saturn. Anyone who wasn't surrounded by an inch of lead shielding would be cooked like a chicken in 15 minutes. Now I was surprised at how this classic got such a low rating? Please great action pop out scares one of the best foot chases before Casino Royale yet 6.4? It does start quite slowly but that is how film's used to be before the Man of Steel template. You know start right off kung fu explosions yelling running screaming all the wonderful features that make current movies such a treat. Yes I know this will seem strange back in the 80s we had this really boring thing called character and plot development no doubt this is why it did so badly. The Pacific Rim crowd that likes lots of giant exploding robots and non stop yelling will be very disappointed. Connery and Boyle carry the movie. Boyle was always as greatly underrated actor as his no talent daughter is overrated. I recommend viewers to that rare treat FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE. Boyle is the villain in that film and here he really shines as a real creep who is poisoning workers with a synthetic drug that makes them work much harder right before they go crazy. All in the name of greater profits of course. O Niel wrecks this and Sheppard makes killing O Niel his mission in life. Dr Lazarus played by frances sternhagen almost steals the movie with great sour one liners and shows why she is the only reason to watch the dreadful Doc Hollywood. James Sikking as Montone turns in a great performance with a great pop out scare. The byplay between O niel and Sheppard is one the highlights of the picture great to see two old pros together after suffering though Prometheus a slight drop off in acting quality. The film is quite intense and Hyams is no slouch at drama and suspense. Yes I know he did Capricorn One and End of Days but he did produce great suspenseful scenes here. It was outshone by the dreadful and overrated 2010 this is his best film by miles. There are a few flaws of course his wife and son are played by just awful actors. The weird bar with the mating figures was as bizarre then as it is now really do not now what Hyams is doing except trying to give the bar a blue collar feel. Frankly every time O Niel is speaking to his wife or son the movie comes to a complete stop. It really was a big mistake by Hyams first they cannot act and they are painful to watch. It wrecks the tension and is quite a bore. If you are looking for special effects sorry this is 1981. They did the best they could some scenes are quite well done like when he is outside in his suit others like the badly drawn mattes of Jupiter are quite awful. The film is exciting unexpected with moments of really comedy embedded in an otherwise grim suspenseful anti corporate drama. I still like it 34 years later.</fullReview>

Montone (James Sikking) is his second in command. Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle) is the head of the operation who wants him to let the men operate smoothly without interference. However miners are acting weird and getting killed. Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen) discovers that the last dead miner has taken an amphetamine drug which lets people work day and night until they have a psychotic breakdown. Sheppard provides the drugs with Montone looking the other way.I like the design of the camp which reminds me of 'Alien'. I like the gritty underbelly feel of this realistic future world. It moves a bit slow at times which is its biggest problem. This is a sci-fi western compared most notably to 'High Noon'. This keeps getting compared to other movies but always comes up a little shorter. It's still a good movie.</fullReview>

The marshal will not be bought or scared off, so of course their must be a "High Noon" style showdown at the climax, to settle matters for good.

		<fullReview>If you take "High Noon" and throw in some "Rio Bravo" and a little bit of "Die Hard" for good measure, the garishly-colored goo left in the blender is "Outlander". Sean Connery is the marshal who faces opposition when he disrupts a drug operation at a mining colony on one of Jupiter's moons. No one around (including his fellow lawmen) are of any help as the top dog (Peter Boyle) has reinforcements arriving any day now. And once they do, it's a cat-and-mouse through the "Alien"-like interiors of the settlement. There's no question that Connery carries this film on his mighty shoulders, and things don't pick up steam until the halfway point. It's when our hero takes up arms and some manly Scottish punches are thrown that this slumbering beast actually stirs. But then everything slows down once again until the hired muscle shows up, and we begin the silly wire stunts of outer space fisticuffs.But Peter Hyams has directed better movies, and "Outland" never rises above "meh". 5/10</fullReview>

Sean Connery out of his comfort zone gives a good physical performance as Marshal W.T. O'Niel with Frances Sternhagen giving a sterling effort as Dr. Lazarus. James Sikking as Sgt. Montone is notable and Peter Boyle gives his usual subtle delivery. The script is light on dialogue and the action is slowed down by Connery having to don a clumsy space suit in the closing act - the showdown may have fared better on the station.It's an average affair but its simplicity makes it compelling and gives it the ability to still stand up today.</fullReview>

There is one elongated chase that goes on forever and ends, finally, with such lackluster that it is the harbinger of more to come. The final "gunfight" is also nothing much and it is rather mundane. The performances and characters are not bad but just can't breathe any life into this lifeless and flat story that has been done many times.

		<fullReview>Yes, it can accurately be described as a Western in disguise, as "High Noon" in space, basically, but that doesn't mean that it isn't well executed and consistently entertaining. Written, directed, and photographed by Peter Hyams, it stars Sean Connery, as commanding a presence as he's ever been, as W.T. O'Niel, a federal marshal stationed on Io, the third moon of Jupiter, where a mining operation has been established. O'Niel discovers that the workers are being given a drug which greatly increases their productivity but also eventually drives them insane. He becomes determined to nail the person(s) responsible for this corruption, but comes to discover that he'll be mostly alone in his fight - even after his nemesis has two hired guns sent after him. "Outland" may be predictable, standard stuff script wise, but it's also a very good looking film, with impressive production design (by Philip Harrison) and sets, all built at Englands' famed Pinewood Studios. Commendably, O'Niel, despite his Dudley Do Right attitude, isn't portrayed as some infallible hero; rather, it's his tendency to make waves that has gotten him transferred from one depressing environment to another. Still, you do root for him all the way, and you also come to like Dr. Lazarus, winningly played by Frances Sternhagen. She's got plenty of sass, and actually comes to O'Niels' aid for the suspenseful finale instead of it being the other way around. Hyams, too, refrains from trying to create any sort of romantic or sexual tension between the two, keeping both characters professional. The back-and-forth chemistry between Connery and Sternhagen is a delight. Peter Boyle is excellent, too, as the company manager who only wants to see results. Other pros include James B. Sikking, a regular in Hyams's films, as the slightly shady Montone, Steven Berkoff, as the unhinged worker Sagan, and John Ratzenberger, in a memorable bit as another miner who goes off the deep end. Jerry Goldsmith supplies the atmospheric score, and the editing is courtesy of the talented veteran Stuart Baird. All in all, this sizes up as solid entertainment, moving along nicely towards its final showdown. Any fan of the genre or of Connery should be quite satisfied. Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sean Connery starring "Outland" is nothing more than a modern day western, well futuristic western with noir-like qualities set out in the far reaches of space. It's "High Noon" (1952) going intergalactic. Police Marshall William T. O'Neil finds himself backed up in a very uncompromising position and with very little, if no help as he tries to do his job in a mining colony on Jupiter's second moon. Some sort of epidemic is happening, where miners are losing their minds and ending up dead. Everyone thinks it's just the norm; too long in space. But O'Neil uncovers drug trafficking, an illegal drug that helps the workers work for long stretches and this corruption leads all the way up to the top.This was one of those films where I use to always find myself flicking through the channels entering somewhat halfway through it and I don't know how many times I've done it. But this was the first time I actually watched it in its full entirety. Sure the surprises in the back-end are foreseeable now, but it still remained grippingly suspenseful. It's a familiarly low-key story, but its backdrop puts a unique spin on it. Some moments are a little grey with its hidden agendas (especially O'Neil's past), but it did surprise me how tight and quick the film got into it. There's no lingering about. Director Peter Hyams ably constructs it around its creative special optical work and strikingly confined, metallic art direction where a hauntingly, desolate atmosphere is etched, a gritty charge is formed (who doesn't love imploding heads?) and the tension is well timed, especially in the climatic deadly cat and mouse game. It's rather sombre in tone, and Jerry Goldsmith adds a terrifically balanced score. The camera has an open style, but it does get in the thick of it.A sober Connery is simply excellent in this lead role, a man with the odds stacked against him. Troubled and lonely, but willing. Is he trying to prove something; to those you thought he'd be no threat or is it simply to himself. Peter Boyle is just as good the weaselling corporate administrator. Frances Sternhagen adds some bite to her role ("Do you think you're making a difference."), as O'Neil's only real ally and James Sikking is reliable as O'Neil's Sgt. The cast also features small parts by Steven Berkoff, Kika Markham, Clarke Peters, John Ratzenberger and Pat Starr.</fullReview>

A series of accidental deaths leads law marshal William O'Neill to investigate these deaths . He finds that the deaths were caused by a psychotic reaction to a drug being used by the men , that this drug is being smuggled on to the colony and that the smugglers want him out of the way and no one is going to help him OUTLAND is the film that is forever known as being a HIGH NOON remake set in space which is somewhat disingenuous . It does mirror some of the plot turns of that Western where a man trying to enforce the law finds himself alone . Carl Foreman's Western screenplay has a rather explicit subtext that talks about Hollywood in the 1950s where by people found themselves abandoned by erstwhile friends because they might have had left leaning sympathies and didn't want to be accused by association .It was undoubtedly Hollywood's most shameful period but OUTLAND doesn't feel it's trying to ape that film and if there's a subtext to this film it's that drugs are bad On its own terms there's a lot to admire about OUTLAND . Connery gives one of his better and more commercial performances as tough and noble marshal O'Neill , a tough guy but at heart a family man whose wife and son feel the stress of the job . The film also benefits from some great set design which is both very convincing and functional without appearing too futuristic . You can honestly believe this is a colony on a satellite of Jupiter where titanium ore is being mined What the story differs suffer from slightly is that there are a couple of scenes where O'Neill knows who the bad guy is and the bad guy talks about his plan over video screens . Are we to take it that in this future world video monitors don't have recording facilities ? Likewise tough hit men referred to as " the best in the business " just happen to pull out and assemble guns in front of a video monitor which is very convenient for the plot . One also has to ask don't shuttle passengers get their baggage searched ?Regardless of a few flaws OUTLAND is a gritty and entertaining science fiction space Western that stands on its own hind-legs which unfortunately gets compared to HIGH NOON a little bit too much for its own good</fullReview>

Sean Connery is excellent in his role as the brooding, decent man looking for a reckoning, Marshal O'Niel. Peter Boyle is perfect as the slimy, yet pragmatic corrupt station manager. The special effects are well done, and director Hyams uses them and the realistic sets to great effect, creating that tense, gritty, dark feeling.

Rather than accept graft in return for passive approval, Connery elects to take on the syndicate, managed locally by corrupt mining manager Boyle. But Boyle isn't intimidated by Connery's attention until his efforts start to hinder supply at which point assassins are hired to kill the meddling marshal.Claustrophobic and at times ultra-violent science fiction thriller has elements of sophistication in its set design and props, although bland dialogue and clichés dent the overall effect. Connery does a reasonable job as the new marshal banished to the badlands finding support in short supply after his deputy (Sikking) is executed as a pre-emptive warning shot. He soon finds himself a pariah and magnet for trouble, his only ally a wily doctor (Sternhagen) not content to sit idle and let Boyle's assassins net their quarry. Aside from the three principals, Sikking (who appears in a number of Hyams' films) has a brief but memorable role, while P.H. Moriarty features late in the film as one of the silent assassins.Moody, atmospheric and at times suspenseful, director Hyams demonstrates his experience with the sci-fi genre, here juxtaposing "High Noon" into outer-space. Connery might have been an unusual choice at the time, but his presence is perhaps just what a film of this scale needed to reach the mainstream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good set up to non ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script and direction derail right when they should take off. And that's when it becomes High Noon. The killers arrive and then each confrontation with them is less well done than the last. Final fight is especially bad, it's hard to stage an exciting fist fight when you have actors in space suits and slow motion to simulate low gravity. In fact Jerry Goldsmith scored the scene for suspense, but the music was rewritten by Morton Stevens, at the director's request, to try to save it--it doesn't. The bad guys in general are a weak bunch, the best are the first two and the best action sequence happens half way into the movie with nothing to rival it after wards. Peter Boyle makes no impression at all other than being really overweight, none of the final assassins pose any threat to the awesome Connery--in one of his best post Bond hero performances and it's a well written part too. But when it all leads to a final confrontation that is poor you can't embrace it. Other weaknesses are the uneven special effects and Alien rip off elements: the poor title sequence and attempts at Alien type gore. This was the film that brought us the now happily dead process of Introvision, most of the miniatures look like miniatures and cut out slides look like slides. It's too bad because there is much right with the movie until the last 20 to 30 minutes. Also existing NTSC DVD is really poor with the image shifting around like an old 16mm print did when it shrunk, certainly the movie deserves a better release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Successful but dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Hyams' reworking of High Noon into a science fiction setting (Marshall Sean Connery awaits the arrival of gunslingers on a mining operation on Io) works well, particularly in conveying the claustrophobic confines of the hermetically sealed community.This is not Connery's best performance, however. Perhaps he was going for Gary Cooper but didn't quite make it. Whatever the reason, his O'Niel - dour lawman, given the worst postings because he is never going to be a high flyer - never really convinces, which is a shame because most of the other players put in solid performances. In particular, Frances McDormand delights as a cynical and, perhaps, rather shady doctor.But the story is solid, the sets are excellent, and the effects are not bad.</fullReview>

Sometimes, like this one, the movie is average.Connery is the law enforcement with a mining company on Io, one of Jupiter's moons. The scenery looks like a cross with Star Wars IV and maybe NASA. Special suits to go outside, but yet mining. The company is importing something illegal to make the miners work more - with deadly results. And only Connery can save the day, just like real life.It just did not do enough to fill my belly. Sometimes I liked the action, but other times I was waiting for time to pass by. I think they could have cut out 10 minutes of it and still be an OK movie. So overall its fair. "C"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Gripping, Science-Fiction Western With Good Cast And Excellent Direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>O'Neil is a federal marshal assigned to head security at a titanium refinery on Io, one of Jupiter's moons. The job is lousy, the place is depressing, the people are indifferent, and O'Neil soon discovers a drug-smuggling operation run by the station manager. With his life at stake and nobody to back him up, is it worth doing the right thing ?This is the second of four brilliant films Hyams made in the middle of his career. It's not without its faults, but is an excellent science-fiction thriller for two main reasons. Firstly, Hyams' unusual blend of western-fantasy-crime story is highly original and makes for a gripping storyline, and secondly, Connery gives one of his most careful and understated performances, making O'Neil completely sympathetic and believable, a terrific contrast to the usual heroic blowhard stuff. When Boyle threatens him, he doesn't comeback with sassy lines or macho antics, he just quietly notes it and moves on. In this respect he is a much more old-fashioned hero (the obvious model for this and much of the story is Gary Cooper in High Noon), and the picture is all the richer for it. Equally good is Sternhagen as the cranky base doctor, in one of her many feisty broad roles (see also Misery, Raising Cain) and the scenes of the two verbally sparring are brilliantly played. I also love the way the film moves between genres so well; it starts off looking like an Alien clone (the start titles and Jerry Goldsmith's similarly low-key score accentuate this), then becomes a mystery/crime thriller but finally evolves into a hunted-lawman in outer-space western, complete with anachronistic shotguns (as opposed to laser pistols). Hyams is a great all-rounder - he does action and special effects very well, and there is a great barrelling midway chase as the drug connection blunders through the station with O'Neil in pursuit. But he also invests his characters with plenty of development and nuance - for example, Sikking plays a fairly typical on-the-take cop, but he's also kind-hearted, worldy-wise and up-front, so his death at a key point has real impact and dramatic bite. There are some flaws as well of course - the drab, Meccano-fit sets are terrific and claustrophobic, but so darkly lit that it's hard to fathom what's going on at times, the mine population varies wildly between suffocatingly crowded and completely empty, and some of the laser-light/LED-screen effects are a bit quaint (though I personally like that). Overall however this is an extremely well-made and intriguing movie with a unique blend of science-fiction and western themes and a highly original storyline. Hyams is not that well-known and none of his films could truly be called outstanding (though 2010 comes close), but he is a great journeyman director and all his work is well worth catching. Trivia - this is the first of his films where someone is called Spota (his wife's maiden name), a running gag reused in The Star Chamber, The Presidio, Timecop, Sudden Death and The Relic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a futuristic version of the 1952 western "High Noon". Even though this movie has not adapted the real-time approach that the original movie has, the similarities of the storyline are just too obvious to ignore, with Connery playing the modern day loner sheriff.Once again though, the storyline proves strong enough to avoid sci-fi extravaganza and utterly it is the low profile atmosphere that makes the movie attractive.Even though the same story has been told several times in movie history and the effects look dated, the simplicity of the scenography and direction provide pleasant viewing and give this "never quite made it" film a Cult status.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outland has the same gritty, used-world feel of films like Alien and Blade Runner, and even the latter seems flashy by comparison. I enjoyed Peter Boyle's performance as the villain, and Sean Connery does a good job as the stubborn new Marshal rattling the hornet's nest.The mining colony's claustrophobic feel comes across well, like that of a prison. In fact this movie isn't unlike Brubaker, and I sometimes wonder if I'd have been so keen on Outland if it had been set in a prison or a city, reduced to a mere drama or thriller rather than posing as Sci-fi fare. And yet with so few FX decorating this tale, the space thing can't be written off as a gimmick. One has to give credit to the plot and performances. The movie's few special effects are designed to reinforce the space setting, rather than to dazzle the audience. When a prisoner is assassinated in his zero-gravity holding cell we see the blood dripping up rather than down. Not a complicated effect to be sure, but an effective way to remind us where we are.My only qualm is with O'Niel's (Connery) final confrontation with Sheppard (Boyle). O'Niel seems content to clock his nemesis in the jaw, despite having narrowly escaped, and permanently disposed of, two assassins sent by Sheppard himself. That he would suddenly recede into his Mr. By-the-book persona and NOT kill the last of his enemies came across as a little too 'good' for such a hard-boiled character. Perhaps that's why Sean Connery gets to be the Marshal and I don't.I give the movie 7 out of 10. It would have been 8 out of 10 but if you tell me I'm going to watch a space movie then there'd better be a space monster in it, if only for a few seconds. Even The Ice Pirates had its "space herpes".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a Sean Connery purist; I'll watch nearly anything that has him in it. Given the right role, he can make any movie worth watching.Just look at "Outland".This won't fool anyone who has seen a fair share of horse operas; the new sheriff (Connery) in town (or on Jupiter's moon Io) is here to clear out the bad guys and everyone is against him except for the local doctor (Sternhagen). Yes, I know; if you've seen "High Noon", you've seen this film, but consider: how many times do you get to see a film in which a prison is made up of a man in space suit suspended in an anti-gravity room? Not many, I'll bet. And Boyle always did make a good bad guy. And Sikking, a regular in most of Hyams' films, makes an appearance.Even if the science of space is lax and there are liberties with logic here and there, on the whole "Outland" is a very entertaining experience. And Sean makes this movie his own as only he can. Seven stars for "Outland" - in space, no one can hear you shake a vodka martini.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric sci-fi remake of "High Noon"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An atmospheric sci-fi remake of "High Noon", "Outland" sports a convincingly high-tech/grunge setting, albeit one that owes a heavy debt for its similar look and ethos to that of the original 1979 "Alien" universe.Blue-collar workers live and work in cramped and uncomfortable conditions, working for a corrupt and almost faceless corporation. Violent crime and drugs are a continual undercurrent throughout, an expected frontier-town cum oil-rig mentality.Both actors and story appear swamped by the surroundings to the point that they never quite ring true: O'Neil's relationship with his family irritates, Lazarus is nothing more than a one-dimensional caricature of the standard "alcoholic doctor", and the story -- while enjoyable and competently shown -- holds no real surprises. But this is made up for by the believable (for the times) portrayal of an necessarily enclosed and suffocating near-future space environment.A well made, if slightly stolid effort, by the man who went on to do "2010".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Hyams directs this Space thriller-western, if you will, in a mining colony on a planet far, far, far away from Earth. It seems that a new Marshall has come to town to keep track of things and just "keep the peace." This new Marshall wants to do more than that and actually do his job despite the crooked manager of the colony and the crooked cops in tow. Sean Connery stars as O' Niel a somewhat down-and-out policeman who has jumped from one miserable job to another with his very unhappy wife and son. O'Niel comes here and amidst personal turmoil quickly realizes some recent deaths are not just guys going crazy from the place but because of a whole lot of crime at the highest level. He soon makes enemies of the highest order and knows of two hit men being sent to the colony to exterminate him. no one, save a down-and-out, drunken(much of the time) female doctor will aid him. This is where the High Noon storyline comes to play in Outland. it is well-done in terms of moving it to a completely different setting and time. Hyams creates lots of very tense moments. Lots of excitement. Lots of great special effects given when the film was made. The colony feels claustrophobic. the acting is first-rate with Connery doing a very serviceable job. Frances Sternhagen is funny as the Yankee doctor. Peter Boyle plays the heavy and does a fine job too. Outland was really a very nice surprise as I hadn't heard much about it and when watching it realized how really good it is. This is first-rate science fiction with a compelling story, good effects, and a nice(if all ready utilized) message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Some 365 million miles from earth on the Jupiter moon of Io a corporate mining company is hard at work drilling for titanium and is breaking all records in digging up the precious medal but at the cost of the lives of many of it's employees. When William O'Neil, Sean Connery, is given the job of security on Io he begins to notice a number of miners have gone off the deep end and ended up doing themselves in.The movie is more about everyday crime back her on earth then a futuristic look at space travel and colonization of the outer planets and their satellites, moons, in that it has to do with illegal drugs thats being given to the workers at Io to increase their endurance. This is done in order to drive the workers beyond their capabilities to the point where they end up with their brains being fried that leads to them going insane and killing themselves.O'Neil having the bodies of a number of dead miners checked out, by having their blood tested, and to the company doctor Lazarus, Frances Sternhag,shock and surprise it's found out that they've been injected with the synthetic and very deadly amphetamine PDE. Even worse the drug is being shipped into Io hidden in it's food supply with the full knowledge and approval of the satellites general manager Sheppard,Peter Boyle, whom O'Neil as Io security chief is working for!The movie has O'Neil realizing that the deadly drug PDE is being used to get the miners to work twice as hard, and long, as normal in order to get lagging production up is in effect driving the overworked and sleep deprived men to go insane and leading them to take their own lives or killing, in a drug induced frenzy, other workers.Sheppard in an effort to stop O'Neil from preventing the drugs from getting to Io has a number of corporate hit-men sent to the Jupiter moon to put an end to O'Neil's attempt and have him and his honchos arrested and put on trial for drug trafficking.A "High Noon" like final with O'Neil on his own with none of his deputies willing to help him in combating the disembarking hit-men. O'Neil has it out with the corporate killer not inside the sealed and safe working and living quarters of Io but outside in the deadly zero atmosphere conditions where nature, more then anything else, is far more deadly then any of the weaponry that both the hit-men or O'Neil can muster. With all the fighting going on outside inside everyone is too busy getting drunk to even notice whats happening until O'Neil, who with the help of Dr. Lazarus, after dispatching the hit-men confronts Sheppard, who seems to be completely out of it, and puts him to sleep and out cold with a straight right to the kisser.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Against the grungy backdrop of an uncomfortably realistic extraterrestrial future, Sean Connery gives a splendid, low-key performance as the man too honest for his own good, too stubbornly principled to peacefully coexist with what passes for "business as usual." Such fellows are a genuine rarity in any galaxy, are almost invariably inconvenient to the more "pragmatic" powers that be, and are hardly ever rewarded for their efforts. Connery's character is no exception to this, and at the end of the film he appears to be no better off than he was at the beginning. His only consolations are that he is still alive, and has been true to himself. And in a universe such as this, that's probably about the best an honest man can hope for.Underrated and unjustly overlooked, this film is among the best of the cinematic refutations of the Star Trek vision. According to Star Trek, technology will ultimately solve all of the gnarly social problems on earth, so that humankind may sally forth into space with the hand of friendship extended, and none but the best of intentions, like the decent and reasonable creatures we supposedly are. Not that that would be a bad thing, mind you. I love Star Trek. It's a wonderful dream. It's just that all our long, sad history points in the opposite direction. The reality is precisely what we have now, and have always had. Technology does not solve the problems. At best it only rearranges them. At worst it creates new ones. Hence, if and when human beings ever do begin to colonize other worlds, they will do so with the same greed and stupidity they have applied to this one, and Outland, not Star Trek, will be the result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a truly great film (greatness being something that differentiates God from man), but it boasts rock solid storytelling and is the only American science fiction movie to date which has actually managed to play with the notion and visions of foreign planets without sacrificing the material reality of its characters, dialog and plot. In that respect "Outland" is more than just blameless - I believe it should be taught at film universities.The story takes place on a planet in space, but they have managed to shift the interest elsewhere - or rather - keep it where it was originally supposed to be: at the center of the human heart. Do not expect fancy special effects (although this movie does not try to shy away from them), but it all seems so real, dirty and worn, so down-to-earth, that the viewer is not distracted by looks and can concentrate on the important questions the story raises.Will people in the not-so-distant future think up a new moral code? When it comes to hard work and people loosing their sanity over it, isn't it just a question of greediness before profitability turns into exploitation and murder? This story takes place in space, but it is really set on Earth and its ethical scope of interest is in the realm of the eternal collision between right and wrong, evil and good.I do believe that with time "Outland" will be reassessed as on of Sean Connery's finest. It deserves so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprise! This is no science fiction flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's tough to find a place more remote than a moon orbiting the planet Jupiter. Just to get back and forth from Earth, you'll spend a year in suspended animation. Why would anyone want to go? There's a marketable mineral on this moon, and that means big bucks for big business and plenty of jobs for the common folk. But just don't expect posh accommodations. You'll face claustrophobic hallways, caged-in cafeterias, steaming rusty plumbing and deadly silence outside. But people pretty much accept the conditions, work very hard, and life goes on...until some of the workers begin to freak out, then end up dead. Could it be just the stress of such an extreme place to make your living? It seems logical...until the body count continues to rise. And, curiously, the mining company doesn't seem too concerned. Enter Sean Connery as Marshall WT O'Niel. First, it's his job to figure out why someone would want to go outside without a pressure suit. Then he has a hostage crisis to resolve and mop up...pretty soon it becomes clear that there's more going on here than rotten work conditions taking a toll. Strangely, the more the Marshall pokes around, the more aggravated the company becomes. Plus, his men seem pretty inept, almost as though they are working against him. The townspeople are too afraid to help, too. Seems only the local doctor is willing to stand with him, even as killers are summoned to help the company smooth out this little inconvenience to their mining business...Now hold it! Wasn't this supposed to be a science fiction flick? Forget it. This is as classic as a Western gets. (Mining town. Big business. Lots of town folk. Tough Marshall vs Bad Guys coming to kill him -- get it?) O'Neil is Gary Cooper in High Noon. He is Wyatt Earp, with his own female version of Doc Holiday, played so nicely by Frances Sternhagen (with more than a healthy touch of Katherine Hepburn in her wraspy voice, interaction with the Marshall, and abrasive character that will stand up to any man) But make no mistake, as good as Sternhagen is, it's Connery's turf and this Scott is as American here as John Wayne. He won't leave, even when he knows the killers are coming for him. His wife does, though, taking his young son with her. (Just like High Noon). It's really no surprise to see space as the new genre for Westerns, when you consider Gene Roddenberry was able to sell Star Trek to TV execs almost 20 years earlier because it reminded everyone of the Wagontrain-style films and shows of the time. ("Space...the final frontier") And, of course, there's Star Wars, where the cantina on Mos Isley might as well have had cowboys inside the way it was a gunslinger hangout. Connery has been passed-off as an American in The Presidio and The Untouchables, but in both cases as an immigrant who kept his Old World brogue and bravado. Here, Earth is a distant place. O'Niel's son has never even seen it. You never hear where on our planet he and his family are from (But with his wife also having an accent, it's suggested that their home probably isn't the US) But standing as the lone law man, outnumbered and outgunned -- the American themes of the Western are loud and clear. Hey, if we can have Clint Eastwood go to Spain, to make Westerns for Italian director Sergio Leone -- why not stage a classic Western on a moon of Jupiter? The plot is helped along by brilliant use of sound (which was nominated for an Oscar) I don't think I'm giving away anything when I say in one fight, O'Niel's face is being pushed ever closer toward the hot grease of a french-fry fryer, and when you hear the cracking and sizzling, you just clamp your teeth and expect to see burns. There are blasts of his shotgun that seem to go right through you, too. (No lasers here.) If you like Connery, Westerns, or just fun movies, this is a good rent. And for extra credit, pick up High Noon, True Grit, High Plains Drifter, Tombstone, and Pale Rider. You'll reach a spot in each flick where the scenery and location pretty much disappear and what really matters is the clash between good and evil and the sidekicks each team collects along the way. Good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sci-Fi, great Connery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking very trim and fit at 51, Sir Sean's O'Niel recaptures Gary Cooper's incorruptible virtue seen before in the classic, High Noon. The plot runs very parallel to the original: a lone man refusing to compromise his sense of duty in the face of fearful apathy of the very people whom his duty dictates he must protect; his wife has abandoned him and he is alone with but one ally, the antisocial doctor Lazarus, played by the superb Frances Sternhagen. The corrupted but ethical sergeant Montone played by James Sikking of Hill Street Blues fame, is slain leaving O'Niel alone to combat the minions of Peter Boyle's corrupt corporate regime. The ending likewise parallels High Noon with Connery's redemptive return to life. He has gone through purgatory, tasted hell and now, turns toward his reward.This is an interesting film with fantastic effects done in the days before CGI with hazy darkness and moments of brightness on a background colorless despair wrought by apathy and corruption. The storyline is epic and there is a great mix of futuristic technology and contemporary shoot'em up. I remember seeing at the time of its release and enjoyed it as much as my recent viewing on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the Book Marshal (Oscar-Winner:Sean Connery) has a new job is One of the Junipter Moons. The Marshal is assigned to remote colony, when people are mysterious dying from seemingly killing themselves and people going absolutely mad. When the marshal is been asked to look the another way, he refused. The Corporate Boss (Peter Boyle), who is controlling the Colony. He won't let the Marshal goes his way of finding the truth.Directed by Peter Hymas (2010, Carpiron One, Timecop) made a fine suspense-thriller set in Outer Space. The film has solid suspense and otherworldly atmosphere. Connery gives a terrific performance as the Lawman. Frances Sternhagen gives an good performance as a Doctor with a Sense of Humor. James B.Sikking has a supporting role as the Marshal's seemingly devoted deputy. It is only Boyle seems bored in the film, which he has little to do. One of the highlights of the film is the dark, terrific music score by Oscar-Winner:Jerry Goldsmith (The Omen, Alien, Gremlins 1 &amp; 2) and the strong visual effects.DVD has an above average non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan &amp; Scan) and an strong digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

		<shortDescription>Top Notch Sci-Fi Actioner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched OUTLAND and I have to say that it is a great film. In my opinion, practically all of the things in the movie worked very well. The acting was solid, especially from Sean Connery and Peter Boyle, the set pieces were cool and reminded me of ALIEN, there is plenty of action, including a wild foot chase through the mining community, the direction from Peter Hyams was very good, and the film was well written and is never dull or boring. There is also lots of tension built up to the final showdown at the end of the film, which is action packed and exciting. All of these aspects add up to a top notch sci-fi/action film that is highly recommended. 4.5/5</fullReview>

Sean Connery plays the head of the space station police force that is fast loosing a war on drug under pressure from the corporation to let the workers on the station let off steam and to turn a blind eye to recreational drug taking. When a new drug turns up on the station that makes its users psychotic Sean has to take on and battle all to bring sanity back into his life. Excellent.</fullReview>

What's both weird and unique about this picture is that it's somewhat of a realistic sci-fi flick. The film takes place on Jupiter in the future where a company was hired to construct a colony but once Sean Connery's character arrives into the mining place he discovers that there's more then constructing going around.3(***)out of 4(****)starsEND TRANSMISSION</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly, Outland turned out to be an enjoyable sci-fi experience. Sean Connery plays a new cop on a mining colony on Jupiter's second moon. When he discovers a conspiracy that many already know about, he's all alone when he tries to bring the company he works for down. Sean Connery is extemely likable in the film. He's a character worth rooting for and a very serious one at that. Although the movie isn't perfect, it does manage to tell a visually striking story with memorable, colorful characters, and elaborate chase and action sequences that manage to convey a surprising amount of suspense. And Connery, of course, carries the film nicely. An interesting and entertaining display of early '80s sci-fi from a director early in his career, and an actor playing something besides James Bond(though we loved him in that). See this dark, atmospheric, sci-fi thriller if want to be entertained, and on the edge of your seat.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" This movie is strange for the singular reason that it isn't great but you can watch it multiple times and never seem to get tired of it. "I don´t remember if i´m allowed to start my comment by quoting another persons review, but i think the guy who wrote this is absolutely right.And why no matter how many times we see this movie, 6 months past we can´t clearly remember the details like we can in other movies no more ? I must have seen Outland about fifteen times since i first saw it on the theathers when it came out, and after a while i want to go back to it, because i can remember the solid sci-fi atmosphere but i can´t visualize the whole movie clearly in my mind no more. Pretty weird feeling... This isn´t even a great movie, but it has this quality, that makes it almost impossible to turn away from it. For me i guess, it´s that realy believable atmosphere of a possible future, as i don´t believe much in that carpeted spaceship Star Trek look. I can bet that if we ever get to have some colonies in our solar system, they will look very similar (and as depressive), as the ones presented in Outland, wich is a sad fact unfortunely, but makes this movie stand out from all the tons of sci-fi movies.Everyone who sees it once, will remember it for a very long time, and this is because despite all the westen clichés set in space, this is a very original story, maybe not in its idea but in the way it´s presented to the audiences. And it´s a strange movie, because it´s very hard to classify. Despite being now an old movie, it has better visuals and special effects than many new releases and you can totaly forget that this movie is now about 20 years old. And there is not a single computer generated effect on sight. It must be one of those rare movies out there wich can only be classified as pure sci-fi and nothing else. It has action, but it always feels that never reaches for the full potential in what could have been done, so it can´t be classified as an action film also. It has a disturbing and creepy atmosphere sometimes, some gore scenes but it isn´t an horror movie. It has that classic cops plot made and re-made a million times from westerns to modern cop shows, but it´s not any of those kind of movies. What we have here is an ambiguous movie that´ends up being very dificult to classify, and perhaps that´s what makes it special and weird at the same time.Because contrary to Blade Runner for example, this movie doesn´t have a fan base, and i don´t think it can even be classified as a cult movie. Outland belongs to its own category and that´s what makes it special and never forgotten, despite nobody ever remembers anything clearly about it.It´s sci-fi. And a very good sci-fi story despite some minor flaws. Peter Hyams has style and i think he did a great job with this movie. I wish he would go back to this type of "personal" movies and stop acting like a hired hand for Hollywood like it seems nowadays. With all the fast-food crappy so called sci-fi wich is around nowadays, Peter Hyams is the right man to still create a good science fiction movie. I wish he would made more movies like this and like 2010 wich is also excelent. So, if you like pure sci-fi and miss watching a good sci-fi movie, get this one because you won´t be disapointed. It´s an excelent strange movie. A real independent movie inside a major studio, if ever there was one.A brilliant movie, without actualy being great. I know this sounds weird, but Outland is exactely like this. Don´t miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many Sci-fi movies and I would rate this one in my top 10. Outland gives you a sense of the "real" future. Face it folks, I doubt that within the next 200 years we will be traveling to distant stars. We will most likely be confined within our own solar system, and that is where Outland prevails. The idea of a mining colony and the corruption involved with that operation is a good idea, a realistic idea. I would recommend watching Outland for its different point of view of your typical sci-fi movie. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty and brutal sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Hyams' impeccable space Western "Outland" can be seen as one of the key films in a cycle of 'blue collar' science-fiction films which Hollywood put out in the late 70s and early 80s. Coming between the grimy space-trucker feel of "Alien" and sci-fi thrillers such as "Blade Runner" or "The Terminator", "Outland" is effectively a cop movie in space, at once looking backwards to 70s cop films and forwards to films like "Total Recall".The plot is basic, a sort of variance of "High Noon", in which world weary Sean Connery is the one good cop investigating a series of mysterious deaths on the corrupt mining moon of Io. When he treads on the toes of the evil capitalists running the Jupiter Mining Corporation, they hire a group of assassins to take him out and, with everyone around him fleeing, he is left to stand against them alone. There's a brilliant feeling of economy to the narrative and while derivative, it grips like a vice and thunders towards its climax.Visually, the film is absolutely stunning to look at, the humid and grimy mines, stark white med decks, embryonic red sleeping quarters and seedy workers clubs all utterly believable and meticulously detailed. The cinematography and set design are truly wonderful, and the design of everything from the spacesuits to the greenhouses seem to have been brilliantly designed. It is certainly one of the best looking science fiction films of its time.The acting is, likewise, excellent. The ever dependable Connery gives a wonderful portrait of a reluctant hero, his world weariness masking a subtle sense of morality and nobility, while Peter Boyle is suitably sinister as his nemesis, the slimy company boss who cares more about profits than workers. Also worthy of praise is James Sikking who is fantastic as Montone, Connery's morally ambiguous right hand man who finally stops being corrupt, only to come to a sticky end.Overall, the film is far better than it's popular reputation: tense, exciting, entertaining and visually stunning. A sci-fi thriller which isn't afraid to say that even in space, we are still the problem, and an underrated sci-fi gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film but not a great film; lots of questionable sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outland looks great, even after 20 years. But you know right away that there will be problems when you see two spelling errors in the expository titles (another review said three, so I must have missed one): "Principle" instead of "principal" and "marshall" instead of "marshal." Some of the technological effects were fantastically well thought out. The setting is a titanium mining colony on Io in the unspecified future. It's about what you'd expect: Gritty, bleak, and peopled with unsavory losers. (I wonder how it would look if done today, with CGI technology; compare what George Lucas did in the special edition of The Empire Strikes Back.) Along comes a new marshal, O'Neil (Connery), an honest man out of place in a situation where everyone belongs to the mining corporation. He discovers that among the illicit drugs that are---not unexpectedly---circulating among the miners is a powerful stimulant that boosts performance, but after 10-11 months, boom, it's Psycho City: People commit suicide or homicide or other violent acts that get them fragged by the police. Naturally, the heartless, ruthless station manager, Sheppard (Boyle), is at the bottom of it, and the rest of the security force colludes with management. McNeil finds himself in a lonely battle with assassins, aided only by the station medic, Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen in a great role, even if her name is Lazarus but she doesn't look Jewish). He manages to outwit his attackers and presumably establish justice.Problems: Io, it is explicitly stated in the opening scenes, has a gravity of about 1/6 G, but in the station, normal Earth gravity prevails. How? A criminal suspect is suspended in a holding cell labeled "No artificial gravity," so you assume that they have found a way to generate artificial gravity. That is fantastically difficult to do and the rest of the film's "technology" doesn't measure up to that level. Have they also managed to damp out the earthquakes that occur almost constantly on Io owing to the effects of Jupiter's gravity? If they can generate artificial gravity, then why can't they design a mining operation that's mostly automated? That would be simpler than keeping all those people safe in what must be a phenomenally dangerous environment. Almost everybody smokes in the colony; what about the fire hazard and their sealed-tight oxygen ecology? Shouldn't all the smokers be prohibited from smoking and instead get little programmable nicotine implants? If they can generate artificial gravity, why haven't they designed more advanced and safer weapons than the shotguns and rifles we see all over the place? Would they really tolerate projectile weapons where the threat of explosive decompression is ubiquitous? And there is a major blunder when a shotgun is discharged outside the station in the near-vacuum of Io's surface. Sheppard communicates with his superiors, who are somewhere on another planet, it would appear, or at least on a space station, and there is no transmission time lag. Furthermore, O'Neil is able to monitor Sheppard's private messages to management; wouldn't they be encrypted and secure, even from the chief of security? There are monitor cameras everywhere in the colony, which figure prominently in the plot; but there is no audio processing technology to isolate conversations from background noise. In sick bay, there is lots of cool advanced diagnostic technology; but hanging prominently displayed on light boxes behind Dr. Lazarus's workstation are an ordinary chest X-ray and an ordinary skull X-ray! Surely they would be way beyond that primitive imaging modality in "Outland." Dr. Lazarus first calls the illicit drug a "narcotic," and then turns right around and labels it an "amphetamine." The writers didn't check their script; they used "narcotic" in the typical lay meaning of any bad drug, instead of an opiate or opioid, the opposite of a stimulant. No self-respecting MD would call a stimulant a "narcotic." Furthermore, the action of the drug, as it is described in the film, just doesn't jive with the way drugs really work. And those are two stupid assassins who come to knock off O'Neil; they stop and assemble their weapons in full view of security cameras without even bothering to check around for them! The greenhouse looks ridiculous; instead of a huge, automated hydroponics facility, there are a few straggly-looking potted plants on shelves under a dark sky. Ordinary sunlight at that distance would be far too dim to support photosynthesis; you'd need lots of artificial light. (Compare Silent Running.) And unless they are processing oxygen artificially, or extracting it from Ionian minerals, the "greenhouse" would probably be the most heavily guarded and secure part of the station, because it would be the lifeblood of the station, where the food and oxygen would come from. You wouldn't be able just to walk into it. It is possible, I suppose, that there could be a sort of recreational section where people could just stroll. It would still need a lot more light than this place.The climactic "battle" between O'Neil and his attackers is actually fairly suspenseful, but the film ends rather weakly. After risking life and limb to stop the traffic in the illegal stimulant, he seems to content himself with landing a single punch on Sheppard. Why doesn't he arrest him? We understand that since Sheppard has failed to eliminate O'Neil, the corporation will now send someone to rub Sheppard out. O'Neil knows this as well, having eavesdropped on Sheppard's communications. Will O'Neil now let Sheppard be eliminated that way after being so obdurate about honesty and justice? At the end, he clearly plans to leave the colony and travel to the nearby space station, thence to go on to Earth. What about his contract? Can he just blow off the rest of his year tour of duty at the colony? This is never explained. This is a good film, but not a great film; it could have been a whole lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite references to "High Noon", this is a worthy acting platform for the three principal actors !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no question that in plot it comes close to "High Noon" only in space. So? The production values for a non-CGI flick set in space were hard to achieve and it should be remembered for that. Connery did yeoman's work as a Marshal who should have been disinterested and just did his one year assignment (kinda like Vietnam duty). Instead, he is shocked at how arrogant the Mine Superintendent has told Connery to do his job - don't make waves. THAT is different from High Noon. In this case people have been killed by an "imported" synthetic amphetamine-like drug. There is decision of his wife to take his young son away with her to earth which his son has never seen. Apparently, the marshal and his family had led a somewhat nomadic life before arriving at this assignment. The writing and the acting taken together makes everything quite plausible including the confrontations with "management" about using drugs to enhance worker production. THAT is very modern. The gal who plays the doctor who helps Connery is very equally outstanding in her role both in detecting drugs in the dead body of a recently killed worker and in sneaking around to do what she could to help, which courage could have gotten her killed. The gallows humor, the action, the dialog are all very believable. This film is high on the totem for me as a favorite plausible Sci-Fi flick. Seeing is believing and worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Outland" takes us on sci-fi / western journey with Sean Connery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late 1970s and early 1980s were a groundbreaking period for science fiction films. It got kicked off by "Star Wars," which fueled the imaginations of many directors of the time. It also caused studios to trip over each other in their search for the next big space saga. Some of those films were fun like "Battle Beyond the Stars." Others were serious works of art like "Alien," "The Black Hole," and Peter Hyams' "Outland." This was director Hyams' first journey into deep space. He worked in the sci-fi field once before with "Capricorn One," but this 1981 cult classic took him to another worldâ¦ or moon would be more accurate. Some say this was Hyams' practice for the more complex "2010," which he helmed a couple of years later. "Outland" has all the elements of a classic sci-fi film of the 1970s / 1980s era. You have the claustrophobic environment of the space station. All the corridors and living areas are metallic or medical stark white. Everyone wears military / law enforcement ball caps and jumpsuits of some type. Most of the men in the film have big bushy beards and long hair. They also smoke in environments where they shouldn't be. Jerry Goldsmith composed the soundtrack for the film. It resembles the score of "Alien" to an extent. There's a dash of "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" in it as well. I can't say the music is as memorable as either one of those, but it gets the job done. The movie is very much a sci-fi version of the classic western stand-off and 1970s drug smuggling drama. Imagine "High Noon" mashed together with "Serpico" but on a moon of Jupiter. One of its most effective elements is the digital clock countdown which shows when the ship is arriving that holds the assassins sent to kill O'Niel. It's nerve-wracking to watch Connery's character preparing for his lone stand against corruption. The practical and front projection special effects accurately reflect the time period the movie was made in. We get prosthetic heads blowing up, bodies bursting in space, and other visual atrocities. It's nice to see some effects reminiscent of "Alien," "Scanners," and "The Thing" versus all the CGI we're fed today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a great Sci-Fi film and I usually don't get the chance to say that often. This has a great cast for a movie that to me only had one familiar face Sean Connery. It also includes Frances Sternhagan from Misery, some of you might know her form other movies too, like The Mist. The reason why I liked this movie is because, unlike most Sci-Fi movies , this has a great plot and the thrill factor. The story is about a mining operation, that takes place on one of Jupiture moons,IO. The beginning of the movie a laborer starts to freak out and screams spiders get them off. The co-workers think he's just playing around and tell him to get back to work. He freaks out so much he rips his suit open and is exposed to zero atmosphere, eventually killing him. It happens again and O'Neil- Connery starts to investigate what is causing people to lose it. With the help of the head doctor Sternhagan. They conclude that the workers are taking a drug, Poly Deeuoluthamol, it makes the laborers do 14 hrs of work in 6 hrs and eventually causing them to be psychotic. Once the General Manager gets wind of what O'Neil is doing, he puts a price on O'Neils head. The GM calls for 2 assassins to take care of Marshal O'Neil and with someone on the inside, it will be hard for O'Neil to find any help from his officers or anybody else to do what's right. With the help of Sterhagan Marshal O'Neil fights a battle he will win and eventually give GM Shappard what's coming to him in the end. This film came out in 1981, I never saw it at the theater, but I did on Sci-Fi 3 years ago. It was so awesome I purchased the DVD and would recommend seeing it to any1, even if Sci-Fi isn't your thing you will love this film and your views about Sci-Fi films will probably change.Kris L.

		<fullReview>Or more like unwatched by many. And it's a shame and a fact that hopefully will get changed, when people watch Moon and see that Duncan Jones was inspired by a few movies to do his own little sci-fi piece. And as you can guess, Outland was one of those movies. Actually considering that Sean Connery is the lead here, it does surprise me, that this movie is not better known.The story is tension filled and can be compared with some similar threads or story lines in other movies. In other words, you are not getting something completely new here. But it is done very well and though comparisons (espcially with High Noon) are at hand, this holds it's own weight. Of course there are a few flaws (sometimes it's hard to connect to Connery's character, who could have been more layered perhaps), but you won't do anything wrong watching this movie.</fullReview>

The atmosphere is great, and the question raised is - would you have the courage to go against the apathetic mob, or would you join them and do nothing? - a question from the beginning of time that will always be relevant.

		<fullReview>The look and sets of this film reminded me a lot of the Alien films and that's a good thing. The sets look realistically worn and lived in, in a time when CGI dominates the screen which in most cases means everything looks neat and clean and completely unrealistic, it's nice to see hard work going into making these sets look so good. I am also reminded of Alien in it's darkness, both in it's surroundings and it's characters, it brings to light a much darker vision of humanities possible future. I was shocked that I had not even heard of this film until recently, I think this is one of Sean Connery's finest performances and a very underrated film. The characters feel so real, none of them are cut and dry good or bad guys but instead they are people trying to survive within their circumstance. The last third of the film really rises the bar in the intensity department adding a very high amount of tension which is also very reminiscent of the Alien series. All and all a really well done film that deserves way more acclaim and attention then it received.</fullReview>

I would also on a side note say that this is about the worst video quality of a DVD that I can remember seeing. It looks like a direct transfer from a video that was transfered from a film stock used in about a thousand drive-in movie screenings. When I started watching this film for the first time I couldn't believe that this film never really found an audience with Sci-fi fans. The set-up was great! Connery was great as the hard headed Irish bull, a sort of futurized imagining of the character he played in "The Untouchables". What happens to this film is the screenwriter wrote himself into a corner. For instance the introduction of his only ally on the ship, the feisty old Frances ?? Forgot her name. Now the story is more or less compelled to bring her back and have her become conscripted in his struggle, which really plays silly on the screen with an old lady running around the sets with the dramatic showdown music blaring. And even worse this leads to the (even suckier) obligatory ending with Connery packing to go and the Old Lady Dr. coming in to say "hey we did it " or something or another just as cliché. Where this film fails to be a re-imagining of "High Noon" that it could have been, is in its failure in logic. In "High Noon" Gary Cooper does go around town trying to get help. Everyone knows the score. What he finds is that no one wants to confront the killers who are after him, and they want Cooper to leave town. Cooper can't do it. In "Outland" no one but the Connery, The Dr. and Peter Boyle's character know that the drugs being smuggled in are causing the psychotic break-downs. Connery for some unknown reason never shares this with anyone. Everyone on the ship knows he is causing trouble for the smugglers, and no one seems inclined to get involved. The obvious point here is does anyone? What is Connery going to do handcuff Boyle and take him all the way back to Earth? The only possible way this movie could have worked the way it was set-up is if Connery had gone to the workers and explained to them how they were being exploited. They might not have licked the idea of the Company selling them speed to increase production knowing full well that this drug causes a psychotic episode about 10 months into their tour. You would think some of them might have figured this out on their own but from the script no one did. Because of all this the movie which is taunt and well acted in the first half of the film; Boyle especially does a nice job of playing the manager. He doesn't go over the top at all as many others would have done. In fact he mostly just makes sense. One bit of illogicalness is his conversations with the company. With the company taking to him as though he had screwed up and better fix it. I am not sure but didn't they send Connery to him? wasn't it really their screw up not reading his resume more carefully? This movie dissolved into all the worst movie clichés in the end. It is a great missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unique movie leaves big question and satisfied customers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I'll say this movie leaves satisfied customers. I have yet to meet anyone who didn't really enjoy this movie. It is a gem. The plot is, as some have said, HIGH NOON in outer space, but there's more to it. It is probably as akin to HIGH NOON as OPEN RANGE is to SHANE. A sheriff in a mining colony (yes, that's right, partner, there's a sheriff is this here town, I mean space station!) begins his tour of duty trying to solve a rash of suicides. He finds something very wrong, and is up against a very wealthy syndicate. But the question this movie leaves you is the reason why he really goes all out. As he begins his tour of duty, the space station's general manager rubs him the wrong way with one very threatening statement. It's that statement that provokes the sheriff. And ultimately, one wonders whether that one moment, that one unwarranted, unwise statement was the very thing that served as the general manager's big trouble with the sheriff later on. Good characters, good acting, good action, good sets, good filming, good...I could go on and on. Good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Connery is back in action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After departing from the Eon-produced Bond series in 1971, Sean Connery acted in a series of highly successful films - The Man Who Would Be King, The Wind and the Lion, Robin and Marian are three key titles. Outland fell into the category of disappointments. Although Connery starred, the film has a dark gritty garish edge that plays against Connery's animal magnetism and larger-than-life screen presence. Another reviewer here has said that no one had heard from Connery for a few years before this film's release. In 1979, Sean Connery starred in the highly successful The Great Train Robbery and the highly-promoted (but less successful) films Meteor and Cuba. Connery was anything but missing in action during those years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Connery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I heard of the movie "Outland" was on a Internet message board. I thought to myself "A sci-fi movie, with Sean Connery? hmm...how good can this be?" so I scoured the local VHS graveyards for this little known "Outland" movie. Finally, I find it! Success! So I go home, pop it in the VCR, and hit play. the movie starts and I think"hmmm...not bad so far." So im watching, and the worker breaks the seal of his suit, and explodes. so far IM thinking that this is classic sci-fi. After the movie was over, I was shocked at how well Connery pulled off the sci-fi role. It was a classic movie, with classic story. I finally got it on DVD, and could give my VHS to a friend, so he too could experience the "IM gonna kick your nasty @$$ all over this room" Sean Connery lines in outland. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Connery, or SCI-FI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Because This is the way Space should be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies you don't mind seeing over and over again. They are few and far between. The ones that depict life in outer space on the terms that it should be faced with. Is there gravity, can you fire a gun, what happens when you get a hole in your space suit? 2001, 2010, OUTLAND, just to name a few.I believe this film to be (as do others) a retelling of the cinema classic "High Noon". The most suspenseful fact in the movie is that that damn clock keeps counting down to the dreaded inevitability, of a showdown at a pre-arranged time. We all know it's coming and we can't do anything about it. Tick Tick Tick.Connery does an adequate job as the stalwart Marshall, meeting the bad guys in a showdown, and has a few tricks up his sleave. But, in a fantastic supporting role is Frances Sternhagen as the buddy doctor that doesn't want you to know she cares.No matter how many times you see this flick, even though it is already over twenty years old, you tend to get sucked in. I do, anyway. Highly recommended, for at least one viewing. Then see for yourself. Try it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad, actually pretty good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations when I saw this, because first off, I am a fan of Sean Connery, and I am a fan of director Peter Hyams. Well, my expectations weren't that off, but they were off by a little. I enjoyed the movie as much as a person with a sinus cold could. Maybe that is the reason I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped. I will watch it again when i get better. Now to get to the movie. I was suprised to see how young Peter Boyle is in the movie. Many of you know him as Frank, Ray's father, in Everybody Loves Raymond. He has really aged in 20 years, but then again, so has Connery. Now most of the movie was great, sure the effects are outdated, but that is what you expect for an older movie. The acting was decent. The plot was pretty good, but slow towards the middle. Some parts that were supposed to be action packed were slow, but to sum it up. The movie is pretty good. See it if you are a connery fan or a fan of sci-fi/ western. 8.0/10 not too bad!</fullReview>

The acting is quite good (Connery is excellent) and the characters engaging. You'll find yourself rooting for the cranky doctor, the marshal's only friend. A good watch for any sci-fi fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems very unlikely that titanium could be profitably mined &amp; exported to Earth, or even elsewhere in the Solar system, from a place as deep in Jupiter's gravity well as Io, unless the company's use of artificial gravity extends to antigravity. Even so, there's plenty of titanium right here on Earth, ready to be mined.Additionally, no acknowledgment was made of the very dangerous radiation conditions obtaining at Io's distance from Jupiter.Lastly, photoelectric cells, unless they were vastly improved over current models, would do little good for power generation at Jupiter's distance from the Sun. Also, even if they were used, high-voltage conditions (which endangered O'Neil &amp; co.) would not exist at the receiving surfaces of the cells.If you want to make a science-fiction movie, Mr. Hyams, remember that word "science." Otherwise, call it fantasy, where anything goes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is much better than anyone gave it credit for, but is often forgotten.It was only possible due to an odd convergence of events. Science Fiction was popular in the early 1980's, to the point where anyone could shop a concept and not get laughed out the door. Sean Connery was trying to establish a dramatic identity that didn't involve James Bond. While such a combination could have lead to some real cheese in other hands, here it was handled with a lot of class.The plot is that Connery plays a law officer at a corporate colony on the Jovian moon of Io, who discovers a plot to give lethal drugs to workers to make them more productive. He discovers the conspiracy leads right up to management, but still does the right thing anyway, putting him in a lethal confrontation with two paid assassins. The comparisons to "High Noon" are obvious, but the scenes still hold up.Also, give props to Frances Sternhagen, as the colony's doctor. Most movies would have given the role to a young actress and put her in bed with Connery. This role was played by a mature woman (She and Connery were the same age at the time, 51) and played the role with grace, depth and not just the life support system for a pair of breasts.(further props to Frances- she's 80 years old and STILL working! Most recently as Kyra Sedwich's mother on "The Closer".) A couple things look truly dated today. Computers with monochrome text and simple commands. Hey, who knew? Other than that, the movie looks great and really holds up.</fullReview>

We screamed out for the less complicated sci-fi films of lore, and our cries brought the brilliant, Moon, and soon a remake of this film.Beautiful in it's simplicity, this "Sci-Fi Western" is a simple play with simple characters not too good, not too bad. Of course we have henchmen and heroes. And of course Sean Connery showing the stoic mastery of a true Scot, while literally, blowing up the bad guys.Come for the story, stay for the exploding heads. This is an hour and 38 minutes of fun, you will not leave the theater enriched, but you will certainly be entertained, and taken at face value, this film is a true work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good Connery film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like Sean Connery, and you like him kicking ass you'll like this film. Although the film itself may not be the cream of hollywood but the sheer stage presence of Connery pulls it up several levels. The storyline of a cop wanting to see if he's bigger than a corrupt system maybe a fairly old clichéd story. But this film pulls it off very well with a fresh approach on the moon of IO. I'll admit that I do love industrial and futuristic sets and story lines, the kind of sets that only the 80s could achieve. Now that I think about it I never considered it was on a set or it wasn't real. Probably because the movie is always moving with either action and pretty entertaining dialogue, especially between Connery and the station manager (who is perfectly smarmy and arrogant). If you love the 80s films and Connery- watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**DEFINITE SPOILERS** In the future there's a mining colony on Io--the third moon of Jupiter. Men sign up for a year of duty. For some reason men are suddenly going crazy and killing themselves--or others. The new marshal O'Neil (Sean Connery) wants to find out why but is blocked at every turn. It turns out the head of the colony (Peter Boyle) is giving men amphetamines to make them work harder--but it also drives them crazy eventually.This movie is well-made and never really dull. The sets are impressive, there's plenty of action and some good special effects. Also the decor of the bar in the colony is--interesting. It shows holograms (I think) of a man and a woman and two woman having sex! The acting is good by Connery, Francis Sternhagen and James B. Sikking. It does turn into "High Noon" at the end complete with the bad guys coming in on the next shuttle, O'Neil being on his own (also he's called marshal all through the movie), and even has a clock ticking down the hours, minutes and seconds before they arrive. Seriously! Still it works.However there are some problems. The script ultimately makes no sense. The workers know they're being drugged and killing themselves-- but seem to have no problem with that at all. Also when the killers are tracking down Connery one of them (in a greenhouse) shoots a hole in a wall which singlehandedly destroys the greenhouse and himself along with it! Are trained killers really that stupid? And didn't the corporation who assigned O'Neil to that colony consider that O'Neil might have a problem with the drug abuse? These contradictions don't destroy the movie--it just lessens the impact. It's worth seeing--just don't think about it too hard. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is film seems to be somewhat forgotten compared to other Science fiction of the time. I expect that is because there are no big bad aliens or inter-galactic wars going on, this is a far more human story than that type of film.Sean Connery plays Marshal O'Niel who has recently arrived at a mining colony on the Jovian moon Io. After a couple of apparent suicides he goes to the doctor and learns that the suicide rate has increased dramatically in the previous year. He soon learns that the reason for the increase is a drug that the workers are taking which is also enabling them to be far more productive. When he finds and destroys the drugs a couple of hit men are sent on the next shuttle to kill him and he discovers that the doctor is his only ally as everybody else prefers to look the other way for a quiet life.While this is science fiction set on Io it could almost be set in any remote community, the mining settlement feels claustrophobic and has a dark and grimy look not unlike that of the Alien films. The acting is good and understated making the characters seem real. The marshal isn't seen as heroic, he is just a good man trying to do the right thing. A few things haven't dated too well, the exploding head special effect doesn't look to good and the ancient computers seem very dated although they do add to the grungy look of the place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Between 1981 and 1985, The Ladd Company released a number of notable movies, among them BLADE RUNNER, POLICE ACADEMY and THE RIGHT STUFF. One of the first offerings was Peter Hyams' OUTLAND, a reworking of HIGH NOON in outer space.Sean Connery plays a Federal Marshal assigned to a mining colony on one of Jupiter's moons and discovers suicidal tendencies amongst the workers. His cause is not helped by the chief shop steward, Sheppard (Peter Boyle), who welcomes every new lawman with equal contempt. He also suffers a personal crisis when his wife and child decide to quit the colony and get the first shuttle back to Earth for a taste of the real life.When another suicide involving a worker who goes into an airlock without his pressure suit occurs, Connery seeks the resident doctor (played by Frances Sternhagen in excellent form) who reveals that the problem stems from an illegal steroid, polydi-chloric euphemal, causing increased productivity for less rest. This leads Connery to a conflict with Sheppard.....With a similar style and look to ALIEN, OUTLAND may not have the shocks or scares of that film, but thanks to Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score and workmanlike performances from all concerned helping to lend a great air of credibility to the film, OUTLAND is another great sci-fi adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was probably the best Sean Connery movie ever made, and I would rank it as one of the top picks of the SF genre. Yes, yes, it was a western in space, but who cares? The bottom line is, everyone puts in an amazing performance, and the direction was just superb. The plot, involving several violent deaths and leading up to a couple of hired assassins coming to take out our protagonist, seems almost trivial in comparison to the kinds of outrageous plots we see in modern 'sci-fi' efforts, and many of the events that take place are, in retrospect, entirely predictable, yet they come as a surprise anyway, and a seemingly pathetic climax nonetheless creates unbearable tension as we await it; right now, you might not think it as exciting as a whole army of assassins coming to get him, but when you see what happens, I guarantee you, you'll be blown away.In fact, I have only two gripes. One is the child actor (god, can't they get child actors who can ACT), and the other is the fact that the station was on Io. Nit-pickers may grumble about the economic infeasability of such a mining operation; I grumble about the physical infeasability. Why can't these people understand that it is NOT POSSIBLE to build a space station on Io! The entire planet is a lake of boiling sulphur, with incessant earthquakes and new volcanoes erupting every minute! A space colony wouldn't last twenty days on it's surface, and besides that, the surface is ENTIRELY composed of sulphur! There isn't an ounce of titanium there!Other than that, though, an amazing film. A real must-see for any science fiction fan.</fullReview>

While High Noon is one of the most overrated movies in the history of cinema, with a slow story, unlikable main character (Gary Cooper is a bore) annoying background sound, and a stupid ending, Outland is a fast paced movie and has Sean Connery who is much more likable and better actor. The score by J. Goldsmith is involving and the supporting actors do much better job here than in High Noon.The only aspect in which High Noon is better that Outland is the presence of Grace Kelly.People should put aside biases against science fiction an enjoy Outland for what it is: a good action movie.Too bad the science is not quite right in Outland.

Should be "Principal".* * * Spoiler * * * The drug dealer in detention is in a weightless environment surrounded by normal gravity. That's an impossibility unless the film was dealing with anti-gravity, which was not.During the space-suit fight you can see the naked wrists of the actors between the gauntlets and the pressure suit, whereas a small puncture in a suit would send a man exploding. * * * end spoiler * * * The acting, even Connery, is absolutely substandard and the plot completely devoid of suspense. I'm giving it a five out of pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Outland" is such a strange name for a movie! I guess a strange name is appropriate for a strange movie. I thought the film was ok, not bad, but not great either. The story was fairly interesting and had some cool things to it, but overall, it was just a mediocre movie. The film was a little slow, especially near the end.Sean Connery did a good job in his role, as did Peter Boyle. The whole cast was good.I will say though that the sets were pretty impressive and what little special effects were in the film were done pretty well.Overall, I would only recommend this movie to someone that really likes science fiction movies, or is a huge fan of Sean Connery. Otherwise, you may want to pass on this one. I hope you enjoy the film. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Pity poor Sean. He never really was a first rate actor -- more a speech technician -- but here he steeps in cheese. The plot: a showdown. The science fiction part: well, there's a spaceship I guess, but it looks a lot like any factory and no detail differs from `real' life (including gravity!). This is every bit as bad as `Battlefield Earth.'Cat's eye comments follow:This is a film about mice used in the manufacture of polydichloric euthynol. These mice are telepathic and can manipulate situations to ensure that they get the precursers, which incidentally is the source of their omniscience. For amusement, they decide to introduce risk into their own situation by motivating a loser `sheriff' at one base to disrupt consumption of the drug. We enter the story with his unexpected motivation and follow the mousey episode that threatens the trade.Because the mice are always in command, there is no real threat. Every move is predictable and each player acts just as the puppets they are. After this episode, consumption of the drug returns to normal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a little like a roll of wallpaper; you've seen it in the shops, you want it on your wall, and then, when you unravel it you stick it to the wall and then you find that, by mistake, you went to the wrong shop and bought 20 metres of bacon! Oh no, bacon walls! What will your friends think? And then, to cap it all off, Sean Connery shows up and makes a hole in your space-head-cover and your head explodes. That's basically what this film is like.It opens on Io, one of Jupiter's moons, without bacon walls. Here there is a space station and Sean Connery runs around a lot, down the SAME CORRIDOR about 3000 times. Connery is playing a kind of space-based-face-mace Sergeant called Lammy Comatose. FOR SOME REASON loads of people are dying, everyone's taking drugs (even though they're in space!!) and a bad guy's going to show up. Connery chases a guy through a kitchen, and is almost killed. Then Connery meets the really bad guy for a final showdown. Then the credits roll, and at precisely this point you find yourself reaching for the fast-forward button looking for the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really surprised by the comments here saying that this film is great. This movie is simply a disaster! Comparison with "High Noon", which is a great movie, does not help to make "Outland" a good film. The film is obvious from the beginning to the end. And it is not a science-fiction movie, since there is no trace of interesting and visionary science there. Just compare with classics like "2001" or "Blade Runner". Sometimes the actor's performance can save a film, but this is not the case here. The actors perform very badly. Sean Connery was not convincing. This movie certainly didn't help his career.A word about the special/visual effects, which are essential in most science-fiction movies: they are extremely bad, even for 1981. Therefore, there is nothing to be saved in this film. It's a complete waste of time.</fullReview>
