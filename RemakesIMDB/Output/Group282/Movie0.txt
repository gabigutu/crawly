		<shortDescription>Delightful comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it was first released in 1948. Now 50 years later I watch it again. The comedy holds up remarkably well. Say what you like about the Hollywood studios of the forties but they could turn out these pleasant entertainments seemingly without effort. The perils of buying and building a house have not changed (although the prices certainly have!)It's a delight to watch three seasoned professionals (Grant,Loy and Douglas)play against each other so well. All the minor characters are well cast. The touches of sentiment are never over done. A movie well worth seeing more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary Grant at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a fantastic showcase for Grant's bewildered man of America, and he always did that so well. The Blandings, a 'typical New York family, on about 15,000 a year', decide to leave their four room apartment in the city and buy a 'dream house' in rural Connecticut.Of course, this being a comedy, you know it won't go smoothly (you get a good clue as well from Melvyn Douglas' laconic narration here and there, as the Blandings' long-suffering lawyer, and Mrs B's high school sweetheart). First the picturesque little home is a wreck, then they start to plan a substitute (the scene where Mr and Mrs B plan what rooms their new house will have is classic), then everything that can go wrong goes wrong ... on top of this, Grant's harrassed advertising executive has to find a slogan for the bete noire of his company, Wham! ham.My particular favourite scenes involve Myrna Loy, perfect as Mrs B, instructing which colours of paint each room will have; and a little room at the top of the house which regularly traps Grant inside. A highly recommended RKO goodie, this film. Hugely enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comic classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has ever embarked on a construction project, from a tree-house to a skyscraper, will identify with the beleaguered Mr. Blandings. His simple vision of an idyllic life in the suburbs encounters the harsh reality of recalcitrant geology, feuding contractors, exploding costs, and other complications -- all to hilarious effect. The script has a perfect ear, the director's timing is impeccable, and the sophisticated style of the stars gives the entire production a polished sheen. Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas are all brilliant, but this is much more than a star vehicle. It's one of the best sophisticated comedies Hollywood ever committed to celluloid. And even 60 years later, the story is all too true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor Mr. Blanding(Cary Grant). All he wants is the perfect house. As we find out from this lighthearted romp, getting the perfect house isn't without a lot of headaches and money spent. This film has quite a many funny moments. What I liked best was the wit of the dialogue, terrific chemistry between Myrna Loy and Grant, and the pure delight of watching Grant perfect what a great comic spirit he had. Melvyn Douglas was fun as Blanding's lawyer friend,Bill. The film has the famous funny scene where Loy is showing a painter what colors she wants each room painted in(folks, she has an unusual peculiar style of speach when it comes to her color). It has other funny bits including Grant discussing the advertising life with his daughters who are very impressioned by a teacher at school. It's core humor comes from the painstaking process of getting the home built. The specifications of this process are amusing. The film is sweet and Grant has such a breezy skill with the humor. He is a delight to watch as is the wonderful Loy. An overall worthwhile experience. ****1/2/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A house in Connecticut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences. The worst one is the lack of closet space! Some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full!Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a great comedy writing team from that era, saw the potential in Eric Hodgins novel, whose hero, Jim Blandings, can't stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife Muriel, and two daughters, must share.Jim Blandings, a Madison Ave. executive, has had it! When he sees an ad for Connecticut living, he decides to take a look. Obviously, a first time owner, Jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent. This is only the beginning of his problems.Whatever could be wrong, goes wrong. The architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn't work for the new house, after the original one is razed. As one problem leads to another, more money is necessary, and whatever was going to be the original cost, ends up in an inflated price that Jim could not really afford.The film is fun because of the three principals in it. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of Jim Blandings. Myrna Loy, was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, an old boyfriend of Myrna, turned lawyer for the Blandings, is suave and debonair, the way Melvin Douglas portrayed him. One of the Blandings girls, Joan, is played by Sharyn Moffett, who bore an uncanny resemblance to Eva Marie Saint. The great Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but doesn't have much to do.The film is lovingly photographed by James Wong Howe, who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better. The direction of H.C. Potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Comedy, &amp; Not Without Some Commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty good comedy, with several good screwball-type sequences, and yet its silliness also contains some commentary, sometimes pointed, and much of it still pertinent. Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are well-suited to this kind of material, and the script provides good dialogue and some amusing situations for them and the rest of the cast to work with.This is certainly of particular interest to anyone who has ever faced either the kind of home-buying experience that the Blandings family goes through, or one of the many other similar experiences that life offers. The whole picture of having to deal with a bewildering assortment of contractors, workmen, lawyers, and who knows what else, is a very familiar feature of modern life, even for those who do not buy their own homes. The movie helps to point out some of the basic absurdities all of this, while providing some good humor.The two sub-plots - the one with Melvyn Douglas and the other with Grant looking for the new slogan - are worked in rather resourcefully, so as to parallel some of the basic themes of the main story about the house, while also providing comic complications in the main plot.Grant has the knack of making the wildest situations seem believable at the time, and even somewhat sophisticated. Loy's charm and elegance make her a very good complement to Grant's character. It's a good combination overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You really couldn't go wrong with Grant and Loy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film opens with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) telling a story about how his best friend--make that client--Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are tightly packed into a small New York apartment, with not enough closet space and way too few bathrooms. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate the apartment, advertising exec Jim falls in love with (or falls for!) an ad for a house. Once he's purchased the house, bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of Jim's 'dream house' goes wrong.One of three collaborations between Grant and Loy, this is a charming little comedy--not very taxing, with no real great message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. The laughs are there right from the start, when the alarm clock goes off and Jim tries to shut it off, only to be thwarted at every turn by Muriel. The timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros, and that's just what Grant and Loy give us: polished performances, simple chemistry, and a lot of fun. Myrna Loy is in a pretty thankless role (it's evident that Grant's character Jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting, and Grant, as always, pulls both off with remarkable aplomb), but she gives Muriel a colour, life and bite that only Myrna Loy can give a character. Melvyn Douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well, never hitting a single wrong note.One of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when Bill gets himself locked in the 'store room', and Jim goes to 'save' him... only to get everyone trapped inside! Every little problem that pops up for the Blandings renovation project--including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for 'Wham'--seems to bring together everything that *could* go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Post World War 2 America. Dwight is about to take office. The typical American middle class family living together in downtown city USA. Their home is an apartment, boxed in like cattle. The opening of the movie is without sound. That is, no one needs to talk. Cary Grant is introduced with physical comedy. The everyday ordeal of having to clean up, shower, shave, is a living hell. Before a single word is spoken, you begin to feel for Cary Grant and you know exactly how he feels. By the second scene, he is ready to move up and out of the big city for rural country USA. One problem after another, The Blandings are faced with the choices they have made. Their dream house falls apart and needs to be built up one brick at a time. Their bank account, marriage, family, their entire life is on the line as they attempt to live out their dream of owning the perfect house. Much like the money pit, it is a coming of age for the middle age. A great comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Building the American Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Manhattan, the American middle class Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two teenage daughters in a four bedroom and one bathroom only leased apartment. Jim works in an advertising agency raising US$ 15,000.00 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to the lack of space. When he sees an advertisement of a huge house for sale in the country of Connecticut for an affordable price, he drives with his wife and the real estate agent and decides to buy the old house without any technical advice. His best friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) sends an acquaintance engineer to inspect the house, and the man tells that he should put down the house and build another one. Jim checks the information with other engineers and all of them condemn the place and sooner he finds that he bought a "money pit" instead of a dream house."Mr. Blandings Builds his Own House" is an extremely funny comedy, with witty lines and top-notch screenplay. Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man moved by the impulse of accomplishing with the American Dream of owning a huge house that finds that made bad choice, while losing his touch in his work and feeling jealous of his friend. In 1986, Tom Hanks worked in a very funny movie visibly inspired in this delightful classic, "The Money Pit". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Lar, Meu Tormento" ("Home, My Torment")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film! The plot is somewhat lacking, but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference. This is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please. As a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining; and with major stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas... how could you go wrong? Comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued, and is very difficult to imitate. A good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this film: The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments. Achieving true comedic dialog is an art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>- Having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of New York City, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) finds a property in the country for his wife and children. He's hoping to find the simple life. But, building a house proves to be anything but simple. As the headaches and the bills start piling up, so do the laughs. Will Mr. Blanding's ever get his dream house? - What makes this movie so special is the three main actors - Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas. Any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is special. Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role. He is so good at playing the put upon husband. Loy is a always a joy to watch. The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are near perfect. And Douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, a particular favorite of mine.- The movie is definitely a product of its time. I get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two-story, three bedroom, four bathroom house on $15,000 income a year. Throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live-in maid and it becomes almost fanciful.- However, for anyone who has bought or built a house, many of the situations and predicaments the Blanding's find themselves in are easily relatable to today. And that's where the comedy comes in. How many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the whole "wife in love with best friend" subplot. It's really not necessary to the plot and feels out-of-place and very uncomfortable as presented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If you ain't eating WHAM, you ain't eating ham!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the nice side benefits of watching an older movie is to recall how things were. Mr Blandings (Cary Grant) was a successful advertising man in NYC and making $15,000 a year. Which was a very nice salary in 1948, the year I turned 3. Today that would be closer to a good monthly salary. Anyway, he, his wife, and two daughters live in a modest home in the City, but there never seems to be enough room for storage, or for everyone to get bathroom time each morning. So he latches upon this bright idea to buy a cheap fixer-upper in rural Connecticut, just a short train ride to Manhattan. Cary Grant is at his best here, as is Myrna Loy as his faithful wife. In black and white, this would have been a gorgeous movie in color. Still, a very good movie, even by current standards.SPOILERS are contained in the following, tread cautiously. So he buys the property and has the house inspected (aren't you supposed to do that first??)several times, and each tells him the same thing, "Tear it down." No structural integrity. So he does and hires a builder to make him a $10,000 house. Problem is, as he and his wife keep demanding changes to the plans, more room here, a bathroom for each person, then the cost escalates. Not to mention the well that must be dug, the demineralizer needed, all of which brings the final structure to much more than they intended. Plus, when they had to vacate their home, the new one wasn't quite ready yet, they moved in without some windows, and the painter was varnishing the living room floor. Still, eventually everything works out, but Blandings is in danger of losing his job if he can't meet the deadline for a slogan for their big customer, WHAM hams. The day of his deadline, when Blandings complained about more ham for breakfast, their black maid says, "If you ain't eating WHAM, you ain't eating ham!" Presto! he found his slogan, and true to the times her reward was "give her a $10 raise."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over the top gags and watered down comic suspense--but hey, Loy and Grant are essentials.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948)The year is 1948. Lots of returning G.I.s are struggling to adjust to post-War America and Hollywood responded with film noir. But the other side to that scene is about those who made it through the war intact, or who returned and started a family and got a job and were ready for the American Dream.Enter the Blandings family and the beginning of the rush to suburbia. The famous Levittown middle class housing project got going full steam in 1948. Bedrooms for the kids, a lawn of your own, and, alas, a long commute were going to be the new reality.The comic first few minutes (with a sarcastic voice-over) show New York to be crazed mayhem, which sets you up for the last few minutes showing a much less sarcastic mayhem in Connecticut. Historic preservation is years away for most Americans, so the old house and its lovely stone foundations inspire only the intoned, "Tear it down." And the dream house, on the salary of this not so unbland rich advertising executive (Cary Grant), goes up. His wife, also not completely bland, played by Myrna Loy, manages to make her spoiled greed cute, if unreasonable to both her husband and to us. Throw in a very contrived conflict of an old love interest of hers, and you have the gist of it all.As much as I love both Loy and Grant very much, and was glad to see this again, the writing and editing and filming struck me as clunky and uninspired. It's funny at times, for sure, but with lots of groans or lulls between. I know this is a matter of taste, and I see a lot of people give this movie high marks, and I don't blame them. But just a heads up on it. I just watched some earlier Grant screwballs (Philadelphia Story, His Girl Friday) and saw Loy in the Thin Man series, and maybe Mr. Blandings is just thin going by comparison. Director H.C. (Henry, not Harry) Potter was unknown then as now, and you get a feeling another director, a Cukor or a Hawks, might have pulled of a different feeling with the same parts. The basic story was timely then and might make sense to anyone now who has tried to rehab an old house or build a new one. That was the hook for me, and I felt for Mr. Blandings. However, the little tensions that make for comic, not tragic, possibility are diffused almost as soon as they begin. You'll see this most in the hinted at jealousy Mr. Blandings has for the sidekick adviser played by Melvyn Douglas. When Blandings suspects some foulplay with his wife you see Grant's face come alive, and then a minute later Mrs. Blandings (Loy) has convinced him it's not true. All is well. Back to drab wisecracks and stereotyped construction workers. This is not really a screwball comedy so much as a screwy one, silly and restrained in some wrong places. Character actors are, normally, supposed to have character, and too often little bit parts that have potential come out all permanent press, from Douglas to the secretary in Mr. Blandings's office. The African-American maid is a wonderful, lively actress and brief gust of fresh air, but she is also typecast. This isn't so rare to mention in this period, but the plot brings attention to it because she invents the very phrase that Mr. Blandings is being paid big bucks to come up with, and Blandings uses it. What does she get? A ten dollar raise.Social justice, not. Watch this movie for purely frivolous entertainment, which it can be at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless comedy that any homeowner can chuckle at</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the prices have gone up a lot, and some of the details have become dated, any homeowner who's struggled with problems of homeownership should get a lot of chuckles out of this movie. I know I did.Mr. Blandings, a New York ad executive, decides to move his family to the Connecticut suburbs and build himself a nice house there. He gets into one hilarious jam after another, from mortgages to lawsuits to construction difficulties, as the costs and schedule of the construction keep escalating out of control. I thought that the funniest scenes were where Blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water. They dig down hundreds of feet, but never find water. Yet only a short distance away, a few days later, the basement of his house-to-be floods!Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give believable performances as the harried Blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined, and Melvyn Douglas is even better as Blanding's lawyer and family friend.The only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she's causing, and there's a black maid (horrors!). So don't watch this movie through the social lens of 2003, and you'll enjoy it all the more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pitfalls of Building Your Dream House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built (or bought) to your specifications, it is not the first, nor the last. In 1940 Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were the leads in the film version of the comedy GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. And about fifteen years ago Shelly Long and Tom Hanks had the lead in THE MONEY PIT. The former was about moving into an 18th Century country house that...err, needs work. The latter was about building your dream house - in the late 1980s. Although the two films have their moments, both are not as good as BLANDINGS, which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name.Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) are noticing the tight corners of their apartment, which they share with their two daughters Joan and Betsy (Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall). Although Blandings has a good income as an advertising executive (in 1948 he is making $15,000.00 a year, which was like making $90,000.00 today), and lives in a luxury apartment - which in the New York City of that day he rents! - he feels they should seek something better. He and Muriel take a drive into the country (Connecticut) and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want.And they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to. For one thing, they are so gung ho about the idea of building a home like this they fail to heed warning after warning by their wise, if cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas, in a nicely sardonic role). For example, Jim buys land from a Connecticut dealer (Ian Wolfe, sucking his chops quietly), with a check before double checking the correct cost for the land in that part of Connecticut. Bill points out he's paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth. There are problems about water supply that both Blandings just never think about, such as hard and soft water - which leads to the Zis - Zis Water softening machine. They find that the designs they have in mind, and have worked out with their architect (Reginald Denny), can't be dropped cheaply at a spur of the moment decision by Muriel to build a little rookery that nobody planned for. The escalating costs of the project are one matter that bedevils Jim. He has been appointed to handle the "Wham" account ("Spam" had become a popular result of World War II, in that the public started using it as a meat substitute, in the light of it's success with the armed forces). Jim can't get a grip on this (he's not alone - one or two other executives fumbled it before him). He comes up with the following bit of "poetry"(?):"This little piggy went to market,He was pink and as pretty as ham.He smiled in his tracks,As they gave him the ax -He knew he would end up as "Wham"!"His Secretary looks at him as though he needs a straight jacket when he reads that one!Jim also is increasingly suspicious of the attentions of Bill to Muriel, although (in this case) Bill is blameless. But he's always around (Jim keeps forgetting that Bill is the clearheaded one, and that he's keeping Jim and Muriel from making so many mistakes). All three have mishaps, the best being when they get locked in a room in the half constructed house, just as the men have left for the day. They can't open the door, and Jim (in a panic) tries breaking the door down by a make-shift battering ram. He breaks a window, and the door opens by itself.The film works quite satisfactorily, with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves. It is one film which (despite changing price levels and salary levels) really does not age at all. After all, most Americans dream of owning their own home and always have.A number of years ago a paint company made use of a delightful scene with Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell regarding the paint job Parnell's company has to do on the various rooms. She carefully shows the distinct shades of red, blue, etc. she wants - even giving a polite Parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue. The commercials hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job. They proudly called Loy "Mrs. Blandings" in the commercials' introduction. You can imagine though how the no-nonsense Parnell handles the situation afterward, when Loy leaves him with his paint crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe you had to be there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie several times, and not once has it ever struck me as funny. There are a few slightly amusing moments, when the couple first are shown the house by realtor Ian Wolfe, but most of the movie is them getting more into debt, and more upset with each other, all over this great idea to build a new house.I just don't see the humor in Cary Grant's character blundering into one bad decision after another, and the rising tension that marks the film. To be honest, I would be rather suspicious too, if an old friend always seemed to be hanging around when I wasn't there. The idea that Melvyn Douglas and Myrna Loy might be cheating on Cary Grant doesn't seem all that far fetched.For an alleged comedy, there's a really bleak quality to this story. The way it's all conveniently wrapped up at the end is just a little too neat for me, after all the agony this family has gone through.Maybe the movie has been misunderstood as a comedy, when it is in fact a bitter satire on the pitfalls of building a home. Satire is not the same thing as comedy, though it may use humor to make a point.There are very few old movies I dislike, but to be honest, this just doesn't work for me. I find too much real bitterness in it to make it work as the comedy it's supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb and very intelligent SERIOUS comedy, that was of course, written off by the critics. A more telling title would have been "The nightmare of home ownership". A man decides to buy a house and move out of his cramped apartment. He buys an old one, but has to demolish it because it is rotten to the core. All sorts of complications ensue, costs pile up, the man loses his peace of mind and can no longer do his work. He is about to be fired. There is an obligatory and perfunctory happy ending, but the message was clear: SUCKERS BEWARE! Buying a home can be a nightmare. The movie was painful to watch because I know people who LIVED it. To buy a home is to buy an entire neighborhood and an entire destiny, because your life will be affected greatly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cosy Little Eighteen Room Dream House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies is Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. Although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today. Still Cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of Wham.What made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post World War II years. Returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the GI Bill of Rights which included home loans. The problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand. Around the time the book by Eric Hodgins and the film were so popular Congress passed and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender- Wagner Housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business.I had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early Fifties. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city Rochester. Their place wasn't quite as grand as a house in Connecticut with eighteen rooms, still they lived there the rest of their lives the way Cary and Myrna most likely did.Of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up, threatening to send Cary to the cleaners. Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas around to offer counsel, usually too late. Truth be told he's kind of sweet on Myrna and Cary knows it.Myrna Loy's role is simply an extension of Nora Charles. If you can imagine the Charles's moving to the country and William Powell having the headaches Cary Grant does, the film would still work just fine.Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House still works well as comedy because the situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my Uncle Walter and Aunt Kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film in 1980 in the midday movie spot. After many subsequent viewings (and purchase of the video) it still makes me laugh out loud.Yes, it's a relic of another age - a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class America - but well executed is well executed. But it's also a document of its age - a celebration of post-war optimism, the baby boom and the nascent consumer age. This film is no "guilty" pleasure.Three wonderful sophisticated leads actors - urbane Melvyn Douglas; bemused Cary Grant; daffily determined Myrna Loy - complement each other and a memorable team of characters.My favourite scenes - "It means we gotta blast" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little piggy".Love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream House?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake, "The Money Pit." Older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas were all "superstars" in an easier, less complicated era. Or was it? Time, of course, has a way of modifying perspectives, and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary, there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older, seemingly less provocative films. In "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House," there may, therefore, be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948. There is political commentary, however subtle. Finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience, only lightly softened by the coming of Levittowns and the like. Politics in the movie? The Blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school (which in real life would get teachers accused of communism). In real life, too, Myrna Loy was a housing activist, a Democrat, and a feminist. Melvyn Douglas was no less a Democratic firebrand: he was married to congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, whom young Richard Nixon accused of being soft on communism (and which ruined her). Jason Robards, sr., has a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less noticeable. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, jr., would be for many years a very active liberal Democrat. Almost the odd fellow out was Cary Grant, whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in Hollywood that was already slipping. But this was 1948: Communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner. It would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films, and then not so subtly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not quite screwball but it comes pretty close, and the movie is a pretty good indicator of the types of problems one runs into in buying or building a new home. What kept amazing me were the monetary references made in conjunction with the project and the Blandings' circumstances. Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) made fifteen thousand dollars a year as a New York City ad executive, and managed to keep a maid on that salary! I'm still trying to wrap my head around that one.Then there was the eleven thousand, five hundred dollars for the Lansdale home with 35 acres! High six figures for that today, before even considering the eighteen grand the family had to come up with to replace the one they tore down. I had to think about that one too, because even if the roof shingles were coming down, the place looked nowhere near as bad as the house Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan bought in "George Washington Slept Here". Benny called that one a hotel for buzzards, a pretty good description for a building that resembled a death trap.The other interesting retrospective one gets here is how progressives were indoctrinating school kids against the concept of capitalism way back in the Forties. It was called 'commercialism' in this picture, but same idea. At least the Blandings countered that it was Dad's salary paying for all their extracurricular activities. Bicker, bicker, bicker.The film resonated with movie goers of the era, not long since the end of World War II with returning servicemen starting their own families and needing a place to live. Seeing this first might have dissuaded some of of them, but the American Dream endured. A very loose remake of this film was made for a more modern audience in 1986 with "The Money Pit". Anyone who owns a home can relate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slick, entirely superficial, entirely unconvincing comedy with a sparkling star-trio at the helm; it passes the time, if not much else. Cary Grant, an advertising executive who makes $15K a year, wants to move his wife and two kids (and a sass-and-sweetness black maid) to the country, but building a new home rather than buying one proves to be a costly headache. Grant has obviously been encouraged to play this material to the hilt, and his hammy, wide-eyed reactions are funny if eventually a bit smug and tiresome. Myrna Loy doesn't have much to play as Grant's wife (she drawls out a few funny lines in her calm, cool-headed manner), but Melvyn Douglas out-acts them both as "a friend of the family" with a small crush on the Mrs. Director H. C. Potter, working from a screenplay by Melvin Frank and Norman Panama (from Eric Hodgins' book), knows how to sell this picture to an eager-to-laugh mass audience: he keeps the pace popping, the cast manic and the visual jokes easy to spot. A picture so completely manufactured might easily wear some viewers down, if situational comedy is not their thing. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about Murphy's Law being applied to home ownership and construction. If a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional. Since it was set in the 'simpler' forties, we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era. Grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by Loy and Douglas. Their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House" is a witty, charming little domestic comedy starring one of my favorite actors: the unforgettable Cary Grant. His character - Jim Blandings, Manhattan advertising executive - lives with his lovely wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and their two daughters in an overly cramped apartment. When Jim spots a magazine ad about owning a home in Lansdale, Connecticut, that's enough to convince him to begin building his dream house. Problem is, Jim is a man who does things on impulse without first consulting his lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas). In the end, Jim quits his job (temporarily), loses practically all of his money over the new house, and might have lost his sanity as well had it not been for Gussie (Louise Beavers), the Blandings' housekeeper who finally comes up with that perfect slogan for Wham Ham.The cast of "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House" is wonderful. Cary Grant is so great at comic acting as he portrays Jim Blandings with all his befuddlement and hysteria. Myrna Loy was the perfect choice for the role of Jim's wife Muriel because she is very funny without ever TRYING to be. Melvyn Douglas is super as Jim's attorney Bill Cole, who is absolutely full of witticisms and who serves as the narrator of the picture. Reginald Denny is great as architect Henry L. Simms, who becomes quite baffled at all the unrealistic additions that Mr. &amp; Mrs. Blandings want for their new home. The African-American Louise Beavers is quite adorable as the Blandings' lovable housekeeper Gussie. Not to mention Harry Shannon as Mr. Tesander, who digs the Blandings' well at their new home ("Yeee-ep"); Tito Vuolo as the frustrated steam shovel operator Mr. Zucca; Nestor Paiva as crackerjack structural engineer Joe Appolonio; and Connie Marshall &amp; Sharyn Moffett as the Blandings children Betsy and Joan, respectively.Highlights: The establishing shots of the Blandings' apartment clearly indicate a lack of storage space; Jim particularly has trouble with his bedroom closet. As he steps in the shower, Jim belts out "Home on the Range" to hide his sudden discontentment with the water temperature. While in Bill's office, Jim delivers quite a convincing speech regarding how there are some things you should just buy with your heart and not your head. Jim and Muriel clearly possess no knowledge of architecture as they draw over Mr. Simms' preliminary plans. Jim and Bill repeatedly get locked in the upstairs storage room of the Blandings' new house; all they can do to get anyone's attention is to pound nail kegs on the floor. Muriel is quite funny in her manner of describing to Mr. PeDelford (Emory Parnell) the colors from her wall painting samples. On the morning of the due date for the Wham slogan, Jim comes up with some that are pathetic! And finally, Muriel is especially funny in confessing to Jim that she authorized the rather expensive installation of a flower sink with a drain and a stone floor ("Just four little pieces of flagstone")."Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House" starts slowly and takes a little time to gain momentum, but once it does, the audience is in for a very enjoyable comedy. In the end, everything turns out well for the Blandings family as Jim tells the audience, "Drop in and see us sometime."</fullReview>

If you bought your home, then decide you should have an engineer look at it, why aren't you in a loony bin?! Because Mr. Blandings will be your roommate!!This is a funny movie about the above. Cary Grant and Myrna Loy put in a first rate job as Mr. and Mrs. Blandings along with Melvyn Douglas as the friend and former puppy love of Mrs. Blandings. In post World War 2 America, a lot of people were buying track homes in newly formed suburbia. Mr. Blandings decided he and his family should have more than one bathroom in a home where they could move freely. Sounds easy. Living through it is rough!This is a light and airy film showcasing how life should be. 10 out of 10! I love and miss Cary Grant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over, as films were moving in a different direction, comedically and otherwise. With television looming on the horizon, Hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time. Where, one wonders, would movies have gone had television not come along, or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years? Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House offers one particular way comedy might have developed.Ad man Jim Blandings, along with his wife and two daughters, are living in a nice but way too cramped New York City apartment, as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs. So he buys some property in Connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications. Well, almost. Had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind. Then again he might not have. You decide. On this frail premise a wonderful film results, full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one. Nothing comes easy in this life, as Mr. Blandings learns; but one needn't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way. There is, after all, the long run. But, Blandings asks himself every few minutes, how long is long?This movie is a delight. It is not, I suppose, a masterpiece in the Capra-McCarey tradition, but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures, and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically. There is real warmth in the picture, and a good deal of (W.C.) Fieldsian hard-edged reality obtruding periodically, but not so much as to leave a bad taste. The people in the film are all very smart and affluent, but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class.Lead players Cary Grant and Myrna Loy plays Mr. and Mrs. Blandings to perfection; while Melvyn Douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend, who often has to bring up unpleasant topics, such as how the real world works. There is, too, a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia, which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years, as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place. These people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural Connecticut. In a few short years things would change, as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear, destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns, which soon would be connected by highways, littered with bottles and cans, their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city.</fullReview>

Cary Grant is uncharacteristically grumpy throughout, Myrna Loy plays the little doormat wife to perfection and Melvyn Douglas is slyly humorous as their lawyer and friend. Nothing out of the ordinary happens - a house gets built costing just that little bit more than the owners anticipated. They do finish up more bathrooms and closets however, and the American dream is validated. I think my parents, inveterate renovators, would have fallen asleep.

The scenes at the breakfast table are the best with Grant and Loy playing off each other.I just wish... I hate to quibble over movies like this that don't try very hard to be anything other than light comedy... I just wish there was more Grant and Loy and less Melvyn Douglas. Don't get me wrong, I like Douglas, but anything that keeps the other two from trading banter on-screen is just taking up space. This also includes the first ten minutes, with its quotidian silence and very very very low-intensity humor.This classic movie feels more manufactured than others of this period. The plot moves along with the kind of artificial devices that are annoying and make you realize just how good Cary Grant is at improvisation (or the appearance thereof). This is only because he doesn't look like he was allowed to do any of it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr Blandings (Cary Grant) decides to relocate because his New York apartment is so crowded. He buys a heap of shite in the middle of nowhere and then decides to knock it down and build his own house. Well, that's what he does - he builds his own house and we follow his trials until the house is built.It's not a very exciting story and I kept drifting off to sleep on a second viewing. Cary Grant is always easy to watch and he delivers his usual double takes and trademark looks of bewilderment and amazement. And that's where the comedy comes from in this rather uninteresting story. The children are irritating and there are tedious slapstick routines. Myrna Loy as his wife "Muriel" is sometimes annoying because there are several scenes in which she just stares at her husband as if to say "Isn't he funny? What's he going to do now?" There actually is a funny scene when Mr Blandings returns home the morning after a storm to find Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) parading around in a dressing-gown with his wife Muriel and he casually greets Mr Blandings as if nothing is out of the ordinary. It's one of the rare moments that sticks in the memory.And who on earth would sit down to eat a plate of something called "Wham"? According to this film, an incredibly stupid American public would. The film is essentially a non-offensive waste of time. My girlfriend liked it more than me - giving it 6/10 so maybe you have to love Cary Grant to make it a worthwhile pursuit of time.</fullReview>

Jim and wife Muriel sleep in twin beds, despite her confession of being a college nymphomaniac (" . . . in those days, I loved a new man every week"). Muriel hosts sleepovers with old flames whenever work detains Jim in town. HER dream house needs to be built "just so." Even when their home is 99% completed, Muriel tears up the blueprints on the merest whim. Why not increase the overall cost of their home by 10% (that's $32,671.39 in today's money) by penciling in four fancy floor tiles at the last second? That's how she operates. Who cares if about half the house needs to be rebuilt to accommodate this afterthought? With a wife like that, who needs enemies? But Jim's "haunting in Connecticut" goes from bad to worse, as a freak spring inundates his basement while the water table languishes 23 stories down at his well head 30 feet away. Flash flooding cuts off his home from Civilization, and bewitched doorknobs lock his wife in closets with once and future lovers.

That being said, I have to confess this is not one of my favorite Cary Grant movies. I like it but I've always considered it one of Grant's second-tier comedies. I think part of the problem is that it's never as fast-paced or wacky as most of Cary's best comedies were. One reviewer said it "wasn't screwbally enough" and I would agree with that. Also the subplots really add nothing and Mevlyn Douglas' character got on my nerves. Still, it's enjoyable enough and worth recommending.

		<shortDescription>The Post-WWII Housing Boom Provides Fodder for a Sharply Played Domestic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coinciding with the start of the baby boom, the years after World War II saw an unprecedented exodus of Americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes. Directed by H.C. Potter and co-written by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank ("White Christmas"), this lightweight but surprisingly observant 1948 screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well. Of course, it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs ? Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and an especially acerbic Melvyn Douglas ? head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership. Even though the film is sixty years old now, there is a timeless quality to the Blandings' dream and the barriers they face in achieving it. Obviously, Hollywood thinks so since it's been remade at least twice - first as a very physical Tom Hanks comedy, 1986's "The Money Pit", and again last year with Ice Cube's "Are We Done Yet?". One look at HGTV's programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today.The plot begins with ad man Jim Blandings, his wife Muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom-one bath Manhattan apartment. Rather than pursue Muriel's idea to renovate the apartment for $7,000, Jim sees a photo of a Connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move. With the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend Bill Cole, the Blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair. However, the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one. This sparks the Blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first. Costs rise with each new complication, tempers flare, and even a romantic triangle is imagined among, Jim, Muriel and Bill. Priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not-so-blissful ignorance of the new homeowners.With his double takes and flawless line delivery, Grant is infallible in this type of farce, and Jim Blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid-career characters. In a role originally meant for Irene Dunne, Myrna Loy shows why she was Hollywood's perfect wife. She doesn't get many of the funnier lines, but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make Muriel an appealing character on her own. Watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette. As avuncular, pipe-smoking Bill ("Cole?Bill Cole"), Melvyn Douglas shows his natural, easy-going lan as Grant's foil. Smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by Harry Shannon as the laconic well-digger Mr. Tesander, Lurene Tuttle as Jim's officious assistant Mary, and Louise Beavers as the Blandings' lovable maid Gussie. The 2004 DVD provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie - the first a 1949 version that did end up pairing Grant and Dunne and then a second 1950 version coupling Grant with his then-wife, actress Betsy Drake. A most appropriate 1949 cartoon, "The House of Tomorrow", is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house. The original theatrical trailers for ten of Grant's film classics complete the extras.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Key Comedy for Its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Super-slick entertainment with a stellar cast, an outstanding script, and a firm grip on the approaching 1950's. At the time, RKO was turning out classic noirs by the dozens. But whatever the value of those shadowy downers, they reflected a war-time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the Eisenhower era. Few films of the late-40's are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy.Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) works as an ad-man on Madison Ave. where in his little daughter's words-- he sells things to people that they don't need, at prices they can't afford. He's making good money, but like thousands of others, he's tired of living in a cramped urban "cave". So, with wife Myrnah Loy, they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the Connecticutt countryside. Needless to say, in the arms of nature, they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion.There's hardly a lifeless line in the entire script. I don't know if writers Panama and Frank got an Oscar, but they should have. Of course, the humor revolves around all the problems that pop-up when city people build a big house on rural land. The annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage, with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving Grant a hard time. Of course, no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than Grant, so it's just one well-placed laugh after another, particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own. Yet, oddly, the film appears to have no comedic high-point. Instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don't peak at any particular point. That's a real movie triumph for any era.Reaching back 60 years later, we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind. With their live-in maid, the Blandings may not be a typical American family, but that post-war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical. And what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than Blandings as an "ad-man" tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more "ham". More than anything, however, there's the movie's sunny optimism. Oh sure, the feeling falters at times, yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the Blandings just stick to their dream carries them through. Indeed, life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge, so I expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day. It's that easily over-looked subtext, along with the sheer entertainment value, that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post-war period.So, if you haven't seen it, catch it next time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Light Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Light comedy has successful NYC ad man tired of his congested apartment and city life looking to move to a remote house in Connecticut. Of course, complications arise. Grant and Loy are fun to watch while Douglas is quite amusing as the couple's lawyer friend. It's not as funny as it could have been but it is enjoyable. Many of the issues regarding escalating costs of home ownership and commuting time are still applicable 60 years later. However, it's interesting that Grant, with an annual income of $15K, balks at spending more than $10K on a house. Taking inflation into account, Mr. Blandings' $18K house on 35 acres an hour from NYC would be worth tens of millions today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you decide to build a house, watch this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was made in 1948, but it still rings true today. Very, very funny. It begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it "builds" from there. Anyone who has ever built a house, will find this movie very endearing. Great cast. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this film. This is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's....clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are made to the cost of things, and those comparisons to today's costs are pretty amazing. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely. I am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it. A true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream Houses Don't Come Cheap!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams. It all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget.There are many great laughs (even if the story is somewhat thin) sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s Hollywood comedy style. A definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses, which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience. As he makes his exit, he assures the client (Grant) that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of $100.00 from the total...or at least $50.00...but certainly $25.00. Hilarious!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revelant at it's release, and still holds truths today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much to love in this darling little comedy. Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even just been short of space,will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled Mr. Blanding.Melvyn Douglas,with great comedic flare, both narrates and acts as the Blandings' attorney and voice of reason.As well Myrna Loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife. But the best performance is Grant's. He is the American everyman, especially relevant at the time of this film's release, when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war. The themes are universal,lack of money, work strain, fear of infidelity.Yes, it does wrap up awfully neatly, but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war, and wanted a happy ending. It is still relevant today, and I must chalk up the poor reviews I see to a present preference for dumbed down, gross out comedies. The look of the film is slick, and there are some great bits of comedy is well, particularly toward the beginning.While it may have lost some of it's social relevance, nearly sixty years after it's release, it is still a gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a little unusual in that it's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace. While this makes it pretty different from the average Grant film, it is still highly watchable and entertaining. It's sort of like someone said "let's just follow Cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed". Considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. While the film has pretty modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material. It's a great film for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Musings: Pure delight from beginning to end. Not a laugh riot, but a more subtle, sophisticated humor. What a goldmine of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr.. Cary Grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed. A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his "lallies to be rabbeted", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative. At that, Barker yells up to his mates, "OK boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so....YANK 'EM OUT!" A second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards. All Grant can do is moan.Yes, the movie IS dated. You'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home, and a place like that, in Connecticut of all places, would probably run a few million bucks.A classic movie that is really a treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a house of fools for a cool movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stopped short of giving "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House" 10/10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit: the fact that a black person is the faithful servant (somewhat reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit). But other than that, the movie's a hoot. Portraying middle class New York couple Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) trying to build a house in Connecticut, this flick has something for everyone.Grant is his usual flippant self, while Loy does quite well as merely a wife. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs as Jim's and Muriel's lawyer Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than he's making clear. As for the house itself...throughout most of the movie, you'll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there. The builders, contractors, and others also provide their fair share of laughs.All in all, a comedy classic. Also starring Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard about this film I was mainly attracted by the leading actor, I had no idea what the story was about, I was expecting a guy moving away to build a house for himself away from everything, not this. Basically Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two kids live in a tiny New York apartment, and they decide to buy and build their own "dream" house, easier said than done. Obviously all the giggles come from some of the dialogue, complications with construction, and getting everything in the house to go well/work. As this is this going on, Jim is also trying to come up with a slogan for his ham product, Wham, and by accident, the maid says it, "If you ain't eating' Wham, you ain't eating' ham", and there's the happy ending when they he has made money and can stay in what seemed a disastrous new house. Also starring Melvyn Douglas as Bill Cole, Sharyn Moffett as Joan Blandings, Connie Marshall as Betsy Blandings, Louise Beavers as Gussie, Harry Shannon as Tesander, Reginald Denny as Henry Simms, Jason Robards (Sr.) as John Retch, Ian Wolfe as Smith - Realtor and Lex Barker as Carpenter foreman. I can't remember laughing that much, but apparently this is better than the Tom Hanks and Shelley Long remake The Money Pit. It was number 72 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.

Post WWII life is simply and idyllically portrayed.Grant is at the absolute top of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire. Loy is adorable as his pre-NOW wife. The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker.

The voice-over describes the idylls of New York City, while the images flashed onto the screen say exactly the opposite. E.g. a diner full of loudmouths, and one snapshot of the most crowded beach I have ever seen! It's very funny. Rent the movie and watch through that segment; then turn it off.

		<shortDescription>MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE is a film that makes you want to ditch your noisy urban dwelling in favour of a serene spot in the country.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Blandings (Grant) and his wife Muriel (Loy) have lived in their four-room Manhattan apartment for the better part of fifteen years. During that time they have had two daughters and hired one maid making for a very tight squeeze. Like most Manhattan apartments, there isn't a great deal of space and the strain of living amongst erupting closets and a constantly occupied bathroom is putting a damper on things. Oh, and before I forget, there is also a pet bird and a close family friend ? lawyer William "Bill" Cole (Douglas) ? that have become permanent fixtures in the Blandings home.Jim Blandings is an ambitious advertising executive whose creative ideas have started to suffer due to his frenzied and inhibiting living conditions. One day, whilst reading the newspaper, he comes across a property listing that makes him sit up and take notice. There is a home for sale in rural Connecticut that promises great views, acres of land, serene surroundings and plenty of space to raise a family in. In other words, it is precisely what Jim and Muriel Blandings are looking for! The Blandings arrange to see the house and when they eventually come face to face with it they are forced to make a particularly difficult and very expensive decision: do they tear the existing dilapidated structure down and start from scratch, commissioning an architect to build their dream home for them? Or do they move into the current house and settle for a renovation?Real estate agent Smith (Ian Wolfe) has been trying to sell "the Old Hackett Place" for years and when the Blandings show interest in the property, Smith's eyes light up - seriously, you can almost see the sparks shooting out of them. The home is a two hundred year old farmhouse and looks it's age; it's falling apart and leaning dangerously to the left, ready to keel over as quickly as a Victorian woman wearing a corset. Eager to make the sale, agent Smith encourages Jim to buy the property (for more than market value, naturally) and turn it into his and his wife's dream home. It's what they've always wanted, isn't it? Why not take the plunge?Since the existing structure is pretty much falling apart and not worth saving, the Blandings finally decide to purchase the property, tear down the house, and build their dream home (hence the title of the movie). Throughout the negotiations and decision-making process, the Blandings have Bill Cole breathing down their necks, advising and cautioning them about the hindrances and difficulties of undertaking such a massive project. It takes a lot of convincing and a lot of construction-related hiccups that eventually make Jim and Muriel second-guess their real estate purchase; Jim only makes $15,000 a year and the costs of tearing down a house and re-building it from the ground up is taking its toll on his earnings. We all know what comes next, don't we? Jim and Muriel's marriage starts to suffer and they find themselves second-guessing each other at every turn. Jim thinks Muriel is having an affair with Bill Cole and Muriel thinks Jim is overreacting and being unreasonably selfish.Though things start to look bleak for the Blandings, they pull through and their marriage remains intact. I wish the same could be said for their new home! First the property gets flooded when a well is dug, then the pouring of the foundations is delayed, doors that were supposed to have locked from the inside end up locking from the outside (and chaos ensues), the previous owner demands the repayment of his mortgage since the Blandings unceremoniously tore down his home without first seeking his permission, and when the family finally manages to move in, the house is missing half of its windows. I know what many of you must be thinking: this sounds awfully familiar. Well, that's probably because THE MONEY PIT (1986) starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long served as a sort of loosely based remake of this classic film and went on to gross almost $55 million at the box office.Things eventually settle down for the Blandings and they end up getting their dream home by the film's final reel. All is well: there are spacious closets in every room, more than enough bathrooms for everybody, an enormous living room featuring a lovely wood burning fireplace, a sewing room for Muriel, and room for the maid. Like many other classic movies of the period, MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE ends in smiles and laughter.Though there were plenty of entertaining moments in the film, I thought it could have done with a bit more comedy. Cary Grant was an actor with incredible comedic timing and in this film his performance seems a little bland. The same goes for Myrna Loy who achieved worldwide fame starring alongside William Powell in THE THIN MAN movies of the 1930s and '40s; Loy plays the part of a dutiful wife in this film beautifully but she does very little else. Sure, she's absolutely charming when she needs to be, but again, I feel as if her performance falls flat. I definitely don't think that either star was used to his or her full potential here whether the script is to blame or the film's director, H. C. Potter.Having said all that, though, MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE is worth seeing. It's a light-hearted look at the perils and trials that come along with purchasing property and designing your own home. Perhaps the youth and young families of today would do well in watching a film like this one, especially considering the state of today's real estate market. It may serve as a warning and it may serve as a gentle push towards home ownership ? who can tell?http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/mr-blandings-dream-house</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie "comedies" nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor, foul language, and groin-kicking. Modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator, the undemanding and slow of brain. Sure, an occasional good comedy will come along, but they're becoming rarer all the time."Mr. Blandings Buildings his Dream House" shows what 1940s Hollywood was capable of, and it's just screamingly funny. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in the Connecticut suburbs. The film follows their story, beginning with house hunting trips, the house's riotous construction, all the way to the finished home--with its "zuzz-zuzz water softener".Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course (Grant is particularly funny as he watches the house's costs zoom out of control). However, the film is stolen by the Blandings' wise attorney, played to perfection by Melvyn Douglas. Managing to steal every scene he's in, Douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the Blandings lurch from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denny as the Blandings' harried architect and Harry Shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful.I've watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh. I think it's a good film to watch when you need a lift, whether you're building a house or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just after world war two, tens of thousands of young couples were in search of the American dream and that goes for Mr. Jim Blandings. (Cary Grant) With his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) in tow, they seek advice from their friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) and wind up trading their New York Apartment and buy into a home in the country. The entire story encompasses the movie called " Mr. Blandings Builds his dream house. " Purchasing a historical home for a paltry $6,000, they soon realize their renovations will eventually cost them $18,000. It's cost is minuscule compared with houses of today. However, back in the 1940 and earning only $18,000, it was incredibly exorbitant. Yet, the story is not only the escalating expenses which grow as the movie progresses, but the insightful secrets between the husband and wife. Added to that is the revelations between the lawyer and his wife. If that were not enough, Blanding is working on a deadline to find a sales slogan at his advertising business. Cary Grant is at his very best in his role and the comedy produced is excellent. A Classic in its own right as his dream house also becomes a comedy milestone. Easilly recommended for all. ****</fullReview>

No matter, they will just build a new house, and have all sort of crazy ideas for it.Stubbornness and carelessness on both husband and wife cause all sorts of difficulties, not only financial but legal as well, as the Blandings discover how little they know about house building and the legal and technical complications that involves. On top of that, Mr. Blanding has a difficult project at work to take over-and his suspicions about his wife and Cole put additional strain on the family.You can never predict how things are going to turn out in the end until the story actually ends. A comedy, but a low-level tension drama and social commentary piece as well which is still relevant today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Cary Grant charm and great support.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a movie that's tailor made for Cary Grant.If you are familiar with him,you know that a comedy of errors involving the construction of a "dream house" that has Grant as a star is a winner from the get go.He is on fire here with the charm that is typical of him,and adding Myrna Loy as support was a genius idea,and it is evident that the entire supporting cast worked just as hard to make the film funny as Grant and Loy did.The humor and reactions are dead on perfect.There's just something about movies made in the 40's.It seems great films were churned out almost effortlessly throughout the entire decade,Mr. Blandings has a prominent place among them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary in Connecticut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frustrated sharing the bathroom and lacking a drawer for his socks, Manhattan advertising executive Cary Grant (as Jim Blandings) moves to a Connecticut country home with his lovely wife Myrna Loy (as Muriel) and their two cute daughters. When the happy family arrives, they discover their sprawling estate is falling apart, so "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House". The couple's best supporting actor Melvyn Douglas (as Bill Cole) helps as situation comedy complications ensue. The upper class co-stars are very likable, slumming as a middle class couple on the move. The film parallels the era's much desired American move to suburbia, complete with cheery maid Louise Beavers (as Gussie). Future "Tarzan" Lex Barker makes a good impression and should have been stranded alone with Loy overnight, instead of Mr. Douglas.******* Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (3/25/48) H.C. Potter ~ Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, Melvyn Douglas, Reginald Denny</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take your time, I can spare the blood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thoroughly fed up of living in the city, and aghast at the lack of room in the family apartment, Jim and Muriel Blandings decide to move to the Connecticut countryside. However, the house they purchase is falling down, with a sense of purpose and determination they set about building a brand new house from scratch, with one crisis after another besieging the project!Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House is adapted from the novel written by Eric Hodgins, a novel that I believe was very popular due to its satirical edge and perfect timing. It was a time of housing problems in America and a time when many people were moving out to the suburbs. Having no frame of reference here (not read the book myself), I can't say if this adaptation to the screen does the source material justice, what I do know is that the film is charming, very funny in places, yet lacking in any sort of originality.Really it's probably down to the cast that the film still holds up today as an entertaining viewing, Cary Grant and Myrna Loy (the Blandings) team up again for the third time, with Melvyn Douglas stealing the picture as the wry and causticly funny friend, Bill Cole (the character arc written in to add a bit of spice to proceedings). Remade to mixed critical notices in 1986 as The Money Pit, this 48 version is still the go to guy for your entertainment needs. Unfussy and without any major hindrances, Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House scores well above average. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though not seen in too many films prior, you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since. Not one of Grant's nor Loy's best films, they make an outstanding effort together. After all, with that much talent and very good supporting cast, you know the laughs will be there.The film is light, has some dramatic spotting but keeps the plot moving and gets you to smile the whole way through.A great example of classic American film fare that has stood the test of time.Definite Saturday afternoon fare, heavy on the popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best...even 50 years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not many movies made over 50 years ago stand the test of time. Part of the problem is changing tastes, different idioms, more (or less) sophisticated tastes, jaded palate, addiction to TV-driven entertainment, and evolution of the cinematic arts. This movie, however, somehow survives the natural attrition of time and still entertains in all aspects despite its age.I am not sure if it's the clever script, the wise direction, the pacing, or the storyline but Mr. Blandings 1948 touches every base, involves and entertains without any need to retrogress one's tastes or standards.I've seen the leads in other movies and they were fine, but this is an exception.It isn't ranked very high on the list of great comedies but in my opinion it is superior as a work to The Philadelphia Story and the other also excellent comedies of the period.This movie works on many levels and despite my expectations (that I would have to condescend to enjoy it), I found that it exceeded them.There are many great scenes in here: the well digging, the cupboard, the breakfast in new york, the love scene, the drive, the bathroom scenes, the list goes on...and on.This is just a great movie that shines above all the remakes and truly shines in its own right as a great piece of film making.Even more than 50 years later...Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute and Sociolgically Important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gary Grant dithers a lot, though less so than in "Arsenic and Old lace." Myrna Loy is a sweetheart, as always. Melvyn Douglas is suave. They are good company for an hour and a half or so.Sometimes it's a little hard to buy: Would a businessman really be so casual about purchases in an area he doesn't know? But it moves along at a sprightly pace. And it tells a story of America the way "The Best Years of Our Lives" tells another story: When we meet Grant, Loy, and their daughters, they are in a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. They decide they need more space. So it's off to the wilds (apparently they were wilds in those days) of Connecticut and their very own house.This happens in the "I Love Lucy" series, too -- to the show's determent. "Lucy" is much more fun when the Riccardos are living on at that impossible address on the Upper East Side than when they move to Connecticut. That move signaled a change in what television was telling people was chic. In "Mr. Blandings," we are never told that the city is still not a great place. But a house in the country is something one earns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More depressing than funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) are crowded in their NYC apartment with two children and a live in maid (???) and decide to buy a place in the country. They do--it's a fixer upper and then the nightmares and supposedly hilarious complications set in.In some ways this is historically important--it mirrors the first time in American history when people moved out of the city and into houses outside the city which became suburbs. That aside though this movie has little going for it. The movie is full of gaps in logic (WHY do they have a live in maid for that tiny little apartment?) and all the problems they run into are more depressing than funny. Seeing a likable couple being driven crazy is NOT funny or entertaining.The acting does help. Grant and Loy are at their peak here and Melvyn Douglas nicely underplays (and is truly funny) as a family friend. Also there's the great Louise Beavers and a VERY young (and handsome) Lex Barker as a worker (he later became Tarzan). Still I was more depressed than anything else. This movie does have its defenders (a friend of mine says it's his favorite movie of all time) but I honestly can't see why. I can only give this a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recommend this to all my remodel/addition or first time custom homeowners. I'd puts things in perspective and they'll have a slightly humorous reminder when things aren't going as predicted. A classic, slightly screwball comedy of the pitfalls and problems associated with home ownership. Oddly enough I didn't learn until recently that this is a remake of the Jack Benny comedy "George Washington Slept Here", also good but more low key. Not to bore you but IMDb wants more lines. So here's a line. Here's a little longer line. Here's a line especially for you, and here's what I hope is the last of these required lines. Don't they know sometimes less is better?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun with many intelligent laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You thought that building a house in the countryside is an easy job? Well then, think again! As this delightful screwball comedy, directed by H.C. Potter, shows, it may end up being a truly Sisyphean task. And funny too!The omnipresent absurdity of this movie provides many great laughs. As we meet Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel for the first time they are thinking of improving their living conditions, by trying to swap their confined New York City apartment for a lovely home out in the peaceful country. However, the poor couple doesn't have the slightest idea what they're getting themselves into.Mr. Blandings is constantly fighting with newly arising problems that slow down the whole process. Paradoxically, the house looks like a bigger mess with every subsequent day. His cash flow is getting a bit of a beating too, as he finds out that the construction will cost a 'little' more than it was originally supposed to. (The movie came out in the forties, when the prices weren't relatively that high, but with today's ones I doubt that Jim would even consider moving out of New York). And if this isn't enough, he becomes jealous and suspicious of the relationship between Muriel and the biggest friend of the family, Bill Cole. The witty dialogues are the biggest quality of the movie. The amount of fantastically selected taunts and comebacks will definitely make your stomach hurt from all the laughing.The casting of the characters is simply marvelous. Cary Grant in of his funniest roles, as a clumsy and disorganized man, trying to prove that he is able to build a home of his dreams. Myrna Loy as a woman, who loves to flirt and play on her husband's nerves. Melvyn Douglas as the friend of the family, who is more of a burden than real help in the process. It is also crucial to mention Reginald Denny as Simms, plying the man responsible for providing the harsh truth about the overall progress on the construction site, who sometimes comes out as a dream-gravedigger. All in all, I want to say that it this timeless comedy should be in the watch list of every screwball comedies lover. And don't forget, see the movie again every time you think about building a house. It may instantly change your mind !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless, family comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that was released in the 1940's and still has relevance to family values, work - life balance and how to progress towards a dream deserves a place in film history. I only chanced upon this comedy one Sunday afternoon. The performances of Cary Grant, Myma Loy and Melvyn Douglas are fantastic and the progression of the Blandings from cramped New York apartment to a spacious Connecticut new-build is a story that will continue to be significant for years to come. The part in which Mr. Blanding (Grant) rants about why he ever thought he could afford his new house is wonderful when coupled with him finding out soon after that Mr. Tesander (the well maker) has actually come to return money to him. This film will restore everyones' faith in humanity! A genuine, enjoyable, light-hearted film gem! RIP Cary Grant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's outside of Pleasantville?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House was a witty, satirical ride that nearly gives us a better viewing than the infamous Money Pit, if it wasn't for that racist ending. I know several of you will claim that the ending (without trying to give it away) was genuine for its time, and I understand that claim, but under today's standards this ending was extremely racist and should have been considered racist for the time of its release. After witnessing this monumental ending, my jaw was on the ground. I could not believe that I just finished a humorous Cary Grant film that promoted such a horrid ending. I realize that I am going to be in the minority on this review, but I just couldn't fathom such an ending, and it really bothered me. Outside of the ending, this film reminded me of that Saturday Night Live skit in which Will Ferrell and his family are sitting around the table talking about their day. Out of the thousands it remains in my mind because Farrell classically gave some of his best lines ever. The family would begin to argue and Farrell would just randomly yell out, "I drive a Dodge Stratus, people fear me!" It was hysterical in a waspy sort of way, and that was exactly what Grant brought to the table in this film. With a charming story, simple characters, and a somewhat underdeveloped plot, Mr. Blandings becomes part comedy part disappointment.This film wasn't the greatest to showcase Grant's talent, but it did a decent job of telling a story and providing the viewer with some comedic entertainment. For me, it was watching Grant and his family interact together. The waspiness of their family structure was hysterical. I loved the way that each one of them, from the children to the wife, chiseled away at each other. If you watch this film from beginning to end you will see that there isn't much "love" demonstrated in this family, instead it is prissy children denouncing their father's career and a wife who seems to want more than they can afford. In the end, you feel sorry for Grant because he is only trying to give his family the American dream, even if it takes away every penny he owns. Sadly, this is a Hollywood movie, so we never see him paying bills or worrying about money, instead we only see smiling faces as debt continues to pile further and further up. Grant was perfect in his role. It was a much quieter role for him than what we have seen in the past, but it worked. Grant's comedic timing was impeccable. He captured the screen and never let go; I only wish I could say that about the rest of his cast. I just didn't feel that anyone else was really contributing to the cause. They were playing their part, just not pushing the envelope. Grant overshadowed the rest of his cast and it became less of an ensemble piece and more of another Cary Grant movie. Sad, but in the same sense, it worked.If you have seen the film The Money Pit, than you have seen the outcome of this film. The two are nearly identical sisters in the cinematic world. Each stand on their own, giving something fresh to the Hollywood community, but I think Mr. Blandings steps ahead by just a photo finish. There is something unique about this film, which I attribute to the other going-ons around the Blandings' world outside of this house renovation. There is Mr. Blandings being the ultimate procrastinator, Mrs. Blandings proving that she is not having an affair with Mr. Blandings' best friend, and Gussie, trying to keep the entire family together with her racially award winning final dialogue. It is fun to keep up with everything, but ultimately it just doesn't resolve itself. I like all the obstacles that this family had to endure, but I never felt as if they had a complete ending. The final moments of this film wrapped up one portion of this story, but failed miserably with the other loose ends. We needed a more climactic ending, when instead we were left with nothing more than Hollywood hogwash ? smiling faces coupled with sunny skies. I felt like asking that eternal question at the end of this film that was so notorious in the film Pleasantville, "What's outside of Pleasantville?" It would have fit perfectly.Finally, I would like to say that what could have saved this film were moments that could transcend time. This should have been a milestone classic, the story of the American family going from their comfortable dwellings in the city straight to their freedom in the country, but instead the director, H.C. Potter, went with some dated themes that will always keep this film leveled in the 1940s. The ending particularly will not brood well with today's standards, but the monetary moments in this film should have been left out. It would have built for a stronger story. I had trouble believing that a man making only $15,000 a year could afford all their spending. If Potter would have just left their financial stability out of this picture, maybe I would have felt less connected to Grant's character, but I would have felt that the story worked better. I just couldn't understand why Grant was spending, spending, spending.Overall, it was a good film, just not one that would have a lasting impression on my mind. Grand did a great job, but was overshadowed by a feeble plot and racism. I loved the waspy nature of the family, but the dynamics were never solidified. I didn't see this family actually living together, just pegs in the Hollywood American family used to keep the plot in motion. Good, but not great.Grade: *** out of *****</fullReview>
