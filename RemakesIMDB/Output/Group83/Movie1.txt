		<fullReview>OK so it's not a great movie by any means, but there's some fine performances from comedy heroes like Larry Miller and Dan Castellanetaetawotsit (yes the voice of Homer Simpson).The film has particular resonance if you've ever attended a University considered not top of the league. All in all it's a cute movie, with cute performances and cute jokes, although that kid genius is very annoying (which is half the point I suppose).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Medfield College must be destroyed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The vote is a compromise between minus 10 for ethics and about 5 for everything else.The cheating of Medfield College has been tolerated for too many decades.It is high time that the viewing public stopped ignoring the cheating of Medfield College and decided to blacklist any future movies or TV shows in which that institution of of higher learning for criminal minds should be the home of the protagonists instead of the antagonists.It was bad enough when Medfly -- I mean Medfield -- College cheated at mere sporting events, but in the 1995 television movie remake of The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes the corrupt administrators and students of Medfield dared to violate the integrity of academia by cheating in the (fictional) College Knowledge Bowl as part of a scam on prospective students and their parents.In the introduction to the airing of the film Michael Eisner talked about how great it would be if someday it will be possible to simply put knowledge into people's heads instantly.If that great dream is ever to be realized people will have to make it come true. Intelligent, curious, creative, people, heroes in the quest to expand the limits of knowledge, people like twelve-year-old college senior Norwood Gills of Hale university, the unappreciated hero of the show.When a lightening bolt causes a freak accident in which all the information in Medfield College's mainframe is imprinted in the brain of goof off student Dexter Riley, nobody at Medfied can figure out how it happened, or how to reverse it, or how to duplicate it. Their best minds are stumped.But Norwood, studying the situation from afar, manages to figure out how the process works. During the final competition of the College Knowledge Bowl, Norwood sends a signal to Dexter which erases all Daxter's memories gained in the accident -- and only those memories -- ignoring any urge he felt to erase everything and destroy Dexter's mind, personality, and identity.Some may think that Norwood would simply send a signal to erase data from a computer hard drive into Dexter's brain. But the special effects graphics of imprinting and erasing the knowledge shows several small nodes appearing in Dexter's brain, not a computer hard drive. And beside, Dexter seems to have perfectly normal intelligence, so how could he have enough empty space in his skull to fit a computer hard drive in! So Norwood must have discovered how to implant and erase human memories.In just a few months (such was his anger) a little boy discovered and invented what we would expect that thousand or millions of persons would take decades or centuries of research to discover and invent in real life (such was his genius). Clearly Norwood is not merely more intelligent than anyone else in the world, but more intelligent (and able to improve life with new discoveries) than everyone else in the world combined.And yet the dean of Hale University used Norwood like a trained dog, using his appearances reciting memorized data in the College Knowledge Bowl as a publicity stunt for his university instead of helping Norwood make discoveries to change the world forever.And in the end two government agents drag away Norwood, a famous and respected child, without a word of protest from anyone, on the dubious grounds that Norwood must be a notorious computer hacker merely because they use the same nickname! A hacker traced to an area large enough to hold Medfield College and Hale University and tens or hundreds of thousands of people.In shows that are only slightly more cynical than this one, the government agents would not merely want to arrest Norwood as an alleged computer hacker, but really want to force him to use his genius not for good purposes -- like copying peoples' memories into computers so they can live forever -- but for sinister ones like erasing the memories and personalities and identities of target persons!And nobody every arrests the protagonists and other Medfield College people who use Dexter to cheat in the College Knowledge Bowl to swindle hundreds or thousands of prospective students and their families into paying for a Medfield College education.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skip the remake, watch the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though the original version of "The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes" was not a great movie, it was fun to watch. This poor remake is but a pale shadow of the original and not worth the film used to shoot it.</fullReview>
