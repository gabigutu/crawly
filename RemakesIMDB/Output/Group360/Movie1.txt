		<shortDescription>Pretty good, enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no reason to be hard on this film. An overall rating of 5.2 is very low, in my opinion, and there is little to dislike about "The Preacher's Wife." It's a fairly simple story involving Dudley (Denzel Washington), an angel sent to earth to assist a pastor's marriage during Christmas time. One reason I liked this film is because few romantic comedies in recent years have been clean enough to watch with the entire family. There is almost nothing objectionable here, just a few brief, very mild swear words that have no bearing on the film. It's a decently funny film as well. I had to laugh at Dudley finding an image of a Windows computer screen in his angel handbook. The wisecracking grandmother was also a beneficial addition to the movie. Take her comment "We're gonna play Monopoly, with real money." There are still a few things that could have been improved on. The plot twist involving Dudley falling in love with Whitney Houston could have been played up more and was not nearly as funny as it had the potential to be. Also, the chemistry between the main couple is not super good, and the film lacks the romance necessary to make this a great rom-com. Nevertheless, it's enjoyable and doesn't deserve any harsh comments.Note: Because of the abundance of Christmas-related content, it's best to watch this around Christmas time, or you may feel slightly embarrassed.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pale remake of a minor Christmas classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to wonder why some folks out in Hollywood try to remake that which was done so very well the first time. You can just see them sitting around the conference table talking about adding color and, oh, yeah, lets make the characters black! It would be OK if they really tried to do it better. But they are really just trying to cash in.Such is the case with "The Preacher's Wife". A modernized color version of the Cary Grant vehicle, "The Bishop's Wife", the insertion of even this excellent black cast does nothing to enhance the story.Denzel never seems to capture the sly charm of Dudley, the angel sent to help the Preacher. Now we know Denzel can be a charmer, but even he cannot deliver through this tired direction and uninspired script. Nothing really works in the movie (unless, perhaps, you never saw the original), the Preacher is not sympathetic enough, Whitney isn't at full strength as the title character, and even Gregory Hines can't seem to make the villain seem like much of a baddie.A thorough waste of time and celluloid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful piece of work that should not be compared with any other in the genre of the Christmas/angel type or the so often mentioned Bishop's Wife. Its not the first film to use an old story and alter it and should be looked at as an original piece of work which is what it is. It simply works well mainly because it is perfectly cast, any romantic will be drawn in, willing the beautiful people in this case Whitney Houston and Dezel Washington together. Washington is pure magic on the screen, playing the inoffensive angel who ignores the ignorance and rudeness thrown at him by thoughtless people who should know better, he pulls off some great moments in the story. Unusually too the children are well cast, not too sugary or given scene stealing lines, they complement the adults rather than displace or ridicule them. This is a specialist type of film, a romantic, unrealistic dreamy story, and must be judged in that light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Stupid Re-Make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just couldn't get into this film, a re-make of sorts of "The Bishop's Wife." The first hour was either annoying or just plain boring, and by then I didn't care what happened in the rest of the movie. Not much happened throughout this film, anyway.The angel in here, "Dudley" (Denzel Washington) said things no angel would say, such as "If you're up there, Lord, then.....""If???" He's an angel and he doesn't know if there is a God? Puh-leeze. What an insult to anyone's intelligence and beliefs. Only the secular film world have a dialog like this, where "Secular Humanism," not Christianity, is worshiped, as it is in this film. Whitney Houston looked good in here, the best I've ever seen her. Washington went around with a sappy look on his face through most of the film. I wonder if he was just embarrassed starring in a dumb movie like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very long time ago I happened on "The Bishop's Wife" and really liked it, but it wasn't a Christmas classic and I never saw it again. So when I realized there was a "re-make" I was excited. I liked this story even better! I thought Whitney Houston was terrific and the rest of the characters (especially her mother) were also very enjoyable. Sometimes I just need a break from the mayhem and violence and this is a sweet, uplifting, old-fashioned Christmas pleasure I try to watch every year. If you like Denzel, if you like Lionel Ritchie, if you like Gregory Hines, and especially if you like gospel music, please give this movie a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I am one of the few people on this message board that actually liked this movie. I thought it was great. It was a charming story about the power of miracles and the fact that angels do really exist. (Of course, we wish they all looked like Denzel Washington, but they do exist!) This is my favorite type of a story because so many people these days forget about the miracles every day. I mean, here comes Dudley, an angel, from heaven sent to help out a family that was about to come apart. Maybe some people don't believe that is possible, but I certainly do. The performances were amazing and we get to hear Whitney Houston's beautiful voice. Give this movie a shot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Wonderful Bishop's Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when it was in the theaters. I basically loved it mainly for its music and Jennifer Lewis' (Julia's mother) performance, but also I loved the opening and closing (climax) scenes. I'm basically a sucker for that kind of thing, and I understand how other people wouldn't find it interesting. I just saw the movie (The Bishop's Wife) which it was based on and finally feel qualified to comment. TPW was not just a remake of TBW, but more of a combination of TBW and "It's a Wonderful Life." Henry in TPW was the character of Jimmy Stewart in IWL, always caring for the underdog (altho very cynical to the angel's angelhood); Joe Hamilton in TPW was "Mr Potter" of the same, with his schemes to redevelop and control the town. I actually found it charming the way elements of TBW found themselves woven into TPW: the ice skating scene, the typewriter-turned-PC, the final sermon, to name a few. But I did realize that the message had been diluted into a feel-good comedy. There are no moments where one feels deeply moved merely by dialogue, such as TBW's Dudley's story of David and the Lion, which captivates the Bishop's entire household, down to the all-business secretary (not to mention the audience!). In TPW, we are made to be moved by the beautiful music; and as such, I guess we might as well just buy the soundtrack. TBW reminded me that special effects are only as good as the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fine and uplifting remake has everything going for it. A great leading man (Denzel Washington) and a great cast of characters that will lift your spirits when you are down. Penny marshal has made a new Xmas classic, and it's a much better movie than the original Bishop's Wife.I like the original as well with Cary Grant but Denzel Washington makes an even better angel, and gives an even bigger heart.Great support is giving by Courtney B. Vance and Whitney Houston, and the late Gregory Hines in one of his finest performances. The soundtrack by Miss Houston is simply amazing, and it has every that a soundtrack should have in it. This is one fine and amazing movie, see it and let a smile come a cross your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Romantic Entertaining Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a rule I don't tend to warm to remakes of classic films however the Penny Marshall directed Christmas story "The Preacher's Wife", is a definite exception and has become one of my favourite festive season viewing experiences. Based on the classic Samuel Goldwyn film "The Bishop's Wife", which starred legends Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven, this 1996 effort has a charm and slant on the essentially same story all its own. Denzel Washington in the role of an angel sent down to earth to sort out the life of a preacher who has lost sight of what really is important, is a most worthy successor to Cary Grant in the original film and Whitney Houston in the female lead displays a warm screen presence and great musical talent that couldn't be bettered in this type of story. Amazingly I only saw this film for the first time 3 years ago but it has become a firm favourite of mine ever since. Combining a traditional and much loved Christmas tale with some truly wonderful gospel singing gives this effort a really upbeat feel which however never sacrifices for one minute the more touching aspects of the story.A truly inspirational and touching story filled with some beautiful music and comic pieces is the best way to describe this beautiful little movie. I love all three lead performances here and it's a joy to see Denzel Washington, normally the star of some intensely dramatic films, in such a charming and light hearted role as Dudley. He displays a fine comic talent and teams especially well with the other two leads. If ever there was a proper successor to Cary Grant in this role then Denzel Washington is it. Whitney Houston does very well in the role of Julia and she displays a nicely touching persona especially in her scenes with her screen son. She of course comes alive in the musical numbers many of which she produced herself. I've become a big fan of gospel music after her terrific rendition of such numbers as,"Step by Step", and especially the show stopping "I believe in you and me". Courtney Vance playing the earlier David Niven role of Henry is also excellent and his performance contains a lot of the dramatic meat of the story as the essentially kind hearted preacher who is torn too many ways and sees himself loosing his family. His work with Denzel Washington in particular is note worthy especially in the scenes when he can't seem to understand just "where", this mysterious helper has suddenly come from. Other standouts in the cast are Loretta Devine as Julia's mother in a very funny performance full of great lines and wry observations about what is happening in the Biggs household, and Gregory Hines as sharp business man Joe Hamilton who in turn is also affected by Dudley's presence in his previously rather shallow life. The look and feel of "The Preacher's Wife", makes it a wonderful newer Christmas viewing experience and much of the credit goes to the church scenes with the St. Matthew's choir taking centre stage. Their singing and expert handling of all the gospel music is perfect and really gets you into the feel of the season.As a "modern", Christmas story I personally feel "The Preacher's Wife", is a most worthy successor to the well known and greatly loved earlier classics like "White Christmas", and "Miracle on 34th Street". Taking a very different slant on the story than the earlier 'The Bishop's Wife", it manages to be wholly original in its own way and makes delightful seasonal viewing. Try and see this touching film next Christmas and I'm sure it will become a treasured part of your holiday viewing like it is in my home.danceability-1, Amsterdam Holland</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another cinematic remake of an older classic that begs the question: "Why?" Especially when the changes made to script and story not only offer no improvement, but are actually giant steps backward."The Bishop's Wife," upon which this film is based, beats this one hands down in all major categories of story, direction, and acting. I even enjoyed the original soundtrack by Hugo Friedhofer far better, in spite of the fact that this film was obviously intended to be a vehicle to exploit Whitney Houston's vocal talent. (Does that remind you of another Whitney Houston vehicle co-starring Kevin Costner?)In the original movie, a need for an angel to be sent to the Bishop makes perfect sense...the bishop played by David Niven was obviously conflicted with earthly ambitions and had lost his way spiritually, sadly neglecting his wife and child in the process. In this remake, Denzel as Dudley the angel seems lost as to what his mission is. In fact, the Preacher often seems to be a better person than the angel in this version! The basic problem is that the Preacher is so dedicated in his role as pastor helping the sick and troubled ghetto kids, his time as a family man is understandably stretched thin. (Incidentally, there is a scene where Henry the preacher is spending quality time with his son, which even undercuts the film's attempt to construct this minor conflict.) Anyway, it all seems more like a job for a scheduling consultant than something as drastic as sending an angel down from heaven to perform "miracles".The Bishop's Wife was also made during a time when Hollywood did not shy away from Christian spiritual themes. While Cary Grant's Dudley the angel is clearly a messenger and servant of God, Denzel Washington's tired glances skyward seem to indicate a reluctant impatience with the Almighty that further contradicts his role and ultimate purpose in the story. And as can be expected in this era of movie sermonizing, humanism is the true "savior" celebrated on Christmas Day.A handsome cast with Denzel and Whitney, but lacking all the charm, subtle spiritual depth and cohesion of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Preacher's Wife is food film that your whole family can enjoy at christmas time. I remember seeing this film six years ago and loving it.This was Denzel's and Whitney's first foray into family territory and both actors succeed. The two have great chemistry together and the choir scenes really get your fingers snapping. Justin Pierre Edmond who played Jeremiah was also good in his first role hope we see more of him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Try</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This updating of "The Bishop's Wife" has much going for it. The cast is just fine, the productional values are on a high level, and the over all intention commendable.What "The Preacher's Wife" ends up being, however, is only an average family film. The essential difficulty, as I see it, is in Nat Mauldin and Allan Scott's screenplay. Their script seems to lack a keen sense of structure, with too many highs and peaks, often via musical performances, which emerge inserted and bloated rather than integral and balanced. The decision to provide Whitney Houston with full-scale musical numbers tends to more distort than enhance the film's focus. After some rip-rousing bring-down-the-house gospel fests, it seems like the end credits ought to start rolling . . . instead the play goes on anticlimactically.Director Penny Marshall might have stepped in and ordered some sharp editing to tighten matters up and shape the film into an effective dramatic form. For this seems to be not a musical, but a light comedy/fantasy with a few incidental music interludes.How wonderful to see the excellent Denzel Washington in a role and film in which he so lovingly believes. He invests his earnest effort into making this a winner, and he's most ingratiating in the part. Houston makes a nice costar, and the entire cast is delightful.There's much to enjoy in "The Preacher's Wife," and there are some mighty pleasant humanistic expressions to savor and delight in along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie right when it came out, when I was a kid. I loved it then, and still watch it every Christmas (and sometimes when the holidays are still months away!). I've seen the original movie "The Bishop's Wife" and liked it, and I think this remake is very well put together. Whitney's voice in incomparable. The perfect soundtrack for her to be singing on. Heart-warming and fun for the whole family. It's one of the few movies that I can watch over and over and over again, and not tire of it. Denzel plays Dudley with just the right charm, and tries to do the right things, but doesn't always seem to make it. Courtney Vance is the picture of a frustrated pastor (I come from the family of a minister. Trust me, he plays the tough times to a tee!) still trying to do what he should, and managing to make it work. Great family film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very romantic and touching movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PREACHER'S WIFE, to me, is a very romantic and touching movie. I thought that Julia (Whitney Houston) looked very pretty in the black dress she wore when she and Dudley (Denzel Washington) went to Jazzie's together, which is where she sang "I Believe In You And Me." I would have to say that "I Believe In You And Me" is my favorite song of this movie. She sounded good when she sang that and every other song she sang in the film. Reverend Biggs (Courtney B. Vance), to me, was a good preacher and father. One of the funniest things about the film is when the boiler broke when the choir was rehearsing. That was weird, but it was funny! In conclusion, if you are a fan of Denzel Washington or you should see this movie if you haven't seen it. When you see it, prepare to be touched and amazed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very strong piece of cinema, particularly the performance of Denzel Washington. As always, he shines above all others in his creative endeavors, and though it does not compare overall to his more recent works (i.e. "Man on Fire", "Training Day", and "The Hurricane") it is still a wonderful move. Not actually a remake of "It's A Wonderful Life," (an apparently common misconception) the film is a remake of a much older black and white film called either "The Reverend's Wife" or "The Minister's Wife" (I am uncertain which). This piece is a step in a different direction from the roles that Washington typically plays. Though it has it's serious and heavy dramatic moments, the film is, overall, a comedy. And, like his other departure "Training Day," this film succeeds at what it was attempting to be, a warm and realistic dramedie. If you haven't seen it yet, it is definitely worth the viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington (Glory, Crimson Tide) is a good actor, but there isn't much he could do about The Preacher's Wife a boring and predictable film. Denzel stars as an angel who is sent to Earth to help out the preacher, played by Courtney B. Vance (Hamburger Hill, Panther), with his church and family. Whitney Houston (The Bodyguard) plays his wife who Denzel gets a crush on. The film had some potential with Washington as an angel, but can't do anything with it. Houston is OK as the wife. Vance is a talented actor and does the best he can with a boring role. For those who are interested, my mom loved the film and owns it, so I recommend the film if you like movies such as, While You Were Sleeping and Sleepless in Seattle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Preacher's Wife (1996): Dir: Penny Marshall / Cast: Denzel Washington, Whitney Houston, Courtney B. Vance, Gregory Hines, Loretta Devine: Wonderful comedy that expresses God's work through angels. Whitney Houston is the preacher's wife whose singing voice graces the film. Denzel Washington plays the angel sent by God to help her and her pastor husband. Courtney B. Vance plays the pastor who is doing too many things at once. He visits hospitals but learns that his son is accused of a crime that he didn't commit. His other issues regard a boiler that is breaking down. On top of that he is being pressured to sell the land for which the Church stands. He also has less time for his wife who sings with the choir. Obviously he does not believe Washington when he shows up claiming to be an angel. Beautifully directed by Penny Marshall with nifty visual elements and an eye for detail. Charming performance by Washington who seems rightfully placed in this sincere role. Also a plus is strong supporting work by Vance who remains sturdy despite events surrounding his life. Houston has a great voice and suitable for the material. Gregory Hines has the thankless role of villain out to claim the land. Great film that will remind viewers of a holiday masterpiece called It's A Wonderful Life. The result is a heart warming comedy about answered prayer. Score: 9 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Christmastime favorite at our house!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this a remake of a similar title/plot? Sort of.Is this one better? Even though I'm a big fan of classic movies, I have to say (having seen both) that "The PREACHER'S Wife" IS a better movie than "The BISHOP'S Wife."Firstly, there's the music. Man! I wish they'd make a soundtrack CD of the whole movie's songs. You can find a FEW of them out there, but not all and not just altogether and on an audio CD.Obviously the late Whitney Houston's numbers are great, but there's also some group numbers, etc of other actors' music that I think is outstanding too.Secondly, Denzel Washington, Courtney B. Vance and Houston as well as Jenifer Lewis, Gregory Hines and Justin Pierre Edmund all just give A+++ performances in every scene. (Jennifer Lewis' character is just hilarious.)SPOILER ALERTAnd I love how the directors/writers dealt with the accidental attraction of Washington and Houston and yet took a moral of upholding Julia and Henry's marriage as his ultimate goal and avoided any sexual betrayal etc. Hence, it stays a good, uplifting, family Christmas movie.And it's a holiday favorite at our house. We watch it every year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>problematic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reverend Henry Biggs (Courtney B. Vance) leads a poor church in a struggling neighborhood. He has placed his work above his wife Julia (Whitney Houston) and son Jeremiah. She leads the choir. Property developer Joe Hamilton (Gregory Hines) is taking over the neighborhood. An angel named Dudley (Denzel Washington) comes down to answer Henry's prayers. Henry tries to help local kid Billy Eldridge who is falsely arrested for armed robbery. His incompetent secretary Beverly (Loretta Devine) is concerned that Dudley is replacing her.This movie is trying for some comedy which Courtney B. Vance is unable to deliver. The pairing of Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston would be great if they're in another movie. Her singing is tremendous but her relationship with Dudley is awkward. She's married and he's an angel. The most compelling part is Billy Eldridge but his part is very small. The whole thing is problematic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, The Bishop's Wife with Cary Grant and David Niven remains a brilliant Christmas movie. But I must admit that its remake, The Preacher's Wife, isn't bad at all. As a vehicle for the singing talents of Whitney Houston it surely succeeds and I think the gospel setting is a great idea as well. Denzel Washington is charming as angel Dudley, Whitey does a great job as a disappointed wife (and sings wonderfully) and Courtney B. Vance is very convincing as a preacher who has lost hope.Strangely there were not a lot of things copied from the original black and white movie. It looks like the people behind The Preacher's Wife only took the basic idea of the original movie and then made up its own story. I think the lack of commercial success is due to the fact that movies about angels don't fit in these cynical times anymore. With James Stewart, Frank Sinatra and Cary Grant in a black and white production you could get away with it. But in these modern days? I doubt it. The Preacher's Wife is no classic, but it's a nice movie when you want to watch a (musical) Christmas film during the holidays.</fullReview>

Nothing matches Whitney Houston. That alone makes the film a must see.And, Denzel Washington. What can I say, He is fantastic in everything he does, and the chance to see him play an angel is a real treat. It reminds me of Devil in the Blue Dress or The Mighty Quinn . Those two films showed a different side to Denzel and this film is in that vein.With Courtney B.

		<fullReview>Nothing here for Conan the Barbarian or Texas Chainsaw Massacres fans, but plenty of moving, comforting, bolstering spirit for those who understand that the "big bang" wasn't a self-causing event. The stately Bishop's Wife is a fine and worthy film, but in The Preacher's Wife we not only give the lie to the notion that all sequels are inferior grade "let's cash in on the cachet of the original" vehicles. All the principal players are incandescent, bringing questions of faith, hope, love and charity into affecting relief. (If we have the capacity to care) We are, in this film drawn into the lives and concerns of its major characters. Some of these are: the struggle of a pastor of a financially troubled church to hang on to his mission, his integrity and the love of his life, his wife's worries about the life and health of their marriage, the fate of an orphan bosom friend of the pastor's son, and the struggle of a homesick (for earth) angel to stick to his assignment and forego extraneous corporeal and earth-bound pleasures. If you have a heart and soul you can't but be grateful for this film treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Can't We All Have an Angel Like Denzel Visit Us?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A completely ignored and under-rated life-affirming tale that never did really find an audience when released in late 1996. "The Preacher's Wife" is a remake of the "The Bishop's Wife" (a golden-age Hollywood experience from 1947 that starred Cary Grant) that works due to Denzel Washington's charming performance. Washington is an angel from Heaven who is sent to Earth to help a struggling inner-city reverend (Courtney B. Vance). Vance's church is about to fall under the hands of land developer Gregory Hines and his marriage to choir leader Whitney Houston also seems to be on the rocks. Can Washington change everyone's life for the better or will he just make matters worse? Nice direction by Penny Marshall (a film-maker who just cannot seem to get the respect she deserves) and the appealing pairing of Washington and Houston make "The Preacher's Wife" one of the better family-oriented productions of the 1990s. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great hit movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie, it was warm, funny and it was nice to see movies evolving around strong morals and themes like religion, love, family, etc.I thought all the actors did great, Whitney's singing is incredible as always. If you're in the mood for a family or christmas movie, then you will enjoy it. It's very warm.Also, to the previous person who said that it did terrible in the BOX OFFICE, you forgot to check your stats because it actually did very well. The Preacher's Wife grossed over 48 million dollars in the USA back in 1996, which today would easily make it over 60 million in adjusted box office. It wasn't a blockbuster but it was definitely a hit. If you want action then don't see the Preacher's Wife. But if you want to see a warm movie about true values in life and that will make you feel good afterwards, then check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute, Romantic remake of The Bishop's Wife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was simply an adorable film with an awesome soundtrack! The characters are real, the dialogue was good the plot and directing was fresh and funny. Denzel Washington makes a very debonaire angel.. and Whitney Houston has the voice of an angel. The supporting cast and characters are all very good too, many of them turning in excellent comedic performances... the chubby bus driver and the church office secretary were great.Penny Marshall did a great job with a super cast. It was fresh, romantic, touching and funny. My whole family just loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look a little harder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not one that was made to make awards and reach the hierarchy of its peers. It was developed for the holiday season but it was also made quite simply to remind us that in life there must be faith. Much like the message at the end of the movie, just because you can't see air, doesn't mean its not there. Faith can be religious but in this movie, faith went much further and it would appear some failed to see this aspect.Those who say their bored are perhaps the very people that need the message of the movie much like Ms. Houston. It speaks about love that is everlasting not only in the terms of religion but in our lives, relationships and our communities as a whole. It is very odd that anyone would not enjoy this movie. It is uplifting and funny, but most importantly if you are human it makes you take a serious look at those around you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>all the ingredients of a good holiday film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Preacher's Wife' contains all of the ingredients that a good holiday film needs. The film is about a preacher who is struggling to find the romance with his wife, and he meets an angel who has come down to sort things out. The film also has an element of comedy to its touching story and the characters in it. The story is what makes this film a good one, and it is worth watching around the holiday season. It's generally a feel-good film, but it is not one that stands out completely with an original plot and stunning cinematography. It is simply a fun film, and it succeeds in that aspect. Just expect it to be another take on a romantic holiday film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barely Watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me state up front that I am a fan of both Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston. I am not, however, a fan of this movie.The script is a complete mess; this movie doesn't know what it wants to be or wants to do. None of the leads is particularly credible in his or her roles. The story is not funny enough to be a comedy, nor compelling enough to be a drama. Another problem, and a big one, is the constant lead-ins to Whitney Houston musical numbers that don't really fit the story.I didn't find this movie very entertaining, and frankly, there were a couple of times I surfed away looking for something better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gospel version of the Bishops Wife about an angel who comes down to help a clergyman find direction in a battle between family and the pressures of his job.Denzel as an angel is inspired casting. Actually the cast is uniformly good, I only wish the script hadn't let them down. I supposed the fact that 50 years had passed since the first film required that some changes be made to the script and plot, but did they really have to move in the direction of TV movies? Its good but things could have been so much better, and I'm not saying that as a fan of the original.Certainly worth seeing but given the choice see the original since it will make you feel good all over for days, this one does the same thing, but only for its running time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful sort-of-love-story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can you say love triangle? Except one of the parties is an angel. And he can't do anything about it. This is a touching story, one of my favorite Denzel Washington films. He plays an angel sent to help sort out a ministering couple and their church - and marriage - woes. But in the meanwhile, he falls in love with the preacher's wife (Whitney Houston). What follows is a feel-good story with just enough action to keep the story moving. My favorite part, however, was the vocal performance, and of course Whitney Houston shines. The odd thing was, I first heard of this movie because of the anthem they sang - it was released as an octavo, and our choir director got it for our sanctuary choir. That led me to check out the movie. It was well worth the effort. While films like "The Bodyguard" showcase Houston's pop talent, "The Preacher's Wife" gives us the privilege of a taste of her gift for sacred music. No wonder the angel fell in love. She has the beauty and talent to rank with the angels. The really cool part is you spend the whole movie wondering if he will act on that love or be a good angel and not interfere. In the meanwhile, he gets to help a lot of people. I strongly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY romantic and touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PREACHER'S WIFE, to me, is a VERY romantic and touching movie. I thought that Julia (Whitney Houston) looked VERY pretty in the black dress she wore when she and Dudley (Denzel Washington) went to Jazzie's together, which is where she sang "I Believe In You And Me." I would have to say that that ("I Believe In You And Me") is my favorite song of this movie. She sounded good when she sang that and every other song she sang in the film. Reverend Biggs (Courtney B. Vance), to me, was a good preacher and father. One of the funniest things about the film is when the boiler broke when the choir was rehearsing. That was weird, but funny! In conclusion, if you are a fan of Denzel Washington or Whitney Houston, you should see this movie if you haven't seen it. When you see it, prepare to be touched and amazed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel Washington's best romantic comedies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is much better than the other romantic Denzel Washington movie which used to be "Mississippi Masala (1991)." Though, this movie was also released at the same time "Jerry Maguire (1996)" did. I like this one, too. I have never seen Washington play an angel before. But now I did, which surprised me. What I mean by "better" is that Washington and Houston are both on each other's side, so they make a great attraction. This movie somewhat reminded me of the time we were leaving to Florida from home when it was snowing here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Black 'It's A Wonderful Life'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the same way that Motown produced a black version of 'The Wizard of Oz' whereby they could see characters that looked like them, the makers of 'The Preacher's Wife' produced a black version of 'It's A Wonderful Life' so that the characters could reflect the black community. Although I sympathise with the emotional connection of audiences with characters that look like them, I do feel that 'It's A Wonderful Life' was a universal story and that 'The Preacher's Wife' was just a black version of it that didn't improve upon the story. It was an enjoyable film to watch, but one couldn't help being overwhelmed with the tones of 'It's A Wonderful Life' ringing in the distance. There were, however, some redeemable qualities to it. It teamed up Whitney Houston with Denzel, as well as Gregory Hines as supporting artist and Courtney B. Vance from 'The Tuskegee Raiders' and 'Black Panthers'.</fullReview>

All the supporting actors were good. I loved Jennifer Lewis as Houston's mother. This is a movie that I recommend everyone to see. It's a great movie to see during the holidays with family or just during anytime of the year. I wish this movie got the recognition it deserves. Not only is the film good, but it has a great soundtrack that I had to go out and buy as soon as I saw the movie. Good job to all that was in the great movie! Go out and see this movie! You will pleasantly surprised. If Siskel and Ebert gave this two thumbs up, then you know it must be a good movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Holiday movie; underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all can probably agree on one thing: Whitney Houston does not have much to offer as an actress. All three major films she was in ("The Bodyguard", "Waiting To Exhale" and "The Preacher's Wife') she pretty much played herself. The direction by Penny Marshall ("A League of Their Own") is great and makes you almost "feel" Christmas. Denzil Washington is great as the angel Dudly who visits Julia and Rev. Henry Biggs (Houston and Vance) to help get their marriage back on track. The drama between the two isn't very believeable, but perhaos because it's a family film it wasn't as focused on the divorce part which I think was one of the film's mistakes. It focuses more on the fact that it's Christmas and their church is about to be run over by a contractor (played by the late Gregory Hines) named Joe Hamilton. Hines's role is very believeable and we unfortuantely don't get to see enough of him inthe film. The kids in this movie are very cute and add to the holiday cheer. The music is also excellent which is also available on the accompanying soundtrack. While "The Preacher's Wife" didn't get the recognition as "The Bodyguard" did (somewhat overrated film) I still think it's a great family film. I guess the main problem was that it's a happy movie based on a troubled marriage. Kidswouldn't exactly enjoy the drama in the household but grown-ups might not enjoy the cheezyness. I can see why it didn't do as well but I still think it was underrated and is great for older children (11+) and adults alike. 3.5/5 stars B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a weak remake of the Bishop's Wife, a wonderful film from the 40s with Cary Grant, Loretta Young, and David Niven creating the characters as they were really meant to be from the novel by Robert Nathan. There were some aspects of this movie that I liked. The children were uniformly good. The camera work and street scenes were well orchestrated. The singing was a joy. But the script has Denzel Washington basically lusting after Whitney Houston, which is not supposed to be what the movie is about. In one scene Dudley (Denzel) and Julia (Whitney Houston) are gazing into a store shop window. He is telling her in a tone that is obviously sexually oriented. . . that if she wears a certain negligee her husband would'nt want more of a present than that. But it is he that is practically drooling. C'mon, he is supposed to be an angel!? Everything that was sweet and wonderful about the original film is missing from this one. I have usually liked Penny Marshall movies in the past, but this one misses the boat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad film but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reviewer Ichaerus commented that "The Preacher's Wife" was a remake after an older film. The film was, in fact, "The Bishop's Wife" [1948] starring Cary Grant (as 'Dudley'), Loretta Young (as the 'Wife') and David Niven (as 'The Bishop'). I thought the original was far better than the remake because, while Denzil Washington is a fine dramatic actor, he was miscast in a light comedy role. Even at her best - and this was far from her best - Whitney Houston isn't suited to comedy either (actually I think her roles thus far show that she isn't suited to any genre). The main actors in the original film, Cary Grant and Loretta Young, were arguably among the best comedic actors of their day, and David Niven was always reliable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of the Bishop's Wife had some good points, all in about the last third of the movie. Recalling that while I greatly enjoyed the original film, 1947 film "The Bishop's Wife", starring Carey Grant, David Niven and Loretta Young, when I happen to catch snatches of it on TV, it now seems slow paced. I think we have become accustomed to faster moving stories. But The Preachers Wife, if anything, is even more plodding than its original.Denzel is a terrific actor, but I'm guessing Penny Marshall (Laverne DeFazio in TV's "Laverne &amp; Shirley" smash hit comedy series)directed him to play his part as someone who wanted to be romantically involved with the Wife, but couldn't. In the original, as II recall. Cary Grant is, of course charming, as only Cary Grant could be, but he remains focused on what he was sent down to Earth to do.The actor playing the Preacher, was the one part I thought better than the original! Which is quite a compliment when you consider that I was very fond of David Niven, both as an actor and as a wit. (As I recall, Mr. Niven was on stage during a televised Acadamy Awards show when a buck naked streaker ran across the stage. I don't recall exactly what he said, but the always dapper and unflappable David watched the streaker with an amused grin on his face and then made an ad lib remark that had everyone laughing.) Courtney B. Vance played the part of Reverend Henry Biggs so well that I became convinced that Denzel Washington was playing a double role, just wearing make-up to change his appearance. (Denzel has the acting talent to alter his persona, even without makeup. Except perhaps for the same face, I would never confuse his Malcome X, his Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, his "Creasy" in "Man on Fire", or his Dr. Jerome Davenport in "Antwone Fisher" with each other. Even without makeup or props you can tell then apart.) Maybe Mr. Vance's talent is recognized within the entertainment industry (his filmography suggests he's been kept pretty busy), but the awards for which he has been nominated are not ones I follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black remake of a disappointing 1947 Christmas concoction entitled "The Bishop's Wife". The set-up has an angel coming to Earth to help out a beleaguered minister and his lonely spouse, who's in charge of the church choir. This is heavenly help they need, but don't seem to want. Penny Marshall directed, preserving the Christmas theme but not quite getting the jubilant results she probably hoped for. It's whimsical in the worst sense, with heavy-handed charm forced upon the audience without benefit of a really good screenplay. Too much reliance was placed upon the cast (the film was probably cast before the script was even written). In any case there are very few laughs, however Whitney Huston is appealing and effortless on the screen--she is a natural, making her scenes flow with ease. The male roles are far less interesting. ** from ****</fullReview>
