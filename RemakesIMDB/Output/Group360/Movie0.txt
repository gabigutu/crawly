		<fullReview>What a pleasure to revisit this Henry Koster little gem. Everything works in the most unexpected way. The mystic magic of the story is utterly contagious. The unexpected musical number on ice skates by Cary Grant, Loretta Young and James Gleason made me want to see it again straight away and thanks to the new technologies I was able to do it on the spot. There was a remake of this movie a few years ago, remember? No, probably not. Denzel Washington in the Cary Grant part and Whitney Huston in Loretta Young's. To see both films back to back should be a masterclass in film anthropology that proves without a doubt that with the passing of time we have lost something invaluable. I don't know what it is. Maybe there isn't a word for it yet. What I would love to share with all of you is the joy that "The Bishop's Wife" borough to me. Even Gladys Cooper's upper class monster has a moment of exquisite redemption. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the kindest, gentlest, most beautiful movies ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good script and inspired casting is what makes this film a real winner.Cary Grant as Dudley the Angel has a charm that transcends his role.When he enters a room his presence fills the screen -- you know he is there even if you cannot always see him. Loretta Young (who was a last minute replacement) is positively luminescent when she gazes into Dudley's face.This goes for Elsa Lanchester and Gladys Cooper (the staff at the Bishop's house) too -- they have absolute adoration in their countenance. Not hard to do with Cary Grant I am sure -- but they take it to the spiritual level.David Niven gives just the right amount of disbelief and cynicism as the Bishop that may have lost his faith.I have always enjoyed performances by Monty Wooley and again he is perfectly cast as the self-described "has-been scholar." The special effects are wonderful for a time (1947) when special effects were pretty much in their infancy.Movie books classify "The Bishop's Wife" as a fantasy -- but there is so much more there than that.It is a love story, a comedy, a drama and an all around inspiring film."Peace on Earth; good will towards men."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holiday Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bishop's Wife (1947- Directed by Henry Koster) A bishop (David Niven) trying to raise money for the construction of a new cathedral, prays for guidance. His answer comes in the shape of an angel named Dudley (Cary Grant). Everyone loves the bishop's new assistant, Dudley that is. Especially, the bishop's wife (Loretta Young)! What follows is a joyous movie that showcases each of the three stars best talents. Grant gets to flash those pearly whites of his and be charming and Young gets to look beautiful and torn between depressed husband and fun-loving Dudley, and Niven gets to showcase his British stiff upper lip while at the same time display some very funny slapstick pratfalls. It's a charming movie that has lots of holiday atmosphere. Boys choirs singing, park skaters skating, city shoppers shopping, etc. Why only a scrooge wouldn't like this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touched by an angel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dudley, the angel, comes to earth to teach a thing or two to the people of this town, or so it seems. He touches everyone he encounters in a positive way. The message is how we humans get so involved in things that are so unimportant that we miss the big picture. This film, directed by Henry Koster, is a classic. In fact, I am surprised it doesn't play more during Christmas, or maybe I have missed seeing it around that time of the year that is the setting for the angel's appearance. It seems as though Dudley is pointing to the arrival of Christmas at a time, perhaps, when the season had still a non-commercial aspect and it was, after all, a family affair.The cast was exceptional. Cary Grant is Dudley, the man/angel who turns everything he touches into a lesson on how to be kind. Julia, the bishop's wife, plays the neglected woman with conviction. David Niven plays the preoccupied bishop who is trying to bring the moneyed people of town to his side in order to erect his monument to his own ego. Gladys Cooper is also a distinguished face in the film. She is Mrs. Hamilton who learns a thing or two about humility. Elsa Lanchester was a happy figure in whatever film she appeared. Monty Woolley, as the professor is also effective. James Gleason was one of the most prolific character actors of his generation. He is excellent as Sylvester, the taxi driver who befriends Julia and Dudley. Their ice skating sequence is one of the best things of the film.This is a film to treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top 3 best Christmas movies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I discovered this wonderful movie quite by accident. It was Christmas time many years ago, late at night, I was cruising the channels one last time before retiring for the night. when I saw Cary Grant's face flash on the screen. I had to pause my frenzied surfing. Cary is one of my all time favorite movie stars. Fortunately the movie was just beginning, so I sat back to watch, and was treated to a wonderful Christmas surprise. Cary is at his wide screen best. All of his charm, wit, and charisma. Endowed by heavenly powers, he bestows his angelic persona upon a small town bishop who is overwhelmed by his mis-guided quest to build a magnificent "earthly" cathedral to glorify God. In frustration at the difficulty in building this false edification to God, he prays to God for guidance. The bishop's prayers are answered in the form of "Dudley", as Cary's angelic character in called. Dudley proceeds to weave a benign spell over a whole cast of wonderful characters to remind them of the true meaning of Christmas. This charming Christmas fantasy truly warms the hart and kindles the soul.David Nivin plays the perfect foil for Cary's assignment of "answering the bishop's prayers". Loretta Young's charming demeanor as the bishops devoted, but neglected wife, distracts Cary("Dudley")from his primary mission, and leads the audience on a heart warming journey through small town America at mid 20th century, during a memorable Christmas season.My young son saw this movie for the first time when he was nine years old. It has become his favorite Christmas movie. He even requested to watch it last summer at age 12. I recommend this film for the whole Family. Put a fire in the fire place, light the scented candles, cuddle up with your love ones, and have a Merry "Cary" Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He's a real angel of a guy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reverend Henry Brougham (David Niven) is working very hard to get his cathedral built--in fact, he's so busy speaking to wealthy clients and attending business meetings that he forgets that the one thing he needs most in this world is his wife Julia (Loretta Young) and their daughter Debbie. As Julia feels increasingly hurt at Henry's neglect, who should swoop in but the mysterious, charming Dudley (Cary Grant), telling Henry he's an angel who's there to answer Henry's prayer. Henry can't quite believe this even as Dudley seems to make himself quite at home in Henry's life, charming the wife, the child, the maids... even the taxi driver Sylvester (James Gleason). It's all a bit too much for Henry when Dudley finally brings the cathedral's biggest patron Mrs Hamilton (Gladys Cooper) around to the idea of donating the money to the homeless instead of to the cathedral. Is there anything left of Henry's life that he can salvage? And can he really compete against an angel who has God and little miracles on his side?THE BISHOP'S WIFE is a sweet little romantic dramedy, perfect for a Christmas night curled up before the TV set. You have to give it credit for packing in a lot more story and real, human characters than you'd expect--it's not stock Christmas heart-tugging schmokum (did I just make up a word?), but a story that's quite genuinely intelligent and real. It's not perfect (what is?), but its presentation of the characters, especially Dudley and Henry, ring true. You can believe that Henry, underneath his bitterness and myopia, really loves his wife. He's just... forgotten his direction in life, is all. Niven does an excellent job with the character, keeping him just this side of prim but making him sympathetic especially when he asks Dudley to put up his fists for Julia. My favourite secondary characters are Sylvester, played impeccably by Gleason, and the slightly dotty Professor Wutheridge (Monty Woolley). They're actually real *people*. Actually, they even fare better than Julia herself, whom I didn't particularly warm to. I wasn't annoyed by her, but nor did I feel that it was very likely she could get a reverend and an angel to almost come to blows over her. It's a shame that Loretta Young spent most of the film looking pensive, and even in her character's moments of joy--say the ice-skating scene--she simply fails to leap off the screen and run away with the audience's hearts.Cary Grant has no such problem, however. From the moment he strolls onscreen as Dudley--the guardian angel every girl wished she could have--he has everyone's attention. He makes Dudley just a little bit roguish, a little bit dark. You couldn't really take Grant seriously if he's all decked out in an angel's costume, halo and harp and all, but you *can* imagine him as a sort of very human kind of angel. Which is exactly what Dudley is. It's mostly the smaller moments Grant sneaks into the film and his own performance that make THE BISHOP'S WIFE compelling viewing, and if you came to this film as a Grant fan, you certainly won't leave it disappointed.All in all, the final film is well-drawn-together, cleverly written and directed, and benefiting from its two powerhouse male leads... Niven cleverly underplaying his part, and Grant suffusing Dudley with the charm and deep, hidden vulnerability he can suggest in all his characters without so much as faking a pained expression. It's definitely a great way to spend a Christmas night, and perhaps any other night. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Choice Role For Cary Grant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "Life With Father," also issued in 1947, this is an old-fashioned "nice" film. Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven make up an impressive trio of stars, but Grant has the best role. He makes the best of it, too, with expressions on his face that are funnier than most of the lines he delivers.One not-so-family oriented thing he does, however, as the "angel," is go out on dates with the bishop's wife (Young). No respectable married woman, especially back then, would ever do that. At least the two of them recognize this fact later. Niven plays the bishop and, as usual in the film world, is portrayed as a weak clergyman.Nonetheless, it is a charming, feel pretty-good movie that entertains through most of it. There are a few special-effects in here, too, that are good even by today's standards. One example would be the Christmas tree lighting scene.This would make a good Christmas movie for people looking for suitable films during that holiday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Light But Worthwhile Holiday Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not quite on the level of "It's a Wonderful Life" or the best of the "Scrooge" adaptations, "The Bishop's Wife" is still a worthwhile holiday classic. Much of the story is relatively lightweight material, but that's not necessarily all bad, since it thereby avoids taking itself too seriously. It is simple but thoughtful, and often quite entertaining. When it picks up a little more substance towards the end, it is then that much more effective for having maintained a lighter tone for much of the movie.The cast is quite strong. Very few actors could handle a role like Dudley as well as Cary Grant does, giving it plenty of energy and believability. David Niven and Loretta Young also give fine performances. With the likes of James Gleason, Gladys Cooper, and Elsa Lanchester, plus a couple of good moments from Monty Woolley, the supporting cast also helps a great deal. The production is unpretentious, even downplaying the possibilities for miraculous tricks much of the time, and it works well.The 1990's remake had a couple of strengths, but it was not up to the standard of the classic version. Denzel Washington, Whitney Houston's singing, and a fine supporting performance from Gregory Hines provided some good reasons to see it. But there was too much predictable padding, and the level of the screenplay and the directing were not up to the standard of the cast.As for the classic version, it avoided most of the potential mistakes. By taking itself less seriously and focusing on a few core developments, it fits together nicely. The closing sequence in particular works very well, and it is easily the best part of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When An Angel Envies The People He's Helping, It's Time To Leave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year before this film came out another heavenly visitor in the person of Henry Travers visited earth after getting a complete and thorough briefing on his client James Stewart in It's A Wonderful Life. But other than learning that Travers liked a flaming rum punch we didn't learn too much about him.Just as James Stewart prayed for guidance, David Niven who's a man of the cloth prays for it in The Bishop's Wife. Instead of lovable old Henry Travers, Niven gets as his aide, Cary Grant. Niven proves to be a difficult client, but rather than expose him to an alternate universe, Grant does what he can in this world. Of course the woman who plays the title role, Loretta Young, is quite the distraction and Cary's having difficulty focusing. Niven's a good man who's been raised to the post of bishop due to rich parishioner Gladys Cooper. He's to do her bidding and she bids that a cathedral be raised as a monument to her late husband. The burden of his conscience and dealing with Cooper has caused Niven to lose sight of what's really important in the world.This is a Christmas season film so you know that everything will work itself out. If Cary Grant were an angel than I imagine he's very much like Dudley this minute. If I had a problem this Yuletide season, I'd kind of like Cary Grant to help me out, if I couldn't get Bing Crosby.Loretta Young is radiant as the woman who causes Cary's halo to slip and David Niven is as charming as he always is. I also liked Monty Woolley as the professor and James Gleason as the cabdriver.Make The Bishop's Wife a must for the Yuletide season. And see it back to back with the version that stars Denzel Washington, Whitney Houston, and Courtney B. Vance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an incredibly wonderful movie which ranks right up there with Casablanca in my eyes and has been sorely under-appreciated by the usually astute IMDb voters. This is Cary Grant's best performance. He is impeccable as an angel who falls in love with an earthling but continues to perform his duties anyway. He gets it all right. Cary Grant is an angel. He was originally cast as the Bishop but demanded to be given the role of the angel instead. This movie is a joy to watch as it shows the power of transformation and the power of the human spirit. I particularly appreciated how Cary demonstrates the humanity of people at all levels of society from the top to the bottom. This is truly a movie for the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Gregg Toland Visual Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At last here is an angel who really has fun just doing his job. Dudley (Cary Grant) brings a subtle joy to his interventions and interactions. The enjoyment factor is what makes "The Bishop's Wife" special. This charming and seemingly simple film that has been a Christmas holiday staple since its release in 1947. But like "Groundhog Day", the surface simplicity is misleading, as this is an allegorical tale about the importance of getting outside ourselves and taking steps to escape the ruts of our day-to-day lives; i.e. finding a better way of living. Dudley works a few minor heavenly miracles but his real power is as a cheerleader and personal guide. No need to be an angel to exercise this kind of positive influence on others. Dudley the angel comes to earth to help a Bishop (David Niven) juggle his professional and marital commitments, the conflict being that his priorities have changed since his promotion from the priest of a struggling parish. Only the bishop knows that Dudley is other than human and it takes most of the film before he is totally convinced. Meanwhile his wife and many others in the town are swept up by Dudley's charms. The Bishop is pre-occupied with securing funding for constructing a new cathedral but begins to catch on that Dudley and his wife are getting along so well that the unimaginable could occur-the angel stealing his wife. If only one word could be used to describe "The Bishop's Wife" it would be subtle. The special effects are minimalist but effective, the careful framing and lighting of Gregg Toland's ("Citizen Kane") black and white cinematography, the tentative steps title character Julia (Loretta Young) takes as she starts to experience happiness again, and the slow realization by Bishop Henry of how far he has drifted from what matters the most.The unity and subtlety is best illustrated in the scene of Henry walking up the sidewalk towards the Professor's (Monty Wooley) apartment. Although a few minutes from the end, this is actually the film's climax as Henry is finally confronting himself. As he walks forward the dark screen begins to get brighter; in step with his progress toward spiritual change and discovery is the end of his physical journey. He moves symbolically (and literally) toward the light.Rounding out the strong cast are James Gleason (Max Corkle in "Here Comes Mr. Jordan") Elsa Lanchester, and Gladys Cooper. Henry and Julia's young daughter is played by Karolyn Grimes (Zuzu in "It's a Wonderful Life").A nice thing is that while the film's "little" miracles are done on screen they are interwoven into the fabric of the story instead of dominating a scene. This casualness fits the tone of the film as does the occasional satirical line. The most memorable conversation is Cooper's demand (she is pledging money for the new cathedral) that the George figure in the proposed "St. George and the Dragon" stained glass window be made to resemble her late husband. Then Niven (deadpan) asks her whom she wants the dragon to resemble.There will be a few who do not enjoy this film but I recommend it to anyone who wants a nice holiday film, or who is interested in a relatively deep allegorical tale of one's capacity to be a positive influence on others, or who just wants to see a truly awesome example of technical film-making.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Enchanting Film I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this wonderful movie during my period of watching all Cary Grant movies which began 3 years ago and is almost complete. I had never heard of this film but was totally transfixed within the first minute. There's not one scene that bores me because it's truly such a delightful film. Cary Grant is so underrated, but here he does some fabulous acting even when he's not speaking. His face is even more expressive in his younger years which works to his advantage and is a sign of good directing as well. David Niven is wonderful, too, for the character he plays (a jerk, but a redeemable one). The real jewel is Loretta Young. She's so contagiously sweet but not in an obnoxious way. Every character actor is wonderful and the casting for this movie is just perfect.I don't like to review the plot, always afraid I'll accidentally throw out a spoiler, but it's so much better to me than "It's a Wonderful Life." I know it's a popular favorite, but I find it quite stressful. The Bishop's Wife, on the other hand, is enchanting. I really don't like admitting I have a crush on a character, but Cary Grant's Dudley just makes me swoon. If you're not a hopeless romantic and/or a male, it's still a great film, especially for the holidays. I've already watched it 5 times in the past week and that doesn't include viewings from the past 2 years. It's like a great song that you have to buy and then goes on your "forever" play list. The Bishops's Wife is one I keep watching over and over and it's in my top 10 on my "forever" movie list of 10's. I don't give out 10's lightly, but this one sealed the deal on my first viewing. I'm so grateful for it's existence and encourage everyone to be transported and enchanted by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great cast of star's in a wonderful Christmas tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies that stand the test of time have a few things in common. First, a compelling story line. Second, a strong cast. Finally, the drawing factor. The Bishop's wife has all three.Dudley, Played by Cary Grant, is an Angel sent to David Niven, the Bishop who wants to build a grand Cathedral. The angel (Cary) Is sent as an answer to his prayer. But the answer may be surprising. The cast includes Loretta Young as the Bishop's wife (Julia) and Monty Wooley as the professor. Loretta Young was a wonderful choice as a caring wife and mother. I can't say enough about Cary Grant. He is as good as it gets.Karolyn Grimes was very charming in this picture. She Played Loretta Young and David Niven's little girl. She appeared in a number of important scenes and was simply tremendous. I had her on my radio show last year and she was very warm. She talked about how Cary Grant would read to her on the set and how kind he was. Not only to her, but to everyone around him. She said he really loved children. Karolyn also spoke warmly of Loretta Young. Their Relationship lasted long past this movie. She said Loretta sent her uplifting bible verses up until the day she passed away."The Bishop's Wife" was released February 16th 1948. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It won for, Best Sound. My daughter and I were taken on a private tour of (The Lot) Formerly United Artists Studio, by a friend of ours. This was where "The Bishop's Wife" was filmed. We were taken to the executive building and shown the trophy room. "The Bishop's Wife's" Oscar for best sound was there on display.When the filming began, Cary Grant was cast as the Bishop and David Niven as the angel. After Henry Koster took over as director, he felt the casting was wrong. The scenes that were shot to that point were tossed and they started again from the beginning. Mr. Koster was on the mark with the change, This was one of Cary Grant's most widely praised roles.One final note. Karolyn Grimes, Who played the little girl, is best known for her role in another Classic. She Played Zu-Zu in It's a Wonderful Life. You Remember her legendary line..."Every time a bell rings an angel gets it's wings".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who have asked about the name of the music sung by the Mitchell Boychoir in this movie, it took years, but I finally ran it down. The original piece is named NOEL, and it was composed by Charles Gounod (1818-1893)as a classical church piece. It is not a hymn at all (in the sense that Gregorian Chants aren't hymns), but was translated for film purposes from the original church music.It can be ordered from AMAZON.COM, the entire title is CHARLES GOUNOD Musica sacraand it is track 8 on the CD. I have loved this movie with the Boychoir performance all my adult life. Yes, I know how primitive and predictable this film is when measured by the whiz-bang techno-blitz of today's movies.. but I suppose that's why I love it so.. it's a retrospective trip where for a scant hour-fifty I can revisit some of the familiar stuff that was around when life really did seem a bit simpler.. having said that, it was pretty tame even at the time. But when the Middle East is ablaze with hostility, and no one can agree on anything anymore, I find it somehow reassuring that elements of this movie still have a universal appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film. It's a movie for all seasons, not just at Christmastime. Cary Grant is charming as Dudley, the angel sent to answer the prayers of the bishop (David Niven) who is desperately trying to raise funding for a new cathedral. However, he gets under the skin of the bishop as he poses as his assistant. Dudley ultimately opens the bishop's eyes as to what is really precious in life. Loretta Young is sweet and lovely and does a wonderful job as the bishop's loyal wife. It's also amusing to see how Dudley seems to charm everyone with whom he comes in contact. It's very touching and heartwarming, and is just a great feel-good movie. Later redone as the Preacher's Wife with Denzel Washington, I believe the original is the masterpiece.

		<fullReview>A movie that transcends time, and conveys a profound message about Christmas. All three lead characters blend perfectly in a drama that focuses on a bishop's main desire to construct a new cathedral for worship, and in so doing, neglects his marriage, for which becomes a scene for contention with that of an angel.Nastaligic scenes of old capture the moments of Christmas with a famed skating sequence between Julia and Dudley, as well as the audition of the St. Timothy's boy choir. All of which, lead to the conclusion of the bishop's true desire, realization of a fulfilling life with his family and wife.The story truly highlights the spirit of Christmas, with a look back in time as the way things used to be. Amazing how the simplest of things in life in that era brought about the most joy, alongside a lesson of the true spirit of the season: giving to those who are truly less fortunate, while recognizing one's own fortune, no matter how small.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This morning I was home at my parents' house for Christmas and came across this movie on American Movies Classics. I became so enraptured I had to run upstairs to watch it on another TV because my family was being too loud and I HAD to watch it is peace. I'm 25 but a huge old movie fan and even a fan of Cary Grant, but for some reason I had never seen this before or even heard anyone talk about it. I really don't understand why this movie isn't on all the time -- it's really a hidden gem and beautiful in every way. I love "It's a Wonderful Life," but why not watch something different? And while "Miracle on 34th Street" is nice, it's awfully overwrought and too sappy for my taste -- "Bishop's Wife" is just right and Cary Grant is so handsome and sweet and charming, very restained. I would highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dudley saves the Christmas Values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starting about 1946 the tradition of doing specialized films about Christmas really began to occur in Hollywood. There had been the 1938 version of Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" with Reginald Owen as Scrooge, "Christmas In Connecticut" in 1944, and a major sequence in "Meet Me In St. Louis" in 1944, but no whole real trend with a Christmas holiday framework. Then came (within one year) Frank Capra's "It's A Wonderful Life", "Miracle On 34th Street, and this film, "The Bishop's Wife". Given that "It's A Wonderful Life" was a financial failure it is odd that the other films were soon coming out - as though Capra's failure was a stimulus to major studios to look at a potential market anyway."The Bishop's Wife" follows the same supernatural framework of "Miracle On 34th Street". There the issue was if Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) is actually Santa Claus. Even if the film's plot truly makes him "legally" Santa by a fluke in postal delivery and a sanity hearing, we really can't tell if Kris is the master of Christmas gift giving. The appearance of his cane in a deserted house that a little girl hopes for suggests he is, but earlier he looked troubled by the thought of getting the child such a gift. He does get an x-ray machine for a doctor friend, but it is got by a joint gift from Macy's and Gimbles. Here we know the supernatural figure is what he is supposed to be. Dudley (Cary Grant) is the visitor to Earth - an angel who is went when a person begs for help from the Almighty. He has been sent when Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven) prays for assistance from God when he is facing the collapse of a project of building an Episcopal Cathedral. It seems that the main source of the money is from the wealthy Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper) and the lady is quite insistent on getting everything her way on the project. When Henry balks Mrs. Hamilton (who was instrumental in getting him his Bishopric) is willing to reconsider her financing the project. Henry finds his project has disrupted his relationship with his wife Julia (Loretta Young) as his attempts to be with her keep getting undone by committee meetings. He also has little time for lower class members of his bishopric (including his old friend Professor Wutheridge (Monty Wooley)). So when he does pray for help, there are several areas where help is needed.Dudley was one of Grant's best liked roles where his romantic personality was minimized - he does go out several times with Julia, but their visits together while pleasant and joyful are relatively staid (the most exciting being skating at a public rink). He is well restrained but the occasional looks he gives to Young show that he likes her more than an immortal holy angel is supposed to. He does not fail to do what his mission is - not only assisting Niven on his duties as a bishop, but assisting Niven in reminding him of his wonderful wife and child (Debbie - Karolyn Grimes), and rekindling the spirit of Wooley in writing his masterly new history of the Roman Empire. He even finds time to put Cooper to rights - making her realize she should not feel so guilty about her real feelings about an unloved husband as to dedicate all kinds of monuments to his memory.The whole film is a charmer, and it is an odd thing that producer Sam Goldwyn had so much difficulty in achieving the final result, hiring and firing directors and actors, and getting script rewrites from Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett. But it shows how sometimes the interference of a Hollywood producer worked wonders. Somehow the original film (with Niven as Dudley and Grant as the Bishop) would have been hard to swallow - maybe Grant as the Bishop would have been interesting (it would have been curious to see him as a stuffy type, and the scene with the varnished chair would have been the type of slapstick that Grant would have been at home with). Niven played a non-angel would-be marriage destroyer in "The Little Hut" with Stewart Granger, and proved to be no competition to Granger for Deborah Kerr. Granger was not Grant, but he could be suave like Grant. I can't see him half-way competitive to Grant either.Gladys Cooper's dowager is reminiscent of her elderly Mrs. Vale in "Now Voyager", but her secret makes her terribly sympathetic. Wooley is quite sharp too, somewhat suspicious of Grant from the start, but perfectly willing to accept Niven's odd information about Grant's origins. Young is long suffering as a loyal, loving wife who realizes that her husband has gotten lost in his activities for glorifying his God. Also Jimmy Gleason has a nice supporting bit as Sylvester, the taxi driver who rediscovers the joys of ice skating.A wonderful seasonal film, it is always welcomed back at Christmas time - reminding us that one does not have to build vast monuments to dead loved ones or to God to celebrate Christmas, but just to recognize what is needed to share joy and love with as many people as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Christmas holiday classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been in love with Cary Grant since discovering his "old" movies as a teen. The pairing of Grant with Loretta Young in this film was magical for me. Their chemistry was undeniable on screen. The characters of the professor and the taxi driver added a lot to the plot as they represent opposite ends of the spectrum related to the holiday. Although I'm not a big fan of David Niven, I enjoyed him in his role as the bishop.My favorite scenes include the annual debate between the professor and merchant for the purchase of a Christmas tree (which resembles the Charlie Brown variety), lunch at Michele's where Dudley invites the snoopy gossips to join he and Julia, ice skating on the pond (whoever did the comic skating for the taxi driver was wonderful), and when the boys choir starts singing with one or two voices added at a time until the whole rehearsal room is filled with heavenly music.I look forward to viewing this classic, and not just at holidays!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally saw this movie as a child. I don't remember exactly how young I was at the time, but the point is that I was truly enchanted by the magic and holiday spirit of the movie. I didn't realise who Cary Grant(the angel), David Niven(the bishop), and Loretta Young(bishop's wife) were at the time. I just enjoyed the hell out of the movie. And now as an adult I still watch this movie every Christmas.(Since it is often neglected at Christmas time by the many TV stations that don't show it, I purchased a DVD copy for my own personal enjoyment. What is it about? A Bishop begs god to send him an aide to help him achieve his goal of building a new cathedral. Cary Grant is the very charming angel who becomes overly fond of the Bishop's wife. There are memorable scenes with a bottle of wine and a history professor, a church choir , a story told to a child, a wonderful skating adventure on a pond. Please see this movie at Christmas. It equals Miracle on 34th Street for charm and intimacy. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm and fuzzy, and funny--Niven and Young are just perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bishop's Wife (1947)This should be a holiday ritual for those who already watch Miracle on 34th Street and It's a Wonderful Life. It isn't sentimental, but it has a serious thread through all its comedy. And the performances by Loretta Young and David Niven (as the bishop's wife and her husband) are pitch perfect. You have to see it twice to realize it, I think, because you get distracted by Cary Grant, who isn't allowed to quite be himself, and he comes off stiff and a little preachy.But then, he's an angel, and what do we know about angels, really? A clever, warm, truly Christmassy film, beautifully directed and even more beautifully filmed (by photographer Gregg Toland, no less!). And it all shows. Monty Woolley and Elsa Lanchester are worth the trip alone, too, for masterful supporting acting. Cary Grant's angel is a gorgeous man, of course, and he has to face every woman falling in love with him as he goes, adding to the comedy. And then he feels a little human himself, a nice and very underplayed touch. It's all filled with such great seasonal stuff, too--shop windows, snowy streets, Christmas trees, ice skating, and even faith itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dudley Do-Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's nearly that time of year and on a cold and windy Sunday, my wife, rather than brave the elements on a window shopping exercise suggested instead we sit in and watch an old Christmas classic. So I selected this old favourite for her which she hadn't seen before (and me in many years) and it's fair to say we were both beguiled by this sub-Capra fantasy.I say sub-Capra, because, good as it is, it isn't in the class of the perennial "It's A Wonderful Life", with which it shares some plot devices, most obviously the visitation on Earth of a do-gooding angel. However where "It's A Wonderful Life" has a much darker undertone in its literally life or death narrative, here all good angel Cary Grant has to do is divert Bisop David Niven away from a glory-hunting cathedral-building blind alley back to the path of piety and humility and at the same time restore him to the bosom of his loving family.There are many Christmassy touches, with snow everywhere, ice-skating in the park, Christmas tree decorations and carol-singing boy choirs with many of these giving Dudley the angel (why do angels always cop such corny names?) the opportunity to flex his miraculous muscles to do good. It's all done very entertainingly, the special effects nicely rendered for the time and once Cary gets those less than angelic thoughts about the bishop's pretty wife, Loretta Yong, out of his head and on the way take the rich old cold widow Mrs Hamilton (Gladys Cooper) on a Scrooge-like conversion, the happy ending is never in doubt.The acting by a big-name cast is affable - Cary is hardly exercised and merely requires to look beatific most of the time and Loretta Young is attractive and effervescent. I'm not sure about David Niven in a dog-collar but he gets the best line (humorously but subtly likening Mrs Hamilton to a dragon) and Golden Age perennials James Gleason and Monty Woolley do well in support.As a whole the film seems a little too full to bursting with good-cheer and peace for all men - even driving avowed non-believer Wooley to church by the end and encouraging Mrs Hamilton to pledge her millions to helping the poor "everywhere in the world" but that might just be the cynic in me. Enjoy this for what it is, an unpretentious festive fantasy out to spread good cheer to all men - and Amen to that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fine movie--the sort of nice old fashioned film that Hollywood did so well decades ago. A delightful script, excellent acting, along with beautiful sets and deft direction make this simple movie stand up so well even today.Cary Grant plays an angel that comes to assist the extremely controlling and obsessed Bishop, played by David Niven. While Niven prayed for divine help, he struggled throughout the film with accepting the help on anything but his own terms. He soon learns of Grant's mission, but others are unaware of his Heavenly origins. Grant plays his angelic role in a very deliberately paced and casual manner--almost like combining TV's Mister Rogers with the usual Grant persona! In addition to these two wonderful actors, the film also features Loretta Young, Monty Woolley, James Gleason, Elsa Lanchester and Gladys Cooper. All did a great job of providing color and support in the film.Perhaps the biggest star of this film, though, were the sets, cinematography and direction. They created a really nostalgic sense to the film that seemed almost better than real life. The snow, the frozen pond and all the other aspects of the film just set the perfect mood. About the only negative at all (and it's a small one) is the skating sequence. While it was nice to see Grant and Young really ice skating in the beginning, using doubles for them as well as James Gleason wasn't very seamless. Having these doubles skating with darkened faces just seemed pretty cheesy but forgivable.All-in-all, this is a nice fantasy film that should be enjoyed by most anyone except the most cynical viewers.</fullReview>

Cary Grant is angel Dudley, David Niven is the Bishop, and Loretta Young is the Bishops wife. The Bishop is trying to raise money for a project. He prays for guidance and in comes Dudley. Dudley and the Bishop seem at odds with each other, is Dudley helping or is he sabotaging the Bishop. What about the wife?I like the part of the professors and his bottle of sherry.

		<shortDescription>A Christmas Treat for All Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was delighted when I saw this film again for the first time in years. It truly warms the cockles of your heart and is right up there with It's A Wonderful Life as standard Christmas fare that reminds all of us what the season is really about.From the moment Cary Grant appears as Dudley, the all too human angel on a mission, we are riveted to the screen. He's out to teach Reverend Henry Brougham (David Niven), a thing or two about Christian charity, and as we all know, "charity begins at home." It seems that in the process of trying to raise funds for a new cathedral, the good Reverend has been neglecting his charming wife, played in her sweet, dignified way by the beautiful Loretta Young.But Reverend Brougham has also forgotten that his flock needs more than a new cathedral- they need hope, faith and charity and his ministry, which he has forsaken in his quest to court the richest lady in town to donate funds for the new cathedral. Cary's Dudley is out to bring these truths home to him.But Dudley doesn't just touch the Reverend's life, he brings joy and hope into everyone's life that he comes into contact with.There's a wonderful skating scene where a taxi driver, Sylvester, played by prolific character actor James Gleason, gets to feel like a kid again and have fun with Julia, (the Reverend's wife, Loretta Young), and Dudley. This scene brought a smile to my face! All the supporting cast are excellent with Gleason, the Professor (Monty Woolley) and the maid, (Elsa Lanchester) being particular stand outs. But Cary steals the show as the irrepressible Dudley.In the end, you feel that this angel has truly earned his wings! Settle back and get ready to be charmed!</fullReview>

Although the movie is takes place at Christmas, it's message that there are still good people in the world is appropriate for any time of year. On top of wonderful acting, we are treated to some cute special effects, wonderful, light humour and a beautiful performance by a boy's church chorus. I would recommend watching this film when there is nothing to distract you from the humour and every bit of action going on in the story as you will want to take in every moment.I had never heard of this movie until I received it for Chrstmas, so it might be a little known treat for all the die-hard Cary Grant fans out there.

He makes you believe he is a saintly angel. Loretta Young was good in that she held back, did not overact or overwhelm with her presence. At first you aren't sure where the movie is going, but it falls into place. You feel the winter scene, you start to think it is going to be snowing when you look outside your front door. The atmospherics are wonderful. I prefer this film to some of the more commercial, better known holiday movies. It would be nice if more people were aware of this movie. What a treat.</fullReview>

"The Preacher's Wife,"or "City of Angels" were not up to par as "It's A Wonderful Life." Since it dealt with classy Cary Grant as the angel intervening human relationship. This Classic is on par with "It's A Wonderful Life," many like it. 10/10 BRAVO!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film. Cary Grant is charming as the angel sent down from heaven to help David Niven out after he prays a silent prayer to Almighty God to help him. David Niven is a minister with a lot on his hands. He wants to build a catherdral and he has to convince the richest woman in town to give them the funds. It has a charm and wit and comedy, along with a simple enjoyable movie. Loretta Young who is as beautiful as always,plays David Niven's wife who finds Cary Grant (Dudley) very charming and fun to be with. On one particular outing, Dudley and Loretta meet up with Monty Wooley( and old friend of the minister and his wife) who offers them a glass of wine. The fun part is that because Dudley blesses the wine quietly, the bottle of wine never runs out. It is continuely full. Miracles abound in this classic Christmas movie. Everyone of all ages will delight in watching it over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Years ago I read somewhere (a film encyclopedia, I think) someone's opinion that Cary Grant was the best film actor of all time. At the time I thought that was ignorant hyperbole. The older I get, and the more Grant film I see, the easier that opinion is to believe. He's superb in this film, as are Loretta Young, Monty Woolley and David Niven. The best acting in the film, in fact, happens whenever Grant and Niven are in the same scene - their chemistry is extraordinary!Although I saw this film on television when I was a teenager, I never gave it another thought until I saw it again about five years ago. Since then it's become one of my favorite Christmas films - schmaltzy, God knows, but that's what Christmas films are supposed to be, and this one is wiser and better made than most.

Excellent supporting performances are added by Monty Wooley ( the professor ) and veteran character actor James Gleason in the role of a philanthropic cab driver who is just happy to have Cary and Loretta as passengers for their 'uniqueness'.The main plot shows Grant TRYING to be a faithful assistant to a Bishop who is insecure at the very least about many aspects of his life.

		<fullReview>Guided by one of the better writers/directors of sophisticated comedy and starring one the great casts ever assembled. Led by Cary Grant who is at his absolutely most definitive here, The Bishop's Wife is a holiday film which slips you its Christmas moral as slyly and as delicately as Cary Grant restores faith in the jaded Monty Woolley with a miraculous bottle of Sherry. Layers upon layers and full of understated magic and charm, you just cannot argue with its logic and message of faith, even if you are someone as cynical about religion as I am. This film has always kept me from becoming a total pagan, I have loved it since I discovered it at about 2 AM on PBS close to Christmas in 1982. It is one of those few movies, at least for me, which transcends being just a movie. Like the old professor it renews my faith in the world every time I see it.Cary Grant never looked more amazing, acted more charming, or brought to life a deeper character than Dudley the Angel. Every moment he's on screen is a pure pleasure. David Niven as well is exceptional and never gets close to going over the top in dealing with his brush with the supernatural. Loretta Young is terrific as his melancholic and unhappy wife whom Dudley finds he's falling in love with while trying to solve the problems of their marriage by making the Bishop see the errors of his ways. It is this conflict which makes the story adult and adds a bit of a dark streak to the proceedings. Though he's restored happiness to all the characters in the end, Dudley walks away with a touch of pathos in the film's final scene; an eternal wanderer who found a happiness he can't have and is resigned to keep wandering. At the point when Loretta Young takes his arm as they're crossing the street in an earlier scene he realizes that a requited affection possibly growing toward love has seeped into their relationship and therefore is a danger that must be dealt with. But the fact that near the end he actually hints at using his powers for selfish ends speaks volumes about the earthly humanity of his character. He actually covets another man's wife, and a Bishop's wife at that! This is a heavenly entity with torn emotions and we feel it in the film's final moments. He's never tempted to stray from the honest path of course but he does walk away in the end with a bittersweet heart.This is not the only thing going on in this complex and moving story by any means. Dudley weaves a tapestry of magic with all the film's characters. Elsa Lanchester, James Gleason, Gladys Cooper, Sara Haden, and Karolyn Grimes are all touched in ways crucial to the story. A masterpiece which the Denzel Washington/Whitney Houston remake (like the abysmal remake of Miracle on 34th Street) profanes. This is one of the truly great films. A perfect 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Stars" Shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's fun to dig into the vaults occasionally and come up with a classic that perhaps you've never seen, or haven't seen for a long time; and it's especially satisfying when you come up with a gem like `The Bishop's Wife,' directed by Henry Koster and starring Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven. It's trying times for Bishop Henry Brougham (Niven), who's trying to raise enough funds for the construction of a cathedral for his church; he has a patron, the widow Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), who will donate handsomely, but only if she is allowed to `call the shots' as it were. Henry has become increasingly distracted by it all, as well as distant, a fact which hasn't gone unnoticed by his wife, Julia (Young). When Henry prays for help, his prayers are answered in the form of an angel named Dudley (Grant), who announces himself to Henry and quickly manages to ingratiate himself with Julia. And with Dudley's help, Henry ultimately discovers what is truly important in his life. Koster has crafted a pleasing and thoroughly entertaining movie that examines the good and bright side of human nature, and how refreshing it is in an era when so many films explore the dark side exclusively. It's an elegant film with performances to match, with the charismatic Grant giving a relaxed and polished turn as the angel. He fairly oozes charm, seemingly effortlessly, with a presence that is captivating to the other characters as well as to the audience; and he brings a sense of peace and serenity to the proceedings that gives total credibility to Dudley. Grant makes it easy to believe that he's the angel he claims to be. Young, as well, is simply outstanding as Julia, lending a dignity to the role while managing to remain down-to-earth and totally accessible. There's an endearing warmth about her that makes her someone with whom you would like to spend more time; a gracious woman of classic beauty, both inside and out. And Niven, as Henry, strikes a countenance that defines class, and he exacts the sympathy of the viewer by making his character one with whom you can readily identify; his consternation becomes yours, and you breathe a little easier once you know Dudley is on the job. The supporting cast includes Monty Woolley (Professor Wutheridge), James Gleason (Sylvester), the terrific Elsa Lanchester (Matilda), Sara Haden (Mildred), Regis Toomey (Mr. Miller) and young Karolyn Grimes (Debby). Watching this film, it's easy to understand why it's been designated as `classic.' Well written and stylishly delivered, `The Bishop's Wife' is an absorbing, memorable film that makes you realize (either again or, perhaps for many, the first time) why Grant, Young and Niven are considered `stars,' and how much great character actors like Woolley, Gleason and Lanchester contributed to so many great films during their careers. For a satisfying movie experience, especially during the holidays, this is one film you should definitely check out; you won't be sorry. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"All the shining gifts . . . "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One reason I keep returning to "The Bishop's Wife" is its brilliantly supportive score. I don't know which of the three credited composers composed the emotionally irresistible theme, but it's fascinating to realize how it's used.It plays first as snippets of incidental music underscoring certain scenes. It imperceptibly builds throughout the film until the Bishop's Christmas Eve sermon and the last lines of the picture: "Loving kindness, warm hearts and the stretched out hand of tolerance. All the shining gifts that make peace on earth." Then the theme explodes in final full orchestral triumph over the end credits. So even the "incidental" music turns out to have an enormously gratifying emotional arc and payoff -- like every other element in this expertly crafted piece."The Bishop's Wife" is, really, a small intimate story with none of the elaborate allegorical scope of Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life." I constantly discover nuances in the performances I hadn't noticed before; inventive camera angles and compositions by legendary cinematographer Gregg Toland ("Citizen Kane"); and flawless pacing by director Koster.Every scene, every sequence, has an arc and a payoff and builds naturally to the next. The actors are simply brilliant.Cary Grant is especially remarkable for his easy layering of subtle comedy, warmth and other-worldly spirituality in his tricky role.All the shining gifts of Hollywood artists at their finest. That's "The Bishop's Wife"'s reward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoroughly enjoyable film..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A thoroughly enjoyable film which, in my humble opinion, is over a million times better than the remake ['The Preacher's Wife'] with Denzel Washington. [*Terrible* movie! Gah! Stick to the original!] Every time I watch this version, I find myself rooting for Dudley and Julia to get together.. Then again, maybe the reason is that Dudley is CARY GRANT! *I'd* go with him! Of course, I'm also a 16-year-old fangirl, so maybe my opinion isn't one that should be taken too much note of.I first watched this film a few days ago while under the influence of some teenage angst. This flick, along with a few other Gary Grant films ['The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer', 'His Girl Friday', and 'Every Girl Should Be Married'] cheered me up an incredible amount and restored some of my faith in humanity. [Unfortunately, not my faith in religion, but that's unlikely ever to happen.]All in all, this is a wonderful film which I recommend viewing when you're feeling a bit down on your luck and mad at the world. Remember, things could be worse: Cary Grant could be trying to steal your significant other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I also am a big fan of Christmas movies and find this to be one of the best of all of them. Loretta Young and Cary Grant have so much chemistry between them. There is also an innocence and sweetness that keeps you smiling all through the movie. This movie is so meaningful because it shows how we should treat our fellow man- that being petty or getting caught up in the daily drudge isn't why we are here. How many movies do you know that attempt to answer why we are here in such a charming and subtle way? I will finish with a paraphrase of one of the last lines from the movie. Reading a Christmas sermon, David Niven describes a stocking that we never fill, and have even forgotten to hang. It's the stocking of the infant Jesus- what would He wish for? Kindness, warmth and love and a stretched out hand of tolerance. Let each of us put in his share :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for all things Christmas, especially Christmas movies. I love 'em all -- "It's a Wonderful Life," "Miracle on 34th Street," "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation," "A Christmas Story," etc. But this is the film that makes all the others seem like runners-up.Dudley (Cary Grant - playing an angel) is an inspiration to me each time I see this movie. Goofy, I know, but true. It's filled with humor, not the punch line kind, but the conversational kind. This is a movie of magic - and that's the best kind of movie for Christmas.By the way...don't settle for the Whitney Houston remake "The Preacher's Wife," it's a shadow of the original. Why did they bother?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch this movie every Christmas with my sisters, and have for about 30 years. I absolutely love it. Obviously.It's a beautiful story with the gorgeous Loretta Young, Cary Grant, and David Niven - what more could you want? The only giggle nowadays is all the stand-ins required for ice-skating and harp playing, but I can overlook that. Monte Wooley, Elsa Lancaster and James Gleason are supporting players. You really couldn't ask for a better cast to tell the story of Dudley, an angel who falls for a mortal - and reminds her husband of what's really important in this world. Karolyn Grimes, who plays Young and Niven's daughter, makes appearances occasionally and talks about this film and "It's A Wonderful Life." She looks like Meryl Streep now. She says that Grant played with her all the time between scenes.If you want to get into the Christmas spirit, or hold onto it - this is one for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Film for the Holidays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bishop Henry Brougham" (David Niven) is having a problem. Essentially, he wants to build a new cathedral for a church but a wealthy widow named "Mrs. Hamilton" (Gladys Cooper) wants to have it named and in honor for her late husband. Naturally, Bishop Brougham is opposed to this on the grounds that it is too crass and commercialistic. However, there are no other donors wanting to step up and he knows that if he is going to get the necessary funds he has to do it during the holiday season when people are more charitable. Otherwise, if he wants to get it built he will have to capitulate to Mrs. Hamilton's demands. Not knowing what else to do he prays about it and when he looks around an angel named "Dudley" (Cary Grant) appears. Unfortunately, the Bishop doesn't particularly care for Dudley's mannerisms and his concern transforms into distrust and suspicion when Dudley begins to take his wife, "Julia Brougham" (Loretta Young) all over town. And it's this tension between the two of them that makes this movie so funny. Yet, while I liked the performance of Cary Grant for the most part, I didn't especially care for the manner in which Dudley began to behave in a romantic fashion toward Julia. It just didn't feel right. But that aside, it was still a nice movie overall which viewers might want to check out some time during the holidays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"...All the shining gifts that make PEACE ON EARTH!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very sweet movie! Perhaps a little too sentimental for some, but I find it quite enjoyable. I've seen it numerous times over the years and never grow tired of seeing it. Loretta Young is so likable and sweet. She has such a simple, but luminescent beauty. I had forgotten how lovely she was until I saw this again recently. She has such bright, trusting eyes - and what a gorgeous mouth ( and I'm a female)! I love to hear David Niven's voice - it's like velvet, even though his character is a bit mixed up and has his priorities out of order. And what can you say about Cary Grant's performance? This movie would have been milquetoast without him in it. He brings just the right amount of sweetness AND mischief (like many of his roles). His comedic timing was perfectly subtle, as the role called for, but even better were his facial expressions. The man's a genius!My favorite dialogue is from the sermon at the end:"We've forgotten to hang it up... the stocking for the child in the manger. It's HIS birthday we're celebrating. Don't let us ever forget that. Let us ask ourselves what He would wish for most. And then, let each put in his share: loving-kindness, warms hearts, and the stretched out hand of tolerance. All the shining gifts that make PEACE ON EARTH."What an exquisite note on which to end the movie. And what a timely message since WWII had only ended 2 years back, and "peace on earth" certainly takes on a whole new meaning in 1947 when this film was released. And it certainly has meaning for us still today...especially today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Fact for "The Bishop's Wife"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have to say that "The Bishop's Wife" has a permanent and valued place in my library of favorite holiday viewing. I wanted to add that I recently had the opportunity of visiting with Bob Mitchell, the director of the Mitchell Boychoir that figures so prominently in the movie. Bob is now (2007) 96 years old, and is as sharp and capable as a man half his age. He recently came to my town to perform as the organist for a showing of the silent classic "The Phantom of the Opera." Bob began his work as a silent movie organist back in the '20s, while just a teenager. His boychoir, called either the Mitchell Boychoir or the Mitchell Singing Boys, provided music for more than 100 movies over a long span. Today, he is still active as a church organist and silent movie organist. Bob is one of the most interesting and endearing people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensitive Christmas story with a perhaps surprising edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I discovered this movie on TV many years ago, never having heard of it previously, but what a joy, being able to call on such talents as Niven, Grant and Loretta Young, not to mention stalwart supporting players such as Gladys Cooper, Monty Woolley and Elsa Lanchester, gave the studio a head start of course. The movie might be seen as sentimental nowadays (though why that's a pejorative I don't know). In fact I think a better word is sensitive. It's apparently simple tale of an Angel being sent down to help a misguided but essentially good Bishop who has lost sight of the real Christian way, is given a human edge and saved from schmaltz by having the Bishop become jealous of the Angels affections for the Bishops wife, and with reason, indeed the Angel does have human feelings for her! Sensitivity is the mark of its treatment of the characters and their flaws, the atheist, the rich widow etc. if even in our secular world Christmas encourages us to reevaluate our priorities in light if Christian teaching, it's a good checkpoint in our too busy and often misguided lives. This movie is a warm hearted and entertaining nudge in the same direction, and we need it. After all were only human!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect reminder for why I like B&amp;W films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As others have said, this is a good and probably under-rated film. The three principals are all very good, though Niven and Grant are the strongest in my view.Rather than comment on the story, I want to comment on how the film looks. Part of this film's charm, in my opinion, is how it is unafraid to show dark. Many exterior shots happen in the dark or near dusk, which in black &amp; white is rendered exquisitely. It perfectly evokes the combination of claustrophobia, mystery, and wonder associated with the short days and long nights surrounding Christmas. The shabbiness of the professor's apartment and some of the street scenes is perfect as well. It adds an aged, yet timeless quality that meshes well with the subject matter.It may seem odd, but this black &amp; white film, partially filmed in the dark, is a visual treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tops It's a Wonderful Life in my book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The subtle humor and acting of a slow warming morality play acted in this movie makes it entertaining yet not stressful or depressing like the Stewart Christmas classic.Niven plays, Henry, the fussy, uptight but capable of tenderness bishop wonderfully as he reacts to Dudley, Cary Grant's mischievous, endearing while determined to complete his holy task, angel.Loretta Young plays, Julia, the soulful, angelic wife who must endure the church politics and games her husband chooses to indulge in over his family and parishioners. Cary Grant's Dudley becomes not just as the answer to the Bishop's prayer but to her need for attention and loving affection.In the end it all gets wrapped up smoothly after silly obstacles and confusions, but the most memorable story arc for me was the moral dilemma of the angel Dudley.The initial scene of the movie where Dudley is casing the crowd like a shark on the hunt while enjoying the celebrations, meant to me that he was waiting and looking for a soul to save or help by 'listening' to inner prayers and needs going through people's heads. The whole isolating 'angelic' Julia staring into a window scene, has Dudley being taken in by her first, then sensing her inner pain. I read that story setting scene as Dudley's first calling. He admits this by faking accidentally running into the Professor and pries him for more information about Julia, hesitates..and her husband the Bishop, which he couldn't get from Julia's inner voice.Since Julia didn't 'officially' pray for help in her life, Dudley couldn't go to her directly. I feel the only reason he responded to the Bishop's prayer was due to his fascination and urge to help Julia. In my off-screen-story imagination, Dudley was hovering over Julia's house waiting for a reason to intervene into her life and conveniently got his wish through the Bishop's prayer. When he first talks to the Bishop, his continuing fascination with Julia keeps popping up from staring at her picture to intentionally introducing himself. Dudley arranged himself to be available for this mission blind and unaware of his reason being earthly drawn to a human female.The Bishop's prayer in my view was totally incidental to the fact that Dudley in hearing Julia's pain/needs first sans a prayer, knew that resolving the Bishop's need for guidance would be key to healing Julia's pain. But in the process would allow him every excuse and reason to get close to her and near. To me the story, I like to follow is Dudley becoming blind to his growing affection for humanity and getting lost and confused to the point of basically falling in love, while going through the steps needed to get Julia's needs, ie the Bishop's priorities, back in sync. Dudley admits this at the end by professing to Julia and begging for her pray/ask for him to stay, like a genie asking for someone to make a wish. Being around her allowed him to experience 'heaven' as an immortal tasked for too long in the mortal world. The growing fleshly mortal sensations Dudley was beginning to enjoy in he finally had to admit and reject.So for me The Bishop's Wife is a 'passion' play for all of the core characters in coming to terms and realizing their true happiness and mission in life and rejecting the fake and shallow. It's a movie I can watch all year round, especially as a Cary Grant fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christmas Charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a Christmas classic long on charm, the 1947 THE BISHOP'S WIFE had a remarkably troubled history. When the film originally went before the cameras it starred noted actress and Academy award winner Teresa Wright in the title role with co-stars Cary Grant as the Bishop and David Niven as a slightly wayward angel--but somewhere along the way Wright ran afoul of director William Seiter, who, for reasons that have never been clearly explained, fired her. This in turn brought down the wrath of producer Samuel Goldwyn, who looked at the film, didn't like what he saw, and fired Seiter.Goldwyn brought in director Henry Koster, who looked at the film and very strongly felt that Grant and Niven were in the wrong roles--and it took some time and effort to convince the two to make the change. Then, by the time shooting was set to resume, Wright was visibly pregnant and was replaced by Loretta Young. In consequence of these changes, there wasn't a scrap of film that could be salvaged from the original footage, so the film restarted from scratch at enormous cost. As a result, and although it was well received and did good box office, THE BISHOP'S WIFE was never the great financial hit Goldwyn had hoped: it was so deeply in the red before it opened that even the best attendance couldn't do more than recoup its cost.The story is simple but charming. Episcopal Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven) has become so consumed by the worldly demands of building a new and very expensive church that he has effectively lost touch with his faith--and, not incidentally, his wife Julia (Loretta Young), who is increasingly unhappy in the marriage and therefore presumably open to temptation. Their difficulties come to a head as Christmas approaches, but to their good fortune they are visited by an angel with the improbable name of Dudley (Cary Grant.) Handsome, suave, and able to show Julia a good time, Dudley soon incurs Henry's jealousy, and through this Henry comes to appreciate Julia and rediscovers his own spirituality.Like most Christmas-oriented films of its era, THE BISHOP'S WIFE is less about serious theological issues than it is about whimsy, and while some may consider the result shallow it is nonetheless a truly charming bit of Christmas cheer. The three leads are memorable, with Grant a standout as the slightly devilish angel, and they are strongly supported by the very entertaining performances of Monty Wooley, Gladys Cooper, and Elsa Lanchester. The script is witty, the direction even if not greatly inspired, and the whole thing adds up to a highly entertaining two hours.THE BISHOP'S WIFE was remade in 1996 as THE PREACHER'S WIFE, but the result was lackluster; gentle charm is not among the strengths of modern Hollywood. As for the DVD release of the original, it is at best so-so; the transfer is on the dark side, a fact that tends to take the edge off the film's emotional brightness. Even so, recommended just for the fun you'll have watching three of Hollywood's classic players execute a lightweight script with considerable grace and, yes, Christmas charm.GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Christmas Special Film from 1947</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyed this film years ago and recently viewed this film on TCM and enjoyed this great Classic film where Cary Grant, (Dudley) plays the role as an angel who visits Bishop Henry Brougham,(David Niven). It seems that Bishop Henry is in trouble with his wife and they are sort of drifting apart because of his concerns of trying to help a very rich lady who wants to build a huge cathedral in memory of her husband. As soon as the Bishop prays, Dudley appears and he introduces himself and tells him he is an angel who wants to be his assistant and help him solve some of his problems. Julia Brougham, (Loretta Young) plays the role as the Bishop's wife and she loves him very much but the Bishop never seems to have any time to be with her. This film is full of comedy, drama and romance and Cary Grant and Loretta Young have a great chemistry between them and they make this film a gem of a classic to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gentle humor and unforced sentiment make for a touching and moving Christmas film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about this movie is so nearly perfect, it's hard to fault it in any way. The performances, settings, camera-work, music, all come together to create an unforgettable Christmas classic.The humor is there, but never over-emphasized at the expense of the characters ,or the serious story line. Dudley the angel is sent to help a bishop beset with problems ,and accomplishes his mission in time for Christmas Eve. David Niven plays the bishop with just the right combination of confusion and dignity, and Loretta Young's fragile beauty and charm could melt a stone. As the angel Dudley, Cary Grant is superb, with a mildly amused, but never condescending attitude toward the mortals he's been assigned to help. His quiet humor and gentle manner show him in a very different light than movie viewers are used to seeing.The supporting roles are also well cast and beautifully played, including James Gleason's cheerful cab driver, Gladys Cooper's wealthy matron ,who transforms completely under Dudley's influence, to Elsa Lanchester's maid and Sarah Haden's secretary. The young actress who plays the Bishop's daughter is also very good; best remembered for her role as Jimmy Stewart's youngest child in It's A Wonderful Life, Karolyn Grimes.And we mustn't forget Monty Woolley, as the elderly professor. His geniality is a delight, his mordant wit at his own expense gradually replaced by a renewed hope in himself after meeting Dudley. The last scene, with the angel smiling warmly at the professor, as he prepares to enter the church on Christmas Eve, is a truly sweet moment.Cynics, beware. This is truly a touching and heartwarming movie, something almost inconceivable in this day and age. A perfect movie to curl up with, when feeling down and discouraged, like the beleaguered bishop of the title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christmas charmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this many, many times and always look for it on TV during the Christmas season. This film certainly must have charmed those at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and sciences to have received five Academy Award nominations for 1947 including two of the biggest categories, Best Picture and Best Director. It did win the Oscar for Best Sound but Samuel Goldwyn didn't get a Best Picture statuette and Henry Kostner didn't get a Best Director Oscar either. It was also nominated for Best Music Score and Best Film Editing. This is a nice film and a fun light fantasy comedy but I think the Academy was a little too generous with five nominations. Loretta Young did get a Best Actress Oscar for 1947 but not for her role here as The Bishops Wife but for The Farmer's Daughter and it brought Young who had been one of Hollywood's hardest working actresses making tons of films over almost 20 years to the A-List stature she deserved. Cary Grant is the "minor" angel sent to earth to help sort things out between the marriage of the Bishop played by David Niven and his wife and their congregations quest to build a new cathedral. Kostner was a great director of comedies and did several including Harvey, It Started with Eve and The Inspector General in his long career. Veteran cinematographer Gregg Toland who was one of the best in Hollywood cinema beautifully photographs this film. Based on the Robert Nathan novel it is adapted for the screen by Leonardo Bercovici and Robert Sherwood but Goldwyn was unsatisfied with the final product and changes were made by by Billy wilder and Charles Brackett. There were lots of problems with this films production. The original film was directed by William A. Seiter with Cary Grant as the Bishop and David Niven as the angel. Theresa Wright had been cast as The Bishops Wife but after her costumes had been made and filming was underway she discovered she was pregnant and Loretta young was brought in. Goldwyn hated Seiter's film, fired him and somehow let Grant talk him into switching roles with Niven. Despite all these problems it garnered a five Academy Award nominations, won an Oscar and made the top ten film list of 1947 for both Film Daily and the New York Times. Also among the cast are Elsa Lanchester, Monty Wooley and James Gleason. I would give it a 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw 'The Bishop's Wife' on the TCM channel. This would be a nice one to own on DVD. It is a very nice story about a bishop (Niven) determined to build a new cathedral, sucking up to the rich widow whose $Millions can swing the project, and in the process failing to appreciate his wife (Loretta Young). He prays for guidance and Cary Grant sort of shows up. Much like Prot did in K-Pax. He announces to the bishop that he is the answer to his prayers. SPOILERS follow - read no further if you have not yet seen this movie.In the end, the answer to the bishop's prayers is not a new cathedral, but use of the $Millions to help the poor and homeless. Plus, a fresh appreciation for his wife. In the process, Grant's angel gets a bit mesmerized by the wife, apparently the first time he has actually become attached to an Earthly being. Grant and Young make a much more attractive couple, but he eventually had to leave. Very nice story, and a very enjoyable movie.DEC2004 update: During the 12 months since my initial viewing, I bought the DVD and it is a very nice one. A great movie to watch every Christmas season.</fullReview>

I'm going to buy the DVD version to see it all, since there were certain scenes which were cut for TV commercials (I saw it on the CBC, our crown corporation; you'd think they'd get an uncut version for broadcast).I've only seen the more recent remake, the Preacher's Wife once, and found that tedious to watch.

		<fullReview>"The Bishop's Wife" is simply a tremendous movie, beautifully combining the talents of Cary Grant (Dudley the angel), David Niven (Bishop Henry Brougham) and Loretta Young (Julia Brougham). Monty Woolley is marvelous as Professor Wutheridge and a superb supporting performance is turned in by James Gleason as a skating (?) taxi driver. Dudley is an angel sent to guide the bishop who had prayed for help in getting a magnificent new cathedral built. The problem arises from the fact that Dudley becomes enamored of Julia who has taken a back seat to Henry's obsession with the cathedral. While struggling with his personal crisis, Dudley has an angelic influence on all the lives of the people he meets. Originally, Grant was to portray the bishop while Niven was to have the role of Dudley. Thankfully it worked out as it did because in my mind Cary Grant is the perfect Dudley. This movie also contains one of my all-time favorite scenes - the ice skating session in the park. It is a scene which gives me a warmth inside and I just can't help but feel good watching it. As a matter of fact, I guess I could say the same thing about the entire film!</fullReview>

The story line carries the message of not getting so caught up in the world's distractions that you forget who you are; such a message could be told with heavy-handed preaching, yet this movie is funny where it needs to be and warms even the most cynical heart to its moral.Cary Grant is superb (I firmly believe that you might see Cary Grant in a bad movie, but you'll never see a bad Cary Grant), playing the angel who knows exactly what the bishop needs, but connives to have the latter discover that on his own.David Niven is great as the formerly idealistic preacher who has become so pragmatic as to sacrifice his own beliefs and in so doing hardened himself to the simple joys of life and love.Loretta Young is the epitome of goodness, bringing joy wherever she goes, but there is a bittersweet quality to her as she realizes just how far she and her husband have drifted apart.Monty Wooley plays an old curmudgeon to the hilt, representing so much of the world that considers itself too sophisticated for Christmas, yet seems to be deeply troubled that his life has strayed so far into cynicism.Dudley makes each of them whole again, and though none of them remember him, his mark on them is readily apparent.This movie is sweet without being sappy, simple without being idiotic, and reverent without proselytizing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christmas fantasy leaves a warm glow in your heart...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not actually a Christmas film, 'The Bishop's Wife' does have a holiday glow about it, due largely to the performances of Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven in the starring roles. It starts around Christmas time with an amusing scene wherein a scholarly professor (Monty Woolley) enters a shop on a snowy day to choose a small Christmas tree. At the centerpiece is a skating scene with angel Dudley (Cary Grant) making it easy for the non-skater taxi-driver (James Gleason) to move around the ice in easy strides. And as the angel, Grant performs other minor miracles too. It's all very amiable entertainment that leaves you feeling good about humanity. Loretta Young gives one of her warmest performances as the woman who realizes her marriage to the bishop (David Niven) is on a rocky course. While there's a predictable happy ending, it's all done with great style and taste. Grant seems to thoroughly enjoy his role as the angel and gives it his usual deft comic touch. Henry Koster, who specialized in mostly lightweight vehicles, does a fine job on this one. Well worth seeing, especially during the Christmas season. Don't bother with the inferior remake starring Whitney Houston.</fullReview>

Niven is perfect, (the now late) Loretta Young is sweet and Grant's performance is...well...angelic! Stunning performances from a fabulous supporting cast, but so effortlessly portrayed that you don't really realise their skill.Not a Christmas film per se, but best viewed at Christmas.

		<shortDescription>The Best Christmas Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it doesn't have the themes of It's A Wonderful Life and no, it is not one of the movies that are rerun over and over and over again like Miracle On 34th Street, Christmas Story or Scrooged. Most critics call it a 3 star feel happy film. It is a feel happy film and that's why it is such a great movie but most critics pan it just because theres not some great theme or plot in it. The Bishop's Wife is just one of those charming movies that portrays the world as you'd wish it to be and has Dudley as everyone's great angel. It's the best fantasy because from the start it doesn't show Grant in angel wings but rather as a human so it makes it seem like there is Dudley qualities in all of us.. a great film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frequently Fascinating; A Charming B/W Christmas Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script's history for "The Bishop's Wife", 1947's popular humanistic hit feature, may explain why it was very good, slightly imperfect, and ground-breaking. The novel on which the screenplay was based, a Robert Nathans fantasy-for-the sake-of-the-idea effort, was adapted by Leonardo Bercovici, Robert Sherwood, Charles Brackett and an uncredited Billy Wilder. What emerges is story about democratic humanism, not monastic religion nor objectivism nor more unpalatable alternatives. The authors tried to make a film about priorities, but since it has no one who knows how to seek these precisely, although they try, it lacks some of the concentrated power of several other Christmas classics. I find it, as a writer and actor, an intensely interesting story which only sometimes involves the emotions strongly. The storyline is simple. An episcopal bishop (David Niven) has been convinced by an elderly lady (Gladys Cooper) to build a great cathedral as a monument to her late husband; his own rather poor charges would be its main parishioners. He appears to have lost sight of priorities--he neglects his wife, acts superior, ignores others in his bailiwick, and is now more tycoon than clergyman. His wife (Loretta Young) is unhappy, but only quietly speaks against his course of action. He is sent help, as Christmas approaches, in the form of Dudley (Cary Grant)--an angel...Dudley announces himself only to Henry, the bishop; to the others, including staff Elsa Lanchester, and Sara Haden, a daughter Debbie and wife Young he is "a new assistant" hired by Henry. Having proved himself to his new boss, via small miracles, he sets about helping everyone, in ways they did not quite expect. These include a lonely cabdriver (James Gleason), a reclusive professor (Monty Woolley), the wife, the help, the children who sing at the church, and Cooper, whom he gets to donate her money to the poor by making her realize her motives for building the huge and showy cathedral are false. I will not reveal the ending to this charming and only-occasionally-troubled tale; Dudley's explanation of religion to the daughter does not quite hold together; but the fun in the film for me as for millions lies in watching Grant suggest the dangerous strength of the human side versus the angelic--and the simplicity of the good will he uses, by means of which he awakens individuals to realizing that even if life cannot be perfect, it could be better if they set their priorities in order and then did something about them. The film is well-acted throughout. Grant is understated as Dudley; Young also does well, because she does not have to act too much.. Niven makes a professional Henry, perhaps with fewer nuances than he would have supplied later in his career. The supporting cast is uniformly first-rate, from Gladys Cooper to Woolley, Lanchester and the very capable Sara Haden. A skating sequence featuring charismatic Gleason is a highlight of the film for many. Veteran Henry Koster directed with surprising power. Legendary Gregg Toland did the cinematography, with attractive art direction supplied by Perry Ferguson and George Jenkins. Julia Heron provided the many set decorations; costumes were done by Irene Sharaff and Adrian. Hugo Friedhofer did the lovely musical score. In the large cast also note Regis Toomey, Almira Sessions, Isabel Jewell, Karolyn Grimes as daughter Debbie and many others. A beautiful B/W production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Charmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bishop's Wife" is one of the better Christmas movies out there. I wouldn't place it as high as "Miracle on 34th Street," but it's in that league, and certainly has a similar feel. Henry Koster does a fine job of giving the film a leisurely pace without letting it drag, and the performances are uniformly solid. It is somewhat of a shame to see David Niven stuck in a part that doesn't allow him much room for humour, as he can be so funny. And I do have to admit that Loretta Young's allure alludes me somewhat. She doesn't seem very dynamic for two men (or should I say a man and an angel) to be making such a fuss over. But she's certainly more than passable.One of my favorite performances came from Elsa Lanchester, in a minor role as the family maid.This movie becomes magical only once---during the ice skating scene between Cary Grant, Young and James Gleason. That could have gone on for hours and I would have been transfixed. But not every movie can be magical, and this film is a very good (if non-magical) one. Pop in on a snowy night, light the Christmas tree, make some hot chocolate, and enjoy.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully unique holiday film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally, Theresa Wright was to play Julia, the title character and Dana Andrews was to be the angel, Dudley, opposite Cary Grant as the Bishop. Luckily, the enchanting Loretta Young was cast after Wright became pregnant. Then Andrews left and Niven entered.However, the roles were reversed. Grant was to play the Bishop and Niven the angel. Thank God, this wasn't filmed as intended because they are perfect as filmed. This film is both sad and serious, fun and joyous. It's an absolutely marvelous holiday fantasy that delivers it's message of the true spirit of Christmas without coming close to hitting you over the head with it.It's, along with Harvey (1950, a high water mark for director Henry Koster, who had considerable help from supporting cast members James Gleason as a cabbie and Monte Woolley as a beaten down old professor who finds new life through Dudley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, the demeanor of the story is dated, and might seem tame to today's audiences, but a light sense of irony and innocence might just be what our cynical world needs.I believe it rates as a classic Christmas fantasy right up there with Miracle on 34th Street. The basic theme of faith in the redemption of the wayward is just as well presented.The three main characters could not have been better cast. Henry, played by David Niven is properly cynical, a perfect counterpoint to Julia's (Loretta Young) quiet faith. Cary Grant's portrayal of Dudley, the angel, is classic. He is the perfect hero for this film.I was especially delighted with the Mitchell Boychoir Christmas song in one sequence. I wish I had that song on a CD. I'd like to play it at Christmas. But I don't see the title in the credits, and the Mitchell Boychoir seems to have disappeared. I couldn't find them on the web.If you liked "Miracle" and "It's a Wonderful Life," you can't miss with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The regal David Niven with a chair stuck to his ass is the height of comedy! and why the art of film-making is so great when done well.Stupid me, I almost didn't watch this one because I'd gotten too big for this kind of sappy holiday fare. The ghost of Christmas future visited me and shewed me what life would be like if I let adulthood, cynicism, real life and all other provinces of man take away nostalgia, rose-colored memories and my childlike quality of hoping the best for all. Sometimes,by force of collective Will, even in the face of fear and doubt, Man's better nature overtakes us, almost subconsciously. The fight or flight mechanism installed in Man reveals itself in mysterious ways. Sometimes films are the actors and there is a certain wisdom and fung shuie(?) about collective experiences like watching holiday movies. I would submit that we should not forget. Happy HOLIDAYS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bishop Henry Brougham is furiously trying to see his plans for a new cathedral through to fruition. As it comes dangerously close to consuming him, he fails to see that his devoted family is drifting away from him. Reflecting one day on the fact that his faith is dwindling away, he offers up a prayer for help and is most taken aback when a guy called Dudley appears to him as if from nowhere. Dudley it would seem, is an angel sent to help Henry in his wishes, but Henry views Dudley with great suspicion, even thinking he is moving in on his wife! But as Christmas approaches, this really might prove to be the season of goodwill and tiny little miracles...Sentimental? Yes it is. Warm and fuzzy? Yes again. What's wrong with those things? The answer of course is nothing. Playing as a sort of linked cousin to It's A Wonderful Life, this picture may not be in that film's particular class, but it sure as heck fire does a wonderful job of brightening up the Christmas season. The direction from Henry Koster is smooth and unobtrusive, while the cast are as charming as the message in the film itself. Cary Grant, David Niven, Loretta Young, Monty Woolley, James Gleason, Gladys Cooper and Elsa Lanchester, all help to make this a perennial necessity for Christmas viewings. Nothing else to say really, just watch it with someone you love at the crimble season and let it cloak you in charming splendour. 9/10</fullReview>

I'm so glad they switched the roles of Cary Grant and David Niven. I can't picture it the other way, although both were excellent actors and could probably have pulled it off.

		<fullReview>In this day of heavy-handed Christianity, it is good to hearken back to a time when God had a sense of humor and delight; when an angel sent to Earth to help a good man could wish for a moment that he was alive once more to experience the love of a wonderful woman; when that same angel could enjoy a drink with an old friend and play a little trick on him at the same time. Anyone saying they have a direct line to the man upstairs will have to have seen this movie and understand it before I will have anything to do with them. The acting is right on in every way, from the three main characters, to the maid, delightfully played by Elsa Lanchester, and to the cabdriver who gets more than a fare when he picks up a young couple on a winter's day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angels in the film during Christmas are always welcome. The fact is that they always looks impressive. However, if the presence of the angels you can fit in with other elements, particularly convincing story, there will be a kind of problem.The story in the basics and be sentimental with a clear message. Tall, handsome, charming, charismatic and debonair angel does not fit in this story. THE BISHOP'S WIFE was cheerful and lighthearted film. Very simple and meager story of human spirituality and weaknesses. Needless to analyze what is not working as it should. In life there are a lot nicer than some of the moral, professional or business ideals. Family and friends are the most important things in the world. What a man needs in order to feel fulfilled and happy? Very little. Clear guidelines. Acting could be a lot better.Cary Grant as Dudley is an angel who has a solution for all, compassion for everyone, a warm smile that brightens everyone's heart and love for the bishop's wife. I do not believe in angels, but I believe in Grant's charm.David Niven as Bishop Henry Brougham is closed his eyes. Basically on the deft and funny way of knowing that his goal brings a lot more dissatisfaction than goodness. Do not let your job or profession away from yourself or from the people you love and who love you. A clear message. Loretta Young as Julia Brougham, I agree that it is nice to see a happy and contented woman. However bad acting and characterization destroyed role that had plenty of room in the story.The film is a solid, carries a clear and compelling message, however, is superficial and can cause a feeling of illusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A delightful Christmas classic that ranks not only among my favorite Cary Grant films but my favorite films period. It's beautiful and funny and touching in ways movies seldom are anymore. The story is about an angel named Dudley (Cary Grant) sent to Earth to help Bishop Henry (David Niven), who's struggling with raising the money necessary to build a new cathedral, all the while neglecting his wife Julia (Loretta Young).Cary Grant is just perfect as Dudley, one of his best 1940s roles. He's charming and handsome and has great chemistry with all of his co-stars. David Niven does a fine job as the stressed and slightly neurotic Henry, who finds himself in the unenviable position (particularly for a Bishop) of being jealous of the very angel sent to help him. With good reason, too, as even angelic Dudley can't resist falling for the heavenly Loretta Young. For her part, lovely Loretta positively glows as the sweet and faithful Julia. Scene-stealing turn from the great Monty Woolley, but when did this guy not shine? Every movie of his I've seen is made better just by his presence. The rest of the wonderful supporting cast includes Elsa Lanchester, James Gleason, Regis Toomey, Sara Haden, and Gladys Cooper. Also of note to fans of another Christmas classic: Karolyn Grimes and Bobby Anderson (Zuzu and young George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life) are in this.It's a quality production with great direction and cinematography, and a witty and emotional script full of very human characters who are flawed but not in the same broken way that description is used today. It's a heartwarming seasonal fantasy film. Not to belabor a point I touched on before but it's the type of movie they don't really make anymore. It's the rare and magical movie you watch with a smile etched on your face the whole time. Definitely recommended for fans of the stars or those who love gentle, old-fashioned Christmas films.</fullReview>

I usually watch this about 3 or 4 times during the Christmas season as it's in my rotation with Home for the Holidays, It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, One Magic Christmas, If You Believe, Bell, Book, and Candle, A Diva's Christmas Carol, and The Family Stone. My roommates hate me during this time of year! I like to think there are people out there that believe in helping others unselfishly. I strive to be that kind of person.I like seeing some of the other character actors such as Elsa Lanchester who is in Bell Book and Candle, and Sara Haden who I only knew from the Shirley Temple movie Poor Little Rich Girl.

		<shortDescription>The Bishop's Wife is a wonderful move to watch during the Christmas season</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 20 years of only reading about this movie (I knew it was remade as The Preacher's Wife when that movie came out in 1996, a movie I remember enjoying), I finally got to watch this on Netflix disc. David Niven is a bishop who seems distant from not only his wife-Loretta Young-but also his pre-teen daughter and most of his staff and some neighbors. Cary Grant is an angel named Dudley who automatically charms everyone except Niven-the only one who even knows what he is. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a charming Christmas movie to watch with great scenes of both comedy and drama. I also loved the character turns of Monty Woolley and James Gleason. So on that note, I highly recommend The Bishop's Wife. P.S. Since It's a Wonderful Life is my favorite movie, I always like to cite when players from that one appear in other films. In this case, Karolyn Grimes-Zuzu in IAWL-plays the daughter Debby, Bobbie Anderson-Little George Bailey-plays one of the boys who torments Debby in the snowfight scene, and Sarah Edwards-Mary Hatch's mother-plays an organist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All in all this is a fantastic fantasy film, especially nice at Christmas but a charming tonic no matter the season. What's so wrong with depicting a world bathed in such a rosy black &amp; white hue, and like craggy taxi driver James Gleason wistfully declares at one point helps restore your faith in human nature (if not your faith).At a difficult fund raising moment bishop David Niven's prayer for guidance is answered by angel Cary Grant appearing, who then also appears to step into the bishop's shoes, scarf, business and marriage to loyal wife Loretta Young. Naturally, or unnaturally angel Dudley makes an electrifying positive difference in the life of everyone to whom he speaks in his mission to help, but finds one of the mere mortals far too interesting and he gets amusingly sidetracked apparently enjoying red blood in his ethereal veins again. Favourite bits among many: Grant's not only suprahuman but superhuman powers even if sparingly used; Gladys Cooper's beautifully decorated and opulently furnished mansion, even if with somewhat tightly fitting chairs; the pivotal ice skating scenes, even if mainly performed by doubles; the boys choir gradually taking their places in front of conductor Grant even if they didn't seem to know why; Niven asking for and receiving an example of a miracle even if he still couldn't believe it.The schmaltz is laid on thickly and with a trowel, but do you really expect anything else from a family Christmas movie which actually mentions Christ? Maybe it's problematic to cynics and atheists, and fundamentalheads because they consider film to be the invention of the Devil, however to the vast majority of us it should be a simple unpretentious joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bringing back the Christ in Christmas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true spirit of the holiday season comes alive every time I see this movie. Even more so than "The Miracle on 34th Street" and "It's a Wonderful Life", this Christmas classic really touches me with the feeling that all is right in a world that sometimes seems so wrong. Confused adults need spiritual guidance, and that comes in the form of an angel, the dashing Cary Grant who focuses on an Episcopalian Bishop (David Niven), his lovely wife (Loretta Young), and various others whom he encounters on his visit to earth. Like other human beings, Niven wants something desperately for the holidays, and that is the funds to build a bigger cathedral which he can only do with the aide of wealthy widow Gladys Cooper, a domineering parishioner who holds the purse strings and has plenty of demands. Niven has no idea that his seemingly idealistic marriage is in deep trouble, and Grant's presence brings temptation into the wake of the season of giving.What could be truly schmaltzy ends up being totally charming, and that is due to the excellent screenplay, tight direction, beautiful photography and music, and the most outstanding cast assembled for a holiday film. In addition to the aforementioned stars are Monty Woolley as an eccentric friend of Young and Niven's (whom Grant claims he knows), James Gleason as a cynical cab driver who really gets into the spirit of Christmas thanks to Grant's presence, Elsa Lanchaster as a befuddled maid, and the sweet Karolyn Grimes as Niven and Young's daughter, an adorable little girl who truly represents the spirit of Christmas. Even the minor players have a thing or two to contribute to the touching story, among them Sara Haden and Regis Toomey, as well as a gaggle of gossipy old ladies who are instantly suspicious when they see Grant and Young together then become charmed and forget about their initial tongue wagging.There are so many small plot points in this which remain in the memory long after the film is over, including the story of old coins Woolley has which he thinks are worthless, a visit to a skating rink where even clumsy Gleason finds he can skate like Sonja Henie, and a snowball fight where young Grimes gets the last laugh. But ultimately, this is a film about the spirit of the holidays, and when Grant tells Karolyn the story of the first Christmas, it truly is touching. The imperious Cooper gives the old pro's try with her sometimes touching, mostly tough character really melting into a pile of mush when she meets Grant. Cary is a bit of a mischievous angel, as evidenced in a scene where Niven ends up sitting in a recently varnished chair at Cooper's mansion, and for a minute, it isn't clear what Grant's motives really are. But as fast as angels arrive, they leave, and they are only there long enough to do what they need to do.A modernized version of this ("The Preacher's Wife") kept the heart and soul of the original film and is also very much worth seeing. Whitney Houston's magnetic smile brought a light into the update, and is a reminder of how lovely Young could be when she simply played her role and didn't try to be too noble. The fact that her character is obviously attracted to Grant in spite of her moral fiber makes her much more human, and the fact that Niven is far from perfect even being a religious leader makes him extremely identifiable as well. Christmas movies may come out by the dozens now, but they really don't make em' like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Holiday Classic And One Of Grant's &amp; Young's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is slowly becoming a holiday classic but you never hear it mentioned among the very best "must-see" Christmas films and it should be. Perhaps not quite a "10" like Alistair Sim's Scrooge, it's still one of the very best movies ever made (holiday film or no).It's got a touching character transformation much like Scrooge. And it's got perhaps the most unusual romantic comedy twist ever - with the wife reborn with ghostly Cary Grant's presence even as he informs the husband (a curmudgeonly MINISTER!) about the true ways of Goodness.Grant's performance here is solid, brilliant and very touching. The depth of his humanity is on great display - and how many actors could pull off this role as Cary does?And is Loretta Young more endearing in any other film? Her performance here alone makes this film worth watching.There are so many funny, charming and moving scenes in this movie it'd be hard to list them all...If you haven't seen this yet, please give it a try. You'll be surprised to find it becoming one of those films you have to see every Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Christmas films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The years following World War II brought an influx of angels (or Heavenly Conductors) to the movie screen in films such as Stairway to Heaven, It's a Wonderful Life, and the 1947 The Bishop's Wife starring Cary Grant, Loretta Young, and David Niven. Though it is hardly a perennial Christmas favorite in the same league as Miracle on 34th Street and It's a Wonderful Life, The Bishop's Wife has its advocates and is generally considered one of the best Christmas films for a general audience. Nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, original score, and film editing, the only Oscar the film won, however, was that for Best Sound and the performances by Grant, Young, and Niven, considered to be among their best, were overlooked.In the film, Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven) asks for divine guidance to help raise the money to build a cathedral, a project to which he is so single-minded about that his values, marriage, and family are put in jeopardy. The answer to his prayer comes in the form of the angel Dudley (well, I guess it's a better name for an angel than Clarence). This particular angel (Cary Grant) is rather handsome and charming and takes particular notice of Henry's wife Julia (Loretta Young) who is under the impression that he is Henry's new assistant. Daughter Debby (Karolyn Grimes) is also not immune to his charms. The bishop also feels that this angel has picked up some rather strange tendencies and has become quite jealous of the time he is spending with his wife, though Julia seems (or pretends to be) oblivious to his "angelic" qualities.Dudley's heart is in the right place, however, and he steers the dour Henry towards the values that are most important in life and in the process transforms everyone whose lives he touches. These include the guilt-ridden dowager Agnes Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), Monte Wooley as a skeptical History professor who has given up writing a book about Roman history because he doesn't think anyone will read it, and James Gleason as Sylvester, a cynical taxi driver who rediscovers that life has some pleasures. He even brings the flirty housekeeper (Elsa Lanchester) back to life. The film has some memorable set pieces that are worth the price of admission by themselves.Dudley, Julia, and Sylvester performing a sparkling skating routine (with the help of professional doubles), Sherry glasses that keep filling up by themselves, Dudley miraculously rounding up a group of forgetful boys to perform the beautiful hymn O Sing to God (Noel) by Gounod at St. Timothy's church, and Dudley "finding" a harp to play in Agnes' living room.The Bishop's Wife has a good message, brilliant performances especially from Cary Grant, and a joyous feel to it, though it is somewhat dampened by the humorless and aloof Henry who doesn't seem to get the message of humility and love that Dudley is trying to convey (well, at least not right away). In essence, however, The Bishop's Wife is a beautiful film that is done with a minimum of sap and should be seen more often. At least you don't have to wonder whether or not Dudley will get his wings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Christmas movie for the whole family!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the movie! It really seemed to speak to me, especially since I wanted to take back Christmas for myself this year. It was a wonderful combination of great actors, wonderful performances with just the right amount of expertly timed comedy along with warm, rich, endearing characters. The dialog was well written with no wasted words. It was a great Christmas movie for me because there was no sadness or disasters or stressful situations as in "It's A Wonderful Life". This movie is rich with life lessons that seem particularly poignant with the Christmas theme. The only sorrow was Mrs. "Moneybags" Hamilton's choice of money over true love. I believe Dudley's charm and sensitive empathy and good humor along with his small miracles were consistent with what an angel is. Dudley gave what was asked of him....guidance. But not just guidance to the Bishop..but everyone he came in contact with....including assisting the blind man across the street in the beginning of the movie. Dudley's love for the title character made an immortal angel envy a mortal man. It was great at the end because nobody suffered the "loss" of Dudley because they had no memory of him...and yet little hints were left behind....an angel doll left on the bedpost for Debbie, the Professor's haunted look on the steps of the church...looking for something or somebody to no avail and the beautiful sermon left for the Bishop to deliver at St. Timothy's church. The beautiful old interiors of the homes with the high ceilings and floor to ceiling windows as well as the fabulous woodwork reminded me of the "Old Money" houses in my hometown neighborhood. The great clothes impressed me, too. I loved Mrs. Hamilton's fabulous velvet gown and pearl necklace in the scene when Dudley played the harp. I noticed that it had a bit of a train dragging the floor behind her. Nothing looks or drapes like velvet. It was a very rich experience that left me feeling warm and happy and amused. AND there was no commercial Christmas orgy with gifts because the gifts were really love and mercy and empathy and redemption for the less fortunate as well as the wealthy alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fill the forgotten stocking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to remember to hang such a stocking, as Dudley admonished at the end of the movie, and to let my family know how to fill it with the gifts that Dudley said Jesus would want most. I particularly liked " a touch of tolerance" (sic). He also included love and kindness.I also like the allusion to "A Christmas Carol". It struck me after one of the Bishop's outbursts. He is the scrooge, his secretary, whom the Bishop required to stay late on Christmas Eve to type his sermon, is Bob Cratchet, and Dudley is the ghost of Christmas past, present, and future.There are people who walk this earth who are not angels, yet because of their presence (consciousness in the sense or Eckhart Tolle's "The Art of Presence"), and acceptance rather than resistance to the moment, are able to bring others out of unconsciousness, as Dudley did for the Bishop's wife. Deepak Chopra's "Seven Spiritual Laws of Success" is an excellent starting point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes angels rush in where fools fear to tread.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often considered a Christmas film, this is only incidentally set in the season. This five-time Oscar nominated film, with a win for sound, was one of the best pictures of 1947, the year that brought us Miracle on 34th Street, and the Oscar winning Gentlemen's Agreement. Certainly a great year for films that make us think about what is important.The Bishop, the great David Niven, really doesn't know what he wants. He is trapped in dreams of glory, and has forgotten those around him that need his love and attention. he prays for guidance.Cary Grant, who makes a perfect angel, shows up and helps him understand what the important things in life are and transforms him. He reconnects him to his wife, the beautiful Loretta Young, who won an Oscar the same year for The Farmer's Daughter.The angel, of course, helps many others along the way before he leaves. Like Dr. Lao, he really just opens the eyes of people to look around and see what is really important.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Return What Was Given</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:When we begin, the frantic Bishop, being blackmailed by the rich widow, is praying to God for help. He sends him Dudley a very wise angel to help him. The rich widow wishes the cathedral to be more a monument to her dead husband than a church to worship God within. Dudley's help is the source of most of the comedy in this holiday classic. Niven's Bishop is painfully materialistic and lost within the drawing of the mammoth cathedral that he hasn't noticed that greed is hiding behind his supposed beneficence to others. Also, the bishop has pretty much abandoned his poor, neglected, lonely wife. Dudley begins paying way too much attention to Young causing a jealous reaction, hidden carefully, by the bishop. Worse, he begins undermining his ingratiation of the rich widow to liberate the necessary funds he needs to build an image to his greatness, though Dudley helps him to see this which he does not grasp until the very end. One of the funniest scenes is where Dudley makes Niven's pants stick to a chair at the rich widow's house so he cannot appear at the holiday choir where Dudley works some more of his mission with the children. There is a sweet sub story about an old grumpy atheistic intellectual who Dudley slowly changes by making his wine bottle fill up automatically.The thematic core of the movie is Dudley helping the bishop but from the bishop's point of view he wrecks everything. Niven gradually learns that he is being taught to give his love to God and his wife not a huge temple to himself. As Dudley spends more and more time with Julia, Niven begins noticing what he has lost and fights to regain her affection precisely as Dudley intended. The main theological point is that he teaches the Bishop that the Love Of God goes towards people not material objects. The bishop fights with Dudley most of the movie even asking him to leave. At the end, in a beautiful sermon Dudley wrote, my header is the essence of its theme. God wishes from us our love of each other and obedience to His Will. The movie has many magical, beautiful scenes; the ice skating scene is one of its best. Dudley does little acts of goodness everywhere he goes. At the very end, the misanthropic intellectual is even going into the church for the Christmas service. Yes, it is a beautiful holiday classic but it has much more depth to it.The core of the film is the anti materialism; the bishop has fallen in love with his cathedral and he is willing to convert it to a monument to the rich widow's fallen husband in order to complete it. Very painfully and gradually, Dudley shows the bishop where God wishes his work to be, with his flock and his wife. He was not put here to erect great monuments that Dudley shows Niven are more about his vanity than worship of God. Dudley's goodness is never pedantic, you will not be subjected to long lectures. He has a certain clever way of turning the bishop's greed and being the widow's sycophant upon him. Grant does such a great job here conveying goodness is a very quiet, subtle way. Only when the bishop says how does he not know he is from the other place, then Dudley says sternly,"You really ought not to say that." The message is that God wishes spiritual gifts not material ones. The beauty of the final sermon echoes this theme: Return the gifts you were given, use them to help others, they do not belong to you. A Beautiful Movie.

		<shortDescription>The best Christmas movie with a spiritual twist--ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've loved this movie since I first saw it when I was in my teens. Think, first, what it has going for it--David Niven, Cary Grant, Elsa Lanchester, Gladys Cooper, Loretta Young, and Monty Wooley--the sort of cast one can only dream about these days. Add to it an unusually sensitive and beautiful script, and handsome photography, and you have what I would have to call a masterpiece, although it is by no means as well known as other Christmas movies. There are very few Christmas movies with a genuinely spiritual twist, and the major competitors to "The Bishop's Wife" would be of course be the various versions of "A Christmas Carol" and "It's a Wonderful Life". Most versions of the Dickens are very good--although the discerning viewer will wish to skip the musical version (there really are no good Dickens musicals)--and you should add any one of them or many to your stocking. "It's a Wonderful Life" is entirely another matter, and watching "The Bishop's Wife" brought out the differences starkly. Personally, I detest Frank Capra's work in general as a kind of saccharine Marxism (not to being mention visually unimpressive and overacted)and "It's a Wonderful Life"--which, only with a little exaggeration can be called the story of an inept businessman--is arguably the most overrated movie in the American canon. It's not Jimmy Stewart's best performance--that honor goes to "Vertigo". "Teacher says that every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings" is one of the most nauseating lines in a supposedly respectable film.But the real telling point of the ultimate mean-spiritedness of Capra's vision vs. "The Bishop's Wife" lies in the treatment of the wealthy. The banker, tellingly, is left out of the final reconciliation in Capra's film. On the other hand, the wealthy widow (a marvelous performance by Glays Cooper) undergoes a powerful spiritual transformation that is really one of the hearts of the film.One could go on at length. Let it suffice to say that "It's a Wonderful Life" is tinsel covered in treacle; "The Bishop's Wife" is pure gold, with frankincense, myrrh, and miraculous sherry tossed in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Angel Delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of three Christmas time classics in my opinion. This one about an Angel called Dudley, yes, just Dudley played brilliantly by Cary Grant. This Angel comes to Earth to answer a prayer of guidance for Henry "David Niven." Henry wants to build a large and great edifice for God. Henry is married to Julia "Loretta Young," a woman that places a poor second to the new building in the "mind" of Henry. Oh, how she wishes that things were like it used to be when Henry was just the Reverend of a small Parish. When Henry would take her to the restaurant called "Michelle's." But now that Henry has become a Bishop, poor Julia gets more attention from the family dog. It will be a tough job for Dudley. Henry only sees a building but Dudley sees a family in crisis. One problem develops, Dudley begins to fall in love with Julia, a human. Dudley begins to use his power to distract Henry while the Angel spends precious moments with Julia. At Michelle's then ice skating and even just playing with snowballs become heavenly events for Julia and Dudley. But is this possible, an Angel with a human? A heartwarming story filled with comedy, drama and wonderful characters. A must to see whenever Christmas comes along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The almost perfect coalescence of actors, script, and direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Question 1: Is the new Blu Ray edition worth the upgrade? There is somewhat of an improvement; it's a good transfer.This is one of the most charming films ever made. It is a fine Christmas story which can be enjoyed anytime of the year. Its 3 stars do marvelously. This is one of those films where everything pretty much comes together almost perfectly.What I find most interesting about the film is how the story treads a thin line between a romance between the angel (Cary Grant) and the Bishop's wife (Loretta Young) and honest concern and compassion. In fact, the difference is the essence of the film.The skating sequence with Grant, Young, and James Gleason is one of the most delightful film sequences in any film I have ever seen. Of course we know the actors have doubles, but it's such a wonderful series of scenes that we are happily willing to suspend disbelief and just enjoy the joy! The cast here is nigh on perfect. Cary Grant is superb as the angel. He's just sparkling here; it would appear that he really enjoyed the role. I suppose some would think this was an easy role; I'm not so sure it was. He was treading on shifting sands here, and managed it perfectly well.Loretta Young does so nicely as the Bishop's wife, who loves life, loves her husband, but is nearly despondent over the way things are turning out for their marriage as her husband becomes more and more obsessed with his project.David Niven. Well, I'm less impressed with Niven's performance here than with Young's or Grant's, but I'm not sure I can fault him. His was a tough character to like...or dislike, so perhaps my hesitation is with the character, not the performance.In the supporting roles, James Gleason's small role as a taxi driver is, perhaps, the most charming of his career. Monty Woolley is good as "the professor". I always think of Gladys Cooper as one of the outstanding character actresses, and she does not disappoint here as the wealthy donor, although she had other more memorable roles. Elsa Lanchester is very likable as the housekeeper, as is Sara Haden (another one of those familiar faces) as the Bishop's secretary.It's difficult for me to imagine someone not liking this film, unless it's totally outside of their preferred genres. It could have been a much different result. In the beginning, Niven was cast as the angel, Dana Andrews as the bishop, and Teresa Wright as the wife. I can see the latter two working, but I can't see Niven as the angel. No, this one turned out just perfect the way that it finally ended up on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentimental Vehicle for Two Great Comic Talents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this is a sentimental piece with an overtly Christian message, but it is a very fine movie nonetheless.Viewers can savor the expert characterizations of Cary Grant as Dudley the angel, contrasted with David Niven's stressed-out bishop Henry Brougham. Their acting-styles are very different: Grant moves languidly across the screen, as if in control of everything he does. The only time when self-doubt enters his mind is when he inadvertently falls for Hanry's wife Julia (Loretta Young). At that moment director Henry Koster frames him in close-up looking longingly as the viewer, making us realize just how attracted he is to her. But no matter; as an angel, he cannot savor the delights of corporeal existence, and must return to heaven to undertake God's bidding. By contrast Niven's Bishop is full of nervous tics; his hands shake as he picks up a teacup (having discovered Dudley's true identity), and he tries to impose his will on Dudley by wielding a stick of celery. In one memorable sequence he finds that he is stuck to a chair in Mrs. Hamilton's (Gladys Cooper's) house, and he waddles around the room like an angry duck, desperately trying to remove it, before sinking down into a corner and picking up the telephone.The two male stars' comic talents are shown to greatest effect in a dinner-scene, where the Bishop stretches out his hand to stroke his pet St. Bernard dog, yet finds to his horror that the dog has moved over to Dudley's side. The Bishop looks up and scowls at Dudley; Dudley simply raises his eyebrows, forcing the Bishop to climb down to avoid having an unseemly argument. Both Niven and Grant possessed fine comic abilities, and Koster allows them full rein to exercise their range of facial expressions.The film benefits from a strong supporting cast, including Young as a harassed housewife redeemed from drudgery by Dudley's intervention; Monty Woolley as a distinguished professor who eventually admits that he has spent the last few years of his life in utter idleness; Elsa Lanchester as an unusually high-spirited parlor-maid; and James Gleason as a cab-driver learning how to skate once more.The subject-matter is very much of its time, as Mrs. Hamilton is dissuaded from giving $1m. for the building of a cathedral in her husband's honor, and to use the money instead to house the poor both in the United States and elsewhere. This was considered far more significant in the post-war world, where members of different nations were learning how to co-exist in peace and harmony as well as rebuild themselves. This perspective holds as true today as it did over six decades ago, especially in a world where the distinction between rich and poor seems to widen rather than contract.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rather than overwork the phrase Motion Picture, the word Film can be most appropriate here. Without offending anyone's philosophical sensibilities, could this film have been motivated by an entity out there, somewhere, such that the people in Hollywood created something intended to be singularly unique? For example, consider what the Director of this film did when he exactly provided for us the scene, frame by frame, when Cary Grant presents to us the Twenty-Third Psalm.Next, many may have also noticed that during the Golden Age, the cast for several films was selected in only one way that could have been possible. For example, can you imagine the roles in this film performed by anyone else other than Cary Grant, Loretta Young, David Niven, Monty Woolley, and James Gleason? Concluding, you will know what the word inspiration means after this film instills your inner self with a feeling of complete, the kind words here are now almost endless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At last! I finally own this wonderful, wonderful Christmas movie on DVD, instead of grainy VHS along with commercials as I recorded it off the TV. It's only taken more years than I care to remember and a seller in Japan to make it happen. Nevertheless, I am over the moon.I saw this film for the first time many years ago with my mum, during a grey afternoon, while on my school holiday. It made an impression that has stayed with me ever since. It is truly a feel good movie, on a par with It's A Wonderful Life perhaps, but for me The Bishop's Wife has the edge. Maybe it's because a film with Cary Grant rarely fails to please, and also David Niven and Loretta Young are both immensely watchable. I'm not sure why this has such timeless appeal, though I often find myself a little wistful for bygone eras where love scenes ended with camera shots into crackling fires, or waves crashing onto beaches.I keep getting away from the point so here goes, I shall control my over exuberance. miss this Christmas gem at your peril! relax in the charms of Dudley and allow him to work his 'magic' on you. For all lovers of the festive season, and those whom observe the true meaning of Christmas, this is a must! I envy anyone lucky enough to watch it for the first time, but I'm still touched deep inside whenever I view it, as I am doing this very minute.Heartwarming, charming and poignant..... and if you don't shed a little tear for Dudley at the end, maybe It's A Wonderful Life is more your kinda movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christmas movie that entertains and enchants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for good Christmas entertainment, I would highly recommend this brilliant and fun-loving movie, directed by Henry Koster. It moves along effortlessly, drawing many laughs with the story of a hard-working bishop struggling valiantly to raise funds for a major building project. At a dark moment when the bishop turns to the Almighty in prayer, an angel comes into his life setting off a series of unexplainable events that leaves the bishop even more anxious and confused. The movie has never really caught the public imagination like Miracle on 34th Street, Scrooge, or even Christmas Vacation but this movie is very rewarding in its own way with an excellent cast and a mix of humour, drama and fantasy. The Bishop's Wife dates back to 1947 and the cast, among the most treasured of their time, are now gone; the leading roles are performed by Loretta Young as the bishop's wife, Cary Grant as the angel and David Niven as the bishop, with the supporting characters led by Gladys Cooper, a wealthy widow who undergoes a sea change, James Gleason as a heartwarming chauffeur, Monty Woolly as a professor whose bottle of sherry never runs dry and Elsa Lanchester as the housekeeper. There are several scenes that are pure fantasy but totally delightful. The angel completes his mission and leaves his charges with a totally unexpected lesson. Along the way, the angel enchants as well as changes hearts. A beautiful Christmas movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very corny movie, but Grant is charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie on Christmas with a bunch of people who thought it was great, so apparently there are people for whom this odd mix of romance and religion works, but this movie doesn't connect with me at all.Cary Grant is quite good as a sly angel who comes to earth to help out a minister and his wife. He is, as usual, charming and likable. Loretta Young is okay as the rather bland wife, and David Niven is stuck playing a charmless minister who he can't do much with.The movie is full of moments that delighted my companions, like a cute ice-skating sequence and a choir performance, but for me these all felt like things that seemed like a good idea but that didn't effect me. The movie has clever ideas here and there, but it also has many moments of lead-footed religiosity, as when Grant tells a bible story to a small child while everyone else in the household watches, inexplicably rapt.For me, this movie has an *almost* quality. Grant is good, there are moments I like, and only a small percentage of scenes really grate on my nerves. I feel there is enough here that a good movie probably could have been built out of the pieces, but I've read that the movie went through rewrites already so perhaps this was ultimately as good as they could manage. Watchable, but that's about it.</fullReview>

He has to be alluring and sexy, most attractive to women of all types and Grant achieves this effortlessly. As the bishop's wife of the title Loretta Young strikes just the right note - she is attracted to him but in what seems like an innocent way. It was a hard call, writing this movie, there are a lot of pitfalls which the writers managed to avoid. David Niven has a hard task in making the bishop less attractive than Dudley without the viewer rooting for Dudley to "win " the heart of the bishop's wife. Why Cary Grant did not win Oscars is,I think, because made it look so easy to be "Cary Grant". I think he said as much when interviewed once. He was a consummate performer in all his movies and because of the ease he displayed he was severely underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Xmas Without The Wife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want Cary Grant for my angel, dear lord! And, could you also send with him several million dollars so I can build my big project, or so it seems this is the prayer of Bishop David Niven. The Bishop's Wife is a late 40s feel good film which reinforces the American notion of protestant Xmas with all the values of middle class Anglo society post WWII. It is a wonderful life for those living in large, craftsman bungalow houses with two house staff and secretaries and assistants. Yes, it's wonderful except Henry can't sway the money people in his community to cough up the millions, his marriage to his beautiful wife, Julia (Loretta Young) is falling apart since his promotion to the big time, and his daughter, Debbie is asleep by the time he gets home from fund raising meetings. Then an angel comes to answer his prayer -- and what an angel is Dudley (Cary Grant). Dignified even on ice skates, polite, and the ultimate do-gooder, Dudley can do everything the Bishop wants if only to be near his wife, the beautiful and unhappy Julia. Dudley will help Henry, but are his motivations more driven by earthly desire that seem anything but heavenly? Dudley is the answer to the Bishop's prayers, but maybe his prayers need clarification for his own good. The dilemma of Dudley and Julia and Henry is a comedic trio never so crass as a menage, but it comes as close as one could in the 40s and it is delightful.The Bishop's Wife is seasonal and filled with cheer, good will to all men, and decked halls. It is never so preachy as to be irritating, and the character actors who support the big name stars give wonderful performances, including the Saint Bernard dog. One of the charming films of the period, it is family friendly and for those who can't resist Cary Grant at his most beautiful, his performance has a subtle witty delivery that is right out of his earlier work with Irene Dunn. This is a film which holds its own to others of the genre but frankly, I'll take Grant for my angel baby any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems there were no shortage of Angels bent on saving people in the immediate post-war years and cynics might be forgiven for wondering aloud where Henry Travers (It's A Wonderful Life) and Cary Grant (The Bishop's Wife) were between 1939 and 1945 when they might have done some really serious saving. No matter, we visit this site to talk about and review movies so let's get on. As feel good movies go they don't get any better, as good yes, better, no. Same about leading men, they don't get better than Grant so right away we have a winning parlay. Add David Niven, Loretta Young to share the leads, Monty Woolly, James Gleason and Gladys Cooper in support and you'd really have to work at screwing it up. One of the strangest things is that Billy Wilder worked without credit on the screenplay and when you know that it's easy - though for all I know totally erroneous - to link the hat motif that featured both here and in Ninotchka. 'Angelic' looking child actor Robert J (Bobby) Anderson played the young George Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life and appears here as the Defense Captain, reinforcing the 'divine intervention' aspect but when you erase all of this what you are left with is one of a small group of forties movies - Miracle On 34th Street, It's A Wonderful Life, The Shop Around The Corner, plus your own particular favorite, that personify the old fashioned values and warm like mulled wine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Christmas Chestnut Will Warm the Cockles at the Very Least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released by producer Samuel Goldwyn as a feel-good follow-up to his postwar classic, "The Best Years of Our Lives", this 1947 film amounts to nice, warm-hearted Christmas fare which takes a subtle jab at organized religion in face of pure faith. Written by Leonardo Bercovici and Robert E. Sherwood (who penned "The Best Years of Our Lives"), the plot concerns Henry Brougham, a young, well-intentioned bishop who has set the goal of building a big cathedral in his parish but cannot convince his rich patrons to give him the financial backing to build it. Praying for guidance, he is startled by the appearance of Dudley, who turns out to be an angel sent to lend Henry a helping hand in realizing his dream. The rest of the movie focuses on how Dudley teaches Henry and his put-upon wife Julia what happiness really means.Originally, Cary Grant and David Niven were cast as Henry and Dudley respectively, but they switched roles upon Goldwyn's insistence when he fired the original director. Under Henry Koster's direction, the film has the necessary whimsical tone, and the casting switch turns out to be fruitful. Grant is an uncomplicated charmer as Dudley, while Niven applies just the right amount of envy-driven starch and humility as Henry. As Julia, Loretta Young can be sweetly affecting, but as written, the character is rather dull considering how both men appear to vie for her affections. A strong supporting cast helps add texture to the story - Gladys Cooper ("My Fair Lady") as rich, ruthless Mrs. Hamilton who wants the cathedral to become a memorial to her dead husband; Monty Woolley ("The Man Who Came to Dinner") as agnostic Professor Wutheridge; Elsa Lanchester ("Witness for the Prosecution") as dotty housekeeper Matilda; and James Gleason ("Here Comes Mr. Jordan") as kind-hearted cabbie Sylvester.Some scenes are intentionally fanciful, especially those that showcase Dudley's preternatural abilities on the ice rink and with a harp. However, you just have to let go of such contrivances for the sake of the fantasy aspects of the tale. That's why the movie plays much better during the holidays when wishful thinking becomes near-epidemic. It's the type of movie that elicits warm chuckles rather than outright guffaws and as such, seems perilously long at 109 minutes. Also worth mentioning are the crisp black-and-white cinematography by Gregg Toland ("Citizen Kane") and the stirring, inspirational score by composer Hugo Friedhofer. The 2001 DVD contains no significant extra features.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sentimental, of course, being a Christmas movie, but still one of the best of the genre, with enough fantasy to appeal to children and enough sophistication to engage adults. The first rate cast is headed by David Niven as an Episcopal bishop losing his spiritual way in the financial struggle raise money for a new cathedral, Loretta Young as his increasingly concerned wife, and Cary Grant as the angel who intervenes at Christmas time to set things right, with Elsa Lanchester and Monty Woolley in supporting roles showing again that they were among the best character actors in film. In black and white, with excellent cinematography by Greg Toland; the MGM Home Entertainment DVD transfer is also excellent. A good addition to your list of family Christmas viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant holiday fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared with the dreadful Arsenic and Old Lace, this movie was spectacular. It was great to see Monty Wooley again (I'd grown fond of him from his performance in The Man Who Came To Dinner), but I was a teensy bit disappointed to find him playing just about the same character.The only negative for me was that the movie sent mixed messages. On one hand, it emphasized the importance of intimacy and simplicity and charity. On the other hand, it glorified materialism.The tension between the characters was discomfiting in its realism. We understand Dudley is trying to make a point with the Bishop--to shake him out of his complacency--but we also sense an undercurrent of turmoil, as though Dudley has really fallen for Julia. This is conveyed very well in the acting.The film reminded me of Mary Poppins--not just because of the presence of the actress who played Katy Nana--but in its use of some pretty nifty special effects and the general idea of a person touching the lives of the people around him very quickly and very intensely...and then leaving.For me, it's no "..Wonderful Life.." but it's got quiet charms that I think will help it endure at least another six decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pleasant enough tale, with some touches of humour and a few really charming bits, it is nevertheless awfully predictable and has little originality, bearing many marks of 'It's a Wonderful Life'. What is interesting is that the film won an Oscar for its sound recording, and while some of the sounds are captured well, it is not anything really striking. Anyway, Grant has a nice charm to him that provides some compensation for Young's light and shallow character, and it is okay as light entertainment; but the film cannot pack an emotional punch as well as 'It's a Wonderful Life', nor does it have much to offer in terms of its plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Architecture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I make a minor hobby out of movies whose form is similar to their content or some major element of the story.In this case we have a terrible, incoherent, scattered and just plain mean film that people love. Corbu said of buildings that no building is a good building, that it is impossible to design and build a good building. But some buildings (he presumed only a few) get turned into fine buildings because users embrace them and 'fill them in' perhaps only with their imaginations and engineered blindnesses.This has many elements of an endearing picture - as many elements as they could cram in: an extremely well tailored angel, a pretty woman (with a cute girl and dog), a perky maid, an old lady who turns over a new leaf, a heavenly boys choir made from street kids. And of course Christmas complete with ice skating. The end has a marriage saved.But it is all done so clumsily presented it embarrasses. At the time, they knew it was broken. First they switched the roles around, then they junked it and reshot, then went back to the original and rewrote and reshot it. The score is its own story. The result is simply bad architecture in terms of the structure of the thing. It has no form, makes no sense in the large - only in the small, hoping the viewer will "move in" somehow.The characters (the main ones that is) have no redeeming qualities at all. We are told that the minister was once a good man, but we see no shred of that goodness, even at the end. Our young wife is pretty, but she has no thought at all, even for her child, except for a new hat. But people _see_ them as lovable,The story features an example of bad architecture within (the cathedral). Pretty interesting fold, that. And it features some of the most garish interiors ever filmed (by the eye of 'Citizen Kane' no less).This was the era of the influence of the Mankiewicz brothers, so we have another narrative fold as well, one in their tradition. It is a matter of invented or recalled history (we never know which one) presented to the eye of a history perfessor. It involves a coin and is an appropriate play within the play about money and infidelity.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who'd be an angel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever considered what a thankless job angels must have? For 99.99% of the time, they do good deeds but their human recipients rarely show the slightest gratitude or recognition. And if, for the remaining 0.01% of the time, angels have the bare-faced nerve to say who they really are, what is the most likely consequence? - being hit over the head with the nearest frying-pan, or being tossed in the mental hospital! Or both!! Furthermore, as far as we can tell, they have no access to parties, booze or the opposite sex. And being an angel in the movies is even more demanding: have you ever seen a movie angel that is short, fat, with knock-knees and a squint? No sir, being an angel is no cushy number!Which brings us to Carey Grant's role as the angel (Dudley) in "The Bishop's Wife". Appearing suddenly in the home of Bishop Brougham (David Niven) in response to the latter's heartfelt prayers, Angel Grant not only says who he is - information that is received with about as much interest as today's TV menu . He also performs cute tricks like opening a locked door without the key, ensuring that a certain bottle of sherry is permanently kept topped up, and dictating sermons to typewriters. Not to mention ice-skating and making a restrained play for the bishop's wife. If all angels had such interesting work, there would be no shortage of them. But then who knows - perhaps there isn't.For my money, the real hero of this film is neither the angel (with his parlour tricks), nor the bishop (with his grandiose plans for a new cathedral), nor even his pleasant wife (Loretta Young) (whose penalty is being stuck with the bishop). The real hero is the world-weary Professor (Monty Woolley) who has been vainly attempting to write a history of antiquity seemingly since Adam was a boy, while at the same time, trying to come to terms with the demands of this world. Thanks to Angel Grant's efforts, the Professor suddenly discovers that only he is able to translate certain ancient texts that remain unintelligible to everyone else - an ability that is certain to bring him recognition at long last.Now if my own guardian angel has been peeking while I write this, I can only promise that......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Expect much Originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be a rather blatant and inferior rip-off of It's a Wonderful Life. The characters even seen modeled to a certain extent from that movie and it's very unsuccessful. David Niven's character is the one sent an angel yet it doesn't affect or change him in any apparent way. He plays a Bishop yet has little faith in Dudley being an angel at first and when he finally believes it, he feels so threatened he wants Dudley to leave. The main difference between this and It's a Wonderful Life is that the Bishop does nothing remotely useful for changing his or other people's lives for the better. Dudley (the angel) ends up being the positive influence on everyone and this is the reason everyone ends up loving him. Another fault is the obvious chemistry between Grant and Young. Grant is an angel and that confused me and despite that I still would rather have her end up with him than with her own husband. The main purpose of Dudley helping the Bishop is never achieved and this film isn't really as feel good as it might intend to be. Perhaps the film just loses all it's magic when seen outside of the holiday season and that could be the reason I felt this way. I seriously doubt it though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bishop's Wife, The (1947) *** 1/2 (out of 4) An angel (Cary Grant) is sent from Heaven to help a troubled bishop (David Niven) and his unhappy wife (Loretta Young). I know this was quite popular when released but today's it's in the back shadow of It's a Wonderful Life, which I find a bit shocking. While I think the Capra film is twenty times better, that film is a rather dark and somewhat depressing one so I'm shocked this sweet and touching film isn't better remembered. The key to the film is having the most charming actor in Grant teamed up with the most charming actress in Young. The two do wonderful work together and really bring a lot of joy to the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Woeful Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An angel descends from the heavens to help a bishop facing earthly woes. Released a year after "It's a Wonderful Life," this film is similar to the Frank Capra classic except that it doesn't work on any level. It's meant to be heart-warming, but instead it's dreary and uninteresting and goes on much too long. Grant is charming as usual but is let down by the lousy script. Niven gives a dull, one-note performance as the grouchy bishop. Young, following up her Oscar-winning role in "The Farmer's Daughter," is rather bland here in the title role. The capable supporting cast includes the likes of Woolley and Lanchester, but their talents are wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pleasant, if slightly odd fantasy with a Christmas theme has angel Cary Grant answering bishop David Niven's prayers regarding the help he needs building a new cathedral; in the interim, Grant also befriends Niven's spouse Loretta Young, who's unhappy in her marriage and could use a little Heavenly good cheer. The curious flirtation between Grant and Young is not imagined; they have all the fun and leave poor, stuffy David Niven out of the mix (and, at one point, stuck in a chair!). The film is perfectly acceptable but a bit peculiar and unmemorable, with Grant just coasting through on his patented good manners. Remade (but not re-thought) as "The Preacher's Wife" in 1996. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Misguided Bishop for Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, this film would be more accurately titled "The Bishop" because it's more about David Niven's character than his wife. Mr. Niven plays the Bishop; and, he is married to Loretta Young; they are Episcopalian. Niven wants money for a huge Cathedral; so, an Angel in the form of Cary Grant goes down to grant his wish - or, does he...You'll want to watch if you like the stars. Ms. Young is perhaps the best; she plays the wife with the right level of innocence, and creates a solid character. Niven does well in a difficult part, discovering something about wishing, and what to wish for... Cary Grant always lifts a film, but his portrayal of the Angel is the film's weak link. There are several times when you think Mr. Grant is going to kiss the wedded Young. Grant is lighted differently, to make him look Angelic. If you're wondering, "What is this film trying to be?" by the end, you'll know... There is a heart-warming Christmas message. ****** The Bishop's Wife (12/9/47) Henry Koster ~ Cary Grant, Loretta Young, David Niven</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy-handed miracles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I greatly enjoy many classic films, but something went wrong with this one. I agree with most of the glowing reviews of the fine acting, casting, music, and even the Christmas nostalgic feel. But what ruins the enjoyment for me is the lack of finesse and attention to details I've seen in classics like "It's A Wonderful Life", and "Harvey". "K-Pax" was far better at showing the fantastic, with some subtlety.The miracles are blatant, not subtle. Dudley calls everyone he meets by name, and no one reacts appropriately to this, or any of the other supernatural occurrences. The continual filling of the sherry glasses happens too many times, and refilling of the bottle is overused. The skating scene is ... without director restraint and almost silly. So was decorating the tree. Typing the sermon (pressing the keys from across the room?) made no sense, other than to show off.Obvious wizardry like we see in this film ... leaves no room for faith, for the viewer or the characters. And all the players that act as if these events are just strange, not fantastic, come across as dunces. Despite a fine premise, the groups of writers that reworked the story for film dropped the ball. I feel they wasted a superb opportunity with an intriguing plot, wonderful actors, and very good direction. The only way I can recommend this film is like a shipwreck being a warning to other ships where the reef is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the first old film I have ever shut off in the middle of. Mind you, I really like older ones and buy them even if they are lousy but bolster an actor I appreciate. There is one minor, minor, story line that remains a serious error in this movie to me. And I have googled and searched and there is no one out there that has ever noticed this error which is quite puzzling. My point is not to highlight that I'm more perceptive or sensitive or whatever but I really am confounded as to why this film isn't offensive to others in the way they treat the bishop's daughter, DEBBIE. She is completely abandoned by her parent's emotionally in this film to the point where she'll say hello to her father and he won't reply to the poor child. Honestly I only watched half of this film to confirm if this little girl was actually their daughter and after she said, "Hi daddy", to him I knew she was. That should tell you how much they neglected her as you can only wonder up to that point if she's living there without her real parents but rather just being watched for the moment by these other people. Maybe, just maybe, I wouldn't notice this oversight if I were younger and not a father(parent) but I don't think so. The script certainly needed more work as this cruel neglect is absolutely atrocious.</fullReview>
