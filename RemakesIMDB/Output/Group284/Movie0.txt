		<shortDescription>Excellent Tapori Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent tapori-comedy movie after a long time. The plot line revolves around Munna Bhai(Sanjay Dutt) and his sidekick - Circuit (Arshad Warsi).Murli Prasad Sharma (Sanjay Dutt) becomes a bhai after coming to Mumbai. His father(Sunil Dutt) wanted him to become a doctor. Every time his father visits him in the city, his dhobi ghaat place has to be transformed into a hospital to show that he is a doctor. That scene is hilarious.But once Sunil Dutt finds out the reality, he is heart-broken and leaves. So now Sanjay Dutt has a point to prove and gets an admission to become a doctor. He doesn't get along well with the dean of the college. He is also in love with his daughter (Gracy Singh). The story now focuses on how people in the hospital need to be loved and appreciated. Arshad Warsi provides humour after every few scenes. Songs weren't that great except I really liked the "Subah Ho Gayi Mamu".Sanjay Dutt does justification to his role as the Bhai. Arshad Warsi in the supporting role has acted very well. His role in this reminded me a movie he had done earlier - Tere Mere Sapne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made in Indian Film Industry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, watched it past-night once again(nth time, I guess!). Just came to IMDb to see the response of our desis! Disappointed!!! Just 381 people have voted for it and the rating is going below 9! This movie deserves to be in top-250 of IMDb! This type of movies are made once every 2-3 decades. Munnabhai M.B.B.S. is a class.I remember very well, when I first saw the promos of this movie on TV, I was considering it as yet another timepass-govinda-sanju-type-comedy- movie. The night next to its release, there was a party in Mumbai having guests like Nasiruddin Shah and Om Puri! Mr. Shah stated "This movie will go ahead of Vaastav." I was surprised like hell! Vaastav!!! Went to theatre the same week and watched it. GREAT MOVIE! I can't mention a point against it. Everything was simply superb. If we talk about acting! Even the sweeper or peon acted far better than the lead-actors of other Indian movies.Don't go on anything, watch it and decide yourselves. You will love the movie, I swear!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughter Guaranteed!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Storyline: Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt) and his gang are the typical 'Bhai's in Mumbai who claims to be a social worker helping out people in recovery (through kidnapping, haath-pair todna) etc and has lied to his father that he is a doctor. When the truth is discovered, an insulted Munna then makes a resolve to become a doctor. Coincidentally, he joins the same college where his enemy Dr. Asthana (Boman Irani) is a strict Dean. A comedy of troubles starts when the 'cool' don confronts strict Asthana.Comment: Although the story is quite similar to Hollywood's 'Patch Adams', the movie can make u laugh non-stop except for some serious scenes that are very few in that movie. The tapori style of Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi is just too good. Sunil Dutt has acted after a really really long time of 17 years. Gracy Singh is graceful and sweet. Boman Irani has done a good job as a Strict Dean of the medical college who accidentally believes in Laughter therapy. Although the punchline of the movie says "He might just cure you", forget about the curing, he will surely make you laugh!! Truly Amazing Humour!! Rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real nice comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Munnabhai MBBS primarily because of Sunjay Dutt. He has always been good in comedy, and his movies make you laugh without having to take help of double meaning dialogues or crossing the line into bitchiness. Ofcourse, Sunjay Dutt has to have a gangster connection, only then the movie can sell. He is the eternal gangster and those roles fit him well, no body can deny that. But where you really have to give director the full points is that he saw the comedic talents of the junior Dutt and put them into a simplistic, well made movie. All the characters, be it "Circuit" (Arshad Warsi) or the "Dean", or Sunil Dutt, have been portrayed well enough in the movie. Some of the scenes, like the one where Sanjay Dutt "rags" the seniors make you laugh out from the heart, because this is something which every fresher in the college dreams of. I think, the movie deserves full points for direction, story, acting, nice title.... This movie was a real treat to watch when most of the other Hindi movies (especially the over-hyped stuff) turn out to be below average.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Laugh Riot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The funniest film of 2003 and perhaps the DECADE. Munna Bhai MBBS is a non-stop laugh riot! Sanjay Dutt gives another mind-blowing performance.Rajkumar Hirani is the new kid on the Block, but it doesn't show, one of would think he's a veteran filmmaker by the way he has directed his debut venture. Vidhu Vinod Chopra is not know for producing comedies, but his risk has paid off BIG TIME!!! The film also stars Sunil Dutt, after a very long gap, but he does full justice to his role, he's in full form and doesn't miss a single beat. Rohini Hattangadi is excellent. Arshad Warsi and Boman Irani simply steal the show. Gracy Singh is Sweet, Sensitive and spellbinding. Jimmy Shergill is excellent in a role that seems tailor made for him.Abbas Tyrewalla's Dialogues are superb and are the soul of the film. A definite must see!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The introduction to Munnabhai and Circuit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by the Hollywood movie 'Patch Adam', 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' tells the comedic story of a thug who wants to become a doctor. The film has its major share of comedic moments and its dramatic moments. It is indeed an entertaining film with the famously lovable characters like Munnabhai and Circuit. Rajkumar Hirani may have taken the idea of an older outsider wanting to become a doctor from 'Patch Adams' but in essence 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' is its own film and it is the performances and comedy that make it worth the watch because most the dramatic moments are a little over the top. While the dialogue in the comedic scenes are witty and hilarious, the ones in the dramatic scenes are a mess.Sanjay Dutt totally nails Munnabhai. It's hard to picture anyone else in the title role. The actor does full justice. It was nice to see Sunil Dutt after a long time and that too as father to his own son. The actor has a strong presence, even in a brief role. Gracy Singh is cute and adorable. Jimmy Shergill is awesome and holds his own as Zaheer and Boman Irani too does very well. However, it is Arshad Warsi who steals the show in a breakthrough performance as one of the most memorable film characters of recent time, Circuit.Most of the songs are well balanced and are good additions to the film. I found Munnabhai's romantic ballad hilarious when he tries to convince the suicider to cut the crap. On the technical side, it's alright. On the whole this is one enjoyable flick. One would have expected more from the second Munnabhai film which I found boring but why should that prevent the pleasure that comes from this movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One prescription of Munnabhia MBBS please!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say laughter is the best medicine, so here comes Dr. Murli Prasad Sharma to cure you. He may not be the brightest, he may not be the most polite, hell, he may not even be an actual doctor but he will put a smile on your face and make you forget all your problems. So if you haven't seen the tactics of Munnabhai, then forget your problems for 2 and half hours and treat yourself to his funny and endearing classic.Murli Prasad Sharma, aka Munnabhai is a gangster who claims to be a social worker. He ran away from his village years ago to make a life in Mumbai. However, he ended up becoming a goon who lives with the a lie he told his parents. He's a doctor. So once every year, Munna's parents come to see their "doctor" son and his clinic full of small time cons who pose as other doctors/patient. One circumstance leads to another and Munna's parents come to find out his real identify due to Dr. Asthana. A shattered and disappointed father, Hari Prasad Sharma leaves Munnaa in anger.A Munna full of shame is now destined to become a real doctor and so begins a tale of laughter, emotions and important lessons in life.When i initially saw the promos of this movie, I wasn't really interested. I was more interested in watching a star studded dud named L.O.C. Kargil which came the same month. I expected Munnabhi MBBS to be a slapstick comedy with no logic whatsoever.Firstly, there is no silly comedy in this movie. The lines are fresh, some are make your chuckle and some turn you in tears. The situations are fresh and nothing is forced. The very first scenes catch your eye and put a smile on your face.Sanju kidnapping the man in the first scene, Sunil Dutt scene at the railway station, the act put up by Sanju in front of his parents. You're just 15 minutes into the film and you're laughing out loud. The sequences in the hospital only get funnier.The film is a comedy but does not shy of trying to touch your emotions and it succeeds big time. Sunil Dutt confronting his son is heartbreaking to watch. Sanju's scenes with Jimmy Shergill is brilliant.The music is situational so it isn't conventional in any way. Although, the songs are different, they're good for the most part. The title song, Dekh Le, Chan Chan etc all go well with the screenplay and are soothing to the ears. There may not be a chartbuster in the soundtrack but the songs are still good.The writing is just brilliant. No loop-holes in the script. No dip in the screenplay. Characters are fully developed. Raju Hirani's story is fresh.Another highpoint - Abbas Tyrewala's dialogues. Just outrageous. They are funny, and not a bit over the top. The emotion filled dialogues are perfect too.Gracy Singh, Jimmy Shergill, Krush Debo etc all lend great support. It was a pleasure watching Sunil Dutt with Sanju.Baman Irani is a great talent and I'm sure he would agree with me that this movie boosted his acting career. He's hilarious. A brilliant act! Murli Prasad Sharma would not be what he is without his side-kick Circuit, played by Arshad Warsi. Arshad is a scene stealer. His best act yet. This role was a turning point for Arshad.Now to Sanjay Dutt. Before Munnabhia, Sanju was doing mediocre movies and mediocre roles. He hadn't give a box office hit in ages. Munnabhi MBBS is Sanjay Dutt's role. He was born to play the character and nobody can do it better than him. Not SRK, not Aamir - NOBODY! Although these people mentioned above are a huge part of the movie, none of them deserve more credit than the real hero of this masterpiece.Before naming him, I'd like to thank Vidhu Vinod Chopra for finding this guy. Yes, I'm talking about Indian cinema's current best filmmaker - Raj Kumar Hirani.This is Raju's film and no one can deny it. A perfectly directed movie and a novel idea. Hats off to this guy, who gave 2 more classics after this movie. (Lage Raho Munnabhai &amp; 3 Idiots) What is there left to say? Just watch it, enjoy it, and watch it again. (I know you will!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a poll coming up on IMDb's Classic Film board for the best titles of 2003,I started searching around for Bollywood movies that I could watch for the poll.Taking a look at the top grossing Bollywood films for 2003,I was delighted to spot a flick which I had seen the first half of at a friends house a few years ago,which led to me quickly booking an appointment with Dr.Munna Bhai.The plot:Finding out that his mum and dad are coming down to pay him an early visit,underworld gangster Munna Bhai orders his gang to completely change the appearance of his mansion,in order to keep his underworld life hidden from his parents.With no time to spare,Munna Bhai and his fellow friend/gangster decide to pretend to be dr's,so that Bhai's family can be happy at him having a 'traditional' job.Keeping everything under wraps,Bhai is caught by surprise,when his mum and dad reveal that they are going to arrange for him to get married to a former school friend of his nicknamed 'Chinki.'Keeping his underworld links under wraps,Bhai's parents run into the head doctor (Dr.J.C. Asthana) of a leading medical university.Talking about how proud they are of their son,Asthana destroys any sense of pride that Bhai's family have,by revealing that Bhail is actually a major gangster.Sickened by the sadness that his parents feel,Bhai decides that the only way he can bring happiness back to his parent's lives is to enter medical school with his gangster buddies by his side.View on the film:Running at 2 and a half hours,the screenplay by co-writer/ (along with Lajan Joseph,Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Abbas Tyrewala)editor/director Rajkumar Hirani moves at a lightning fast pace,with the writers jam packing the movie with hilariously sharp one dialogue and quick-paced slap-stick which is smartly always rooted to the characters current situations which helps the jokes to never feel disconnected from the drama taking place.Making sure to never become sickly sweet,and backed by a wonderful score from Anu Malik, (with almost all of the songs thankfully being subtitled)the writers wisely use the running time to gradually give the film a real heart,as Munna Bhai discovers the skills that he used to keep his gang together,can be put to better use for people who are in desperate need.Returning to the screen for the first time in 16 years,Sunil Dutt gives a very good performance as Munna Bhai's dad,with Dutt showing a real sorrow towards his real life son,as he discovers the lies that he has been told.Meeting up with his dad on screen,Sanjay Dutt gives an excellent performance as Munna Bhai,with Dutt delivering each one liner with a real relish,whilst also making sure that the comedy moments never get away from Bhai's aim of making his mum and dad proud.Despite there being a 20 year gap,Gracy Singh gives a charming performance as 'Chinki',with Singh showing a real sincerity as Chinki finds herself being taken by Bhai's charms,whilst Arshad Warsi shows a real comedic bite as Bhai's loyal sidekick Circuit,and Boman Irani (covered in expertly done make up effects) gives a tremendously ruthless performance,as the Dr who is determined to make Munna Bhai fail at the school.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant comedy, huge message, miracle at its best. This movie is an ideology, a thought, an idea, a discussion, a help, a concept, a psychological analysis, in all the reason to start religions.It plays on an idea....."It doesn't matter what you are or what you do, the only thing that matters is what you feel inside, what you are inside".....Patch Adams is a man who see vagina as a fact and just remains with it without attractive or repulsive thoughts...... Munna Bhai is a man who see the world with what it need and not with what it is having.Mind and logics play on the level of physical existence while love and compassion play on the level of life, its events, the religion. Dead body for experiment is referred just a subject but he orders to refer it with respect and not as a blob of flesh. A goon with a kind heart creates difference.The film is obvious drama with lot of loop holes but since its a comedy and has so many unforgettable punches of logic that its highly respectable. Such kind of movies are not for comparison, they are to abide by and understood with heart and not the brain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest comedy i ever have seen by Sanjay dutt(Munna) and Circuit. Overall it was a good mixture of comedy and moral message. Movie gets the speed in second half. There are many scenes where you can't stop yourself without big laughing. Munna once said to doctor "i have to become a full proof doctor, you are not good enough because if you are a heart doctor then you never know what is going on in knee". Bride's father was a senior doctor, who never likes Munna because he was a gangster. Munna just get entered into his medical college by fraud documents and cheating. Munna's character is having very good sense of humour, he generally offers hug to everyone, that's has become a very good dose for patients.In the end when Sanjay's parents gets to know about reality then they had proud on their son.I will give 8 rating to this movie and will say "Must watch" .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MunnaBhai MBBS- The film is a tragic-comic tale of Munna's antics in the process of becoming a doctor and thereby laying bare the way the medical fraternity functions. Emotions play an important role in this film and while the first half is a laugh riot - primarily because of Munna, Circuit and Dr Asthana - the second half has some weepy moments. But the film with the original story it's a good, clean, entertaining film. The plot more or less stays on the track barring a few song sequences, which slow down the proceedings. Anu Malik's music is a letdown though everything else about the film is good enough. Sanju could have made Munna - the bhai with a heart of gold - endearing and absolutely adorable in a way only he could. Complimenting his performance are two key actors - Boman Irani as Dr Asthana who is a hoot with his act of 'laughter therapy' and Arshad Warsi as Munna's trusted aide who can do anything for his bhai. With a remarkable comic timing, Warsi deserves good, meaty roles in future. Gracy Singh and Jimmy Sheirgill as the cancer patient too play their parts sincerely. Last but not the least, Dutt Senior brings a certain dignity to his character and truly brings a lump in the throat in the climax when he hugs his errant son. Truly a Kodak moment! All in all, Munnabhai MBBS is just the film the doctor prescribed for viewing pleasure! fully entertaining!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MUNNABHAI M.B.B.S. is worth watching movie. Moments that you carry home after the show has ended. Rajkumar Hirani's strength lies in the fact that he has extracted wonderful performances from just about everyone in the film, not just from the principal cast.The screenplay could've been tighter. The film has engaging moments in abundance, but the goings-on could've been concise towards the second half. Dialogues are commendable, especially the ones delivered by Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi. Cinematography is good. If VAASTAV was a turning point in Sanjay Dutt's fluctuating career, another film that will make people sit up and notice his talent is MUNNABHAI M.B.B.S. Known as an 'action man' all through his career, the actor proves with this performance. He is lovable as a bhai, aspiring to be a doctor and equally impactful towards the end when death snatches away one of the patients (Jimmy Shergill). A good performance undoubtedly!Sunil Dutt is such a pleasure to watch after a hiatus. The small but significant role remains etched due to this veteran's expert portrayal. In fact, this is the second time the father and son have starred in a film and the moments they share on screen look straight out of life, especially the hug (jadoo ki jhappi) in the climax. Gracy Singh is first-rate, delivering a controlled performance. The actress is getting better with every release. Jimmy Shergill &amp; Boman Irani is also good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Storyline: Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt) and his gang are the typical 'Bhai's in Mumbai who claims to be a social worker helping out people in recovery (through kidnapping, Heath-pair Dona) etc and has lied to his father that he is a doctor. When the truth is discovered, an insulted Munna then makes a resolve to become a doctor. Coincidentally, he joins the same college where his enemy Dr. Asthana (Boman Irani) is a strict Dean. A comedy of troubles starts when the 'cool' don confronts strict Asthana.Comment: Although the story is quite similar to Hollywood's 'Patch Adams', the movie can make u laugh non-stop except for some serious scenes that are very few in that movie. The tapori style of Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi is just too good. Sunil Dutt has acted after a really really long time of 17 years. Gracy Singh is graceful and sweet. Boman Irani has done a good job as a Strict Dean of the medical college who accidentally believes in Laughter therapy. Although the punchline of the movie says "He might just cure you", forget about the curing, he will surely make you laugh!! Truly Amazing Humour!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MUNNABHAI M.B.B.S. is worth watching for the tender moments it has to offer, Moments that you carry home after the show has ended. Jimmy Shergill is excellent. The sequence when he learns that he is suffering from a killer disease and his outburst thereafter proves that the actor is capable of so much more, provided he is offered the right kind of roles.Arshad Warsi is outstanding, complimenting Sanjay Dutt at every step. Though he doesn't have lengthy dialogues to deliver, his sheer presence, his expressions all through and the mannerisms will win him plaudits from one and all.On the whole, MUNNABHAI M.B.B.S. is amongst the best movies churned out from Bollywood in the recent times.</fullReview>

The story move around the character Munna who is by profession a Don, i would not call a Don as he is just reducing the gap between rich and poor. He is taking some money from rich and helping poor to take care of there needs. Music is also amazing. I love to sing these songs whenever i am in good mood. I saw this movie more than 15 times in TV also. Direction of the movie is superb. The Scene i love the most is the ragging scene where Munna ragged his seniors. The way he give everyone a caring hand and make them his follower is treat to watch. I emphasized and say it is a Must Watch movie.</fullReview>

Munna's father, Hari Prasad Sharma , an upright, moralistic man, believes that his son is actually a doctor running a charity hospital. Every year, when his parents arrive, Munna and his gang bathe, shave, don white coats and stethoscopes and pretend to be diligent doctors. But the clever charade falls apart. Hari Prasad Sharma runs into an old friend, Dr. Asthana, who has a daughter called Suman . The two decide that their children, both doctors, would make a perfect match. Munna tries hard to save the situation, but his father discovers the truth. And all hell breaks loose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good but also a case of too much....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Munna has spent the last decade trying to pretend to his parents that he's a responsible doctor. However, he's actually a gangster. When they find out the truth, he decides to go to medical school and does. Out of the blue, the previously evil Munna suddenly notices how dispassionate and love-deprived the medical school and hospital are--so he begins doing everything he can to change the place. And, oddly, he begins calling everyone 'dude' and talking like a surfer."Munna Bhai MBBS" is a film that has way too much in it. Now I know that it was popular in India...so the filmmakers made the right choices for this movie. But outside of India, I can't see the film doing as well because it actually looks like about five films shoved into one! IMDb says it's a remake of "Patch Adams"....and much of the movie is also like that. But there's also a lot of Rodney Dangerfield's "Back to School", a gangster film, "Animal House" as well as, of all things, a Pauly Shore picture! A great example of too much--and a tighter focus could have made the film great. As it is, it's fun and very enjoyable but also very slight--when it should have been profound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Munnabhai M.B.B.S.: The Film That Gives You a Jaadu ki Jhappi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>+ Rajkumar Hirani: Marking his debut, Hirani sparkles with his simple style and his ability to extract the best from his actors.+ Script: Munnabhai... also comes at a time when there was a serious dearth of good writing in films.+ Sanjay Dutt: He reinvents himself playing a gangster with a good heart. It is a pleasant departure from his usual gun-totting gangster self that he otherwise is known to play.+ Music: It is sort of a comeback for Anu Malik who was fading away from the limelight at that time. Brilliant music.+ Supporting cast: Arshad Warsi gets to redeem himself as Munna's sidekick and takes the film to a whole new level. Sunil Dutt plays his last ever role as Sanjay Dutt's father himself and enthralls us all. Gracy Singh also gets to make a comeback after a slew of mediocre films. Boman Irani plays the character that would define him for the rest of his career.- Length : As is with most Bollywood films, the length of Munnabhai M.B.B.S. is something that could have been managed by cutting it down a little.Munnabhai M.B.B.S. will be remembered for a lot of things. It broke convention and told a story like never before in Indian cinema. It got together a famous real life father-son pair together on the screen and brought out a chemistry that was simply amazing to watch. It also brought together a cast of actors that were down on their lucks at that point of their careers.Munnabhai M.B.B.S. tells the story of a gangster, Munna, who has also lied to his father that he is a doctor in the city. Every visit from his parents ends up in him faking the existence of a hospital run by him. Things go haywire when Dr. Asthana, a real doctor, calls him out after Munna's father proposes that Asthana's daughter get married to Munna. Left red-faced and embarrassed in front of his father, who vows never to see him again, Munna decides to become a real doctor to teach Asthana a lesson and win back the trust of his father.Directed by the incredibly talented and the then debutant, Rajkumar Hirani, Munnabhai... will forever be remembered for being a sweet comedy that taught people something while entertaining as well. The term "jaadu ki jhappi" will be something that will stay with every Munnabhai fan for years to come. One can also never forget Arshad Warsi as Circuit, the sidekick who has a heart of gold.Munnabhai will also be remembered for the chemistry between Munna and Circuit. They make it look so real and believable that is is difficult not to fall for their characters.Sanjay Dutt rules the screen as Munnabhai. He even surpasses his performance in Vaastav with his role as the gangster with a heart.Munnabhai is a special film. It set the ball rolling for a host of adaptations by regional filmmakers. Even Hollywood sat up and took notice. It is the film that will be etched in our memories as our all time favorite gangster film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Munnabhai MBBS was an acid test: The promos were not too attractive Sanjay Dutt and lighthearted films - no chance, Arshad Warsi was going through bad phase, new director Rajkumar Hirani but the film proved all wrong The film is a lighthearted film with emotions, comedy and all yet it's different then run of the mill. The film starts well, the scene when SuniL Dutt arrives is funny(Nawzuddin Siddiqui appears in a cameo as the thief) then the scene when Boman Irani insults Sanju and his family is superb. The real fun starts when Sanju enters the college and the scenes that follow, Jadoo Ki Jhappi and all are superb Only hitch: Length in second half, some scenes are lil irritational but yet this are minor glitchesDirection by Rajkumar Hirani is superb, rare for a newcomer Music is good, title song is a typical number but got famous, other songs are goodSanjay Dutt is born to play Munnabhai, no other actor could suit it, it was offered previously to Srk I doubt he would do it well, Sanju is admirable in emotions, comedy and romance and everything though looking old Gracy Singh is for once good and charming Arshad Warsi is simply awesome, before this film he had proved his talent but his career was going downhill, but after this film he suddenly became famous, he is born to play circuit Boman Irani was another rare find in this film, he is simply matchless in a role that made him typecast in such roles later, Jimmy Shergill is admirable in a cameo, Amongst rest, Sunil Dutt is admirable in his last film, Rohini Hattangudy though being same age as Sanju is awesome Amongst rest Yatin Karyekar and almost everyone is superb</fullReview>

Sanjay is enough to entertain the audience for full 2 hr. 30 min. and he has support of Arshad Warsi and Dr. J.

		<fullReview>This movie is an over-the-top comedy fare from start to finish. And if it does not leave you in stitches rolling on the floor, then you really ought to go see a doctor!Pretending to be a doctor when he's actually an underworld don, this is a simple yarn of a thug out to prove a point to his parents by getting into medical school and becoming a real doctor. What a hilarious idea!! There is superb acting by the main characters Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani, Gracy Singh as well as almost all the supporting cast. Arshad Warsi is outstanding as the don's right hand. The substitute doctor acted well, too. Some of the melodrama (the guy with cancer, his family, etc) could have been cut in the editing room, but doesn't affect the pace much. It does have a few dance numbers, but nothing out of place or forced.Vidhu Vinod Chopra is making a name for himself taking calculated risks with new directors (Hirani, Sarkar of Parineeta) and new talent. Great to see someone in Bollywood sticking their neck out to make something at least plausibly entertaining, not the usual romantic nonsense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunil Dutt was the original funny man of the Indian Cinema (Padosan)even though he did not mean to be, he had a vacant,stupid look that came across better than his romantic roles that he had to endure in countless movies. Now we have his prodigal son Sanjay Dutt who has a physique for a gangster and a facade that is as vacant as his father which makes him perfect for a comic role (The Burt Reynolds of Bollwood). He is a disaster in romantic movies and many may feel the same way too. He is very adept at playing the intensity of a gangster as in "Plan" or a gangster/fake Doctor as he does here.As Munnabhai he fills the coat to the fullest with his talent. The story is poignant and moralistic where the audience comes out with a message instead of glossy eyed teeny- boppers watching the recent string of bubble gum movies like KKHH, DDLJ, KHNH, most of them starring mediocre actors albeit saved by catchy music. Talent will shine no matter what-Gracy Singh is an example of that premise, this is an actress who has the elegance of the yesteryear Stars like Vijayantimala and talent go with it, and she has only one place to go-that is the top.Boman Irani is just is just superb.

Being tapori genre; its dialogs are ought to be written by some expert - and it is exactly fulfilled. It is a rare combination of several good works inclusive of music.I just wanted to write this comment about the theme of the movie. It is impossible not to draw parallelism with Patch Adams, but I believe it is invain - as the comparison stops in the beginning itself. I saw this movie and had the feeling of a roller coaster ride and enjoyed immensely (laughed and cried at the same time). However, there was a sort of uncomfortable feeling precipitated in me after seeing the movie. I do not know how to understand that. I am not sure whether it is generated because a tapori like Munnabhai can question the age old wisdom and education or because it promotes unconventional things, but certainly there is a difference here. Patch Adams is a regular doctor takes on the system of medicine but Munnabhai....... I could not delve more into this because I liked the movie so much.</fullReview>

But this Indian film about a mobster who wants to become a doctor to please is father is almost too stupid for words. We have a very unpleasant main character, silly goings on with totally unbelievable gangsters, sloppy acting, unnecessary songs and dance acts, sentimentality, and so on. What we see here is another example of the failing voting system of IMDb, because if more people from the western world would see this film I'm sure it would never get an 8+.</fullReview>

After showing his comic talent in Inaam Dus Hazzar, Daud, Haseena Maan Jayegi, Khoobsurat, Chal Mere Bhai, Jodi No.1, Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah, Sanju is back with his best comic performance. Arshad Warsi good support as a Side-Kick. Good to see Sunil Dutt after Phool. Sr. &amp; Jr. Dutt came first time face to face in this movie before they worked in two movies but never came face to face (Rocky ans Kshatriya). Gracy Singh again in a role of Doctor after `Armaan' but you will see the difference in her both performances. Rohnin Hattangadri gave a adequate support. Surprise perdoemance by Boiman Irani who earlier worked in three films `Everybody Says I Am Fine', `Let's Talk' and `Darna Mana Hai' and one wonders that where this talented person was before and where he was hiding and why no one noticed him before. `Aik Jhohri Hi Heere Ki Parakh Kar Sakta Hain' and that Jhohri is none other than RajKumar Hirani who has done a Fabulous Job. And the Credit goes to the Technical WhizKid Vidhu Vinod Chopra who has played the role of a Producer in this movie and didn't interfered in the making of this movie and gave a free hand to his director to work. A Must See Movie and is the best movie of this genre. 5 out of 5 Allah Hafiz</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doctors in India - It happens only in India !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where M stands for Master of Masters B means Bindas character (Callous &amp; careless attitude) B means Beshumar Actor (and actor of unparallel skills) S means Shayana Character (a very clever character)Story of an educated failure ? with good righteous pair of parents , but son becomes hay wire because of the society ? seeing corruption, cheating and bribery everywhere ? the son ? Munna Bhai ? becomes a kind of underworld don ? who is afterall good at heart.A "Jaadoo ki Jhappi" ? meaning "Miracle hug with love" is the remedy to all ailments !Very true indeed ? some little things he does because of which the movie is a smash hit among frustrated-by-socio-economico-political-lo- scenario Indians ..are as follows :1.he hugs the sweeper saying that he is also a human without whom its difficult to survive.2. he speaks against too much formalities before accepting a patient who is about to die.3. he faints at the sight of blood.4. he kidnaps a Chinese tourist and chloroforms him and makes it the dead body to be dissected on !5. This ragging the Chinese tourist happened because the tourist was taking the snaps of the bitter truth still existing in India ? ie. Poverty !- He was taking the snaps of poverty stricken malnutrition-ed Indian citizens ? this the Munna bhai &amp; comrades did not like as they spend lakhs of Rupees on prostitute women &amp; wine. Being wasteful and creating ruckus and unrest in the society is their major pre-occupation basically.6. The miracle hug is happening only between young boys and girls in schools &amp; colleges ? even more than that in fact like MMS of DPS?Baazi dot com?remember Indians ?7. He treats a cancer patient on his last days?by making a skimpy clad woman dance in front of him and even arranges for a date with her ? since he was already dying of cancer ? so an AIDS attack wont matter much.This , my dear people of this world ? is a smash hit movie in Indai ! ? Hail India.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tell me how it is NOT a copy of Patch Adams...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A misfit/underdog joins the med school.Believes in healing by humour, making personal relation with patients, which is atypical of the docs.Hated by professors and fellows. Professors try to remove him from college.His roomie, who is the topper (also hates him), helps him stay.Now tell me how Munnabhai M.B.B.S is not a copy of Patch Adams! Merely by changing a bit of preamble and postscript of a story, one cannot call it original. At least Robin Williams could bring in some amount of tolerance to Patch Adams, but alas in here, there is none.</fullReview>
