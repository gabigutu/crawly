		<fullReview>Even though it is remake of Hindi film,the dialogues by crazy Mohan and the delivery by Kamal with facial expression and timing is first class.Also others are equally acted well.Plot may be Hindi but dialogues are original and trade mark of Crazy Mohan.Only Kamal can deliver this in cinema.Crazy and Kamal are good combination.I also enjoyed the melody of music.good luck to Bharadwaj. Plot may not be logical in western eyes but for me cinema is an entertainment and I was entertained very much by this film. I think Prabu,though was in supportive roll,did very well indeed.Prakash Raj acted extremely well. I think he is very under rated actor in Tamil films.I think Sneha is beautiful and acted very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have'nt seen the Hindi original(Munnabhai MBBS), 'Vasool Raja MBBS' will be a rip-roaring comedy for you. For the n'th time the acclaimed duo, Kamal Haasan and Crazy Mohan come together to give a laughable, entertaining and successful masala venture. When compared with the original Sanjay Dutt starrer, this movie is technically cheap and haphazardly made. But what matters most for the masses is the entertainment value of a movie. As expected, the movie had a good run in the box office. It has become a habit for Kamal, one of India's most talented actor, to make senseless slapstick comedies after every serious big budget movie. Similarly, this was released after his village action-flick Virumandi, which had an average run, although critically acclaimed. Kamal hasn't cared much about his make up too, as he looks plump n tired, in most of the scenes. Prabhu is reduced to playing his sidekick. Prakashraj, for the first time with Kamal, has done a decent job.Overall, this is not one of Kamal's best comedies but is a real-good time-pass flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this is a remake of Munnabhai MBBS, it is as good as the Hindi version. Kamal Hassan is very funny. His personality mirrors as he acts. Prabhu was just as funny making the movie more hilarious. Prakash Raj is strict yet humorous. Sneha is fine also. Her character helped move the plot along. The dialogues are well created. Even though most of the dialogues are the same to Munnabhai MBBS, there are more comical scenes embedded into the script. Those "extra" scenes are witty and made the movie stronger. The songs are fun and really work with the movie. The supporting actors really enhance the movie. Overall, it is a laughing riot and a bit more humorous than the Hindi version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vasoolraja MBBS is a remake of the Hindi mega hit Munnabhai MBBS. People who have seen Munnabhai MBBS have made an unfavourable comparison, preferring the Hindi version to the Tamil version - even Tamil moviegoers. Well, I am an exception - probably the only exception. I saw VR first, then MB but I preferred VR and watched it again just to confirm my preference. I did not change my mind.Rajaraman is the son of Nagesh and Rohini Hattangadi (reprising her role from the Hindi version). After an argument with his father, Raja runs off to Madras where he becomes a debt collector (hence the nickname "Vasool" meaning collect), thug and gangster. His father however thinks that his son is a doctor and Raja is forced to pretend as a doctor every time the father comes to the city.Nagesh meets Prakashraj, a doctor and arranges to meet Sneha, Prakashraj's daughter, also a doctor. However, his maid informs Prakashraj of the true identity of Raja and humiliates him and his parents and kicks them out.Raja then swears that he will enrol into a medical college, marry Sneha and humiliate Prakashraj. How he does it is the story.I found the whole movie hilarious. Crazy Mohan's dialogues had me in stitches. It was a Kamal Hassan movie so I am not complaining that Prabu had a secondary role - it does not matter anyway since Prabhu always acts as a brilliant foil to the main stars.Kamal Hassan did not do anything different in the film, but the dialogues and the twists in the story kept me enthralled.Prakashraj delivered the goods although I preferred Boman Irani. The "laughter therapy" that caught India by storm was pilloried to the fullest here. Sneha was funny, naughty, sad and went through a gamut of emotions that did not need much work. Karunas had too few scenes but made us laugh whenever he appeared. He tells Raja: " Why are we standing here on the top of this high tower? You know I am scared of height. I get scared even looking at Amitabh Bachchan" (Who is well-known for his height).The music is excellent and the theme song will make you hum along.Overall, I would watch this film again and again, whenever I need a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that does not work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an absolute remake of Munnabhai MBBS.Poor cast in this remake makes the movie boring.Arshad Warsi character in Munnabahai had been made filthy in this remake. I would laugh at the person who says that Kamal Hassan is a world hero. Poor music makes this movie more worst.It fails to make a magic.I feel very sad for making Arshad Warsi character worst in this remake. Songs are poor in this remake.Absolute this is a remake that has made me hate south Indian movies totally.Every scene is copied from original Munnabhai MBBS. My kind wish is please stop remaking super-successful movies in other languages. I felt very depressed after watching this remake.</fullReview>
