		<shortDescription>Excellent Entertainer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a long time, you get to see full length entertainer from the MEGA STAR Chiru. Beginning to End, full entertainment. Family and kids can watch this movie. Chiru performance is super, however other characters got side tracked. Every TINGLISH proverbs are rightly used. What else you can expect more!Heroine selection is okay, but would have been nice to see more new generation heroines. Comedy Gang did their best, but still it would be a worth if they had little bit more length.Worth a watch</fullReview>
