		<shortDescription>A pointless remake of an excellent British film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite having double the budget and some pretty big Hollywood stars the 2010 release adds nothing whatsoever, and in fact is in many ways inferior.Not only are there some very lacklustre performances in particular from Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence as the two sons of the deceased, but the camera work in some sections is truly awful with the decision to use "handheld" or steadicam photography resulting in the picture shaking so badly in some sections that it is almost hard to watch.Despite all this many of the best moments of the original are copied perfectly and work just as well as they did the first time around meaning that there are several good laughs to be had, but when you've got the choice of watching this or the original there's really no contest.Distinctly average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was really impressed............WITH THE ORIGINAL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why was this film remade? Why can't the Americans just let us have our comedies? Why do they have to steal all of our ideas? Why would James Marsden and Danny Glover degrade themselves in this movie? Why can't they try something original for a change? And when will Chris Rock realise that he's really not all that funny?Please take my advice all avid film and comedy fans if anyone out there is interested in watching this film STOP!!!! Go out and find the original and watch that. I promise you it is so much better.The British have a much more tactful way of creating comedy. We don't need to use short people jokes and sexual innuendo to get laughs. IT'S JUST SIMPLY BETTER</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a Word, Unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Unnecessary' is probably the best single word description of Neil LaBute's "Death at a Funeral." I mean, there's really no precedent for the release of a same-language remake a paltry two and a half years after its original, and yet the guest list arrives for this new "Funeral" with almost as fast a turnaround as a Hollywood sequel. Hell, Chris Nolan hibernated on his second "Batman" film longer.Nevertheless, the reality is that the decidedly Afro-American-friendly version of the dysfunctional family comedy (notable only because it really is the later film's sole distinguishing feature), is now in theaters, leaving anyone who remembers the Frank Oz original to ponder why.LaBute and star Chris Rock, who also served as a producer on the film, cheekily 'adapt' U.K. writer Dean Craig's screenplay by peppering it with hip-pop pop-culture nods to Usher and R. Kelly, and leaving the rest, in essence, unchanged. On one hand, I appreciate the sentiment in that it doesn't presume to outdo its progenitor, but that's its problem as a standalone piece: it's either identical or inferior in every conceivable way. As such, the majority of its first-time audience will probably appreciate the comedic build-up having not been spoiled on the gags, and that's fine for right now, but it poses a potential dilemma, say, ten years down the road.When film buffs and historians look back on "Death at a Funeral" (which they honestly have little reason to), the choice between the two versions will be obvious. Plus, they'll have no idea who "Usher" is.Likewise, even today I'd recommend a rental of the 2007 film over a ticket to its 2010 counterpart, because, well, the original is the original, and for all its faithfulness, the remake actually accentuates what's lost in translation. The pop-culture one-liners clash with the characters on the page, and leave them feeling half-formed and sloppy on the screen?Are we watching Chris Rock do what makes Chris Rock hilarious, or are we seeing him play a repressed, introverted protagonist? The answer, messily, is both.On that level, there's a creative integrity to the original performances that is impossible in LaBute's version. Martin Lawrence, Danny Glover, Tracey Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Peter Dinklage, Luke Wilson, and others comprise an undeniably talented cast that does an admirable job performing characters that were written as upper-crust Englishmen, but watching Rock sulk his way through the film makes it abundantly clear that they're not being themselves.There's also the not-so-insignificant matter of LaBute's bland artisanship. In the past, he's been responsible for equally lifeless big-screen adaptations of his own stage plays, and a spectacularly poorly-received remake of "The Wicker Man"?It begs the question, why was he asked and trusted to shepherd this project? There's no single performance in the film that feels particularly informed by his hand, and LaBute fails to bring a single funny idea to the table. In adhering so rigidly to "Funeral" prime, his remake is marked by an absence of directorial and comedic vision.I have no qualms with anyone who enjoyed "Death at a Funeral" for the first time via the LaBute/Rock version. A lot of what made the British comedy memorable has survived, and even with a jaded precognition of the gags, I mined a couple laughs. However, the fatal flaw of the 2010 adaptation is that the 2007 version exists. It's not like it's antiquated or anything; it's three years old.Anyone with an open mind can still appreciate the original "Death at a Funeral," and its immediate availability for less than the cost of a night at the movies makes the 2010 remake quintessentially one thing?Unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the original instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me cut it short. There was a refreshing, funny, utterly lovable and enjoyable death - comedy titled Death at a Funeral. It's not even outdated, came out a couple of years ago. This movie tries to live up to the original English comedy, but despite the brilliant actors like Glover and David, it doesn't succeed. It actually made every mistake a remake can make, therefore the original remains brilliant and this one is just a weak copy. Sad, but true. They tried, even tried hard, I admit, but there are things that best remain untouched. Death at a Funeral is one of them. It's a nice try, but will disappear undocumented, unlike the original one that remains a fine example of English black humor.My recommendation: Watch that one instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Go and see the recent original film 'Death at a Funeral,' the British version, hilarious. It is a black comedy, which isn't depressing but is light hearted fun of the almost delicious Charles Addams school of macabre humour.I can only surmise the US film industry thinks US viewers too thick or insular to watch a comedy in the same language with a (nowadays) slightly different accent. If you aren't as puddle headed as they've assumed, see the original and laugh yourself sick, as I did. PS it so far has got 7. something on IMDb... enough said, you'll be pleased you did. What's more the whole family can enjoy this one without boring anyone at all let alone to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was that about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original Death at a Funeral when it first came out and thoroughly enjoyed it, however this remake, though possessing arguably greater star power fails to live up to it's predecessor. in my opinion, it misses the mark completely, and was absolutely unnecessary. I know everyone has different taste, but this was just bad. Bad Bad Bad. It is difficult to give an unbiased review seeing as how I have watched the original, but this to me has just highlights how substandard this film is. It is as if Hollywood was trying to prove a point, but failed miserably. I have watched the original four times and still am able to laugh throughout. This was just terrible. This brings me to the question "why?" Who felt that this was necessary? I was gravely disappointed with this film and I think an apology is due to it's original writer and cast members for this atrocious remake!!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninspired remake of a great comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about the funeral of a family man. the funeral turns out to be very eventful with many surprises."Death at a Funeral" is almost the same as the British original, be it the title or the plot. The British one was really funny, I remember myself laughing very hard when I watched it. This remake, is mildly funny, but it is just in a different league. It uses cheap humour to make people laugh, and it lacks the witty dialog of the original. Moreover, characters are less sympathetic and more annoying in this remake. Despite a few funny moments, I would stay "Death at a Funeral" is an uninspired remake of a great comedy. Maybe filmmakers will bear in mind that remaking such a recent film in the same language with the same plot is not such a good idea, as it will inevitably draw comparisons between the original and the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very talented comedic cast...unfortunately the material and character development were lacking. I only chuckled a couple times at best.Hopefully, if Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence,Tracy Morgan and Luke Wilson (some of the funniest and most talented),should have the opportunity to perform together again, it will be in a screenplay that will play to their talents, not confine them in characters that are stereo-types.Loretta Devine...an amazing talent as seen briefly on television's Eli Stone, was used minimally and not to her full potential.Danny Glover...played an erasable old codger, once again,character not fully developed. Example: James Marsden's character consumed a hallucinogenic unbeknownst to him, so when Peter Dinklage's character &amp; Danny Glover's character also had consumed a hallucinogenic the effects of the hallucinogenic seemed over the top for James Marsden's character "Oscar", and Peter Dinklage's character had quite a few more pills and yet had a more subdued reaction. Finally Danny Glover's character who was physically immobile somehow managed to end up naked on the roof after consuming the hallucinogenic. This wouldn't be that big of a deal had it not been one the integral 'sight gags' involving Tracy Morgan with Danny Glover's character earlier in the film.Bored to death by Death at a Funeral!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has its fair share of funny moments, but does not live up to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's unfortunate watching a talented cast not live up to their considerable talents. This is why Death At A Funeral, a remake of the 2007 British farce is so unfortunate. While the funny, talented cast does what they can and produce their fair share of laughs, they don't live up to their considerable talents nor does the film live up to its original. I think the reason I actually kind of enjoyed this is because I view the 2007 version and this version as two completely different films, but it's hard not to compare the 2 if you walk into this version having already seen the 2007 version. I'm happy that this story is getting a wider audience because the script is brilliant. A cast including Martin Lawrence, Regina Hall, Columbus Short, Chris Rock, Zoe Saldana, Luke Wilson, Danny Glover, Peter Dinklage, Keith David, Loretta Divine, Ron Glass, Tracy Morgan, James Marsden, and Kevin Hart create a better than average comedy, but not the comedy this talented cast could of created. I really liked the cast and did laugh at this more than at something like, say, The Bounty Hunter. I'm sure a lot of people are gonna like this, but, unless you have not seen the original, and in that case, do not know there was an original, you can wait for video, or better yet, skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Let me get this straight: our dad was "bromantically" involved with a guy that could fit in his pocket, and you're mad because he's white?" Aaron (Chris Rock)That's the story line for Neil Labute's remake of Frank Oz's Death at a Funeral. And that's the best line in the film, a foolish, slapstick send up of a funeral service in which Chris Rock's Aaron tries to keep the event from sinking with the news that their dead dad was, when he was alive, very much alive with his short lover, Frank (Peter Dinklage).Funereal is how I would characterize the humor of this iteration, in which the most offensive scene is not as good as any other like it in film slumdom. By that I mean when Norman (Tracy Morgan) holds Uncle Russell's (Danny Glover) fundament for everyone to see on his hand, face, and shirt, comic scatology has reached bottom, so to speak. (Oh, Danny boy, how low can you go for a buck?). To compare this scene with the pool sequence in Caddy Shack is to make Caddy Shack the Citizen Kane of comedy. Similarly James Marsden's manic turn as the guest on a hallucinatory drug must be embarrassing for an actor whose role as Corny Collins in Hairspray now looks favorably like Ryan Secrest after a summer at Actor's Studio.I'm wasting your time by trying to make up for this lame comedy of bad manners. If you want to feel as if you've died and gone to purgatory for indiscriminate film goers, then see Death at a Funeral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy that goes absolutely nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grant you this is a potentially good idea for a movie, especially a comedy. But the results are very disappointing. There are about 1 or 2 laughs few and far between, which are very minor. I'm not even convinced these actors are trying at all, or if there's a real story here. At the very beginning, after Chris Rock finds that the wrong body is in the casket, I thought this movie might go somewhere. Boy, was I mislead. And the subplot, involving James Marsden, is a complete misfire. Wow. Actually, his part is so stupid, calling it a misfire is an understatement. However, it is not exactly a boring movie. I suppose the picture makes up for in admiration what it lacks in humor. Also on the plus side, it's only around 90 minutes in length. As for the toilet humor (which isn't funny either), well, let's just say this film gives that term a whole new meaning. If you absolutely must see this, at least skip a trip to the theater.** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrible remake, the original came out less than three years ago. Originally the film is set in Britain and the dark humor rolls through the entire movie. The new one? Not so much. It seems someone decided that the the original "Death at a Funeral" wasn't 'black' enough, so they did a black-cast, and changed the location to urban America. The dialogue and story? All the same as the original. This remake seems too forced. The jokes aren't funny, the actors seem fake (despite it being a great cast) and overall just terrible. I hope that you take the time to watch the original and have some laughs instead of this garbage. Hollywood just seems to be getting lazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shameless ripoff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a shameless and unfunny ripoff of the 2007 British movie of the same name. Nothing in this movie even remotely approaches the humor of the 2007 original version. What makes this movie even more pathetic is how it even botches up those scenes that in the 2007 movie were hilarious. After watching the 2007 movie one left the theater with a smile; after watching this movie one leaves hoping that their funeral won't be as disastrous as the one in the movie. The cast featured some really good comic actors, but in this movie they are not funny. The acting was poor, Martin Lawrence and Chris Rock were unfunny (in fact, Mr. Rock was actually subdued), the dialog was flat, the story, as already indicated, entirely unoriginal, and the plot nonexistent. And as for Danny Glover, this movie has to be the low point of his acting career. The movie attempts to be goofy but winds up being contrived. But the worst element of this movie is the story's utter lack of plausibility. In the original British version, the story works; in this ripoff version, the story collapses. As this movie proves, what may be funny in one movie may not necessarily be funny in a remake, even if the story is exactly the same. May this movie rest in peace in DVD land.Orchestra Wives (1942)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, well I haven't seen the 2007 version, so I can't really compared this remake with that movie. So I will be making my review here solely on the 2010 version.I found this odd comedy to be delightfully screwed up and so far out there, that it was well worth it. Given, there weren't that many moments where I was laying flat laughing, but there were some moments in the movie that were funny and cool.Now, as for the acting, well I found all cast actors and actresses to be good in their given roles and they did well with the material they had. And having James Marsden and Luke Wilson in the roles as the two white people worked quite well, and they brought some fun to the movie. And I also think the dialogue was nice. And also Danny Glover in the role of that uncle in the wheelchair, that was just so cool. He truly is a nice actor.I would have to say that, for me at least, this is the type of comedy that is watched once, then probably never again. It just didn't stand out that much so that it had repeated watch value.If you like off-comedies and got a twisted sense of humor, then this movie would be something for you. I found it to be enjoyable enough, especially because it was amazing how the funeral turned out with all the weird things happening.There are some pretty nice twists to the story throughout the movie, and if you are in for an evening of some comedy, then "Death at a Funeral" might be a good suggestion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an example of movie-making at its worst. I really am at a loss to know what market these sorts of movies are aimed at. Perhaps a black US audience might find more amusement than a UK audience ? although the director is white. I don't know. This IS a black movie with a capital B. There are three token white actors one of which is a token midget. They studiously avoid referring to his lack of height until the end of the movie when it all comes thick and fast but, as with the rest of the movie, unfunny. Chris Rock, arguably the lead, is not an actor of any discernible talent, closely followed by his brother in the movie ? that's brother rather than brother ? Martin Lawrence. The women and the white actors come off marginally better. A gag about a guy getting crap all over his hand is a toe-curlingly unfunny set-up for a totally unamusing running gag. The movie doesn't even end when it should do but has another two or three minutes of 'story wrap-up' scenes which are completely unnecessary. Directed by Neil (The Wicker Man 2006 remake) LaBute one can only wonder what dirt he holds on Hollywood execs that they continue to bankroll his worthless projects. If anything, perhaps it is good to see something like this occasionally just to remind oneself what good cinema is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death at a Funeral (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Rock once commented on his admiration for Ricky Gervais, and how he can quietly deliver a joke with absolute confidence in the punchline. He then went on to say how he had no confidence in himself, and that is why he repeats punchlines, each time getting louder and LOUDER. In his defense, he is probably the quietest person in this film. A remake of the sensational English movie of the same name, shows a new low for American cinema. A remake of a 3 year old film that was in English to begin, and was even helmed by an American director. WHAT IS THE POINT? Well, the exact same jokes are here but each one is LOUDER. After the father falls out of the coffin, the irritating Tracy Morgan then commentates on what he just saw "He was BANG, and I was like DAMN!" The need for loud "comedians" to reiterate what just happened in something considered part of a visual medium, is confusing and aggravating. James Marsden is a bit of a shining star here, as he manages to come up with some different absurd acts to engage in. Other than that, the exact same jokes for people that find LOUD, funny. Neil LaBute should once again DIE HORRIBLY, after a second failed attempt at an American remake of a British classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death At A Funeral is a remake of what is a fantastic British comedy about a funeral service where everything goes wrong. The original is brilliantly funny, well acted and the jokes work perfectly with what is a great script.It's such a shame that the same script can be ruined so badly by a Hollywood remake of a film less than three old that didn't and shouldn't have been remade. Now I can understand the point of some remakes for example Tim Burton re-creating Charlie and The Chocolate Factory for a new generation, but Burton didn't take the script from the original and he didn't make the film until like 30ish years later (thats a guess I don't know when the original. I can also understand why Hollywood remake foreign films because a majority of people will not go and read subtitles for an hour and a half. I just cannot understand why they wanted to remake Death At A Funeral and even more so why to keep the same script and add in about two extra jokes.Now I do believe that if an audience member where to see this without having seen the original they would find it funny, I even laughed twice. However if they were then to see the original I think they would still laugh more. The original is better in pretty much every way apart from the amount of money its made.Completely pointless and if you want to buy the DVD just make sure its the original you click on and not this piece of rubbish.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death At A Funeral is easily one of the funniest films I've seen in months. Those looking for something hilarious should definitely see it. It's a simple film; just a series of events and misunderstandings at a funeral. All these lead to real chaos, however. The physical and even the spoken humour is well executed. The whole cast deliver solid performances. The script is surprisingly good for a film like this. Add to this a fitting ending, and you've got one satisfying comedy. There's some gross humour, but unlike recent gross-out comedies the stuff here actually works and doesn't feel unpleasant. In addition, most gags contribute to later events in the story. Death At A Funeral is a solid Hollywood product with a star cast that manages to make every star worthwhile. It doesn't break any new ground, but it's truly hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Classic But It Made Me Laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death at a Funeral (2010) *** (out of 4) Remake of a 2007 British film, this comedy is certainly done in bad taste but the talented cast bring enough laughs to make it worth viewing. The "story", if you want to call it that, is rather simple as a group of people show up at a funeral only to have one thing go wrong after another. This includes the dead man's sons (Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence) constantly fighting, a man showing up claiming to be the lover of the dead man and we even get a white boyfriend who everyone hates and they're really going to hate him after he accidentally takes some acid. This is a rather vulgar movie that makes a living on bad taste and dirty jokes but what makes them so funny is that no one wants the stuff to be vulgar. It's strange but all the characters here are good people who mean no one any harm yet they just get into situations where they're forced to do things that they normally wouldn't do and that's what makes the film so funny. The film contains a terrific cast lead by Rock and Lawrence but we also get Danny Glover, Tracy Morgan, Luke Wilson, Loretta Devine, Peter Dinklage, James Marsden and Keith David. All of the actors are obviously given it their all. Sometimes they deliver wonderful jokes while at other times they fall flat on their face but no matter how the joke comes out you can at least see how hard they're working to try and make the laugh. One of the highlights of the film is when the crippled character played by Glover gets diarrhea and has Morgan rush him to the bathroom but his hand gets stuck in the toilet as the old man sits down. Another running gag has the father being gay and hiding it his entire life and his son played by Lawrence gets upset because the lover is white. The movie runs a very quick 90-minutes but every ten-seconds there appears to be a new joke being thrown out. I give the film credit for pushing all the right buttons and at least attempting to make fun of more dramatic situations. There's no good flow to the movie and the story is certainly nothing special but people are tuning into this thing to laugh and they'll be doing that quite a bit from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that all of the people involved had time to waste making this horrible movie. I knew this was going to be terrible, but I watched it anyway because I suppose I had time to waste myself. This film has too many problems, so I'm not going to waste your time nitpicking.The American version of Death at a Funeral lacks the subtly that the original has. All of the characters are obnoxious and vulgar, so when these embarrassing situations happen, the viewer isn't surprised. What makes the British movie funny is that the characters come from affluent families and are forced into uncomfortable, compromising situations. Everything seems expected in this movie. It's like watching a taxman do taxes.SPOILER ALERT: This movie is almost identical to the British version, except this version is terrible. If you have seen the original movie, then there really isn't any point in watching this one. It almost seems like no one really wanted to make this movie. The dialog has barely been altered. They just threw in some Americanisms and thought they made enough of an effort. Why was this movie made? Maybe it was just to reach an audience that would otherwise not watch the original, but I don't think that would justify the production costs. The one thing I did find interesting is that both versions include actors from the Firefly series: the preacher and the pilot. Why didn't they just use the money from this film to make more Firefly episodes?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just over two years ago I saw the 2007 British movie of the same title. I gave it a rating of 8 out of 10, it is a funny and interesting take on a family funeral that turns into a family crisis. It was funny without being "dirty." Meanwhile, I read that this movie was being re-made with an American take, set in Los Angeles, and with American actors and American sensibilities. Reportedly the producers were impressed with the British movie and wanted to re-make it so that a wider American audience would get to see it.So, curious, I got the DVD of this new movie from my public library, and I watched it yesterday with Natalie, a college student who incidentally has the DVD of the British movie and watched it again just last week.In quick summary, this American version is nowhere as good or as funny as the British version. The characters' names are changed, and of course the location, but other than that it is pretty much the same movie, but with more toilet humor and more profanity thrown in, neither of which help make it a good movie. Both Natalie and I agreed on this point, and both of us observed that this one doesn't "flow" nearly as well as the British original. The scenes are the same, but the story doesn't flow as well from scene to scene.So, while the British "Death at a Funeral" is inventive and funny, this American "Death at a Funeral" is just disjointed and profane. Unless a viewer just wants to see a predominantly black family movie, the British movie is superior in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only watched half of it - what a waste of time that was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original UK version was really funny. I got an uncomfortable feeling early on when the guy who was drugged delivered a line taken straight from the original and delivered it without any comedic impact whatsoever. This character was used to drive a lot of the comedy and vibe in the earlier film - and in this film he was just hopeless - wasn't funny, he didn't appear ready to tear things apart, or drive the plot - it was woeful, flaccid stuff and I'm just bloody mystified how the film makers screwed this up. If this character doesn't work the film doesn't work. And this film didn't.So what was actually a very good cast (sans Chris Rock) couldn't save it and they and every other creative clearly turned up for the money and made a very forgettable picture.What a dreadful, dreadful shame looking at the raw material they had available.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to spoil a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching and thoroughly enjoying the 2007 version at a friend's place, I thought I would get my own copy. Unfortunately, I didn't know about this remake until I played the disc. I'm afraid this just didn't work for me. The scene set-ups did nothing to help suspension of disbelief, rather the opposite. I couldn't transcend the sense that I was just watching actors trying to be funny with inappropriate lines delivered with poor timing, as opposed to the original version that employed irony instead. I can't understand why this movie grossed the figure mentioned above, unless others made the same mistake I did. The disc I bought now resides somewhere near the bottom of my trash bin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I went in with an open mind...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2007, I went to Hollywood Video to rent some movies, I came across a DVD case marked Death at a Funeral, never heard of it, but saw that Frank Oz had directed it so not even knowing what it was about, I decided to give it a shot. I don't think I had such a great time laughing at this wacky dark British comedy and was hoping that eventually this would become a kind of cult classic in America. So a few weeks ago while I was at the theater, I saw a poster for Death at a Funeral and thought "that sounds awfully familiar?", going into the movie theater, there is the trailer playing for it. Again I said "This looks really? Oh? My?" and my jaw dropped. I couldn't believe that a film that hadn't even aged 3 years was already remade with an American cast. From what I was reading, Chris Rock saw Death at a Funeral and loved it and wanted to do his own version. At first I just refused to see this because in my opinion, the original wasn't given a fair enough chance yet to be seen by a wider range of people, give it a little more time. But my boyfriend really wanted to see the remake, not even knowing about the original until I told him about it, but he asked that I have an open mind if I thought the first one was so funny. After thinking about it, he was right, if I loved the first one, why not give the remake a fair chance? Conclusions: the film was just alright.Aaron has prepared for the funeral of his father in his home that he shares with his mother and wife. Not seeing family often, this is the one opportunity he has to see everyone. Aaron envies his brother Ryan, because Ryan is a successful writer, which Aaron wants to be but has yet to have his novel published. Elaine and her fiancée Oscar are on their way to pick up her brother Jeff before heading to the funeral. To ease Oscar's nerves, she gives him what she believes is Valium. Jeff later reveals to Elaine that it's not actually Valium, but a hallucinogenic drug. Chaos ensues when Oscar hallucinates that the coffin is moving and he knocks it over which pushes the body out the coffin which freaks out the guest. Aaron is approached by an unknown guest who happens to be a midget named Frank, who reveals himself to be the secret gay lover of his deceased father. Frank shows Aaron photos as proof and threatens to reveal them to Aaron's mother unless he is paid $30,000. To protect their father's reputation, they try to figure out something while this insane day continues on while still trying to grieve for their father's death.I don't know if it was just because I saw the original and knew what to expect, because I really didn't laugh out loud. A couple of things bothered me, one being, I don't know how to say this without sounding wrong so I'm so sorry if this sounds offensive to everyone, but one of the reasons being that the first film was such a blast is because most British people are very introverted. To see something shocking like that kind of a day was really funny and to watch their reactions was just great. Now with an outspoken black family, I knew what to expect and how they would react. Also how they were trying to be politically correct, I understand in some way, but when they see a midget walk into the funeral, they constantly refer to him "the man in the leather jacket" or "the guy we don't know", it was kind of odd that they really didn't mention his height. James Mardsen who played Oscar on the hallucinogenic drug, he was funny, but a little too over the top funny. His performance felt more forced while the original, Simon(the original character's name) acted more realistically as he based his performance on past experiences of getting high. Mardsen will get laughs, but he does get a little too silly at times. A few things were good about the film though, I surprisingly didn't mind Martin Lawrence in this movie, he normally gets on my nerves very easily. He was a little more played down and made his performance more tolerable. Danny Glover did steal the movie as he's possibly the most realistic character in the story, we all have that extremely grumpy old person in our family that drives us nuts. Over all though, I'd say stick with the original, it is a really great movie, but this one isn't a toss out, just wait for the rental on it.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haven't seen the original yet, but I can still tell this version is inferior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard positive stuff about the original after this version came out. And from what I heard this movie is a negative compared to the original. So I don't really get why they came out with this version when the original came out just a few years ago. The whole movie is basically a black comedy revolving around one funeral. Most of the jokes come from the whole family gathering at a funeral and begin to argue and bicker in a obnoxious manner. I don't know how good the original version is, but this movie felt like a waste of time most of the way through. The jokes in this movie isn't even funny most of the time, but what it does is over exaggerate everything and try uber hard to make unfunny funny. Which doesn't really work most of the time, the trailer seemed pretty dull and boring comedy and this movie is basically the same. Since the positive reviews the original has been getting, I wonder why they decided to make this version when tanks. And I can tell without even seeing the original that came out in 2007. The plot about almost everything going wrong at a funeral might be a good idea for a black comedy, but this one goes in a direction where it's not effective at all.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death at a Funeral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mega-star line up of African American actors in a highly bizarre comedy directed by Neil Labute(of all people)about the hi-jinx and shenanigans which take place during the day of a patriarch's funeral. Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence are brothers having to contend with a dwarf(Peter Dinklage in a piece of inspired casting)threatening to show a sex photograph of himself with their father! He wants 30 thousand dollars or else their mama will see her husband's dirty little secret(emphasis on little). Loretta Devine is the widow, Keith David the exasperated preacher who just wants to sermonize and move on, interrupted over and over by Rock who has to deal with numerous issues, Zoe Saldana(Avatar; Star Trek)with a lot of problems on her plate(a doctor father who doesn't approve of her boyfriend, the significant other(James Marsden, as you have never seen him before) who reacts crazily to a hallucinogenic drug he believed was a Valium, a former lover(Luke Wilson)interested in a relationship with her, although she knows he just wants pops' money), Regina Hall as Rock's wife who desperately wants a child(even attempting to seduce her husband, not wearing any panties, before the funeral!), and Tracy Morgan as a friend of the family who must cope with the demands of disgruntled, wheel-chair confined retirement home relative, Uncle Russell(Danny Glover who steals every scene he's in, even referencing his most famous character, Murtaugh from LETHAL WEAPON). Marsden's basket-case antics and Glover's brutal honesty are definite highlights, not to mention, the reactions of Rock and Lawrence when they discover daddy's hidden life. Poor Morgan suffers from "pigment mutation" which has him constantly scratching, as well as, being defecated on when his hand gets caught under Glover's ass when he needs to drop a load in the toilet! Marsden thinks the casket of the dearly departed is moving with someone inside and removes all his clothing while recuperating in the bathroom after being told he was given a different kind of drug than Valium! Glover comments truthfully about everything, he's the relative of the family you wish to harness, often saying things without hesitation. Saldana is mostly running around with Christopher Short(as her brother, who whipped up a batch of hallucinogenic pills for a friend, them getting placed in a Valium bottle which finds its way to Marsden)trying to keep Marsden from causing an embarrassing ruckus, quite often unsuccessful. Luke Wilson is Saldana's father's chosen favorite and continues to court her despite her every resistance(he can not take no for an answer when its quite clear she is head-over-heels for Marsden). Rock lives under Lawrence's shadow(Lawrence is a successful author, although it's established that he isn't exactly a very good one)and wants to be a writer despite the lack of talent, yet as a "tax man", he's carved out a fine life for himself and Regina(Rock is the one who helped pay the bills, including the funeral expenses while Lawrence was flat broke). Perhaps the gay jokes might turn the stomach of many homosexuals, but its all in good fun and really not *that* harmful(the "little people" are also poked fun at when Dinklage is held captive by Rock and company when he tried to confront the widow about the photographs, plenty of zingers from many of the principles in the cast). Every member of this massive cast get a chance to shine, each with their own little moments. Certainly the comedy is broad and the plot is all over the place, more slapstick and farce than anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original British release in the cinema and laughed so much. It is sometimes disturbing when you laugh at something and realise that no one else is laughing. This movie made absolutely everyone in the auditorium laugh at the same time, at the same things. I suppose it is like reading the book and then watching the film. Reading the book gives you, the reader, the ability to picture in your own mind and interpret the situations your own way. You see what the writer is doing and make it your own. When you see the film interpretation, it is there, in open view for everyone, and not everyone sees it the same as you do. What you see is an interpretation of the director, you are not able to conjure up in your mind what is happening. This is where the film exposes itself. It is a total flop. It does nothing to enhance the original film, it is not funny at all and the acting is cardboard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I made a big mistake by watching this version just a day before I then viewed the original, and the truth is that this is a totally unnecessary movie. When African-American comedy is placed beside British humour, the Americans are found wanting. Black comedy with its crass jokes and oftentimes outlandish mannerisms seems to fall flat when placed side by side with the subtleness that makes British comedy always standout. I'm sure the major reason why this remake was done was because those involved were enthralled by original; but I guess if it was this version that was made first, no one would have bothered to remake it. Can anyone please answer: Why was this film ever made?</fullReview>

I guess most of the "funny" stuff is when people make mistakes in the movie. Acting was average, comedians weren't funny, but if you are a fan of slapstick movies, you may like this one.Now, I like some slapstick actions in some comedies but to me even this one had bad or too much slapstick.

		<shortDescription>The Hangover Part II of remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 years after the solid Death at a Funeral, an entertaining British comedy, for some reason it was remade in America with the same screenwriter, the same jokes, the same characters and even the same actor playing the dwarf. The tale of bizarre revelations and utter chaos at a funeral was made for British humour without a doubt. The jokes and characters are Americanized here and it doesn't work at all. The performances are fine and Peter Dinklage is still excellent in his role, but this remake is not only incredibly lazy and far too faithful, it's also exhausting and gets the tone completely wrong and while it's occasionally amusing, it's a lot less funny than the original. The film could have worked with different jokes and the decision to copy every single gag from the original makes this a very irritating viewing experience. It's not very funny in the end and although the cast assembled is pretty impressive, they're all miscast since the script and story-line don't really suit them. This is how not to do a remake, and since this was only 3 years after the first one it's honestly difficult to see why this even got made.4/10</fullReview>

If you want to look for the better one, go for the 2007 version, because it's actually a great story, superbly written. They just had to turn the film into some black Detroit clusterfuck with the choice to remake, and the bad choice in actors. Why, why, why? This version is not a modernisation, or a sequel, or anything like that. 3 years in between the 2 films. Don't bother with this American version, they followed the same script, but just added black people. They even used the same midget. Seriously, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a Hollywood made version of a 2007 British comedy of the same name. The script and scenes are almost identical to the original but it lost something on the journey across the Atlantic. The only major change was to replace the uptight British upper middle class family setting for an equally uptight American upper middle class Afro- American family but it lacks the crisp punch of the original. Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad movie it is well acted, well directed and has a a good script but it just misses its' target. I would highly recommend watching the original version which has Mathew MacFadyen, Kris Marshall, Keeley Hawes, Rupert Graves and Jane Asher in the cast and I rate it as one of the best comedies I have ever watched.Trivia, there is another remake in Hindi entitled "Daddy Cool" (2009).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the funeral of Aaron (Chris Rock)'s father. He's the eldest son giving the eulogy. Ryan (Martin Lawrence) is the more popular successful writer son especially according to their mother Cynthia (Loretta Devine). Cynthia berates Aaron's wife Michelle (Regina Hall) for failing to conceive so far. Ryan won't pay for his half of the cost. Cousin Elaine (Zoe Saldana) gives her fiancé Oscar (James Marsden) a Valium from her brother Jeff (Columbus Short)'s apartment but it's actually LSD that he's dealing. Elaine's father Duncan (Ron Glass) does not approve of her relationship. Norman (Tracy Morgan) and Derek (Luke Wilson) brings cranky Uncle Russell (Danny Glover). Reverend Davis (Keith David) presides over this crazy mess including a dwarf Frank (Peter Dinklage) that keeps asking to talk to Aaron.Director Neil LaBute brings Dean Craig's script to the States. I've never seen the Frank Oz original and some have ridiculed a remake only 3 years later. Of course, there is a reason for that. Few people in America saw the British movie. I don't see any major problems with a quick remake especially if they use great comedians. There's also something poetic about its universal appeal to make the family African American. These are simply funny comedians doing some fun characters. Marsden probably surprises most since he's given the character with the broadest comedy. Tracy Morgan is hilarious. Martin Lawrence is funny getting on Chris Rock's nerves. There are some laughs and a general wackiness.</fullReview>

One American reviewer said "almost as good as The Hangover". Ummm YES That's the problem. The Hangover (a huge success in America) is loud and crass too...nothing else. American "humour" is very different from any other countries. (Its uniquely not funny). The days of The Marx Brothers are long gone. Chris Rock is probably the luckiest "funny guy" in the world. Simply ...he has never been funny. And gets worse as time goes on. One day a funny U.S.A. movie will be made.

		<fullReview>By making a US version of this comedy- they have dumbed it down and lost a lot in translation. Much of what made the original film great was absent, with poor acting throughout and lackluster line delivery ruining most of the jokes. The actors seemed to not understand the story and as a result the expression and tone required to pull this off just wasn't there. Martin Lawrence and Chris Rock may as well have been reading their lines...they were that bad. Tracy Morgan and Luke Wilson were also surprisingly poor. James Marsden was probably the best performance whilst all the Ladies performed reasonably well- and Peter Dinklage played the EXACT same character. This remake was genuinely pointless, a waste of money and I wish I hadn't watched it because it might put a dampener on the UK version- so I highly recommend that you watch the UK version and skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My movie choice for this assignment is "Death at a Funeral". It is a comedy movie that was telling the story of a family who organized the funeral of their father. Aaron and his wife were not that rich so they live in their father house. Ryan was a successful writer but selfish who did not like to help financially for the expanses of the funeral of their father. For the funeral, many relatives were invited include Oscar who by mistake took a drug instead of a pill so he was embarrassing everybody in the funeral. The mayor characters in the film were Martin Lawrence as Ryan Barnes, Chris Rock as Aaron Barnes, Peter Dinklage as Frank Lovett, James Marsden as Oscar. Aaron organized the funeral of his father when his brother Ryan did not take a serious in the organization of the funeral when he comes there. It is like a funeral was an opportunity for the whole family to come see each other again. At the funeral, uninvited man Frank showed up and threatened Aaron and Ryan to give him a money or he would tell their mother about his relationship between him and their father. Aaron told Ryan to pay him but he refused to do it. Frank got mad and Ryan and Aaron tried to avoid the drama. Ryan and Aaron decided to put him in the coffin with their dad because Frank hit his head on a coffee table and lose conscience. Frank waked up in the coffin and got out and traumatized everybody in the funeral. The characters in the film were great and they played well their role. From the begging to the end of the movie, each character was well engage by presenting their role in the movie. Uncle Russell played the role of entertaining and kept the audience in the mood of laughing. In the film we can see how involving and unique each character was in his role in the movie. The lighting in the movie was great. The light in the movie reinforce the mood of the scene and create an effective visual image. Different camera angles were used in this movie to create and effective sense of visual balance between one shot and another. The camera angles created emotional attitudes in the film. For example when Aaron was delivered his message about his father at the end of the movie, I saw how the camera angle presented that emotional connection in the look of Aaron and other people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>where the family and friends of a black middle-class patriarch gather to pay their final respects. This film revolves around the funeral ceremony for the father of Aaron (Chris Rock) and Ryan (Martin Lawrence). Aaron, the older son, lives with his wife Michelle (Regina Hall) at his parents' home. Aaron and Michelle have been trying to buy their own home and have children but have been unsuccessful. Aaron envies Ryan because Ryan is a successful writer, while he has not had his novel published, and resents his brother because he would rather spend money on two first class tickets from New York to L.A. than help him pay for the funeral expenses.The plot is similar to the original death at a Funeral, a UK production, which came out in 2007, starring Matthew McFayden, Alan Tudyk, Peter Vaughan, Keeley Hawes, Peter Dinklage and Rupert Graves as a dysfunctional family gathering together for a funeral service. Both these movies are good, enjoyable, fun watches. Uncle Aflie (US, Danny Glover, UK, and Peter Vaughan) are hilarious. Both of these movies are good, enjoyable, fun watches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fortunately this film does not aspire to great heights. Flogged, hackneyed racial in-jokes spoil rather than entertain. Typical token-black hogwash. This film stars some familiar faces presumably so people will say "oh it's that guy," affording the film enough time to slip in a half-baked one-liner to catch their attention and with any luck stop them changing the channel. Personally I was working on my research when I overheard this film's embarrassingly try-hard attempts to be funny. Since I was close to nodding off, and a source once told me the film was passable, I slumped onto the couch in disbelief as Chris Rock gave his father's eulogy right when a midget predictably leaped from the casket. In the uproar that follows, a resolute Rock commands the audience's attention because his trite message is important. His accomplice, wearing square-rims, looks on approvingly. Sometime before this, a white guy was on acid on a rooftop threatening to commit suicide. It's possible I missed something, but I don't know how to reconcile the two.There is no lesson here, except that the dumb can get on top of the clever, and from there, proceed to defecate all over their better judgment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death at a funeral was just not that funny. I mean if there was anything more to this movie aside from as a dedicated comedy, that might have been acceptable. But this movie has far too many names for the amount of laughs. They play their parts well enough, maybe the script is to blame. James Marsden provided the only real consistently funny presence. Call my a Kevin Hart fan, but his cameo was also funny. That's about it. Tracy Morgan is his typical outrageous self, so if you enjoy that there's plenty. But Chris Rock in enamored with playing the serious role and Martin Lawrence's lines just didn't hold much comedy.This movie was shot well but also felt too long. It seemed like someone took the core concept from the British movie, wrote a few jokes and cast a lot of stars.I wouldn't recommend this movie to many. There are so many good comedies out there that this doesn't really stack up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't particularly keen on watching this remake. More so because the original movie was only made about three years prior to this one AND it's in English language so why was there even the need for a remake. Do Americans really not get British humour that they need to have them remade? I was surprised that Neil LaBute, who usually makes interesting films (if one can forget 'Wickerman'), chose to direct this. While the humour here is not as subtle nor as refreshing as its predecessor, it's actually still quite funny. 'Death at a Funeral' could have easily been much worse (given that much of the cast has been loud in their other films). A few of the jokes fall flat but otherwise the humour mostly works (especially the sequences that have been directly copied from the original).LaBute assembles a fine ensemble that includes Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Peter Dinklage (reprising the same role), Luke Wilson, James Marsden, Columbus Short, Zoë Salda?a, Tracy Morgan, Regina Hall, Loretta Devine, Keith David and so on. With the exception of Tracy Morgan, all the actors do a fine job and work well off one another. Rock and Hall are quite different from their other films. Marsden gets to display his flair for comedy.Overall, it's not as bad as I thought it would be but it still doesn't match up to Frank Oz's film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awww $#*%....Not as bad as I wanted it to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the 2007 original, I really did not understand why they had to remake this movie JUST for American audiences. I mean, it was in English and directed by AN American, for cryin' out loud!!!I decided to give it a chance because I love Chris Rock, even though a few of his choices in movie roles haven't been quite up to par with his talent. With a producer credit, though, on this film, I figured he was a fan of the original and wouldn't try to rework it too much. That and PETER DINKLAGE was asked to actually agreed to reprise his role!Although some jokes are slightly more heavy-handed in this version, and some jokes not as kinetic (Father Falling out of Casket didn't strike me like it did in the Frank Oz version), it is overall the same movie with a different cast.In fact, in a weird way little bits were improved and gave the movie an overall flow that worked. Where Luke Wilson plays the Ewen Bremner character, his successful yet sleazy character was made as a foil to the James Marsden character, as opposed to some slime hitting on Alan Tudyk's fiancée. And even though they beefed up the James Marsden freak- outs over Alan Tudyk's amazing ones, these ones still had me laughing.I guess in the end the movie feels like you are watching a play put on by a different production company where they keep the same book, script, and basic concepts and add a few flairs of their own style to it. For those of you thinking "this must be the BLACK version of the original, eh??", I would say yes, it centers around a black family with more of an African-American aesthetic and motifs, that certainly isn't the point of the movie. Perhaps lots of camera angles, shots and ideas wouldn't have been in director Neil LaBute's head if it weren't for the original, yet this movie is able to make it's "own thing" happen.Overall, I recommend this film, as reluctant as I would have been when I knew it was being made. Also, I recommend the original too because it's also good and has a cast that will make you laugh in a different way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death at a Funeral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Nurse Betty), I only found out after watching that this was a remake of the same titled film from only three years earlier, but this one is apparently more superior. Basically the father of the Barnes brothers, Aaron (Chris Rock) and Ryan (Martin Lawrence) who have different views and personalities, has died, and they are holding the funeral in the family house. Family members and guests going to the funeral include Aaron's wife Michelle (Regina Hall), Elaine (Zoë Salda?a) with her inebriated fiancé Oscar (James Marsden), grouchy Uncle Russell (Danny Glover), Derek (Luke Wilson), Jeff (Columbus Short), Cynthia (Loretta Devine) and paranoid and slightly dumb Norman (Tracy Morgan). Reverend Davis (Keith David), a fan of Ryan's writing is the one overseeing things, but there is also an appearance by an unfamiliar friend the father, a dwarf named Frank (Peter Dinklage), who is interrupted a few times when trying to explain why he is there. The funeral starts off fine, and then the intoxicated Oscar thinks he sees the coffin move, and causes chaos trying to open it and making the body fall onto the floor. While everyone is talking to each other, trying to calm down after this event, and the body and coffin are put back in place, Aaron finally approaches Frank, who is ready to explain how he knew his father. Aaron and Ryan find out with a shocking photo as evidence that their father was in fact gay, and Frank was his lover, and he is threatening to reveal this secret to the mother and everyone else unless he gets $30,000 he feels he is owed, as he is not in the will. It takes a while to make any decision, and Frank gets angry and starts fighting with the brothers, Jeff and Norman, to the point where they restrain him, and give him the same "valium" Oscar took. Of course they find out that it is a mixed drug that caused hallucinations, but in Frank's case, he falls to the ground and they believe him to be dead. While they panic and plan to put the body in the same coffin as the original corpse, seeing how he is small enough, Oscar thinks his fiancée has feelings for Derek, and slowly going back to normal, he strips naked and threatens to jump off the roof. He is stopped by Elaine telling him she is pregnant, and with Frank hidden the funeral looks like it's ready to go on as planned, but then Frank wakes up and jumps out of the coffin, and the big secret is revealed to the mother via the photo. Aaron yells that he and Ryan may have found out this secret, but their father was a good man, Michelle gets her wish to plan a baby, and the end sees Uncle Russell naked on the roof having taken the mistaken "valium" too. Also starring Ron Glass as Duncan and Scary Movie 3's Kevin Hart as Brian. The mostly black all-star cast is good, with Dinklage reprising his role from the original version, the jokes may not be constant but the scripting just makes you keep you interested, so it's not a bad comedy. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death at a Funeral (2010): Dir: Neil LaBute / Cast: Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Tracy Morgan, Peter Dinkledge, James Marsden: Superb comedy about secrets revealed within one family within the compounds of a funeral held at the house. Chris Rock plays oldest son who is preparing a speech with regards to his deceased father as well as dealing with his wife's yearning for pregnancy. Martin Lawrence plays his brother who succeeded as an author when he failed. Tracy Morgan worries about a rash on his hand. He is sent to pick up his foul mood uncle. Peter Dinkledge steals scenes as a midget with dire information. Directed by Neil LaBute who previously made the dark comedy Nurse Betty, but this is certainly something different from the director. He is aided by a superb cast of comics headed by Rock who mirrors both frustration and the yearning just to get through the day. His closing speech in one of the film's most priceless moments. Lawrence avoids responsibility while pursuing a younger venue of women. Morgan ignites much humour in dealing with the demands of his uncle, particular an uncomfortable moment in the washroom. James Marsden steals scenes as a white guy dating one of the daughters and ends up high and naked on the roof. Finally there is Dinkledge who steals his scenes especially when his plans of blackmail go way off in left field and in bizarre places. Great comedy about reunion and family with hilarious situations involving misplaced bodies, pills that aren't what they seem, and a trip to the washroom that brings this funeral home down with big laughs. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death At A Funeral is a remake of a 2007 British comedy by the same name, and is usually not the type of film I go for. For starters, I hate Chris Rock, and I really couldn't see a film about a funeral being all that funny. The previews were a riot and I love Martin Lawrence, so I decide to give it a try and was once again was taught that you can't judge a book by it's cover. This film turned out to be one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. It's a solemn day for Aaron and Brian, as they prepare to lay their father to rest. They expect it to be a small, simple ceremony, but they are soon reminded of why their family only gets together at weddings and funerals. A series of unbelievable and hysterical events keep disrupting the service, which include, but are not limited to, a gay midget, a guest tripping on acid, and a crotchety old man that really has to poop. I'm not surprised that I liked this film as much as I did, but I was surprised by the reasons why I liked it. You'd think an R rated film staring Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence would be raunchy as hell and way over the top, and it was, but not because of either of them. Rock and Lawrence were actually fairly toned down in this film and it was the large cast of supporting characters who really make the film. Danny Glover is amazing as Uncle Russell, an old timer who hates everyone and isn't afraid to run his mouth. James Marsden is equally as good, as the hated white boy friend, who takes what he thinks is Valium to calm down before the service. Death At A Funeral is absolutely hysterical and full of non-stop ridiculousness, if this film doesn't make you laugh, there is most definitely something wrong with you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem nowadays, is that no one can ever make a remake and have it criticized on its on merit...instead everyone just compares it to its' original and believes that you can't like both. As a person who never saw the original, I can say that this was a a good movie. The only reason why I gave it a 9 instead of a ten is because the very very beginning (maybe the first 15 minutes) sort of coddled us through the introductions, and I much prefer a movie/TV show to dive right into the plot. But other than that, the movie was hilarious all the way through...in fact it seemed to get funnier as the story progressed. By the end of it, I was dying with laughter. The acting was great, the ensemble cast had great chemistry and each character stood out int their own way so the character development was spot on. I think that people should give this movie a real shot and don't go into it comparing it to the original because no remake is going to be the same...every remake is going to have it's own twist and creativity that's going to cater to different people...so give this movie a shot! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A comedy that focused on two brothers and their relationship with the decease. Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence encountered difficulties through out the entire funeral that some what changed their lives. Anything that you could think of probably went wrong that day, but the brothers tried everything to get through everything that tried to stand in their way. The brothers found out some astonishing information about the decease that they did not want to be released at no cost. Trying to keep this secret caused some difficulties that could have cost them a lot more than they where prepared for. This film was not some of Chris and Martin's best work, but I did get a few chuckles out of it. I usually enjoy movies that Chris and Martin make but I guess it is a little more difficult when the movie is a remake; although I did not see the original.</fullReview>

I desperately wanted to show it to my girlfriend and could only see this one in the Video Store.

But instead of exploring a really funny subject, they brain-dead copy paste the scenes, the dialogs etc to make a meaningless copy. ... Except that this one isn t funny... Everything about it is heavy, people have to scream to try to be funny. Really, what an Horror !! How can people sell royalties of a brilliant movie to some grotesque people like this.Now my advices: If you haven't seen the original, give yourself a favor and watch the wonderful British Black Comedy instead of this horrible black American comedy. If you have seen the original, seriously, Follow everybody's advice, and don t even watch the trailer of this crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Note: scroll to 'PS': it says it all.) It was shocking to see that this film actually got quite a few good, national reviews. I am inclined to think only liberal white guilt is responsible because, after the first few minutes, everything in this thing is sadly, painfully, unfunnily, forced. I am not interested in the original, nor in why this follows so quickly on its heels. I am more interested in how some fine talent can accept such really dreadful writing and direction. At this stage in his career, Danny Glover is content to get old-man-cursing laughs? Even that's all right, though, given how the entire energy and feel of the film is wrong. It wants to be mad slapstick, but reverts all the time to ponderous, sibling-issues dialogue utterly out of place, and unthinkable during the crises. No one seems to know just how to play anything; should the young wife, desperate to conceive a child on the day of the funeral, go earnest or silly? She does both. Should the mother, who witnesses her husband's being dumped out of his coffin, play it confused or blithely unconcerned? She does both. But, again, the whole problem is the whole film. It has no idea of what it wants to be, or how to get there, and absurd situations are reacted to in infuriatingly dull, normal ways, yet not in the manner that underscores absurdity well. PS The father has had a long, secret gay relationship. No one had a clue. So no member of this family, living in this house for ages, has ever noticed how, in the father's extremely accessible den, statues and pictures of male erotica abound? That's not funny, or slapstick, or burlesque - it's just dumb because great farce needs to be set up on realistic premises to be farcical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aaron's father's funeral is today at the family home, and everything goes wrong: the funeral home delivers the wrong body; a cousin gives her fiancé a Valium from her brother's apartment, not knowing her brother is dealing drugs - it's LSD and the fiancé arrives at the funeral wildly stoned; Aaron's younger brother, Ryan, a successful writer, flies in from New York broke but arrogant; one uncle is angry over his daughter's choice of boyfriends, and the other is cranky and coarse. Add an ovulating wife, a jealous ex-boyfriend, and a short stranger who wants a word with Aaron - what could he want? Would another death solve Aaron's problems? And what about the eulogy? An incredible comedy cast gives way to overly crude material. I laugh at crude stuff, as long as it has a heart, but this doesn't. The scene where Danny Glover Takes a dump and Tracey Morgan Gets crap all over him was the only laugh I got.Bottom line. I'd suggest the original over this.

		<shortDescription>Missed opportunity for a different spin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DEATH AT A FUNERAL (2010) Chris Rock has taken the 2007 English comedy "Death at a Funeral", and set it in America, where the patriarch of an African-American family has just died. His will requests that the funeral service take place in their large home, where Chris' character Aaron lives with his wife and mother. Aaron has a "practical" job, while his younger brother Ryan (Martin Lawrence) is a successful writer, something that Aaron has dreamed of doing himself. Their rivalry is one of a number of plot threads, including a cousin whose boyfriend has mistakenly taken a hallucinogen instead of a valium, a cantankerous uncle, and a mysterious stranger. All of these plot lines (and more) weave through an increasingly dysfunctional funeral service, and will all manage to be tied up by the end. It is a good script, and my big objection to the film is that it almost duplicates the 2007 film, with a different cast. I think a great opportunity was lost to make a film that was much more African-American in tone; these characters are too ethnicity-challenged, mainly because the script is nearly unchanged. For those who have seen the original, this will add no new wrinkles, and so will not be particularly funny. For those who haven't, it could be a clever, fun comedy. My instincts are, though, that the script is funnier set among the "stiff-upper lip" English than among a predominantly African-American group in LA.</fullReview>

I believe that this film is best watched tired with low expectations and I almost guarantee that you will find a few laughs and not get bored with events.The acting is quite poor, but succeeds because it is sometimes laughably poor and the actors take their characters in a daft script seriously. The story succeeds because it makes absolutely no sense and has the audacity to keep heaping it on without apology. And the set and filming are great, more than functional.So, not really a film I could seriously recommend to anyone, but if you do come across it, give it a try, I doubt you'll find it a waste of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A retelling of the original, not a copy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may not be fully the equal of the English movie that it is based on, but I think that what sets this movie out as being worthwhile is that it ISN'T just a flat remake; and yet, at the same time, it faithfully carries the whole heart of the original story. This is still a great movie, and worth a watch.What sets it apart is that it takes one of the original's greatest strengths - the wonderfully woven storyline that created the whole comic setting that the cast plays off of - and then detaches it from typically dry British humour, then pairs it with the more overstated humour of black American movies. It really is a polar opposite style of comedy -- think of the contrast between a black Gospel church and a quiet Anglican church in Oxfordshire. You could complain about its bluntness compared to the English version; but that's the whole point here, and it's what makes the remake worthwhile. This is the same great story, with the same roles, but new characters playing the parts to a completely different beat.I'm a born and raised Englishman, and I really love the original. It's a fine example of a British comedy movie, probably the best I've seen in many years. But I think that the American version attracts too much of its criticism for not being the English one, and I think that misses the point. This movie isn't trying to be the original. It's retelling the story, rather than trying to carbon-copy it.And really, it's the only reinvention of this movie that ever COULD have been worthwhile. Trying to copy the original version, bones, style and all, would have been futile and pointless. But this version, instead, gives the same story a fresh rhythm; a rhythm that may appeal to some on whom the original's dryness might have been lost. And I'm quite unashamed to say that while the original, for me, is the fairest in the land, my heart loves them both nonetheless.</fullReview>

However, on occasion I find myself with an agreeable attitude, as in this case, watching and hoping to find a nugget of merit amid a pointless mimic. What I found was an over talented cast plodding through a filmic regurgitation filled with poor timing, poor delivery, poor reaction and poor cinematography (apparently they have not yet discovered the steadicam). In my opinion, Death At A Funeral (2010) is an abysmal failure and one's time would be far better spent enjoying the comedic delight of the original script performed by a superb cast with impeccable timing in the authentic Death At A Funeral (2007).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suitable for the typical American</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call me crazy, but I really enjoyed Death at a Funeral. I think most of it could be due to the fact that I never saw the original British version, and viewed it as a standalone movie instead of comparing every scene, line, and actor to the original.All I can say after reading these reviews is give it a break! The only reason that this movie is getting relatively bad reviews is because people refuse to watch it with an open mind. If you haven't seen the original, I'm betting you'll think it's funny. If you have, you should probably just forget as much as you can about it. It's like watching American Idol and comparing the renditions to the original. Duh, it's not as a good as the original, but still a good performance nonetheless(sometimes, anyway).Honestly, the weakest part of this movie would be the main characters played by Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence. I found them the least funny characters, not to mention the least interesting. The thing that makes this movie funny is simply the situation that they are all put in. It's outrageous, in your face, and in a word: funny. If you're not laughing at this movie I don't think you have a sense of humor. Or rather, not a typical American one. I could see British people being taken aback by this version, and other people along those lines, but to me, this movie seems suitable for the typical American. It's much funnier than most of the other movies that have been out recently anyways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'DEATH AT A FUNERAL': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Remake of a popular indie British comedy, of the same name, from 2007 directed by Frank Oz. This 2010 update is directed by Neil LaBute (who also directed such titles as 'IN THE COMPANY OF MEN', 'NURSE BETTY', 'LAKEVIEW TERRACE' and the poorly received 2006 remake of 'THE WICKER MAN') and written by the original scriptwriter Dean Craig. This new version is highlighted by an impressive ensemble cast including Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Tracy Morgan, Zoe Saldana, James Marsden, Luke Wilson, Columbus Short, Danny Glover and returning cast member Peter Dinklage. I haven't seen the original film but I've heard it's much better, despite the talented cast and filmmakers this movie only somewhat delivers.The film is played out during an afternoon funeral where everything goes wrong and the story revolves around Aaron (Rock) who's father passed away. Besides coping with his father's death Aaron also has to deal with the pressures of his wife (Regina Hall) wanting a child as well as his mother (Loretta Devine) wanting a grandchild. He has to deal with the stress of writing a eulogy which many think his arrogant mildly famous writer brother Ryan (Lawrence) should be doing. He also has to deal with paying for the funeral on his own, since his famous brother is broke, and the morgue delivering the wrong body. There's also his cousin (Saldana) and her accidentally drugged boyfriend (Marsden) as well as her jealous ex-boyfriend (Wilson) and a grumpy old uncle (Glover). To top it off Aaron also has to compromise with a blackmailing little person (Dinklage), with some startling information.The film is a zany screwball comedy with some decent laughs but that's about all it is, nothing more and nothing less. The cast all do their jobs adequately and the directing is about what you'd expect from a film like this. There's really nothing to complain about but ultimately the film is forgettable, it does what it's supposed to for an hour and a half and then life goes on. Nothing to think about of course but also no really big laughs to look back on. This is fine but I've heard the original film is much more memorable and funny, I should probably check it out. As for this film it's not bad just an average comedy with an impressive line up of stars.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pmr_F8e44c</fullReview>

But I believe the English do it better. And that's part of the reason the new Death at a funeral doesn't work. It's an American comedy remake of an original.The new film has the same plot.The plot involves two brothers(Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence) who have to keep the secret that their now deceased father was gay with a midget(Peter Dinklage, who returns from the original).Neil Labute's Death at a funeral takes all of the hilarious jokes from Frank Oz's Death at a funeral. Nearly scene for scene,nearly line for line. What was hilarious then is repetitive and annoying now. And that's probably the film's biggest weakness.I didn't laugh. Well, I laughed here and there at the rare new jokes that were provided. And I believe James Marsden,who replace's Alan Tudyk's drugged naked character. The rest of the movie needs to be to be put underground. I liked the cast, but not the movie necessarily.It's a movie for two certain audiences:The people who never saw the original and the blacks.I'm neither. I loved the original Death at a funeral. Didn't hate but didn't like the new one. Skip it.2/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I didn't see the original. I don't want to see the original, because I don't normally like British comedies (no offense intended). If I'd seen the original, I probably wouldn't look at this one, because I'm not a fan of remakes, but since I didn't see the original, this will suffice. This was the second funniest movie that I watched in 2010, after Hangover. I laughed from the beginning to the end. Yes, it was silly, and had a lot of bad language, but is was hilarious at points and very entertaining. The movie was stolen by James Marsden. I had tears flowing from my eyes from laughing at him. I take a movie for what it's intended to be....a comedy. It was meant to make you laugh, and that it die. I recommend it for anyone who loves outrageous, silly comedies. If you prefer British comedies, I suggest you see the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I've recently seen the English version and yesterday I just saw this one. There are lots of reviews bashing this one and praising the original, which is something strange. The plot is basically the same; some actors work better here and some work better there, so it's rating shouldn't be that different. Peter Dinklage, James Marsden, Chris Rock and Regina Hall are really funny actors and worked well in their characters-- with exception of Hall, since her character doesn't have many funny lines, sadly. Uncle Russell isn't as hilarious as in the original version, but he does his job. Other than that, the whole thing is pretty the same and you won't notice many differences between the versions. See it when you're in the mood and you'll have a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the 2007 original containing an all-white mainly British cast, this remake with it's mainly black/African-American cast is clearly aimed at a larger audience.It succeeds in matching the original blow for blow in terms of comedy and much of the credit for this I think goes to the writer.With the action taking place primarily in a single location, this film has much of a stage feel about it - much like the original. And like any staged effort, adaptations and other renditions should be welcomed and warmly received.90-minutes well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death AT a Funeral Film Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death at a funeral is a movie directed by Neil Labute and was released on April 16, 2010. This film has a 5.4 star rating out of 6 stars and took place at the widows house to host a funeral for her husband. The film was shot in Los Angeles, California and it took about 21 million dollars to produce this movie. Starring in this film is Chris Rock, Regina Hall, James Marsden, Tracy Morgan, Peter Dinklage and Martin Lawrence. These main characters make this movie a fun filled comedy. In the beginning of the movie there is a funeral hosted for the father of Aaron (Chris Rock) and Ryan (Martin Lawrence). Aaron is the oldest son who lives in his parents house with his wife Michelle (Regina Hall). They have been trying to have children for a while but have been unsuccessful. Ryan, Aaron's younger brother is a successful writer that Aaron envies because his books are not published but his brothers are. Their cousin Elaine (Zoe Saldana) and her fiancé Oscar (James Marsden) go to pick up Elaine's brother Jeff (Columbus Short). Oscars nerves overcome him and Elaine gives Oscar what looks like Valium but is a hallucinogenic drug that Elaine's brother made for a friend. Throughout the movie Jeff tells Elaine that it is not Valium. A friend of their fathers, Frank (Peter Dinklage) shows up at the funeral claiming to know a big secret about him and their father. While encountering the fathers past everyone faces conflicts throughout the movie until the big secret is revealed. To keep the secret he wants 30,000 dollars or he will reveal the secret to everyone. Frank is force fed the same Valium Oscar has taken and the conflicts are not solved until the very end. Aaron finally gets to say his eulogy to finish the funeral. From the movie, I believe acting is a great way to express yourself. Aaron (Chris Rock) is a very good actor. He makes the scenes come alive and he is very loud so it keeps the viewers intrigued in the movie. For example, when he wanted everyones attention to read the eulogy he wasn't shy to speak up, he made sure people heard him and they were listening. Another actor who is very talented is Norman(Tracy Morgan). This man acts like a goof and makes the movie funny because of all the silly things he says and the way his facial expressions match with his words. For example, Uncle Russell (Danny Glover) had too much nut cake and Norman had to bring him to the bathroom and Uncle Russell went the bathroom on his hand and When Norman got it out he was flailing his arms around like he was going to die and the way he expressed that scene made it pleasurable to watch. Now this actor, Ryan (Martin Lawrence) is an amazing actor. He portrays his role very well. He also knows how to keep his viewers intrigued and he can switch from being sad to serious to extremely happy and not make the film look like he has all of these emotions and doesn't know what to do with them. For example, when he tries to seduce Martina (Regine Nehy), he went from sweet sexual man to angry to confused when Aaron needed his help dealing with Frank. Acting is a gift some people have and some people don't, and these actors, they have it. Also from the movie I believe that sound has a big part in making this movie. In this movie there is a lot of yelling, gasping and loud noises. Sound has a big role because it makes you feel like you could have been apart of the scene because of it's good quality. Every sound was very clear and loud enough so it didn't sound like a whisper but soft enough so it didn't sound like someone was screaming in your ear. Sound in a movie is one of the most important things that produce a good movie. For example, when Oscar was high up on the drug it made him say wacky things but when he yelled it was very clear of what he said but it wasn't too loud. Also when he would whisper to himself it wasn't a wicked soft whisper that no one could hear but it was clear enough that it could be easily understood. In my opinion I think this is a very good movie overall and every movie has one or two faults to it but this movie was not bad at all. I thought it was interesting, insightful, funny and a little bit mysterious. Although there was swearing there was not a whole lot that made the movie un enjoyable. I thought the quality of the film was very good and the film played out smoothly without any mistakes. I would recommend and suggest this movie to anyone who asked me. Out of a 6 star rating scale I gave it a 5.4 because it was great but there were one or two things that threw me off from a perfect score but it is an enjoyable moving that can be shared with the whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to get into how this movie is bad, just read the other reviews and you'll get everything I would be typing. But I am going to iterate something I only saw mentioned once in these reviews. I knew it was going to be a mixed cast the second I heard there was to be a remake. I said to my friends "What the frig!? Just you watch, because the cast of the original is all white, someone in Hollywood feels they have to remake the movie so it'll be PC and go all affirmative action." Boy was I wrong, they went with an all black cast. They even threw in a token white guy to just to load up an arsenal of mixed couple jokes. (As if him being stoned wasn't enough reason for a father's disapproval) And they didn't even try to "remake" the movie, they just handed the old script over to the new cast after having some urban script writers add in the stereotypical urban talk.If someone remade Barbershop in 2005 with an all white cast and ruined all the jokes with redneck accents, Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson would be holding a march in Washington.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its a different type of humuor. Get over it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original when it came out on DVD and loved it. It was my kind of humuor. The actors made it seem like it was actually happening in a real life situation. The 2010 version did not live up to it. However you must take a look at how things are. Most people would find the British one to have dry, plain, almost dull sense of humor with no real delivery. Although as mentioned before it was more believable. The American version is exactly that. The same movie written for American audiences. The humor is what they are used to seeing, something more directly funny than witty funny. I saw this movie knowing it wouldn't be like the original in humor style. If you enjoyed the original you should enjoy this one unless you believe that it should live up to the original. If you haven't seen the original but are familiar with the cast I still recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death at a FuneralThe best thing about a death at a funeral is that it allows you another chance at inheriting a kick-ass set of china.And while this comedy is devoid of porcelain platters, it does contain a secondary stiff.In addition to organizing his father's funeral, Aaron (Chris Rock) must play ringmaster to his eccentric relations?Ryan (Martin Lawrence), Elaine (Zoe Saldana), her drugged fiancé Oscar (James Marsden) and dimwitted Norman (Tracy Morgan).Further compounding the situation is the diminutive Frank (Peter Dinklage)?their father's lover?who hopes to use their father's sexuality to extort money from the family.A remake of a British comedy, this African-Americanized version manages to garner a few cheap laughs at the expense of little people, homosexuals and the incontinent, before settling into mediocrity.As for concealing a subsequent corpse: place naked carcass on table; cover genitals with sushi; and pretend they're part of the reception.

		<shortDescription>Remake not much better than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why they decided to remake this movie, especially since it was released only three years earlier. Frankly, the British version isn't much better than the American. And the only thing I liked better in the American version was the more racially diverse cast. I watched the original film right after the remake, and I noticed nearly ever other line was exactly the same, though obviously delivered quite differently. This movie is not a "remake" of the original, British Death at a Funeral, it is a copy.The film lacks a main plot line, which makes it extremely boring. There were a couple of times I laughed at some of Tracy Morgan's lines, but I usually found my mind wandering elsewhere. The whole movie is basically just the telling of some tragic misfortunes that happen during the day. You would barely know it was about a funeral, seeing as there was no scene that really grabbed me emotionally. For a film to be truly amazing, there must be danger, sadness, and humor. This movie barely had humor. One advantage the original film had over this one was the acting. The actors weren't necessarily bad in this movie, but I wouldn't say they were very good either. But, I must say, James Mardsen was much more appealing to see naked than his British counterpart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but needs more laughs! It's not funny enough!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people decide they will make remakes outta the original ones, half of the time they're really good, but...as for depending how much you really try to make a difference, things can fail out a bit.I've never seen the other 2007 British version, but...the new one is sorta half a failure. In the movie, a black family gather up together because a special man in their family has passed, but as the funeral draws near, Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence's characters discover that a little man they never seen before had something to do with their father a long time ago.The film features a great cast like Luke Wilson, Zoe Saldana, James Marsden, Tracy Morgan, Keith David etc etc. The list can keep on going forever, but to cut it really short, I don't think the word "comedy" was the best fit category for this movie. You might think about getting mixed feelings for the movie cause that's what I was having before I saw it until today.The beginning acts off sorta stupid, but in the middle of it, it blends in a little. It's the jokes that are poorly misused and not enough "laugh out loud" funny sorta type you would usually have when you're watching a good or lousy bad comedy film.To work it out, I think the director, writers and the whole other people at work needed to come up with better laugh out jokes while they were making the film, but at the end, I guess the movie didn't turn out so bad. If the jokes were done right and gave out a more tickle in your tummy, then the movie could of work out more with better please-meant! I give it a 4 and a half 10 stars because it still needed some more work for the laughs if they wanna please the audience without making them walk outta their seats and get their money back. They could of done better than that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aaron (Chris Rock) is in charged of his father's funeral, the funeral is at his father's home. Things starts going badly, when the wrong body shows up at his home. Then his successful writer brother Ryan (Martin Lawrence) can't help paying for the funeral for some reason. Elaine (Zoe Saldana) and her nervous fiancée Oscar (James Marsden) can't stand her father Duncan (Ron Glass). Elaine decides to give Oscar an Valium to relax but her brother Jeff (Columbus Short) finds out that her sister wasn't giving Oscar Valium but it is actually a hallucinogenic drug. Norman (Tracy Morgan) is forced to pick up his mean-spirited Uncle Russell (Danny Glover) with his friend Derek (Luke Wilson), who stills have feelings for Elaine. Aaron's wife Michelle (Regina Hall) wants badly to have an baby. An mysterious man (Peter Dinklage) claims to be the friend of Aaron's friend but he is actually more than a friend... Everybody's situation at the funeral goes from bad to worse.Directed by Neil LaBute (Lakeview Terrance, Nurse Betty, The Shape of Things) made an more successful remake than he did with the unintentionally funny "The Wicker Man". Rock is good in a straight part. But it is Morgan, Glover, Dinklage and especially Mardsen steals the show in their supporting roles. Loretta Devine, Keith David and Regine Nehy appears in supporting roles as well. This was actually more successful at the box office than the original did in the U.S. but not as critically successful with the film critics.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an enjoyable commentary track by the director and actor:Rock, three featurettes, deleted scenes and outtakes. "Death at a Funeral" is certainly in bad taste for most of the time but the humour certainly works. But it is the supporting cast have the best moments. Don't miss it. Peter Dinklage plays the same role from the original 2007 movie, directed by Frank Oz. Dean Craig, who wrote the original film, he is still credited for the remake. HD Widescreen.

		<shortDescription>not as Bad as You all make out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the other reviews on here are calling this movie boring and useless. I have to disagree I laughed quite a lot as there are some really funny goofy gags in the film. Its not just a black film like others seem to say the white guy who played Oscar was very funny when he took what he thought was Valium and it turned out to be acid. Chris Rock always good, Martin Lawrence was also good and i was pleased to see Danny Glover as ain't seen much of him in recent Years. The only thing i would say is they should have give more thought to Luke Wilson's character as he didn't seem to be there for any real plot line and he is capable of a better performance as seen in OLD SKool.Just watch it and don't believe everything you hear from critics make your own mind up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was quite entertained by this version of Death at a Funeral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another picture I watched with my movie theatre working friend. It's a remake of a Frank Oz-helmed film for Britain that came out just three years ago. This version was directed by Neil LaBute with a cast that included Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Tracy Morgan, Luke Wilson, Zoe Saldana, James Marsden, Peter Dinklage (the only one to reprise his role from the previous version), and Danny Glover. Many of the people I just mentioned provided many good laughs, especially Marsden as a drugged wanderer, though there were also some-pardon the pun-dead spots as well. Still, this was quite an entertaining comedy to me that didn't become too unbelievable in the way things happened. Since I hadn't seen Oz' version, however, I can't compare them yet. So on that note, that's a recommendation for Death at a Funeral.</fullReview>

Why did Martin Lawrence's character try to talk to a young lady young enough to be his daughter. Loretta Devine's character made me almost urinate in my pants from laughing when she hit that midget when she found out that the deceased family member was in a gay relationship.

		<shortDescription>This Time, Death is Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me stop and say this is one of the few films I have seen with an African-American ensemble cast. Everyone you could possible want to see in a funny "black" Comedy is here. This movie has a lot of 90s style slapstick and farce themes added to it, but still, thats when the film has its greatest moments. Its not the nicest, most friendly movie I have seen, but it is definitely a nice laughfest. Just like Hot Tub Time Machine and The Hangover. At least one laugh per minute.Tracy Morgan, Cuba Gooding Jr., Martin Lawrence, Danny Glover, Chris Rock, Regina Hall, and Luke Wilson are all people who I have seen a movie from and liked it. Tracy Morgan and Chris Rock were the two actors that stood out to me. I love them, and find Chris Rock just mindblowingly funny in his stand-up Comedies. So seeing this was no mistake. I was too shocked to find out this is a two year spread of an English remake. I remember hearing about the original and when looking at the poster sometime ago after hearing about this I recognized the dwarf (Peter Dinklage). From what I hear, this is the same thing, just done with a black family.The movie is like a funeral anthology. Various mishaps go wrong in the day of Chris Rock's father's funeral. All he wants is to pay respects to his father in an ordinary fashion. What he doesn't understand is why it's so complicated. Conflict after conflict continues when someone takes an Hallucinogenetic drug on accident, Uncle Russell won't stand still, and the main problem is that an unknown dwarf (Peter Dinklage) comes to the funeral univited to state he wants his deservings (apparently $30,000 is what he feels he deserves). The dwarf and Chris Rock's father had a lot of close relationships, usually homosexual encounters. If the $30,000 isn't obtained, the man will show the pictures to Chris Rock's wife.So a plan is needed, but all are clueless which is when the laughs begin. The scenes are take mild effort to think about, but in the end are just funny as all hell. Uncle Russell (Glover) going to the bathroom when Tracy Morgan's hand is stuck in the toilet. Simple, but funny. The outrageous acting by Tracy Morgan plays along nicely with the flow of the film as well.To be honest, I never saw the English version of this film, but intend to as soon as I can. I don't know which I will be more bias to because this one was excellent. Ensemble cast, hilarious lines, and just ridiculous conflicts that won't be seen at any funeral. I also must say that Peter Dinklage performance was underrated much. Many don't know him by name, but many will be appearance. He does a great job in the film as well as being well-received in the original 2007 film as well. When Death at a Funeral got raunchy is when I busted a gut and just burst out laughing.Starring: Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Luke Wilson, Tracy Morgan, Danny Glover, Regina Hall, Kevin Hart, James Marsden, Zoe Saldana, Loretta Devine, Ron Glass, Peter Dinklage, and Columbus Short. Directed by: Niel LaBute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very funny and moves along quickly but Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence hardly provide any of the laughs in the film. If anything Zoe Saldana's bf in the film is the one that got the most laughs. This film is about a family preparing for the funeral of their father. Throughout the day it follows the various family members attending as there all hiding secrets from one another and trying to deal with it, without anyone knowing. The funniest story had to be about the daughter who is going to marry and have a baby with a white man, who accidentally takes drugs from his fiancé's brothers. The twist about the father, actually being gay was kind of funny but got a little crazy near the end. Overall though a very funny movie to watch if you like slapstick comedy.</fullReview>

I'm not racist or anything because those kind of movies are not good. I despised the Tyler Perry movies. But, this turned out to be the funniest movie I saw so far in 2010.This is about a family getting together for a funeral of two brother's dad. Unfortunately, the funeral doesn't work as well as hoped because of many mishaps.The acting is great. I been a fan of Martin Lawrence, Chris Rock, and Danny Glover for years. The others such as Zoe Saldana and James Marsden were great.My favorite scenes was the homage to Danny Glover and the toilet from Lethal Weapon and when Zoe's boyfriend gets high on drugs.Overall, this is a fantastic film.

So, I went in setting the bar low, wasn't even going to see it at all, until a friend invited me to go check it out.I loved it. The humor is definitely not subtle, it's more in your face and over the top, it's hallmark American film comedy, but it works on almost every level. I don't usually care for poop humor, but the scene with Tracy Morgan had everyone in the theatre rolling. I had fears that this would have a lot of the stereotypical black comedy trademarks, but it didn't. It was comedy anyone could enjoy, without a lot of the jokes that a lot of white audiences just don't get.Marsden's character never went too overboard for me, they played it well, and though his antics lasted the whole film, they were original enough and varied enough that they didn't start to tire me out. Rock was the straight guy for the most part, his one liners made me chuckle a couple of times, but nothing too funny. Morgan was hilarious with the rash stuff and the toilet (literally) humor. Martin Lawrence's character was poorly written- his lines were annoying and I don't think I laughed at him once. I think that came down to the script and not his performance, even though he did get a bit annoying in parts.Luke Wilson was pretty much pointless here, not offering much in terms of anything worthwhile. Again, script issues.The editing was a bit off. Jokes that could have landed were ruined by cuts that came too soon, quickly transitioning to another character's action. That stood out several times especially in the first half.Compared to the original, it held up well. I think I may have liked this one better, which is definitely a surprise to me. The comedy was much less black comedy and more traditional- much louder than the original. Much more high key overall. It all worked though. Highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptional Film. I have not laughed so hard since the Hangover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that I said that there are spoilers in here, but I will try to limit it as much as possibleThis film is a remake of a British film with the same name. And, if you liked (or thought you would like) the British Film, then you will like this one, because it is practically a scene for scene remake. The plot is the same, the majority of the dialog is identical. The characters overall act similar (a little more over the top, but the movie is over the top)I liked this film, it is out of what I would normally watch, but what can I say. it was funny. My only problem is that, being a fan of the original, I knew all of the jokes. Literally, no surprises. As a result, I can only ask why. Why was this film made now. I loved watching it, but a perfectly fine version existed. If you haven't seen the original, watch this version. The Dream girls references will make you laugh. The antics of Tracey Morgan are good, and I will venture to say that some of the other actors surpass that of the British film. If you saw the original, you are missing nothing by skipping this film.8/10, thats being very kind to it. Overall, for what it is (a slapstick gross out Dark Comedy), its amazing. And ultimately, who could ask for more</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LaBute's Funeral Warms Up the "Stiff" Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LaBute's Death at a Funeral is indeed in some ways, more effective than the original. I personally think that the more uptight the family (the original, with a British cast), the better, and more jarring the scatological/drug humor and sexual peccadilloes will be, but this version surprised me. It is a much more warmed up version of Oz's film, which helps the film along immensely. After all, this is supposed to be comedic farce, and while Brits are quite good at it, that wasn't evident in the original.James Marsden turned out to be a stunningly good physical comedian (I really only remember him from the X-Men films but pretty sure I've seen Disturbing Behavior and a couple of other things). He manages to far surpass the creativity and humor of Alan Tudyk in Oz's version (playing the boyfriend of a family member of the deceased). All the cast make solid contributions, though it is a bit disturbing to see Danny Glover playing the thankless role of the old, mean-ass, obscenity-spewing uncle, who torments Tracy Morgan's character.Peter Dinklage is even better playing the same role of the mysterious funeral attendee with a disturbing secret and Martin Lawrence looks good and his acting is quite good, as the successful younger novelist brother of Chris Rock (in a thoughtful and restrained performance), the older brother who is trying to hold it all together. Lawrence seems to have gotten himself straightened out after his troubles some time back and has also had his shtick pulled back by Director LaBute. While it was somewhat embarrassing for me to be laughing uproariously in a movie theater in which there were only six or seven adults present, laugh I did. Couldn't help myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent remake with Very Funny Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am truly astonished at the average rating this film is getting on this site. This is not a great movie but it is a good movie with some genuine laughs. I enjoyed this far more than Date Night, which was also good and had a few laughs. I think Hollywood needs some lessons on comic timing and the such. Truthfully, this could have been a far better movie but when it works it works very well. Neil Labute demonstrates that he is a very competent director. The film is well paced, and the acting is from good to very good. It does not turn into a blacksploitation comedy at any time. So, OK it is not a masterpiece but it is worthy of a far higher rating than it is getting here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie hoping to just be entertained. Wow! This is a great movie.I've seen other comedies this year but this by far has to be the funniest! Hilarity abounds at this funeral. It's a great time to be had by all. Laughs galore! Parents beware. There is a good reason for the R Rating. There are a few gags to that are not suitable for children: There are the gross out poop gags having to do with the character of Uncle Russell and some total-male-nudity gags that occur when one character gets high on dope. But aside from that it's 90% good-natured humor that comes from incidents that are described in other reviews.What happens to Danny Glover's character (Uncle Russell) at the end you've just got to see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A must see movie. Much better than the 2007 original. If there were any problems with this film, I would say that it was Luke Wilson. Glad that Peter Dinklage revised his role. His performance in this remake was better than his in the original. James Marsden's performance as Oscar easily stole the show.The comedy in Death at a Funeral delivers. I can't say it any clearer than that. I found myself laughing throughout the entire movie. There were maybe only 3 small points in the movie where the theater was quiet.Many people might look at the cast and get the image that the film is a black comedy. Honestly, it isn't. The film caters to all crowds, as the personal problems are relatable to all ethnicity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent dark comedy farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a film aimed at the mass market. Your enjoyment of this film will depend on your appreciation of dark comedy, aka "black comedy," and I am not referring to race. A black comedy is one which presents a usually serious or even a morbid situation in comedic terms. The race of the characters is not the point.The best previous example I can think of is Joe Orton's "Loot," which involved similar gags about a corpse. But in "Loot," all the characters where British. And white.In this film, the characters are American. And most were African-American. I.e., not white.And this was a farce and not merely a comedy. The goal in any farce is to keep a horrible secret from being discovered, and the humor is in the increasingly absurd measures being taken to prevent the discovery.I thought this film is a gem. Rather than putting a cast of extraordinary African-American actors through the usual paces of what unfortunately passes for comedy these days, the director allowed them to show their ability to present a farce as well as any white cast could do. I am still amazed and astonished.Thought this is an excellent film, it's not a Tyler Perry film in any way. This same cast of actors in a Tyler Perry film would have done a wonderful job, no doubt at all. But here, that same cast has established that they can produce a farce as hilarious and comical as any that the white farce-masters could devise.I can't think of any cast member who presented a disappointing performance. Chris Rock was outstanding. I can't say enough good things about him. He anchored this film by a consistent but comic presence. Martin Lawrence as Chris' brother and nemesis was superb.Danny Glover took a major professional risk in playing this part, but I think he succeeded.And the white dudes. Luke Wilson, playing something close to his usual persona, was perfect. And James Marsden--it is unfortunate that this film and his performance will probably be forgotten at Oscar time a year from now.I laughed constantly from about 10 minutes into the film, unto the very end. Dark comedy, black comedy, is not for everyone. But if you are a fan of black comedy, you will love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one funeral you won't soon forget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would'nt think that so many things can go wrong at a funeral, but things go wrong at every turn. First they deliver the wrong body, then a relatives(Zoe Saldana) boyfriend(James Marsden) takes a drug, he thought was Valium, and it makes behave very wacky. The oldest son(Chris Rock) is on his last nerves, when his older brother(Martin Lawrence) is very little help, but things soon unnerving, when a stranger(Peter Dinklage) comes to the funeral, with certain secrets about the descest father. You wonder how will this day turn out? This movie was funny, Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Danny Glover, and Tracy Morgan where all pretty funny. Although James Marsden stole some scenes. There are two scenes that are pretty for shock value, but still pretty funny. This is one of those movies you can laugh at when your having a bad day or week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All-Star African-American Comedy Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything that can possibly go wrong at a memorial service does go wrong in "Nurse Betty" director Neil LaBute's witty but tasteless comedy "Death at a Funeral," starring Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Danny Glover, James Marsden, Tracy Morgan and Zoe Saldana. Ostensibly a faithful rehash of director Frank Oz's British comedy with the same title, this predominately African-American remake?just three years after the original?qualifies as a side-splitting experience from fade-in to fade-out with our protagonists contending with one surprise after another to get their dearly departed dad and his mourners through the memorial. Incidentally, Peter Dinklage reprises his role from the original as "mysterious stranger." British scenarist Dean Craig, who penned the original "Funeral," banks on outrageous situations as well as Chris Rock's commentary to yield laughs galore. Essentially, Craig has relocated the action to Southern California. The primary characters consist of an oddball variety of believable, quirky, but sympathetic people. Indeed, the cast acts virtually as an ensemble in some scenes. Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence complement each other without trying to one-up each other. James Marsden has a field day with his character-driven shenanigans and Tracy Morgan draws some of the biggest laughs. The important thing here--as in most good comedies--is that the cast and the director don't consciously behave as if they were making a comedy. Nobody tries to be funny. The humor emerges in the collision between the characters and events beyond their control. Watching the reactions of both Rock and Lawrence constitutes half of the fun of "Death at a Funeral."Tax accountant Aaron Barnes (Chris Rock of "Good Hair") is not a happy camper as "Death at a Funeral" unfolds. Imagine Aaron's reaction when the funeral home delivers the wrong corpse to his house! When they open the casket for our protagonist, Aaron finds himself staring down at an Asian gentlemen (Jamison Yang of "Surfer, Dude") rather than his deceased father Edward (Bob Minor of "The Gingerbread Man"). Since Edward's death, Aaron's overwrought mother Cynthia (Loretta Divine of "Waiting to Exhale") has been pestering both Aaron and his 37-year old wife Michelle (Regina Hall of "Scary Movie") about giving her a grandchild to take her mind off her late husband. Moreover, Aaron is struggling with his father's eulogy. Tradition dictates that the oldest son must deliver the eulogy. Nevertheless, some people, such as Aaron's uncle Duncan (Ron Glass of TV's "Barney Miller"), think Aaron's younger brother, Ryan (Martin Lawrence of "Bad Boys"), who is a bestselling novelist, should have drawn that assignment. As it turns out, Aaron is only nine months older than Ryan. You see, Aaron has written a book, but he has refused to let anybody read it. Meanwhile, Cynthia is so overjoyed when her celebrity son Ryan arrives that she knocks down Michelle in her haste to embrace her baby. Ryan is a smooth-talking womanizer. He is also a published writer so deep in debt that he doesn't have a dime. When Aaron asks for help with the expensive funeral bill, Ryan backs out. Instead, Ryan sets out to seduce a sexy 18-year old girl, Martina (Regine Nehy of "Lakeview Terrace"), who gets his hormones into an uproar.Meantime, Aaron's cousin Elaine (Zoe Saldana of "Avatar") is attending the memorial service with her newest boyfriend Oscar ((James Marsden of "X-Men") and Oscar is really nervous about running into Elaine's father Duncan again. Oscar doesn't think that Duncan likes him. Elaine and Oscar cruise over to pick up her brother Jeffrey (Columbus Short of "Armored") and Elaine borrows a Valium. What Elaine doesn't know is that Jeffrey has whipped up a hallucinogenic cocktail of mescaline and acid for his friends. Jeffrey doesn't discover what Elaine has done until he notices Oscar's bizarre behavior. At one point during the memorial service, Oscar is so sure that he has seen the coffin move that he interrupts the service. A melee ensues as Aaron and company try to subdue Oscar. Predictably, the casket topples onto the floor and Edward rolls out! If Oscar's misguided shenanigans were not enough to contend with, a stranger named Frank (Peter Dinklage of "Elf") corners Aaron with incriminating photos of Edward and he cuddling up to each other like the gay lovers that they were. Frank demands $30-thousand dollars or he will show the photos to Cynthia.Elaine's ex-boyfriend Derek (Luke Wilson of "Home Fries") and long-time family friend Norman (Tracy Morgan of "Cop Out") have to make a detour at a nursing home to collect cantankerous Uncle Russell (Danny Glover of "Lethal Weapon") and bring him with them. The wheel chair bound Uncle Russell doesn't give Norman a moment's peace. Derek is hoping that he can patch things up with Elaine, and he does his best to change her mind about him. On the other hand, everything that Norman does for Uncle Russell draws criticism from the oldster. Things get really out of hand when Norman has to assist Uncle Russell to the toilet and Norman's hand gets trapped under Uncle Russell. Mind you, this is only the set-up for even more hilarity that follows.Between the wrongly delivered corpse and Uncle Russell's antics, "Death at a Funeral" boasts more than enough high-jinks to keep you chuckling out loud. Dull moments are few and far between, and this superficial but funny Paramount Pictures gagfest never loses track with its objective: making us laugh. The refreshing thing about "Death at a Funeral" is how LaBute confines the most action to the family household without inducing a sense of claustrophobia. Anybody who enjoys Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, and Tracy Morgan will have a rollicking good time at this contagiously funny, but dark comedy about mortality and the different facets that death exposes to an individual's character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly positive upswing for the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie. Heard it was a gross-out--- not true! Sure, it has its rude moments, but in a raucous, bust-a-gut funny way. What did concern me was the genre, and Chris Rock. I mention it here only because it turned out not just well, but admirably and surprisingly well.I am being sincere and as respectful as I can when I say that many of the "ethnic" family comedies of the past 10 years have left me a bit cold, and puzzled. I wondered what the humour was??? For members of any particular social group specialised humour can be meaningful. It may be a valid way to celebrate one's ethnicity and one's unique place in the world. And that is GREAT! It's just that those laser-focused themes may not appeal to other people in general. And, sometimes the rush to celebrate one's own "flavor" can also, at the end of the day, have the effect of creating an exclusionary, "us and them" mentality. And that's OK too, as we all have family time and friend time that may not be appropriately shared with every other single person on the planet.So while I don't have a problem with the genre of "look how different WE are" films, I also am simply not drawn to them either. Chris Rock is an immensely talented performer, and can be hilarious! But as with the aforementioned genre of film, he has in the past struck me as a somewhat angry, unfair, and divisive personality.So, I mention all that to say how utterly unlike my fears this movie turned out to be. Maybe my perceptions had changed in some way? Or maybe the genre has evolved and matured to the point where uniqueness, specialness, and "character" can now be presented as something ALL audiences can delight in? That is, I felt sincerely welcomed into this movie's world. I found that positive universality "new," and I really, really loved the invite and the experience.The film itself is not a masterpiece--- most comedies are not--- but it is hilarious, and very well done. Martin Lawrence's character, and Luke Wilson's character were both obnoxious- but that's a film genre staple going back 90 years. Once I realised it wasn't about race, or fearing others, I could laugh at their boorish antics. The other characters showed genuine love, concern, and quirky personalities--- all fit ingredients of this kind of comedy.Was it vulgar? Yeah--- but not as much as I had been led to believe. Was it funny? Yep! Was it all wrapped up neatly by the end of the film in true comedy tradition? Well duh, of course it was. If a few pooh jokes don't cause you to cringe with apoplexy, go see this. You will laugh, and feel better when you leave the cinema than when you arrived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death at a Funeral is one hilarious movie. It's one of the funniest movies i've seen this century, and probably the best of 2010 so far. This new remake of the original that was released in 2007 features lots of big laughs, and is just as funny as the first. Chris Rock, Tracy Morgan, Martin Lawrence, and the handful of other black actors really know how to meet the demands of comedy hungry fans. This movie has got to be one of the most funniest since the Hangover and Bruno. While it does feature scenes that are more of the same of the original, it still brings back more laughs than you can count. Overall, Death at a Funeral is an excellent movie that is well worth watching if you want to have a laugh (actually, tons of laughs).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slapstick comedy at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Synopsis) Aaron (Chris Rock) is a well-mannered and hard working young man, married to Michelle (Regina Hall), and still living at his father's home. When his father dies, it is up to Aaron, the oldest son, to organize the funeral and give the eulogy. The funeral takes place in his father's home and Aaron tries to put on an appropriate expression on his face to welcome his relatives, including his famous writer brother Ryan (Martin Lawrence), and his father's friends. But preserving a civil atmosphere will be a hard thing to do, especially, when from the very start, the undertaker makes a horrifying mistake. And Ryan wants to be the celebrity of the event without paying for anything. But those incidents are only minor compared to the information that Aaron and Ryan get from Frank (Peter Dinklage) the mysterious dwarf who is attending the funeral and nobody seems to know.(My Comment) This movie had it all as to jokes crossing the line. It had a body falling out of the coffin, it had nude scenes and people on drugs, it had feces on people, and it had sibling-rivalry, and a wife who wants to get pregnant, all of this happening during the funeral. However, all this said, it is one of the funniest comedies I have seen in years. You will laugh out loud from beginning to end. There are some scenes that I almost busted a gut laughing so hard. This is slapstick comedy at its best, and the scene with Danny Glover is the funniest. After laughing so hard, I was actually tired leaving the movie. The movie may not be PC, but it is only a movie.

		<shortDescription>Better than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American remake of "Death at a Funeral" is one of the rare instances of the remake being better than the original.The story, and for the most part, the script is the same. The thing that makes the new version so much better is the cast. Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, and Tracy Morgan make a great comedy team and none of them have ever made a better film. The rest of the large cast is excellent and the dialog was quick and witty. Danny Glover almost steals the movie as the cantankerous uncle.Like the original, there is a lot of dark humor. Not all of the laughs are the type where you laugh out loud, but I found the entire film enjoyable.I can only guess that the low rating and poor reviews are from people who really loved the original. I didn't really care for the original and I was surprised at how good the new version was. Whether or not you have seen the original, I recommend seeing the new version of "Death at a Funeral."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see that on the forum lot of people complain and hate it because it's a remake from not so old movie and complete same storyline. Yeah it's the same story but boosted with many more enjoyable laughs. I mean in the original in the first 10 minutes I couldn't tell weather I'm watching a comedy or a tragedy. Still for those who haven't watched the original I'll just warn that there are many scenes where you gonna laugh even if you're not supposed to, but after all it's a black humor. The all star cast did a great job bringing a new life to this movie. I wish all the remakes were done like this one. So if you want 90 minutes of laughing out loud this is definitely your movie of choice.Have fun!</fullReview>
