		<shortDescription>Suresh Gopi At His Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CK is one of the greatest mystery/detective movie in the history of Malayalam cinema (aka Mollywood) with Suresh Gopi being the lead protagonist lawyer who has a very peculiar way of killing his criminals!The style and the misnomer (License to Kill for Lal Krishna) and his ways are truly for this movie only. The movie succeeds in keeping the audience hooked to the seat and you may want to see it again and again following the charm the whole cast feats to gather!Can we be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: No Violence: Yes Nudity: No Sex: No</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the gripping crime thrillers ever made in mollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie as the name indicates revolves around a murder case of a girl named chinthamani. Suresh gopi as usual excels in his role with ample support from rest of the cast. The script is fast paced and spins on an off with its non linear narrative. all in all the movie can be watched as a decent thriller which engages you right from the beginning. The director and script writer have tried to avoid the regular clichés associated with mollywood crime thrillers, which gives a fresh feel to the movie. thilakan , one of the versatile actors in malalyalam plays the role of the murdered girl. he delivers one of his career best performance of a shattered father.</fullReview>
