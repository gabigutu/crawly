		<fullReview>Tons of homogeneous talent -- the tooth bleach is blinding. No story, no rhythm (oddly enough), over-processed young actors with expensive haircuts and wardrobe.This film isn't about a school with young hopefuls, it's about a fictitious institution packed full of painfully beautiful pimple-free young people.In the original film, a handful of personalities burst onto screen and their characters were revealed as layers peeled away.In this version, tons of hotties are thrown in and popped like corn. Nothing memorable occurs, no great songs or outstanding characters. This should have been called "Fame: Another High School Musical" Looked up the director on IMDb.com and he produced Briney Spears' tours -- talk about unoriginal, packed with fluff, and emotionally depthless. He brings all those qualities to this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fame - An Unfortunate Snoozer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I was younger I enjoyed the original Fame movie. Although I currently can't remember anything about the movie at all, save for the theme song. Tonight I got the chance to see the sneak peek of the 2009 version. Overall, I wasn't impressed. What was wrong with the movie? 1.) The plot?or lack thereof. There were so many "main" characters, that the scenes just jumped from one to another without any real cohesion. Sometimes there were even two scenes going on at the same time with the camera flashing back and forth between the two.2.) The timeline. Before each "section" of the movie, you got a title like "Freshman Year", "Sophomore Year", "Junior Year", and "Senior Year". This would have been fine if they spent any time in these years. Instead, they went by so fast that the title just threw off the pace. For example, you get introduced to the characters and see "Freshman Year". Then you get to see their insecurities and character flaws all over the course of one day. The next day is "Sophomore Year" and the characters have made no forward progress since day one of freshman year. The movie could have been vastly improved by simply stripping out these time stamps.3.) Character development. Tied to the first two problems with this movie is the character development. There is so much going on and time passes so fast that you don't really get to see much development of many of the characters. I understand there is only so much time in the movie, but that could have been resolved by reducing the number of "lead" characters. If you reduced the number of people we had to keep track of, we'd be able to see more how those characters evolve, and care more about them in the end.4.) Lack of resolution. None of these characters really show any sign of improvement until the last scene in the movie, and then we still get no resolution on how things turned out. The last scene is graduation and we have no idea if any of these people amounted to anything after that. Very few even make mention to what they MIGHT be doing after the movie ends. Heck, I would have even settled for the lame freeze frame with written text explaining what people went on to do (which is a pretty cheesy cheat out of writing a resolution to your story as is).5.) Predictability and memorable characters/scenes. I am going to lump these two issues together, because they go pretty much hand-in-hand. the movie from beginning to end was pretty predictable. There were absolutely zero surprises within. As a result, there was very little memorable about the movie. In fact, without looking at IMDb, I couldn't name a single character in the movie.So was there anything good about the movie? I guess for what it was, it was an okay movie. No real surprises, and nothing you are going to remember any length of time from now (which is maybe why I don't remember the first movie). But I did enjoy the gratuitous completely unrealistic cafeteria jam session on day one of Freshman Year. And some of the cast music (which I assume was mostly original?at least nothing I've heard elsewhere) was good. Actually, I would have been okay if it was just one jam session after another, because I kinda dug that cheesy scene. Otherwise I say that if you are really interested in this movie, or perhaps a fan of the previous one, wait for the DVD. There are much better movies you could spend your money watching, especially since tickets are so high these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They should officially change the name to LAME.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>okay.... so first things first.... I was invited to the N.Z. premiere tonight in Auckland of the new "Fame" reboot or remake or whatever you want to call it. I thought free food, a few celebrities to stalk and some free beers and then the movie to end it all, sounds like a good night. I grew up with the 80's fame on t.v. I saw Leroy rocking it weekly on screen... so yeah I was interested to see how they re-branded this film for the new millennium. To be frank, I was not expecting "Fame" to be an academy award masterpiece but I was still very intrigued after watching the trailer, the music sounded cool, the atmosphere seemed a little charged the trailer was cut nicely... but sadly... thats where all the excitement ended in the trailer.....This movie is b- to- the -oring.!! BORING! So I will be mentioning some spoilers so stop reading here if that's an issue for you.... got an issue grab a tissue.Basically they take a bunch of very talented up and coming singers, dancers, actors etc and they cram 4 freaking years of this elusive, over the top, hardest school in the world to get accepted to into a roughly 90 minute film. Every 25 minutes was one year.. starting with a "freshman year" title on the screen... then about 25 minutes later fade to black and "sophomore year" then about 25 minutes later "junior" etc etc... this spread the movie extremely thin... although the leads hair grew longer or haircuts changed so you knew they were older and more mature.They have the cliché young black guy who is full of torment and angst that his father left him, who sits all melancholy in the stairwell while everyone else is in the cafeteria dancing on tables and plugging in guitars and hitting bongos. There is the young black woman who is being forced to play classical piano by her parents when all she really wants to do is be free and sing her heart out... because no one cares about her needs. There is the typical geeky video guy who always seems to have a camera in his hands when you see him, the gay male ballet dancer who no matter how hard he tries cannot cut it and impress his teacher.... blah blah blah and the young girl actress wannabe singer who starts singing in a little tiny voice all shy and quiet, so you would expect that bam she will find herself and come out of her shell like her teachers have been telling her the ENTIRE 4 YEARS!!!!! BUT NO.... nothing changes... she doesn't get a big voice, stays wooden and timid and shy... I mean seriously I thought this school was supposed to be only accepting the best of the best! They just spent the first 20 minutes showing us auditions and having the school principal tell everyone that thousands audition but only a few hundred are accepted!! There are so many cheesy moments, from the black guy saying "aiightt" to the "I just want my parents to be proud of me" to the boyfriend "I'm just going to sing to you and give you a big hug and then cartoon rabbits will come out and doves will lower a silk scarf around your neck and there will be world peace and God bless you tiny tim"... what?!?! Okay so maybe I'm going a little over board but there was more cheese in this then a stuffed crust pizza from domino's.I think the biggest problem with this film is you walk away with a "who cares" mindset. The fact that they have approx. 10 main roles and follow them for their four years of tuition which is crammed into 90 minutes of movie is so thin... you just don't care about the characters at all because you don't get to know them. Each person maybe gets about 15-20 minutes screen time max. Then you are left wondering so what about him or what about her or did she make the album or did he get kicked out or did they stay together or how did the father handle the news????!? The story is not interesting, it extremely average, there is ZERO edge to this reboot.... no pizazz no hype no excitement. It's plain dull.I'm sure that young girls aged between 5-13 will like this, is this who 'fame' is catered towards??? I mean if tweens is the fame target demographic then it may do okay for a week or two. Sadly the biggest audience reaction from tonight's "Fame" premiere was when the "New Moon" trailer screened before the start.Some good things..... The singing is amazing... the dancing is as you would expect incredible but over all that's it. The acting a big thumbs down, I came away from this feeling like it was a very expensive made for TV movie. The story is all over the place, spread top thin and unlike the trailer again I say there is no edge, It's like a pilot for a new TV series... actually.... is that what it is suppose to be?!?FAME is LAME!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fame seems pretty awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be fooled by the trailers, Fame is not as dazzling and inspiring as it may seem. Strip away the fancy lighting, music and camera work and you're left with nothing less than a cast of one dimensional, mundane, and unlikeable characters. The movie doesn't give enough time for any of the characters to develop and therefore, I ended up feeling like I barely knew the characters at all, even at the end of the film. I don't even think I could name all of them. The actual script and dialogue is not any better and the plot feels forced and irrelevant to what the movie claims to be about. From the looks of it, no one in the movie is cut out for actual "fame" with the exception of Payne's character who is portrayed as an arrogant and selfish dancer. The cast had a lot of potential to become very likable characters but because of the poor script, their performances fall flat and feel fake. I entered the movie with hopes of being entertained even if it was on a strictly "crowd pleaser" level. I left feeling like I had just wasted an hour and a half of my life learning that "success is love." There are no real resolutions to any of the character's trials and tribulations. Life must suck at this performing arts school because no one learns anything particularly profound or life changing. Don't waste your time with this movie, and if you still want to, at least wait for it to come out on DVD. The large screen, dark theater, and popcorn won't make this movie any better than the dud that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Fame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had watched the original Fame movie when I was a kid, enough to know the theme song sung by Irene Cara, but little else. Fast forward to today, I'm pretty sure I still enjoyed the reworked theme song, but the film unfortunately is a disaster, with predictable story lines, cardboard characters, and while I'm quite OK that it may have tried to be more documentary like in its presentation, it just fell short on almost all accounts, save for some of the set musical pieces.Despite its hip trailer aimed specifically at its demographic audience, the film just didn't work out, and tried too hard to resemble plenty of dance movies already out there, except that it did a lot more worse by injecting too many characters having everyone bear the brunt of the burden in carrying the film through its runtime, through supporting role appearances at best. Having cast a relative bunch of good looking unknowns also helped in providing the fresh-facedness required, but it's akin to watching a bad episode of American Idol, except that you don't get to choose who stays and who goes.Granted it wanted to be more "School like" encompassing all the various subjects taught from dance to acting, in quite an elitist fashion in getting mere hundreds amongst thousands of applicants, and if quality control was so stringent, it provided critical flaws to the plausibility of the show. For one, these characters are talented folks, and it's just no good treating talented folks like toddlers in school, picking on every little thing they do wrong in hoping to polish those rough diamonds. Also, the screening of candidates, while provided some Audition hilarity, was mostly based on the whims of the various instructors, hence the kind of petty issues they dredge up for themselves, like the angry actor who thought the stage was his calling, throwing tantrums and in need for some serious counselling.But the most critical flaw of them all, for a movie in its genre, is whence the buildup and character development? We're suppose to believe that after their graduation they're all "ready to make it" in the big, bad, unforgiving world of fine art performance. Unfortunately the output's pretty much the same as the input, save for a few characters who turned into perfect gems overnight, with nary any focus on their transformation. The best just coasted through school, while the worst (amongst the best) turned in much better performances through the sprinkle of magic dust or through the rubbing of shoulders. There must be something in the diet served by the school's canteen as well it seems.Fame fell short and became plain, formula, predictable, and ultimately boring. The screenplay reeked laziness - who needs yet another teenage movie where it tells you that even the best amongst us suffer from trouble dished out by disapproving parents, romantic relationship roadblocks, yet another naive girl becoming bait for hot looking predatory guys, wanting to fulfill a deep desire and break out of routine, discrimination, trust and integrity. The list just goes on, no thanks to individual cardboard characters being assigned some thematic homework, and turning in the results in little episodes and scenes, without allowing the audience to build any emotional connection, or to even root for the underdogs.It's ambitious too in its setting, taking on the entire school journey of these select group of youngsters, albeit without a real story, nor gelling them together in one coherent way. Technically, director Kevin Tancharoen (who had so far done music videos) and cinematographer Scott Kevan had opted for the shaky cam technique, for what reasons I do not fathom, and came off quite irritatingly. Someone should start preaching the virtues of mounting the camera of a tripod, versus making it a lame excuse to want to do it documentary style, or to allow for fluid motion in capturing the performances, not!The only saving grace here, are some of the performances, be it group dance ensembles, or solo acts. I had preferred the former a lot more for their energy and choreography, and amongst all the disciplines, I personally enjoyed the dances a lot more, compared to the others like acting, or even singing, due to the rather lacklustre tunes and mediocre lyrics.This is one film that I'd rather not remember its name, and could be called anything else other than a remake of Fame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>to quote --- http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/article/movie-review-fame-2009#comments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie had such a good vibe in the early stages before we actually started to shoot it. In fact, it had such good energy going on, that it was a pity it ended up being cut-up/chop-chopped and 'sanitized'. There were a lot of scenes that unfortunately did not make the final cut. These scenes showed stories about true friendship, love, passion, relationships, sexuality, disappointments and successes in detail thru character development. Though the locked version was 'tamed down' because of the PG rating, a DVD directors cut would probably show the actual stories of the 10 different characters.It seemed that Mr. Tancharoen forgot (maybe intentionally?) that he had 10 characters to develop. It appeared that there was concentration on one, Ms. Panabaker (and how could her character pass such a rigid audition?), Mr. Book, Mr. Pennie, Ms. Naughton (who sang very well) and Ms. Payne. Whatever happened to Mr. Iacono, Mr. McGill, Ms. Perez de Tagle, Ms. Flores (Did you notice her? what character did she portray?) and Mr. Perez? What are their life stories or experiences? Being part of the crew, I witnessed a number of scenes where Joy (Anna Maria), Kevin (Paul McG, who plays a gay dancer?did you notice?) and Neil (Paul I, obsessed film maker) developed and established their friendship. There was a dramatic/touching scene where Joy and Kevin made the whole crew shed tears and I thought that would have been a clincher in the film. But sad to say, it ended up in the editors bin. Ms. Perez de Tagle should have been given more substantial scenes. She really is a "Joy" to watch. If I may add, Mr. McGill as handsome as he is, should have been given the same opportunity. In my opinion, these three characters would have been able to show the true color of FAME.Needless to say, Mr. Tancharoen should have captured the true essence of the "New York PA youth" by utilizing and developing all of his characters evenly. In my opinion, he could have done that, if he had chosen to do so. However, it seems that Mr. Tancharoen concentrated on just one character's development???.Jenny (Ms. Panabaker)?.whom he had 'captured' and "captivated" way before the filming was over. Sad, utterly sad, but true.Give it a chance, view it in it's entirety. Maybe a PG-13 rating would have made the FAME re-invention???.'live forever' Thank you.KW, Beverly Hills, CA</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely, a niche movie that only relates to teens already in the performing arts. To me it felt like the writer crammed 4 seasons of Degrassi or all 3 High School Musicals into 140 minutes. All in all, there wasn't a sufficient amount of time to flesh out any aspect of the movie. Way too many characters. Dull musical numbers. Bland choreography. Uninteresting AND unnecessary romantic subplots.The movie should have focused more on the professional growth of each student over the course of freshman year by really spotlighting the student/teacher dynamic. Instead the movie flaunts the futile personal endeavors of each student over a four year span at a prestigious academy. So by the end, the high school backdrop felt completely pointless because the students learned absolutely nothing to separate their senior level experience from the original insecurity of their auditions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go in expecting a collection of enthralling dance numbers and you will be walking out a satisfied customer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Tancharoen's rambunctious first feature film (after directing a series of music TV shows like "The Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll") isn't as mawkish or amateur as you may expect. He may not have Martin Scorsese or Steven Spielberg looking over their shoulders, but Tancharoen clearly knows how to shoot a dance sequence. Thankfully he understands what the audience want from a movie like this and it isn't lengthy conversations or scenes to showcase the young stars' acting chops, we want exceptional dancing mixed with an ear-pleasing soundtrack. From that standpoint this first-timer delivers.We meet the characters during the introduction as they audition for a spot in the highly sought-after academy, each one of them showing their obvious skills over a well crafted montage that establishes the tone for the rest of the movie. From there we go from one rhythmic set piece to another, of varying enjoyment levels, with the absolute highlight coming from a Halloween party boogie at the halfway point. The gigantic finale goes for broke however doesn't quite reach the heights it should. Also worth noting is Tancharoen's ability to ensure non-dance enthusiasts (like myself) will be entertained no matter what art form is on display; those who think they could never take pleasure in ballet just try and not be entranced with the routine led by the lithe Kherington Payne in the second half.Every film needs a plot and character arcs mind you and this is where Fame's failings become quite evident. The massive ensemble cast is simply too big; trying to follow the amount of individuals on offer is often frustrating. When you start to like someone they disappear for 30 minutes whilst we see the other dozen or so stories unfold, and only randomly do they intersect each other. Of the young cast Kay Panabaker, Asher Brook and Paul Iacono are the pick whilst the wise and wonderful teachers are best served by Bebe Neuwirth and Charles S. Dutton.So how much is the final result affected by the hit-and-miss acting (the romantic scenes between the teens are excruciating), unfocused screenplay and ridiculous reasons to break out in song and dance? Not all that much to be honest. A film that can be this fun to watch doesn't deserve to be hung up on faulting elements such as these. Go in expecting a collection of enthralling dance numbers and you will be walking out a satisfied customer.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed seeing how talented they were, and it gets you feeling rhythmic. At first, I thought it was going to be a good movie, seeing how the auditions went. But, after that part and they went onto freshman year, I got a little disappointed. They showed the students' problems, and what they're going through to make it to be famous, but it almost seems like the director got bored of the movie itself, and just skipped through a lot in the movie. You don't see how the students' problems were faced and how they were solved, you first see them upset, and then at the end, they're happy and ready to graduate? That's not a very good plot, actually, there isn't a plot at all. I am upset with the movie, but the dancing was great. Overall, it really was enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the light of Art school films, just more development!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're thinking this is just another Step-Up, Save the Last Dance, or Raise Your Voice, you're wrong, but there are definite similarities. This features a school for the arts, much like the other film, but this one goes through a bit more character development.Everyone has to audition to see if they have what it takes to get into the school. Starring Megan Mullally, Kelsey Grammar, Bebe Neuwirth, Charles Dutton, and other stars that aren't really well known to me. The bigger names are all teachers who help the students with their musical and acting talent. This movie gets into what families struggle through to get their kids into a really good school. Including making hard decisions and in the end letting them make their own choices. Relationships are tested and if you really care about someone, you will not let anything get in the way. This movie may seem dull at first, but it was a good one to watch and might just be more exciting than the others I have mentioned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FAME? I think not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fame was quite a let down I must say. I feel like I've just wasted about 2 hours of my life and $10 on a movie that I literally got up to use the bathroom during and had no drive to return to the theater other than it being my friends birthday. To start, there were so many main characters I didn't even catch half their names during the movie...except when there was some overly dramatic (yet insanely slow paced and boring) scene about how they were leaving school in which case their name was no longer important because their character was eliminated. It was hard to connect or feel any type of emotion for any of the characters because they were so disconnected and their background stories (if they had any) were incredibly vague. Needless to say I felt nothing when that one boy whose dancing career would supposedly amount to nothing contemplated suicide, he should have jumped, it would have brought something into this story. Its almost as if the people who created Fame felt some sympathy for every Broadway reject who couldn't make it into the chorus or background of a real show. Their careers will probably amount to just being "Dancer #1" in the credits of a movie. The singers, while very talented, were just showcased off for that. I have a feeling that this was the peak of their performance and in about two years time each will have a solo album thats being sold for $7.99 at the checkout line at your local Kmart. There is so much more to be said about this movie, but I feel like its being to harsh. Simply put: Fame sucked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh New Faces; Same Old Lessons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first impression of the movie was that "Wow! They've kept the same feel of chaotic creative energy as the original movie." As I watched, I kept looking for Coco and Bruno and Angelo and Shorofsky and all the other people I remember from the original. When I finally stopped doing that, I was able to focus on what they were doing with the new cast of characters. I saw minor elements and situations from the original, but these played out differently based on the character. The students themselves were fresh and new, with a wonderful modern take. The teachers had the same real-life lessons for the students - a nice touch of consistency. The one negative I noted is that the students this time did not seem to have the same level of character development as in the previous version. These students do not stick in my mind as strongly as the original cast. All-in-all, I would call this a great sequel rather than a remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baby, Remember My Name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1980 original, "Fame", was a gritty depiction of life at a public performing arts high school in New York City. The 2009 remake, "Fame", is a puff piece, never daring to handle any of the intense (yet still relevant) subject matter that was handled so eloquently by its predecessor. Rather than abortion and sexual assault, it focuses on stuff like troubled teen love and disapproving parents. Staying well within the parameters of its PG-rating (the original was rated R), it lacks the edginess and aforementioned grittiness that defined the film it emulates and, instead, closely resembles something that Disney might have produced as a vehicle for the likes of Miley Cyrus or the Jonas Brothers. Fortunately, I like Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers...and, all flaws aside, I surprisingly enjoyed "Fame". It is not the important and relevant film than it probably wants to be, but it is a fun, well-made, and nicely-acted display of its young stars' undeniable talent.Read My Full Review Exclusively At: www.thecinemaview.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FAME - maybe not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, having seen the original Fame a number of times and having sung the theme song aloud in public on a few embarrassing occasions, I guessed that I would probably not be a big fan of the Fame re-make. But, nothing could have prepared me for the sheer awfulness that was this film. Two friends from work and I went to go see it and all three of us sat there, mouths open in disbelief that this piece of twaddle actually made it onto the big screen (or any screen).There is absolutely nothing endearing to say about this poor, scum of a film that managed to plummet the legend that is FAME into a murky puddle of repulsive acting, uninspired singing and dancing and sheer lack of substance. The characters are uninteresting, and unbelievable (apart from the classically trained pianist turned singer, none of the other PA kids have an ounce of real talent). I can't even recall the names of any of the characters, because I was that uninterested in their over-the-top, cheesy, teenage angst performances. I found myself upset that the kid with the imitation flock of seagulls haircut was saved from jumping in front of a subway train.I feel for former Frasier star Kelsey Grammar, whose cameo performance aptly reflects his regret at agreeing to this shoddy piece of cinema, and the under-used, and abused Megan Mullaly who got my only snicker of a laugh throughout the entire film for a sarcastic remark. As for the story lines - they were weak, poorly-developed (at one point the blonde ballerina, who we think may have been dating one of the PA students, just disappears from the film and no one seems to notice or care). The characters of Marko and his pretentious, overly-acted girlfriend had all the cheese, and none of the chemistry (read acting talent) to pull off an honest romance. As for the choreography, simple, pedestrian and definitely not what you would expect from the top performing arts students in the country. Personally, the burlesque, slutty dance performance towards the end of the film was in poor taste and, in my opinion, a meager attempt by the director to gain some audience interest - sadly to no avail.Dance films are supposed to inspire and have a general reputation of feel-good cinema, and all Fame made me feel was anger - at one point my friend actually drop-kicked the screen (I am not exaggerating). To the scriptwriters who wrote this film, the producers who commissioned it, the director who took it on, the future D-List actors who were cast in it, and everyone who contributed in some way to the making of this film - you should be ashamed ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film by myself in the cinema which gave me the chance to really focus on it-since I went to an early show. I thought the film would be a flop-I was kind of just killing time-in a nutshell. Surprisingly, I found the film very well done, hard and soft in all the right places-and bang on in its portrayals of the disciplinarians that exists in many American families. I was completely blown away by some of the music in the film. All in all I had a really good time and wasn't expecting to at all.I saw the film Rent when that came out and I was expecting to have a better time than I did at it-I found Rent depressing whereas this one was really very life affirming in many ways.I guess you either get it or you don't, just like you either appreciate the better dance and trance tunes or ya don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fame; It Wont Last Forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What was the point of making this movie?" I continually asked myself this question during the 107 minutes after the previews were over. There were 10 main characters, none of which have enough screen time (not that their acting talent merited more) to make you care about them. It is so filled with old teen and musical movie clichés that the plot can be predicted by the time the "freshman" sequence is over. Fame is about the New York City High School of Performing Arts and 200 students who spend four years of their lives going there. That is the plot and then there are all the different characters whose stories are so stereotypical that they have all been told in another movie at some point. There is the under-privileged, talented, black boy from the ghetto who falls for the girl who's a piano virtuoso but really just wants to sing, but her father won't let her, the uptight white girl who finds a guy who helps her loosen up, the director who gets scammed out of $5000, the guy who isn't talented enough to make it and tries to kill himself, and so many more. The characters are all completely one dimensional except for the teachers, who have some substance but not enough screen time to make you care about them more than you care about the students. The writing is very limited and the direction is no better than most of the other dance movies to have some out in the past five years. The choreography wasn't bad but you can find much better in other films (i.e Take the Lead). The high points of this film are the cinematography and the film editing which were very good, but you forget about the look of the shots after all the mindless droning of the characters. The only suggestion I could give to the producer's would be to take the cast of the faculty (which included Kelsey Grammar, Bebe Neuwirth and Megan Mullay of 90's sitcom fame) and some of Sinclair's dancers, actors, and singers to launch a TV show. That would at least have some talent and would be worth spending the hour a week to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake of a Classic 80's film,that falls flat quick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a general consensus that remakes are in trouble. The remake of "Fame" even though it masquerades as a reinvention,is no exception. The last time "Fame" was in theatres was in back in 1980. With the direction of Alan Parker,and at the time an unknown cast,this was indeed a preppy tale trailing a bunch if gifted kids at the prestigious New York performing arts high school had some electrifying energy as well as some incredible musical numbers and some pizzaz. The movie also introduce some newcomers at the time including the theatrical debut of a teenage looking Irene Cara. That was back in 1980. What was once fresh and innovative and newly created then is now tired and dull,not to mention a lack of interest. And it shows in this new version,which was hyped up during its theatrical trailer is hopeless and completely pathetic. Basically the film follows the same exact formula.You have thousands of teenagers that are united by the same dream: attending the New York High School of the Performing Arts. Over Ten-Thousand auditions,200 places-which was a very selected school where only one in a chance are accepted where survival is the fittest to succeed. In this version,every student thinks that he or she has a special talent and from there the culture reeks with everyone's sweaty desire to accomplished the impossible goal......the desire for fame. The style of this film opens like an American Idol-esquire opening with the scene proves otherwise. Other flaws are abound in this movie and it shows in this remake in which my opinion should haven't been tampered with or remade in the first place. First,there are flaws that are cringe-worthy attempts to take some of the material out of its original context. Unsure whether it wants to be a "mock" documentary,or just drop trou and be a musical,this film falters on both counts. The only time the screen jolts awake are moments when the director Kevin Tancharoen finally and actually lets someone perform. The film does have some real talent. Naturi Naughton excels as an aspiring singer and Kherington Payne shows some innovative and unbelievable moves to music of some of today's hottest pop and R&amp;B talents. But the rest of it really falls flat. And some of the cast members that includes Broadway and Tony-award winner Bebe Neuwirth, along with Megan Mullally, Kelsey Grammar, Charles S. Dutton, and Debbie Allen cannot save this picture. Not even the cameo appearance by Irene Cara(who was in the original film along with Debbie Allen)wasn't even the risk. All the singing and dancing can't skew the fact that none of the unknowns cannot act a lick, a fact that which ruins the point of doing a classic 1980's flick like this in the first place. The fact that this film needed actors and a narrative that could have save this picture because the dancers and singers are just brilliant,and it could have save this picture from falling forward. By the way,where are the gay people here? The ones that aren't ready to commit suicide? Who remembers Leroy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the old version, so i can't compare it to the old version.Before i went in i wasn't expecting much, to me it looked like a hip-hop dance film, which would be pretty similar to the likes of Step Up 2: The Streets. But i was pleasantly surprised to see it was not another remake of Step up, but equally disappointed to find no real interest in this film. Not only did two people i went with fall asleep, the characters were so unlikeable, i felt myself coming out the cinema wondering why i spent my time even going.Strip away the fancy lighting, music and camera work and you're left with nothing less than a cast of one dimensional, mundane, and unlikeable characters. The movie is only 90 minutes long and with 10 main character story lines to follow, there wasn't much depth to them. I don't think i can even name any of them.I don't even know why any of the characters would want to go study at this preforming arts school to start with, none of them seemed to improve during the four years they study there. And also a big emphasis is made how lucky they are to be in this school, yet most of the main characters leave the school before the four years is up...i didn't get that point? And the most important disappointing factor in the whole movie - there was no hot male lead! Only one guy came close and even then he wasn't much of a looker. Definitely a thumbs down for that aspect of the film.So overall Fame is not as dazzling and inspiring as it may seem and it was pretty much a waste of 90 minutes of my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie by accident without any expectations... Therefore there were no standards set high in my mind that this movie couldn't reach. Little did I know, i was about to waste an hour and half of my life for nothing... I always like to highlight good things about stuff before writing a negative critique, however, there was literally nothing good.. The movie and its characters had no sense whatsoever. It was SUCH cliché and stereotypical in every way... It is obviously better to pack 15 story lines into a movie and not follow one to the end than to focus on 4 or 5 to provide the characters with some depth... No good acting or at least artistic performances (interesting to see kids in talent school having no talent), no interesting, unpredictable or original story lines, no good songs.. There was nothing to relate to, nothing whatsoever... If you are about to watch this movie, go to the Board of this movie and see "Things I learnt from Fame"... you'll understand why not to watch this movie... too bad i saw the board forum after watching this movie, not before... could have saved my precious time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See the real "FAME" movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, watching this tripe filled remake of the vastly superior 1980 version of "Fame" made me want to just abandon this disaster and break out the older flick. To be fair, at least they didn't just rip off the old characters and story lines and transplant them over. On the hand, considering what we are left with here, maybe they should have. Despite the acting caliber of Grammar,Newerth, and Dutton, it still suffers from a bad TV movie script. Were is the gritty realism of the 1980 film? I know they wanted to keep this version a PG, but that just destroyed all the things that made the original work. This lame, tame, tepid remake just makes you walk away with a curse on your lips. What a lousy film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"People will see me and cry"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake was doomed from the start. The original film is iconic- even those who haven't seen the film know the theme tune. How can you compete with Irene Cara's original version? The r'n'b remix that this new film uses is terrible. But it's not just the title song that this remake has to compete with. The remake cannot free itself from the shadow of the original.Remaking Fame was not an entirely ridiculous idea. The original was thirty years ago and with the advent of Facebook, YouTube, and all those X-factor type shows, shortcutting your way to fame seems like a real possibility. And the cast actually look like they could be at high school, instead of the original cast that looked like they could have children who were at high school. There was a lot of potential for the director and writer to make a film that didn't try to compete with the original, but was an alternative that could be equally enjoyable.This film focuses more on dance and music than it does acting (perhaps because the actors can't really act). We get the same types of characters that we got for the original, however in the original these characters didn't come off as stereotypes. They were fleshed out and I was gripped by their problems, which were far darker than this film. As a viewer you actually wanted to make an effort to follow all these different characters in the original. However in this film the characters are so cardboard and the situations so clichéd that it's easy to forget who they are. It makes the lyric in the title song: "baby, remember my name", amusingly ironic. For the time that the characters are on screen, most of them are annoying. The naive/stupid 'plain' girl and her wet boy-band reject love interest are particular standouts in that department.As in the original, the film marks each year of the characters' time at the school, starting from auditions to graduation, however the time gaps seem to be massive. Random characters and relationships will just come out of nowhere, and so the characters never really progress. Instead it's like amnesia occurs at the end of each year.You can tell which of the songs are from the original film because the other ones are so bland. There is a nice version of Out Here on My Own, although it doesn't compare with Irene Cara's version either in the musical or dramatic sense. Cara's character (Coco) was the showoff star who was actually more vulnerable than she appeared to be. In the new version, she's a bit of a loner- the equivalent of Bruno in the original.But what about those who haven't seen the original? You'll probably be even more lost than the ones who've seen the original and know what to expect. Because the film is character-driven, the lack of interesting characters will make the film seem infinitely long. It attempts to be gritty by adding in a few swear words and 'serious' issues but this just makes it worse. If it was really cheesy at least it might have been entertaining.In short, this film has nothing to say about fame, current or otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Started really strong but could not keep the pace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really enthralled by the beginning of this film. I found it great. Great dancing, great music, very good acting, especially the profs. I thought I was on the way to a classic, like Slumdog Millionaire.However, along the way, the film lost its pace. It became too focused on little stories, moving away from the art. Granted, you can't really have a non stop dancing and music but indeed the story line just drifted too far off the artistic performance which should have remained the main focus.I liked the way the black singer kept faithful to her team mate in spite of tempting offers - which gave way to one of the best artistic performance of the film at the end - and there were many of those, which is why I give it an 8 in spite of the weaker story line.A truly enjoyable film about which mostly the rhythm and music will linger in memory.</fullReview>

The singing/dance numbers are great, and there are some really fun scenes. Granted, the story doesn't string together very well- it's very bitty. However, I don't think it's at all deserving of the bad rep it's been getting; if you don't go in expecting something Oscar-worthy, you'll probably enjoy yourself. There's a lot of talent in here, and if you try to compare it to the previous incarnations, you're not going to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Description of the film:I have seen the film "Fame" at the kinepolis. The director of this film is Kevin Tancharoen. The actors who plays in this film are Megan Mullally, Kelsey Grammar, Debbie Allen, etc. The genre of this film is music and comedy. The movie fame is a remake of the original Oscar winning hit movie. Fame follows a group of students who experience highs and lows for 4 years at the New York City High School of Performing Arts where they need to work hard week after week and at the end of the 4 years they determine who's suitable for a life in the spotlights and who isn't.Evaluation:I like the film, but it wasn't very special. I like this film, because I like musicals, films where they sing and dance, etc. The actors were very good, because they play very well and they are very good in dancing, singing and acting. Ik like also the music, because you always wanted to sing en dance on the music during the film. The end of the film is very nice, it's amazing to see them dancing en singing like that.I definitely recommend this film especially when you like musicals or films where they dancing, etc.I give this film a eight and a half out op ten, because it's a very good film, but not the best I've already see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it is not easy to squeeze 4 years of things in a movie which is only 107 minutes. It probably won't be nice for some people because the movie had no focus. There are many little stories in the whole movie. For example, between Jenny and Marco is a little love story. Although the movie is about the arts school, the setting for most of the movie is outside school.I think that Asher Book, who stars as Marco is pretty hot. (but because he only sings in the movie, it does not make him stand out a lot. If he had danced, I believe that a lot of girls will like him a lot.)Kay Panabaker is a great actress, not to mention beautiful. Naturi Naughton is an amazing singer who has lots of power. I thought that the end of the movie could have include more dancing, but it's still alright. The movie has to include many characters' story, and probably because of that, it has somehow lost its focus. But overall, the movie is still OK. Those who are more inclined to arts (music, dance, sing) will probably like it more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest the biggest mistake that will people do with this film is to misjudge comparing to the old move or TV serial.No this is a whole new thing.Congratulations to all persons who worked hard for making this movie.In a small amount of time they managed to do a film based on the old idea of famous "Fame" but combining a fast review of the old time TV serial parts as the looking of a piano or a Cello to keep the educational style without to be boring with the modern times psychology of artists and rapped all together with a whole new hip hop and rap modeling.Family problems co-exist on this movie too and acting as a bridge from the old times to the future career of the modern artists too.But to really understand and appreciate the efforts of making this movie , a tiny bit of artistic beat or music passion must circulate in your blood then you ll become a part of it , without it you ll never understand the meaning of this movie .I m saying again without the music educational level of what represents the name "Kurtis Blow" or if you are in the age above 40 and you don't feel forever young don't try to understand this movie you will be disappointed. Full of Excitement with big E !!! then so enjoy!!! This is a movie to make you live again and again and again...of course it could have been done better if Rudolf Nureyev was the dancer in his early steps but don't take it personal more Nureyevs will follow - accept it !</fullReview>

Actually, with the exception of Debbie Allen's cameo, it has little to do with the original movie, other than that it's set at the same school. The multi-talented actors were very good in their roles and the music was good enough to make me want to own the soundtrack.Honestly, I don't remember watching the original movie, but I was a huge fan of the Fame t.v. series. If you're going to this movie expecting to see the same characters from the old movie or show, you'll be disappointed, but if you go with an open mind hoping to be entertained, you'll have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"FAME" ? REMEMBER their Names (&amp; Don't be afraid to SUCCEED)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Based on an advance screening).This is a remake of the 1980 film by the same name, about attending the specialized New York Academy of Performing Arts. It uses a large cast to follow the trials &amp; tribulations of students, their interactions with each other, their parents, the staff &amp; the (very) "outside" world around them.Jenny (KAY PANABAKER) is an initially "mousy" type of actress-singer, with little confidence or understanding in what she does and the motivations of some people around her. She's encouraged (&amp; later romanced) by self-assured &amp; generous-spirited MARCO (ASHER BOOK) who'd sung for years in his father's restaurant (&amp; has a good &amp; pleasant-sounding voice, such as in performing "Someone To Watch Over Me" &amp; "I Just Got To Be Happy"). Denise (NATURI NAUGHTON) is a talented classical pianist, altho she dislikes doing just that &amp; being forced to do so by her pushy father.Kevin (PAUL McGILL), who has a dance-teacher mother back in Iowa, wants to be a dancer-- tho the instructor isn't very encouraging about his talent. Malik (COLLINS PENNIE) wants to be an actor, but, his teacher (CHARLES S. DUTTON) points out he comes across as overly angry.Outgoing comedic Neil (PAUL IOCONO) loves doing video work all over the place, &amp; carelessly urges his dad to put up money to produce a movie. Walter (VICTOR TAVERAS) likes to produce &amp; arrange music. Alice (KHERINGTON PAYNE) is an accomplished dancer who eagerly wants a career in that field (rather than concentrating on romance in her life). Joy (ANNA MARIA PEREZ DE TAGLE) is a dedicated student.Various segments feature some of the older, well-known stars: MEGAN MULALLY (as singing teacher Fran who's urged to perform by some of the kids at one point); KELSEY Grammar (in an understated performance as acting instructor Joel); BEBE NEUWIRTH as teacher Lynn; and, as Principal Simms, you have DEBBIE ALLEN (who played 'Lydia Grant' in the ORIGINAL 1980 version of the film, plus the same role in 131 episodes of the TV show rendition from 1982-1987).The film has a wonderful ENERGY in many of its musical and dance numbers (such as 'Out Here On My Own' and 'CarnEvil', and the large closing one with drums). Some performances are so impressive in the film (such as ones by Naturi), they got APPLAUSE from people in the movie theater audience. I liked the way they individually 'PRESENTED - INTRODUCED' the main actors separately during the credit section at the end (as movies "used" to do).But, by sort of hurrying through what they say is a "4-year" period at the school, certain elements of the DRAMA are periodically "RUSHED" and a bit weak compared to the musical &amp; dance elements. As a friend commented, he felt the film showed little real "growth" by the performers thru the period featured, &amp; thus came across as somewhat "cliched". While I feel there's some accuracy in that position (in that the drama sections are a trifle "feeble" by comparison), I felt that the MUSICAL &amp; DANCE elements &amp; overall acting are so strong (&amp; the main "point" of the film), they MAKE UP for that in providing a very EFFECTIVE entertainment vehicle (&amp; a bunch of the young actor / performers are people to "WATCH" &amp; REMEMBER for the future!).</fullReview>

I didn't know one name by the end. 2) They don't even sing "Fame" in the film! How disgraceful is that! It is only played in the credits which by that time I was running out of the room. 3) The pure lack of musical numbers is just mind-blowing. The ones that are there are poorly choreography (except the final performance which is the only reason this gets 1 star) and the singing is only mediocre. 4) The acting! It's really bad from beginning to end.Please do not pay to watch this film, rent it or watch it on TV - DO NOT BUY IT! It's very, very bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wretched. Horrible. Awful. Pathetic and sad. When the lights burnt out of the title before the movie even began, I foresaw bad things for this movie. It is so full of cliché and stereotypes.This is one of the most poorly made (this is my biggest complaint) films I have seen in recent years -- nothing seemed to really matter to anybody involved. Bad script, horrible acting (Kay Panabaker may be the MOST annoying actress I have ever run across), implausible situations ... ugh. Stupid and trite. Fake emotions and tears. I actually felt awful when I wanted a kid to go ahead and kill himself because he was wearing horrible pants. I didn't care for a single soul in this film because NONE of it felt real(istic).I can watch So You Think You Can Dance or Glee or American Idol on television and care more for any of those people I see on screen than I did here. Fame is all truly tragic ... and not in a good King Lear-tragic kind of way. There seems to be no real heart or emotion in this thing -- perhaps it is adequately named since fame is what so many people seem to care about anymore ... it doesn't matter what one does to "earn" it.Famehorrors! (this could've been spelled another way but I think it would have been rejected -- although BOTH words fit) -- and this dud of a film was full of them since not one of them seemed to genuinely care that the movie was terrible.The original television show deserved better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up watching Fame on TV, catching a few episodes here and there. I am not big on remakes but I thought maybe it could be more modern and exciting 29 years later so I was willing to give it a chance. I was so wrong.I rented the DVD for my wife who had seen neither the original nor the TV series. My next mistake was choosing the director's cut version, adding nearly 20 more boring minutes to our watch time. Halfway through I hit the 50% speedup option to get through the movie faster. It was still insufferably long. The only enjoyment we got was watching the clips in the end credits where the actors were finally able to show their talents. We also enjoyed the music video.Spoilers: Too many main characters with nothing to do but show how 4 years of working your butt off really gets you nowhere, including a lack of any real growth. Most of the characters peter out, get taken for a ride, drop out, or find other ways to end the suffering.I can usually relate to any movie and any character, but this time I just could not care about any of them. There seemed to be a lot of wasted talent, waiting for their next cut-scene.There was almost one tense moment when one of the characters contemplated throwing himself in front of an approaching subway train. I was so bored by that point that I would have pushed him myself just for my chance to be next in line. At least that would have been dramatic or helped the audience feel something. Alas, the only thing I felt was regret. That is two hours of my life I won't be getting back. And another 30 minutes to warn people not to make the same mistake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Closer to reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Fame today and as i do with every film after i see it, i come on to IMDb to see what others think of it. Not much to my surprise, this film has been hit with a lot of criticism and that was to be expected. But this is my opinion of what i thought of Fame.I'm not going to compare this to the first one. In all honesty, everyone knows the original is always the best. But Fame was different. This Fame, it stepped in to reality. While a lot of people may fail to see this, it is true. Because this is the truth for a lot of young kids out there who try to make it. In each character we see a different story. And it's most likely a story of someone who's facing that out in the real world.I see this close to reality because this will be me in a month. Auditioning for dance and acting at tafe. This movie, although i know is nothing like what i will probably go through, showed me possibilities, circumstances and many things i'll most likely have to face like the kids in this film did.Each characters story opened my eyes. The successful ones, you could feel for their happiness, while the ones who weren't as successful, i could see that it would hit close to home. Having to go through the hard work, suffer through the late nights, the achievements and the ones who fell short. This is what's happening or what is going to happen to many teenagers around the world and Fame showed us this in a way closer to reality than many other films.Although a lot of people are bagging it for not having the right story line, for having crap actors, for having bad dancing and singing. I also think a lot of those people wouldn't know what it's like to go through this. I heard that they wanted this Fame to be as close to reality as possible. Hence, the new actors, the dance moves, the singing and the acting. They were not trying to do the same as the old Fame. They were bringing it in to the world of today. They wanted it to be closer to reality and if that's what they were aiming for, they got it spot on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fame 2 is a remake of the original Fame (1980). The film is about students at a performing arts school. We follow the teenagers through the high school as they try pursue their dreams while dealing with school work, family problems and love. The film shows the downsides and upsides on being a young adults taking advantage of their talents. It shows positive and negative sides of the entertainment business, how the business take advantage of them, but also how they can get what they want as long as they work hard enough.The film is exactly like the original, boring. Fame 2 isn't your average chick flick, but you loose interest after a couple of minutes and a lot of the scenes are very predictable. There's a lack of humour and the film didn't do anything new with the storyline from the original film. However, the music acts and choreography in the dance scenes are very good and it show that the cast has put a lot of work into it. But this doesn't make up for the bad script or scenes, which is why you must be desperate to manage to watch the entire film.for more reviews go to: http://malinlystad.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This may not live forever but it's good enough as a one-off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If any of you are wondering, this is not like High School Musical. Shockingly, this is a very good remake (well, I wouldn't say it's a remake but an updated version but many people call it a remake). The students are very likable and the acting is so-so, the actress who stuck out with her fantastic singing voice was Naturi Naughton and her version of the songs "Out Here On My Own" and "Fame" were brilliant. The dance sequences were phenomenal and actually made you want to get off your seat and join them. The storyline was good and it sent the usual message this type of movie sends and delivers the whole 'you can make it if you believe in you' message which worked as it would in this movie.I'm genuinely surprised as this was better than I expected it to be but it's not better than the original. My criticisms are that one or two of the actors had their moments of great acting and then it went to poor however this wouldn't put you off the movie as the singing and dancing triumphs. Another criticism is that there wasn't enough Naturi Naughton for me, I wanted to hear her sing more, her voice is phenomenal! For me, I thought it was fantastic and I'm shocked at how much I liked it. If you're a fan of the 80's Fame, then you'll love this! This is two hours of feel-good fun.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember its name....if you have to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When bad reviews and moderate box-office results came through for the re-invention of "Fame", I decided why not go for it after all. After that, this looks like a movie I can tell one of my friends about. And now that I still have the movie on DVD for over 4 1/2 weeks, I can still tell someone I know about it. "Fame" doesn't live forever but I was impressed by the flaws, clichés, and sometimes sentimentality of this film. In other words, it's funny, fast-paced,and just terrific. Set in modern-day at the Performing Arts High School in New York, this movie deals with over 10 students who goes through four years (plus auditions) of love, heartbreak, joy, and raising your voices. Some might have a problem with the quickness of the four years combined together and some of the actors looks too old to play teenagers. But I didn't, so I basically stuck with it and it even surprised me for 107 minutes. The "teenagers"/newcomers in "Fame" are surprising and fantastic. For example, Naturi Naughton (who played Lil' Kim in "Notorious") steal some of the scenes of the film whether it's from singing the original tunes from the original film, "Fame" and "Out Here on my Own" or from going by her parents' wishes as a classical pianist and becomes a singing sensation. Kay Panabaker and Anna Maria Perez de Tagle (from Disney Channel) are superb, especially when they sing. Collins Pennie is phenomenal as Malik and he, like Naughton, steals some scenes. Much as the same goes to Asher Book, who as Marco, develops some joyfulness and emotional content through the film. Even the adult actors like Debbie Allen (from the movie and T.V. show of the same name), Kelsey Grammar and Megan Mullally has their moments as well. This IS a movie directly for the teenagers if the kids can't handle this movie. It has its moments and sometimes the sentimentality will put a smile on your face. I enjoyed it, so why don't you go for it. Go, remember its name....if you have to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more enjoyable than the IMDb rating would suggest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read what the critics say about this movie, I just noticed that the IMDb rating is rather low. But taken for what it is, and not comparing it to the original, this edition of "Fame" is a nicely entertaining movie.I enjoyed it especially because it portrays the struggles of young men and young women who are talented and want to make their lives in the performance arts world. It actually helps to view the DVD extra, maybe even first, where each of the young stars are profiled in a minute or two. In viewing that you find that the actors in their real lives are very similar to the characters in the movie.The story presented here covers almost 4 years, from the youngsters auditioning for admission to the PA high school, through graduation. It is told mostly linearly, and features the struggles of several of the characters.Kay Panabaker, really a teen during shooting, is Jenny Garrison. She is talented but naive, and she has some difficulty fully expressing herself, as a singer and as an actor. Her path is to learn to free herself.Naturi Naughton is Denise Dupree, a classically trained pianist, of strict parents who expert her to pursue a career in classical music. They don't even know she sings, but she has probably the best voice of all the students we see. Her journey is to find her real voice, and for her parents to accept that.Kherington Payne, also a teen during filming, is Alice Ellerton, who has been dancing all her life. She and her parents are frank about her going to PA, she needs training but as soon as a professional opportunity comes along, she is gone with it. Also to the dismay of her boyfriend.In a good touch towards realism, real Broadway star Bebe Neuwirth is Ms. Kraft, the dance instructor. Debbie Allen, part of the older Fame movie, is Ms. Angela Simms. Charles S. Dutton is teacher Mr. James Dowd. And in a small role Kelsey Grammar is faculty member Mr. Martin Cranston.There are a number of other characters and equally compelling stories. I don't know why anyone who enjoys singing, dancing, theater, those sorts of things would rate this movie lower than 5 or 6 or 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fame: What's in a Name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From this moment forward, I'm going to completely forget that the original Broadway production existed. That's not to say that this rendition of Fame was better or worse, but I do believe that comparing them is not fair. You have to remember that there is nearly a 30-year difference between the media, which grants a large difference between what can and what will change. With that being said, I feel as if this movie actually did a decent job in doing what it was should - bringing an entertaining moving and showing what recalling happens in an art school.The plot as much goes in the same boat as sever that we have seen before. We watch the lives of several students as the go from bumbling and hopeful applicants in a prestigious arts school in New York City, to prospering and proud graduates. Yet it's not all fun and games, as each of the selected ten students have their own trials and tribulations in their friends of dance, music, and acting. Along the way, their teachers who add their own flavor and advice will guide them. These little gems by people like Kelsey Grammar and Charles S. Dunton layer on an impressive and applaud-worthy amount of attention and detail to what these kids should be learning. They fully immerse themselves into the role of molding their minds into what they need to be.For delivering the story of each of the characters, director Kevin Tancharoen did an interesting and stuck it to the parts that were only worth telling. When I say that, He doesn't show you each of their love loves, or what their careers are - in fact he barely gives them enough face time to know who they are - but sticks to what's enough to give them their motivation and drive. The passion of each character is what makes this movie and that's what pushes this movie along past it's four "years." However when done in this fashion, you do run into the issue of what I mentioned just a moment ago; not knowing who is who. It wasn't until the end of them move where I could clearly recognize anyone, let alone remember anyone's name clearly.I did say that I wouldn't compare this to the Broadway original, but considering that this was on Broadway, it's safe to assume that the music was left as well. One has to realize that you are watching a movie about NYC preps in arts school. Yet most of the musical numbers were not spontaneous or over-excessive (though the first main number did nearly break that second one). The majority had a purpose and flowed with the plot, which is always a plus, in the aftermath of the High School Musical trilogy. Yet the highlight of this little aural romp was the fact that overall, there was no true happy ending. Sure, people got what they needed, but not in the way that they expected it. It was true in the way that real life would finish out for kids. It's a little bit of reality wedged into a lot of fantastical imagery and melody.The movie overall is good. Could things have been done better? Yes, yet that can be said with almost any movie. This is, however, a movie that you have to want to watch, much like Rent or West Side Story. If you walk into those and you are either not prepared or they are not what you enjoy, then you are going to be disappointed and will not experience the full potential you were meant to get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many characters- Not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of Fame really isn't very good. The main problem is that there are too many characters whose progress through the School for the Performing Arts we are expected to follow. There must be at least ten "major" characters. This means the film rushes from one to another too quickly for us to get involved in their stories or have much empathy with them.The script is pretty poor as well. Some of the dialogue and situations are very clichéd. It seems more like a film version of the 80's TV series rather than the Alan Parker film. The young cast do their best in the circumstances but the material isn't great. You'd wonder why the producers bothered hiring reasonably big names like Kelsey Grammar when his role is very incidental. Maybe a lot of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. The musical numbers aren't really memorable either. The graduation show at the end isn't far removed from High School Musical.Unfortunately I don't think I could recommend this even as a DVD rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fame 2009 should serve as a warning to any studio attempting a remake, re-imagining or re-invention of a classic. Far from capturing the magic of the original we are instead presented with the biggest Turkey of the year so far.The premise is similar to that of the 1980 film. A bunch of fresh face hopefuls are accepted into the prestigious New York City High School for the Performing Arts. Their professional and personal lives are tracked throughout their school experience as they seek fame and fortune in the big city.The problem with Fame 2009 is not the fact that it fails to live up to it's predecessor. It's fault lays within the fact that it plays like a hastily put together, two hour MTV video trying to make a quick buck of the name of a beloved franchise.The first fault with Fame 2009 is it's director. To date Kevin Tancharoen's most prestigious credits happen to be "The Search For The Next Pussycat Doll" and "Britney Spears Live From Miami". However adept Tancharoen may be at zooming a camera in on pop tarts behinds, he is painfully unqualified to helm a fifteen million dollar musical in which you have to deal with real actors. He manages to illicit even faker performances from his young cast than any contestant on one of his reality shows could have ever been capable of.The casting in itself is a train wreck. These teenagers are supposed to be attending a talent school, yet not one among them seem to be particularly talented. As a matter of fact you can't help but wonder if the list of successful applicants was confused with the list of rejects and then no-one had the heart to tell them. None of the young cast possess the appeal or charisma to actually make their roles memorable. Not even the support of Kelsey Grammar, Megan Mullally or Bebe Neuwirth could elevate the quality of the film. They languish away in small, thankless roles which makes you wonder why they even bothered to waist their time.Another major blunder is Allison Burnett's script. Whilst the original Fame broke ground by incorporating classic musical numbers with gritty subject matter, Fame 2009 comes across as something schlepped together by the Disney channel as a follow up to High School musical. The content seems insipid, with the highest source of tension being "I want to sing but my parents want me to play classical music!" Cue the violins. Character development is also so atrocious that by the end of the film you couldn't really care a less about anyone. Numerous sub plots are introduced at an alarming pace, yet not one of them are adequately explored or resolved. After spending over three years in the lives of these kids, their is no discernible growth or change in anyone. You'd even be hard pressed to remember their names.The final nail in the coffin have to be the films musical numbers. You could expect the same quality from any High School production. It's not a good sign when you leave the cinema feeling you could have been a better choreographer when the closest you've come to a dance routine is the Macorina.If your feeling nostalgic for leg warmers, sweat pants and the vocal styling of Irene Cara i suggest you bypass this offering and rent the original.

		<shortDescription>A movie that really is as dull as people have said!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually enjoy movies about performing arts. Usually, they get very average reviews since most people are left unsatisfied. I watch them anyway and more often than not I enjoy them. With this in mind I watched Fame. I thought it would be best to dismiss the negative reviews since they were probably from people who idolised the original or who preferred classical dance and music. This is one of those rare instances when I have to agree with the majority of reviews. Fame's remake is really boring! I still have memories of the original Fame movie and of the TV series but those memories are so faded now that I am not basing my review on any comparison against the original. I am not even sure exactly why the remake is so bad - perhaps it simply follows the cliché that the sum is greater than the parts. In this case, it's lots of little things that combine to create an unforgettable movie.The casting is okay for the most part. The staff of the school were believable but, of course, the film is about the students. Here is where the clichés set in - they were the same cardboard stereotypes Hollywood love to use in everything. This made them forgettable; they simply weren't memorable. Also, there the film tried to follow too many of them so we never really "clicked" with any of them. Yes, some of them certainly had talent but we never got close to any of them so we never really learned to care about them.The pace of the movie was a serious weak point. It was divided up by year. In this way it became too routine. Had it just ignored this approach and followed the characters more intimately it could have been more entertaining. Generally, people have described this movie as boring because it *is* boring.I watched the version which was supposed to have contained a lot of extra dancing and singing but I was actually surprised by how little there was. For two hours it was surprisingly devoid of dancing and acting. The culmination at the end was a step in the right direction but even that was too short.This movie had the potential to have been a real attention grabber but instead is one of the most forgettable movies I have ever seen. Wait for the next remake of the original and hope that one delivers. Until then there are plenty of better performing arts movies to see. I might even go back and rent the original again to see how it compares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fame (2009), or how to make a film devoid of any drama in 3 easy steps!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a great line in Edward Porter's review of the new Fame in the UK Sunday Times newspaper that said something along the lines of "Remember their names? I can barely remember their faces!" This essential sums up all that is wrong with the new Fame movie. There is nothing memorable about it.You would think that when making a film about a group of dramatic arts and music students you would seek out the most talented unknowns out their. There must be dozens of them surely. Which makes you wonder how on Earth they finished up with this bunch of no-hopers! There is only one kid with any discernible talent, the pianist-turned-singer who has a teen Jennifer Hudson vibe, amongst the young cast. The rest is filled with lousy singers, uninspired dancers and wooden actors.It does serve to make the underused teaching staff (Kelsey Grammar, Megan Mullahy, Bebe Neuwirth, Charles S Dutton) stand out more but I doubt that was an intention. In fact the script and direction goes out of its way to underserve these actors. Mullahy is given a terrible song to sing at a karaoke bar which does nothing to serve her natural singing talent, serving instead to make her sound shrill. It does perhaps show why her character did not make it as a successful singer and is just a teacher but that would be giving the director far too much credit I suspect and, besides, just not explain the awed gawping of the students. Grammar crops up in this scene out of nowhere making you think he was maybe just shoved in to give him more screen time. While Dutton has an hilarious storyline where one "troubled" student is telling a story and, in the timeline of the movie, it takes Dutton 2 years to ask the logical response question. What have these guys been doing for 2 years?! And that brings me to the script which has two huge problems. The first is the timeline. The film follows the students over 3 years at the school, but does so so swiftly that it allows no time for growth. Most of the scenes follow in an ordered logic that would work just as well in a film that spanned a single week as 3 whole years. There is no growth. From one year to the next none of the characters appear to have developed, to have learnt a single thing. Those that are morose and troubled in year one are the same in year three. Na?ve on day one? Yup, na?ve on graduation. And this equally serves to kill any possible chance of rooting for a character to succeed. You don't see characters getting better. Suddenly you are just jumped to another year and lo and behold someone quitting because they have an acting or dancing gig and you not only wonder "how did that happen?" but "who is that anyway?" The script does such a poor job of setting the characters up that often a characters "big moment" seems to be their only moment, leaving the audience shrugging and looking at their watches.The other problem is the phenomenal lack of tension and drama. There seriously is none. It appears to be a phenomenon in Hollywood films I'm noticing more and more that they are so determined to hit all bases and offend absolutely no one that there is an almost comical lack of drama. The recent "thriller" Obsessed was this way. It had zero thrills. Fame is the same and hint as possible drama through unhappy parents or disappointments is so instantly resolved that no tension had built. A scene with one character possibly suicidal I was audibly rooting for the guy to kill himself just to give the film some sort of drama, an element of edge, a moment of guts, but no. Nothing. The closest thing you get to anticipation watching Fame (2009) is hoping it may at some point actually have something to anticipate! This is probably partly the problem with hiring a choreographer to direct the movie. A good director (like the original film's Alan Parker) can hire a good choreographer to help him but I guess a choreographer can't exactly hire another director for advice. This films screams "I have no sense of story and drama" and while much of the blame can clearly be assigned to the script and the awful casting a good director would have seen those problems and, at least casting wise, probably helped avoid or overcome them. The director here is massively out of his depth.Fame's worst offence though is the truly unrealistic view of the world it portrays. The original went some way to at least suggest the work that such students have to put in, though perhaps in this age of reality TV where any moron can become an instant star this would be an unteachable, untenable lesson. Here any success any of the students have comes seemingly by luck and "right-place right-time" factors or from outside help. The school doesn't seem to have helped them at all. And on top of that none of these students would make it because they are so phenomenally devoid of talent. A cast of talented unknowns with a choreographer director proved what can be done in Disney's High School Musical. Given the potential for revisiting Fame in a modern day setting everyone involved should be ashamed of what they've turned out here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is nothing but a High School Musical and a really bad one at that. It has nothing like the gritty down to earth feeling of the original and there was little or no character development.To break the movie out into years at school there were these occasional graphics indicating freshmen, Sophomore and the like. The only issue is they spent less than 15min in each year and the result was little actual development of the characters through the movie. Can Allan Parker please do a "reboot" of Fame and we can all pretend that this 2009 version wasn't made. If your around 12 years old and like that Walt Disney "High School Musical" Theme, watch Glee on TV, your going to get a lot more out of it.

		<fullReview>For those who don't know, FAME is a remake of the 1980 version and it completely lacks what made it good. The original FAME has believable characters and situations, memorable songs, and brilliant singers and actors. However, no one can act and the songs are poor updates of the original. Even if you judge this movie on it's own basis, you're still going to find it awful. The acting sucks, the music is forgettable, and the direction is so bland that nobody even knows what to do half of the time. FAME was clearly trying to please the High School Musical crowd when it was released and it completely failed. This is kid version of a serious and realistic musical. FAME was about understanding, trying to find yourself in high school, and the consequences for following the path to fame. Now every sense of seriousness and realism is taken for terrible dances and awful musical sequences. This is a complete butcher of what the original FAME was. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND WATCH THE 1980 VERSION INSTEAD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fame (2009): Dir: Kevin Tancharoen / Cast: Kay Panabaker, Charles S. Dutton, Kelsey Grammar, Bebe Neuwirth, Debbie Allen: Unnecessary remake about reaching the highest potential. It regards four years in the lives of several students who enroll in a school of performing arts in hopes of making it. Director Kevin Tancharoen is faithful enough to the original but the screenplay isn't as detailed and the ending is too abrupt. The original gives viewers the impression of four years of study and hard work while the remake delivers tremendous musical numbers but little involvement. Fortunately the performances are actually quite convincing and engaging beginning with Kay Panabaker as one of the standout students. Among the professors there is Charles S. Dutton as an acting teacher, Kelsey Grammar as a music teacher, and Bebe Neuwirth as a dance instructor. Debbie Allen is the only participant appearing from the original film although here she is a principal as oppose to a dance instructor. They are all in good form but unlike the original these subplots seem straight forward in regards to their interactions with students and the results. This is not a superior remake but it is far from the worst either. It has the idea but not the detail. It has the music but not the lyrics. In the end this is an entertaining remake but it never reaches the heights of the original. Score: 5 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from the fact that this movie looks slicker and more technically accomplished than the original 1980 "Fame" movie, this remake is inferior to the original in every way you can think of. Of all the problems in the movie, I think the worst is the fact that NONE of the characters - students or teachers - is fleshed out sufficiently. The movie crams in so many characters that it doesn't have time to follow any for a decent length. The lack of a human angle probably explains why the movie doesn't have any bite - I remember the original movie had more grit and drama. This even extends to the musical/dance numbers - the music is instantly forgettable and the dancing is at its best mediocre. What the movie ends up being is very boring, even if you choose to watch the theatrical cut over the extended cut. Stick with the original movie.</fullReview>

The original has the advantage of being original. Instead of diving into one or two of these characters, the feel is scattered and the four year span doesn't help. It's the same structure as the original but once again, the original was original back then. There is also a cleaning up of the original in this G-rated version. So it's not even as good or edgy as the original and lots of these Step Up Dance Up movies have been made since then. None of this is memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry to say that this was such a bad movie, or sequel, or remake, or adaptation, I don't know how to call it. This is not even the shadow of the original. The original movie has distinctive characteristics. This one has no hope, no emotion, no real talent and, on top of that, a bad story with an awful ending. The start up was promising, however, the story-line immediately fell short. The inclusion of Debbie Allen was a nice touch as a key character from the original movie. The non-inclusion of Irene Cara was a no-no. You cannot think of the song Fame without thinking of Irene Cara. I'm sure that Megan Mullally and Kelsey Grammar are not happy... at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My initial impression of the 2009 remake of "Fame" was favorable, having seen only the scene where the failed ballet dancer contemplated taking his life in a subway station. I was impressed by the directorial style, where everything around him faded into a distant noise as he became overwhelmed by his feelings of hopelessness and futility. This is, unfortunately, the most striking scene of the whole movie, and not really enough to justify sitting through it for a whole two hours (I saw the "Extended Dance Edition"). If the rest of the movie would have been made with the same care, it would have been much more resonant and enjoyable. Unfortunately it was not, and this is why I was so disappointed with it.Upon viewing the complete movie from the beginning, I was taken with director Kevin Tancharoen's use of the cinema verité style in order to give the movie more of a documentary feeling. Unfortunately, his attempts at realism were severely undermined by the flat, one- dimensional characters, clichéd situations, and (for me) underwhelming dance and musical production numbers. Add to this the fact that the rather sloppily written screenplay attempts to cover too much ground for the movie's running time, trying to focus on so many characters that I was not able to really connect in a substantial way with any of them. The movie ultimately has a rather sterile, detached feel to it, and I found it difficult to really care about the characters because they came across as stock types (the shy, na?ve starlet who comes this close to be taken advantage of, the angry inner city black youth, the selfish dancer who only cares about stardom). The production numbers did not impress me either, although Naturi Naughton did display an impressive vocal range and stage presence. This is especially worrisome to me, as I watched the "Extended Dance Edition". None of the dance numbers really stayed with me...I've seen better on shows like "Britain's Got Talent".The more experienced actors (Kelsey Grammar, Bebe Neuwirth, Charles Dutton, Megan Mullaly, and Debbie Allen) had little to do except for portray the teachers, which also come off as your typical authoritative/mean/condescending/inspirational stock types. The younger actors are fine in their roles, although not outstandingly charismatic or memorable. I can't really complain about the acting, though, since the script is so poorly conceived the actors simply don't have much to work with. Not even Meryl Streep and Laurence Olivier could have saved this one.One thing I did notice was a direct rip-off of a scene from "Mr. Holland's Opus", which is, in my mind, a far superior film whose characters truly resonate with the audience - a student does a rendition of the old Gershwin standard "Someone to Watch Over Me," and is instructed by the teacher that she needs to have a better grasp of what the words mean. The scene is slightly different here, but couldn't they have at least have chosen a different song? This, to me, is symbolic of what is wrong with this movie - lazy, formulaic plotting, stock characterizations, and a poorly conceived script. There are so many characters on display that at the end of the movie, I didn't know what happened to all of them. What happened to the aspiring director at the end? Or the dancer's best friend (and it was news to me that they were friends until the end of the movie?) The filmmakers didn't even so much as put an epilogue on the end that you could read in order to figure out what became of the characters. Overall, I felt like the movie was a waste of my time. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Verdict : Flashy Movie, 3 Stars today after so many days, today I watched a movie (Fame (2009)) and I must say though this movie does not meet the original version of 1980 nor does bring any new contents or slapstick performances but kind of makes you glued to your seat until the students reach their junior year. Fame kind of reminds one of their undergraduate years and the fact that even a movie can be made about some interesting school years. Though this film never goes into any details and rather places a collage of the various things that we have already seen at various places and the only people this movie will perfectly fit to are the ones who have almost no knowledge of dance, acting or movies.NOTE: All my reviews are available at http://rastogisaurab29.wordpress.com/category/tv-and-movies/movie- reviews/ OR http://www.imdb.com/user/ur39556023/comments?order=date</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all let me make this clear; I LOVE MUSICALS. Even when they're not great, a little song and dance always gives me something to look forward to in a movie. Second of all, let me make this also clear; my expectation of a remake is never set too high. Same as sequels, very rarely do they capture the magic of the original movie.So I didn't watch this movie expecting to be blown away, to be honest I barely expected anything; but somehow it managed to disappoint. Really.The actors all look the same, well at least the boys do, they're all safe, mediocre choices. And that pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the movie- safe and mediocre. They tried to have all the components of a hit (complete with a hip hop performance); teenage drama, success, failure, betrayal and even a make over. But the lack of emotional depth in all the characters (even the angry kid whose sister got killed) and story lines makes you lose interest half way through.Sorry Fame 2.0, you sucked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1980 Irene Cara/Alan Parker version of the film is a cult favourite, famous for that title song that went to number one, naturally a remake would be much more modern and stylised, it did sound like a bit of a silly idea. Basically, set in New York City High School for the Performing Arts, the story sees a group of young boys and girls wanting to achieve fame in whatever talent they have, whether it be drama, music, dancing, rapping or singing, but they have their hold backs. The story goes through freshman year, sophomore year, junior year, senior and graduation, and the main characters, amongst others, are wannabe actress Jenny Garrison (Kay Panabaker, Danielle's sister), wannabe pianist Denise Dupree (Naturi Naughton) and wannabe dancer Alice Ellerton (Kherington Payne). The teachers keeping an eye on the students and helping them achieve their ambitions include music teacher Mr. Martin Cranston (Kelsey Grammar), dance class teacher Ms. Kraft (Jumanji's Bebe Neuwirth), voice teacher Ms. Fran Rowan (Megan Mullally) and Ms. Angela Simms (Debbie Allen). Also starring Walter Perez as Victor Tavares, Asher Book as Marco, Collins Pennie as Malik Washburn, Kristy Flores as Rosie Martinez, Paul McGill as Kevin Barrett and Paul Iacono as Neil Baczynsky. I can see what the critics mean by trying to make it like a High School Musical kind of thing, I found it similar to something like Save the Last Dance as well, it is filled with the most obvious and tedious clichés, the characters are pretty one dimensional, the songs are okay, the title song being the only really memorable one, overall it is a pretty pointless remake musical drama. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the time of its release, the original FAME (1980) was out of my demographic - I was too young to appreciate the tribulations of 70's high schoolers balancing schoolwork and performing arts and aiming for their fifteen minutes. In this tepid remake - now I'm too old to care. Kevin Tancharoen helms this rushed production that flits through so many story lines and characters at the New York School of Performing Arts, it implodes with two-dimensionality.Main character is young, nominally talented Jenny (Kay Panabaker, who looks like she's still waiting for her period), so inept at the performing arts, we wonder how she ever got in. We discover later she didn't even sleep her way in, so which authority did her rich daddy pay off? Other characters orbit, trying to cover every angle on parent-kid tropes: the talented kid stultified by parents; the parents trying to channel their kid's talent in another direction; the kid hiding their scholarship from parents...We see the cons, the competitiveness, the crises, as film scrambles through Audition Day, Freshman Year, Sophomore Year, ultimately failing to convey the tedium of practice, the long hours of dedication, the added burden of schoolwork, the sacrifices de rigueur in becoming any kind of artist. Well, I guess all these annoying extroverted snots are just looking for "fame" - not art. As evidenced by the impromptu cafeteria jam which will leave you feeling dirty. Veteran cast (Charles S. Dutton, Kelsey Grammar, Bebe Neuwirth) don't have much to do except pretend to be teachers, which Grammar of course, pulls off most eloquently - everything he says sounds didactic. After claiming the school is highly coveted, we wonder at the mediocrities who were turned away when tin-eared Jenny plods insensibly through a vocal rendition of Someone To Watch Over Me like a little girl who's never been touched by either a boy or her pedophile uncle. (People clamor to get into a school that accepts people like HER?) Then pretty-like-a-girl Marco (Asher Book) gets up and sings it like he's remembering being touched by a boy or his pedophile uncle. Compare their renditions to that of Jean Louisa Kelly (and whoever performed her singing voice) in MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS - an amazing performance sung with the truest emotion of desperately needing a willy in her mouth. The annoying conceptual mistake all movies of this ilk make: "talent = fame." No. Talent simply equals talent. The vagaries of the industry denote either landing in the pathway to greatness or nibbling at the periphery. Talent helps, fershure, but is not the magic key to any door. And "holding onto your dreams" is no guarantee of success. Likewise, "letting go of your dreams" is no guarantee of failure. The Kids playfully harass one of their vocal teachers who proves her mettle at Karaoke (which, to my knowledge, proves nothing more than you're a douchebag), asking her why she didn't stick to being a vocalist. Whatever that means - remaining a starving musician, I guess. They infer that inherent talent guarantees success. Or at least fame. As long as you "hold onto your dreams." This demonstrable bull is so egregious that I let my dreams out of their titanium prison and told them if they wanted to get held so much they should seek therapy. The way the untalented character (Paul McGill) is castigated, movie is telling us that lack of talent equals futility in achieving fame. Also demonstrably untrue: Paris Hilton, The White House party-crashing Salahis, balloon boy's father, George W. Bush, Milli Vanilli, William Hung, Ed Wood, Rob Schneider, and most of the kids in this movie. Yet "hold onto your dreams" is shoved down our throats like a pedophile uncle's penis, not taking into account that Paul McGill's character was just told to let go of his dreams, being so untalented he is advised to become a teacher! Those who can't do, teach, right? But what if HE held onto his dream of being a dancer? Well, he already IS a dancer - just not a "famous" one. And fame is all that counts.Regrettably true. More people know the brainless Rush Limbaugh than the acute Stephen Jay Gould. There is more fame for the talentless winner of American Idol than for the talented writer of the song he sang. Most of us teachers and musicians and composers get tagged "wannabes" and "failed musicians" at some point in our lives if we're not famous enough for the insulter to know us outside of their jejune existence. What we are is "Failed FAMOUS Musicians" - through no one's fault (especially not ours, since - as FAME tells us - Talent=Fame, and we've always had the talent) we've failed to become well known enough for Jejune to appreciate who we are. The original 1980 theme song, Fame (performed by Irene Cara, written by Michael Gore and Dean Pitchford) conveyed what it was all about - narcissism. "Give me time, I'll make you forget the rest / Don't you know who I am? / Remember my name! / I wanna live forever..."There's nothing in this film that captures that egotism. And the urgent disco stylings of Cara's version are completely ignored, in favor of two of this film's overactors (Naturi Naughton and Collins Pennie) performing a limp hip-hop rehash as an outro fadeout. Keep searching for your fifteen minutes, kids. Appearing in this film will just make you Failed Famous Actors...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad.There. Review done. Over. That's it.Okay, okay, I guess I should say a bit more here. Well, I'm old enough to remember, and to remember having enjoyed, the older incarnation of "Fame" with the movie and TV show. It wasn't perfect but it was pretty good stuff, all about the perils of reaching for the stars while the fates are throwing hail at you.So I wondered just what they would do with the remake and how gritty it would get (my memory is a bit hazy but I'm pretty sure that when the series was on TV it was such a big hit because it wasn't all spangles and stardust).It's just terrible. The adults/teachers are very, very good (with the most memorable characters played by Kelsey Grammar, Bebe Neuwirth, Megan Mullally and Charles S. Dutton) but the kids are simply interchangeable, a bunch of stereotypes walking around in skin sacks. There's the dreamy director who wants to act to know the whole process better (and how he ever passed his audition I'll never know though, to be fair, he made me laugh a few times), the girl made to perfect her craft at the cost of everything else, the dedicated actress naive enough to think that it's just acting talent people are after, the angry young black rapper, the classical musician who produces phat beats, etc, etc.I didn't really care for any of the people I saw on screen. Time passed by too quickly to work up any concern for their particular problems in any one term and everyone had roughly the same amount of highs and lows. Bizarrely, things never really got gritty. In fact, it felt like a diluted version of the old series crossed over with a number of "big number" moments designed with the Pop Idol generation in mind (Kevin Tancharoen showing why he got the gig, perhaps). Which is just sad.Yes, there are other good points. I thought Kay Panabaker was okay, I really liked Walter Perez and Naturi Naughton and Kherington Payne can't half dance but the movie spreads these plus points amongst far too much dross. Oh, the "Carn-Evil" sequence was bright and lively, shame it was the only though.See this if you like: Fame, High School Musical, Step Up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere, someone took an awful turn and decided that the original "Fame," a seminal work, wasn't good enough and made it into an episode of "Hannah Montana." But this did confirm that dancing and singing have in fact gotten worse in 30 years. At best, 2009 has nothing new to offer. The final insult is the "we worked so hard" in the 2009 version compared to the grandeur of "I sing the body electric." And the "African" drums are just a PC waste of everyone's time. Millennial self-referential claptrap.At best it is a sad shadow of what was before. At worst it is the best the millennials have to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My best friend saw it before I did, and she thought it was amazing, so when we went to see it together, I was really looking forward to it. However, within the first half an hour, I was bored out of my skull. I had expected it to be like the original series, which according to my parents was "fab", but, it most definitely was not. There were parts which I think were meant to be funny, or scary ( SPOILER:&gt;&gt;&gt; when the boy almost jumped in front of the train) yet it all seemed like it was filled with an anti-climax. If being in the cinema audience made it seem any better, well, I'm not going to rush out to buy the DVD.

		<fullReview>The original "Fame" (the 1980 movie), really affected me at the time it appeared. The reason is, I think, is that the coming of age of young people as artists is much grander than the ordinary sexual awakening. It is driven by deeper urges, and when you see the spectrum (drama, music, dance), some of them are unfulfilled by all of us.It was extremely well made. It had fantastic songs, lots of interwoven stories with characters that we learned enough about to care (by film standards). What drove the whole enterprise was the open, free energy of these kids. Every one of them burst with connective energy, promiscuously taking risks that are noted several times in the script. The final number is one of the most rousing experiences in filmed song, this despite coming close to the then pervasive Coke "we are the world" meme.(Folds)Now this. It is equally amazing. I highly recommend it, especially if you are susceptible to the urge to connect and matter. It shares many of the same plot points, sometimes curiously morphed. It has kids, songs, dancing, performance, etc. But none of the things that worked in the original do here. It isn't a matter of a failed attempt; rather the filmmakers deliberately decided a different strategy. What happened here, is that instead of investing in the kids, who they are and what they do, the film invests in the space between the movie and us. Its the camera that has energy. Its the images themselves that have character. Its the rhythm of the thing that inserts itself. The yearning is in your desire to enter the thing. It is pretty darn amazing, not just because of the effectiveness of the cinema, but because of the clear intent to transform the energy from the sender to the contract with the receiver.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I entered the movie theater and realized that "Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel" and "Old Dogs" were being advertised before this movie began I knew I was in for a real treat.But, I haven't seen the original, so I knew I wouldn't be "tainted" by that; I'm just judging on the movie by itself here. And lemme tell you folks, it's pretty impressive.We begin with promising characters that go no where and stay one dimensional and barely learn anything about them, yet we're supposed to be moved when one of their dreams doesn't become a full reality. Wait- what? The dancing, although slightly impressive, is nothing out of the ordinary. The "best dancer" in the school is alright, but nothing that would be gasp-worthy. And yes, yes, I know she was on "So You Think You Can Dance," but did she win? No. And apparently she can't act either.None of the actors look like believable high schoolers and the school has an unlimited amount of funding (and I'm in a high school for preforming arts, so I would know.) Half of my fellow students in my drama class could out act this newcomers. Although, to their credit, they didn't have much do go on; the script is as thin as it gets.And, to make matters worse, the singing isn't very impressive either. They all had the same sort of robotic- Hannah Montana/HSM type of nasal tone that we've all heard before on Radio Disney; it's old. We came for great performances, not an even WORSE High School Musical copy pretending to be- well, "Fame". Why should I care about these characters? So far none of them seem very special to me (although the black girl, I forgot her name, now THERE'S a singer. The rest? Mediocre at best.) Where's all the edge of highschool? No drugs? No sex? Why are these kids so clean? One drinking scene, and one "almost rape" scene, which really didn't seem that scandalous at all. Wow, one "gangsta" kid, real impressive and original guys. Wasn't expecting that. And the black girl who can sing hip-hop, and the closeted depressed gay guy, and the over-the-top dramatic film kid, these aren't predictable, no sirree. Why aren't these kids in a real crisis, and why the hell is the drama teacher a counselor? This movie is choppily edited, and for some reason it goes super fast (and not in a good way.) None of the years are distinguishable from another.The absolute worst part? They cut "I Sing the Body Electric" for some crappy "believe in yourself" song. At that point I left the theater, because A) I had to pee and B) I was tired of being sold short. I didn't care anything about the characters well being, and when the gay dancing boy tried to off himself, I sincerely hoped he would succeed. And then all the kids, one by one, would jump in front of the subway to end the movie in a more interesting manner then how it began. And then the filmmaker kid would say, "And cut" and jump dramatically into the subway and die a slow death, and the "Fame" theme song (not the terrible remake, the original by Irene Cara) would play behind his demise. Now THAT'S an ending.In full? It felt like an afterschool special. A really bad one. From the 80's. The movie was going for a reaction, but with too many one-sided characters and no real emotions, I had no reaction. It was stupid bubblegum fluff advertising itself as a great dance movie, the next "Fame." Well, it wasn't "Fame" at all. It was "Shame."</fullReview>

Some of the players in the film do seem to have talent, but the characters were very blah for the most part. Gets an extra star because Charles S. Dutton is the man, no matter what role he plays.Overall, doesn't hold a candle to the original, which gives a better look at how life at a performing arts school would be.

		<fullReview>Did this remake want to be a remake? It was hard to tell. The characters were different but some of their stories were similar, the fantastic musical score of the original film was largely ignored, and the film seemed to go out of its way to cover up the fact that Performing Arts is a New York City institution. None of the kids had New York accents, the girl who played Jenny was so miscast as the Doris Vinsecker mimic she should have sprouted pigtails and been jet-packed to middle America where she obviously belonged, and the street scenes pinpointing New York as the locale for this movie were minimal. There was a shot of Webster Hall and some karaoke venue I'm not familiar with, but the bright yellow taxis and the lights of Broadway were mostly kept under wraps.Don't get me started on character development!! There was none. Did you care when the girl who gets the gig with the modern dance company dumps her brokenhearted fellow PA student boyfriend? Why should you? They only appear together in 2 scenes prior to their breakup: when he is admiring her from afar as she dances a solo and when she invites him to a dinner with her parents to annoy them. When the black girl (loosely modeled after the Coco character in the original) breaks into "Out Here on My Own," you want to laugh because she's all the opposite: the product of a domineering father and passive mother who forbid her to do anything but continue on the classical pianist career path they launched her on. She's not out there on her own; she's being double-teamed by her stuffy parents and left to suffocate in an oppressive home environment. Ditto for other characters as well. We are left to wonder about many characters' emotional states because we haven't been made privy to what led up to them.Embracing the original score (with added genres to be true to present day) might have saved this flick. Including "Out Here On My Own," erroneously crooned in the middle of the movie, and the feeble salute to its namesake at the end when "Fame" plays over the credits, didn't do it for me. The new music introduced in this film isn't remarkable or memorable, just like the film itself.I'm surprised that such talented actors as Kelsey Grammar, Debbie Allen, Bebe Neuwirth, and Megan Mullally wanted to appear in this swill of a film. And maybe they didn't, because their portrayals of the four key administrators at this school were half-hearted and lifeless. For a school overflowing with creativity, the faculty had the personalities of sponge mops.And speaking of creativity, the original film was dead on depicting the students as lovable narcissistic ego maniacs passionate about the craft they hoped to perfect. There was none of that here. The film passes through these students' four years at PA without even a hint that they've mastered their craft or matured in any way.In short, the writing was bad, the acting was worse, the direction was missing in action, the editing was in sleep mode, and the score was a snore. Go rent the original. It might be a little dated but it's one fantastic ride. When the students regale the graduation audience at the end with "The Body Electric," you are moved because you've come to care about the kids and their angst-filled four years at the High School of Performing Arts. Furthermore, you want to celebrate their triumph with them. If not, "The Body Electric" is one dynamic musical piece and worth the price of admission alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the 1980 film was not a masterpiece, with an abrupt ending, some rambling dialogue and an imbalance of development of characters, it was entertaining with great songs, spirited choreography, good performances and a story with themes that were relevant then and also are now. The 2009 Fame can be seen as a make-over and sadly it is not a good one. Kelsey Grammar and Charles S. Dutton give decent performances, the singing is quite good and tuneful and better than the material deserves and the finale is fun, but that's pretty much it. The film feels too much like a High School Musical film or something lifted from the Disney channel, which means dull lighting, sets with a overly-studio-bound look and at times awkward editing that looks like a bad music promo. Much preferred the soft-grained, grittier look of the 1980 film. The songs are not very memorable and nowhere near the standard of those from the 1980 film, which had three truly great songs while this film had no good original one and felt like various music commercials/promos cobbled together. Someone to Watch Over Me and the pre-existing classical music are fine but this criticism is more aimed for the songs written for the film. The script is all fluff and no depth, all gloss and no heart and is very shallow and scattershot structurally. The plot was little more than a throw-away in a painfully predictable way and little effort is made to show the grit and the atmosphere of being at a performing arts school that the 1980 film did brilliantly. The pacing was odd because the film did often feel too short and rushed but at the same time because of the vapidity and the stale feel of it all it was dull as well. The characters are mismatched and the film doesn't give anywhere near enough time to develop them or allow us to root for them, they're just cookie-cutter cut-outs ranging from bland to irritating. In fact the personalities are so flat they border on inter-changeable and without any distinction, maybe if there weren't as many and that the film was longer and this problem would have been halfway solved. The choreography is sometimes spirited but often lacks heart and originality, like with that Hot Lunch Jam re-creation which fell completely flat. Apart from Grammar and Dutton, the acting doesn't cut it, Megan Mullally looked medicated, Bebe Neuwirth has done a lot of stuff I've liked but she's over-bearing here and the younger cast's inexperience comes through loud and clear. To conclude, a rather lame make-over unfortunately but not without its moments. 3/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For all the pretentious critics...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It really doesn't matter how in depth you went to pretend that you were some intense movie critic, as you proved one thing with all the negativity: you don't know anything about what makes a movie a success. 1)Numbers: "Box office The film opened at No. 3 behind Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and the newly released Surrogates with approximately $10,011,682.[7] The film has grossed $22,455,510 domestically and $50,930,003 in the foreign market with an international gross of $73,385,513, making it a moderate box office success." 2)The fact that this movie hit the screen at the right time when all the annoying reality music shows are on, along with Glee on TV and the High School Musicals being in the theaters and theatres shows that knowledge of your audience is the key to success, NOT listening to, lack of success, critics telling you not to make a movie other than the way they prefer it to be. 3)Do you ever find yourself laughing at others when they are angry that a movie didn't stick to the original comic book script(Rhetorical)? Yes, I am laughing at all of these negative reviews in the same way. The truth is that it's an average movie, it isn't the original Fame movie or series and...good. That is the past and it was good, there isn't ANY point in doing the exact same movie or show, as that IS the constant annoyance that Hollywood is doing in the current. Take the time, watch the movie again without the expectations of the original movie and you might just find it tolerable. I give it a C+ to B-, which is better than average and worthy of a movie rental price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Name "Fame" Shouldn't Even Be On This Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every actor, producer, singer, writer, and dancer for this movie should have been forced to watch the original movie "Fame" and every single episode of the television show "Fame" before doing this movie. It was nothing like the original Fame! I am mad that Debbie Allen only appeared in two scenes of the movie. It would have been cool for Debbie to walk in the class when that smart mouth dancer was yelling at the teacher. Naturi was the only one in the movie who really had any talent. Charles S. Dutton did not convince me that he was a drama teacher. And his angry student tried to be the new "Leroy" in this movie. Kelsey Grammar tried to be a good music teacher, but he was no Shrosky!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American Idolization of "Fame"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was and am a major fan of the original movie and of the first few years of the TV show. My partner wanted to rent this on NETFlix and we watched it...I walked into this wanting to hate this movie...and I walked away almost completely hating this movie.There is no depth in this movie and no character development. Sure we want to see the starry-eyed youngsters get hit in the face with reality as they work their butts off on their crafts. What we got was just an "American Idol" and "So You Think You Can Dance" take on how acting/singing/dancing is...quick, easy and only about being famous.I wanted to know more about the teaching staff than I did the students (perhaps it's a generational thing) but we got more of that in the original film which was completely absent from this new version. We had one scene with the voice teacher starting to explain why she was teaching and not "performing" and I wanted to know more. Kelsey Grammar's character looked like it could've been very interesting but it never emerged.There were two good nods to the original version(s): Debbie Allen as the Principal and the Oscar-nominated "Out Here on My Own" - Ms. Naughton does an incredible performance with this beautiful song. I didn't like the version of "Fame" at the end.If you want to see a good version of this, watch the original "FAME" - as 80's as it is...it does tell the story much much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Fame"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I concede that I am not among the target demographic for "Fame," I still feel qualified to inform you that the film is a piece of crap. Its failures reach far beyond the fact that I couldn't possibly care less about students of the performing arts singing and dancing their way to the top. It's a rickety, poorly conceived and bewilderingly constructed fiasco with clichéd, interchangeable characters overcoming what are surely life's most trivial challenges ultimately to perform some bizarre, evidently uplifting Cirque du Soleil knock-off at graduation."Fame" attempts to create compelling fiction by way of reality TV. "So You Think You Can Dance?" or "American Idol," or any other prime-time talent-off currently on air bares more in common with director Kevin Tancharoen's film than whatever's playing in the adjacent theater. Appropriately then, Tancharoen comes from a music television background, having directed episodes of winners like "The Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll," "Dancelife," and something called "The JammX Kids," which IMDb informs me is also known by the title, "Can't Dance, Don't Want To."So in all fairness, Tanchaeoen may have looked on paper like the perfect candidate to direct a remake of the 1980 film of the same title. Unfortunately, he seems to have no artistic comprehension of how the mediums of film and television (let alone reality television) fundamentally differ in their approach to storytelling. He employs a fast-paced music video editing style that makes it difficult to follow what withered conventional story "Fame" has, or even to keep track of who's who or what plot or character archetype is most currently being exploited.And the film is mostly devoid of likable characters, as each of the featured students has next to no screen time to themselves, each recalling the developed protagonist of some other, better movie. There's the uptight, book-smart girl who needs to learn to embrace her spontaneity, the headstrong street-smart kid who's too macho to be artsy, the girl whose parents want her to become a classical pianist even though her proclivity is for singing, and my personal favorite, an out-of-place pretentious filmmaker with his ubiquitous camcorder recording all the break-out dance numbers that just, you know, happen in those types of schools. To top it off, the characters all fall under the sway of their universally tough love 'tell it like it is' professors.It's not fair though to hawk all of the film's problems off on Tancharoen, as Allison Burnett's screenplay is every bit as scattershot, grating, and uninvolving as the final product, and the cast, who fulfill their contractual obligations to sing, dance and occasionally speak, never go very far above or beyond that. "Fame" is just a limp noodle of a film that I couldn't possibly recommend to anyone who doesn't have a preexisting interest in the performing arts, and I have a feeling even that subset will probably be let down by its blandly talented cast and major dramatic shortcomings.When you get right down to it, there are a thousand reasons not to waste your money, or even very much more time on "Fame." From the staccato pacing to the cookie-cutter characters and complete lack of dramatic tension, the film plays not only like a remake, but a retread of ideas that have been executed better a hundred times over, making this superfluous, half-baked, intellect deficient cash-grab a one-note disaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Do You Know? It Does Live Forever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1980, "Fame" was the little movie that could. It developed an immediate cult following, made Irene Cara a star, the title tune won an Academy Award, and a short-lived television series emerged. So was it an inspired idea to redo a movie that hasn't lost its popularity over the years? Let's just say this contemporary version is redundant as a makeover, but as a stand-alone film it's unadulterated fun. It features both Cara hits ("Out Here on My Own," "Fame"), here sung by Naturi Naughton, a highly gifted performer, who is surrounded by a talented young ensemble of dancers, musicians and - duh! - actors. Besides, it's always a joy to see Bebe Neuwirth, Kelsey Grammar, and William S. Dutton strutting their stuff. But it's Will &amp; Grace's Megan Mullally who leaves you holding your breath. Her rendition of "You Took Advantage of Me" stops the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very mediocre remake of a brilliant movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Commitments is my favorite musical film from the great director Alan Parker, but Fame (1980) is on a very close second position (yes, I liked it even more than Pink Floyd: The Wall).Fame showed us the daily bustle of various young students of performing arts, exploring their minds and revealing their motivations, insecurities and personal challenges.And, besides of that, the music was fantastic, and it also portrayed the urban realities from New York in that pre-Giuliani time.In summary, Fame is one of my favorite movies from the 80's, which represents a warm but realistic examination of the "fame search".Having said all that, I have to mention that, when I knew a modern remake was planned, I did not find that as a bad idea.After all, the concept of "fame" nowadays is very different to what the concept was like 30 years ago (30 years?! Time really flies), and I thought it would be interesting to see the contemporary perspective of that chimera, as well as its new ideological, social and technological challenges.Unfortunately, the ambition from screenwriter Allison Burnett did not go that far away, and she simply repeats the formula from the original film, changing the funk by rap and becoming the intensity from the creative process into bland melodrama and a lot of clichés.I do not pretend to make more comparisons between both films; those who have seen the original film will discover parallels and references (including a mention to the excellent The Rocky Horror Picture Show) in this new version, and they will take their own conclusions out.I will simply say that Kevin Tanchaoren may have a lot of renown in the world of dance, but he shows in Fame (2009) that he still has a lot to learn as a film director.His cast selection was very irregular, because even though there is genuine talent in some members from it (Naturi Naughton and Charles S. Dutton), the rest of the actors are weak and lacking of personality.In my humble opinion, Kay Panabaker is the worst member from the cast, since she feels irritating and feigned on her role.Besides, Tanchaoren does not bring a good rhythm to the movie, so it finishes becoming easily boring.In summary, Fame (2009) is a mediocre, bland and tedious remake of a brilliant film.I do not recommend it, mainly because there is no excuse of telling on an impersonal and listless way a story which should be overflowing of emotion, enthusiasm and creative energy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creative bankruptcy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My biggest concern about Fame 2009 is the utter creative bankruptcy and lack of creativity from Hollywood directors and producers alike. Re-makes or re-issues are only showing to me that they lost the last creative bone in their body with their last surgical procedure (which was more than likely a lobotomy).I can just imagine the conversation surrounding the so-called "creative" process: Uhm ... we need to make a movie that's going to make some money. OK, what's popular at the moment? Well, Highschool musical and step-up are definites with the young market. OK, so what are we going to do? You mean, you want me to think of a new idea? Are you crazy? No ... hey, how about a re-make? When I was a teenager there were a lot of song and dance musicky stuff. How about fishing one of them out and re-doing it? If one of my students did that in their art project, they would get a VERY low mark! Fame was relevant to a specific time and context, commenting on the zeitgeist of an era in which relevant comments about art, creativity and growing up were made. It concerns me when forty-somethings try to re-live their teenage fantasies by trying to be hip and with-it to a younger generation and re-heating past films to a 21st century audience, but also the notion that I keep picking up from young people that anything older than 5 years is ancient.Good movies from the past do not have to be re-made or re-issued: they are fine as they are. Find your own voice, your own ideas and your own vision of the world: THAT is creativity! A more relevant approach could have been to determine the role of performing arts schools in the 21st century: are they relevant? Do they offer us "fame" (hey, everyone will get their 15 minutes thereof) or do they still cultivate performing arts the way they are meant to? Or has that become irrelevant? Anyway, if I wanted to watch a rehearsal highlights package of a high school musical (because this is essentially what Fame 2009 is), I wouldn't have bothered to pay entrance fee to a cinema: I would have waited till my own school's rehearsal week and made a cam cording thereof -- so much cheaper and so much more meaningful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Garbage! Don't take the kids!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have never reviewed a film before, but just felt the need to tell others not to waste their time on this film.Also, don't think that just because it has a PG rating that its a film for kids, it isn't! I took my 10 year old daughter with me, as she usually enjoys a bit of singing and dancing and she was thoroughly bored. I feel sorry for all the mums with even younger children who kept asking "is it finished yet?" The setting for the film was not pleasant, an old and dirty performing arts school set in Chicago, which including the dull characters proved nothing pleasing to the eyes.The school seemed to do nothing for its students, in the 3 years that it portrayed in 140minutes, apart from make them want to commit suicide, which one tried to do (I heard another child ask her mum "why is he trying to do that" to which the mother replied "because he was sad", its great what these films teach our children these days, its OK to jump in front of a train when you feel sad!!!!) Usually I try to look for something good in films that I have watched, but just cant think about anything that would make me recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this movie was pretty terrible, now I can see why some girls would actually like this movie somewhat though. Mainly because of the characters performances when they take the stage, which is the only positive thing going for this movie. Everything else just sucks, plain and simple. The plot is one of the worst I seen in theaters, mainly revolves around bunch of students trying to reach fame. And the students that doesn't deserve it doesn't make it and the ones that does makes it. The thing is when it comes to most of the characters, I did not care what so ever if they succeed or not, especially the one that wants to become a director, the kid is just a dreamer nothing more and was hoping he doesn't make it so he won't end up making a crappy movie like this one. I especially hated the constantly singing dude, he just seemed like a douchenozzle and a fake the girl he was with is annoying as hell and freaking stupid. So yeah the plot of this movie was just irritating to watch, only positive thing about this mess was the performance when the characters take the stage that is all.3.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The song in Fame sings " I want to live forever.." if I had to watch this movie forever I would want someone to kill me. I love movie musicals. sure, I like to have a couple of drinks during movies with music, it puts you in a more festive mood, but I really don't think it was the alcohol that made me vomit all over the living room floor during this movie. this movie is really that stinky and dumb.The original 'Fame' movie by director Alan Parker was great. that is why I was anxious to see this film of the stage version.I also thought because it was a stage musical this would have more music than the Alan Parker film, which technically really wasn't a musical, it was a film with music. I was wrong. even though this was supposed to be a musical it hardly felt like one at all. the musical numbers were all these really horrible rushed, awkwardly timed, tone deaf duds. the original movie ends with the students at graduation singing a really beautiful musical number and song called ' I Sing the Body Electric' which is based on the title of a poem by Walt Whitman. the graduation scene at the end of this movie was all flash and no joy. 'Body Electric' was replaced with a really putrid song about succeeding that made the songs on Sesame street seem like Andrew Lloyd Webber. I would have vomited some more but by that time I had already barfed so many times I had no fluids left.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remake of the neo-classic 1980's film from Alan Parker about kids attending the High School of the Performing Arts in New York City.Lets cut to the chase, its not hard to understand why this film was made, its been long enough since the original film and the end of the TV series that producers figured it was time to see if they could get a new crop of young talent and have them burst forth on the scene. At the same time it was hoped that the fond memories of what went before will translate in to cash now. Unfortunately aside from the old pro actors who play the teachers there is no reason to see this film.To start with the new group of actors brought forth to be students are a poor lot. they aren't bad, but none have the spark that will ever make them a star. Worse they aren't talented enough to make you care about what they are doing on the screen.To be fair the young actors have nothing to work with since the real culprit is the script is cliché ridden and extremely poor. The script is such that the characters don't develop. They just are. The dialog is flat and what everyone is given to say sounds far less than real. For the teachers its platitudes and slogans "The stage is no place for cowards". Its not a line of dialog its a cop out. The words of the kids seems to have been cobbled together from teen TV shows. Nothing is connected to the real world.The only time is when the music (not singing which is weak) and dance numbers happen. Only then does the movie come alive.This is a major disappointment. Its a good idea badly handled.</fullReview>

I connected with the Characters in all aspects, I thought that Debbie Allen's Performance as the Head was amazing and Megan Mullally's Performance was out of this world especially her singing, Oh and yes she is (Karen Walker from Will and Grace). All the Other Actors and Actresses were cast absolutely brilliantly and have great ability in both acting and singing where credit is due.

Over half way through the movie and it hasn't gotten to the point of the character' stories. 3/4 of the way through the movie I still had no connection to the characters and therefore didn't care what happened to them. The movie was choppy and seemed to have no plot and no real character development. The movie tried to introduce far to many student characters and the strong casting of the adult parts couldn't pull this movie out of the tedium it became.

		<fullReview>Fame! I wanna live forever! Hmmmmmm....I think i died while watching this film.I can't compare it to the original as i haven't seen it. I was around when that came out and forgot to watch it i guess, but now i don't even want to bother watching it just to compare.It was incredibly boring, predictable and clichéd.The only thing i was impressed with was the woman from Will and Grace being able to sing so well. I loved her voice. I wish it was just a movie about her and her rise to FAME. I loved her voice. Oh, and the guy who wants to make movies, at the end he's talking to himself in the camera and he has a poster of Killer Klowns from Outta Space. That's a good film.Not much was achieved in their four years at that school. Not one excelled, which would make me think twice about sending my kids to a school like PA.There were too many characters, not enough time for their roles to expand and to explain themselves.The girl Jenny, at the start she came across as timid and looked quite young so you would think she would struggle at the beginning. That whole shaking excersise where she had to release herself, the man told her not to be embarrassed. So i thought she'd be the type to come out of her shell and impress us in the end. FAIL. At the end her voice was boring, even throughout. Her character was boring and its funny how naive she was. I liked the bit when she went to that guy's trailer and thought that there was nothing wrong when he suggested they have sex as part of a scene he was rehearsing. No one is that stupid, so i laughed at her. She was stupid. Her stupid boyfriend was happy for no reason. He had a crap voice too.Victor the producer. He was stupid. Oh god, all these characters were flat. He was boring. He obv came from a lower class poor background and he fell for a girl who was from an upper class background and she found him "FUN". Yeah right, what they do? Nothing. Tho, i agree she was an OK dancer.Malik - black guy from the streets wants to be rapper/actor - YAWN. Then ends up teaming with Victor to be a producer and acts all big headed. And talks all street. And uses that girl Denise. Him and Victor both do.DENISE, she could sing and she could play piano but really her character was boring and i don't understand why they showed her dad and mum the most out of any of the other kids. So, her dad just wanted her to play piano and nothing else. What kind of dad is that? And the mum obv been beaten by the dad and finally she stands up to him in the end and he can't stand it. I can't go on, its just too boring.That gay guy, i really thought he'd be a good dancer in the end. The teacher kept showing him up and putting him down, i really thought he'd excel. So he tries to kill himself and then doesn't and becomes a dance teacher. How sad is that? He can't dance but will show kids how to dance. Good one. What the hell was that Joy girl about? Token Chinese girl? I liked the guy who made films but he wasn't amazing.Nothing was amazing at the end. None of the dances were spectacular and none of the songs were either.This film will probably be loved by little children who want to be famous when they are older and children who have just left school and want to go out into the big bad world to make a living. They might learn something from this maybe - not to be too naive. I think i just dislike naive teenagers.And OMG, Don't get me started on Kelsey Grammar because i can't really say anything about him. Throughout the film he looked like he was dying. He just looked bored.I really don't want to talk about this film anymore cos there is nothing else to say. Its just depressingly boring and clichéd and i hope none of those actors are in other films.I liked Megan Mullally singing though. She has a great voice. I hope she can have a part in another musical like Mamma Mia or Hairspray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fame: A Name That I Will Definitely Remember!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that a remake of "Fame" was coming out, I was so excited. But I also was a little bit skeptical. A classic like "Fame?" And then the negative reviews started piling up. People, you are all being very unfair. "Fame" is the best movie musical since "Hairspray."The story: A group of ambitious teens make their way into New York's High School for Performing Arts. There's Denise, Malik, Marco, Victor, Neil, Jenny, Kevin, Joy, Rose, and Alice. They all have one mission: to claim their fame and be successful. But they will have to meet all of the obstacles in order to make it big. Some will claim their fame and others won't.This "Fame" has its characters that sort of follow the formula of teen dramas, but so did the original. The students of P.A. are characters that make you feel all of the things they are going through. The 1980's original had that, and so does this version.The reason I love the 2009 edition of "Fame" is because I didn't compare it to the original. The original film had a gritty feeling that really affected you. The 2009 version creates a very entertaining and more light take on success and its obstacles. The original movie was rated R, so now we come to a brand-new PG-rated edition. But this one is not to be confused with the dreadfully annoying "High School Musical" movies.The acting in this movie is really good. Kelsey Grammar, Bebe Neuwirth, Charles S. Dutton and Megan Mullaly actually make better teachers than the original ones, despite the very good performance of Anne Meara. Along with the adults is the "Fame" alumni Debbie Allen in a cameo as the school principal. The movie opens with her classic "You got big dreams, you want fame" speech. The students are definitely memorable people. My favorite of them all is Naturi Naughton as Denise. Naughton is the next Jennifer Hudson, believe me. This girl can really belt out solos, especially in the iconic "Out Here On My Own" and the grand finale "Hold Your Dream." She has had a remarkable musical career, including playing Lil Inez on Broadway in "Hairspray" and donning the role of hip-hop star Lil Kim in last year's "Notorious." And I would love to see her do more musical roles. Other students like Collins Pennie as Malik, Asher Book as Marco, "So You Think You Can Dance" contestant Kherington Payne as Alice, and Kay Panabaker as Jenny really can act and sing too. The cast is gigantic, and they all do a very good job.The music is also a big part of the movie. Without great music to back it up, "Fame" would be nothing. Luckily, Mark Isham has created a flawless new score with brand-new songs that the original movie didn't have. And the new "Fame" cover is addicting, like the original song. The finale, "Hold Your Dream," is probably my favorite number in the movie. Consider the new "Fame" score booked on my Ipod.First time movie director Kevin Tancharaeon, who directed a concert tour for Britney Spears, films the musical numbers with a great documentary-style feel to them. I was very impressed with his work. Right on, Kevin! Wonderful choreography, fantastic music and singing, great acting, and a very good story abound in this new classic. I came out of this movie still singing the songs in my head. I could see Naturi Naughton performing "Out Here On My Own" or "Fame" on the Oscars. Hopefully, she'll get at least a nomination. This movie is only for fans of the 1980 version that go in knowing what they're in for. Avoid all the terribly underrated reviews. "Fame" is better than the "Step Up" style crap that has been coming out lately, bar none. As the theme song suggests, I will definitely remember its name.</fullReview>
