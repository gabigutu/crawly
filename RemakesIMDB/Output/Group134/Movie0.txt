		<shortDescription>The last of the 70's movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Fame' (1980) is brilliant. It's got all these qualities that made the late 70's movies so great. It is proud of its directness and not ashamed of being over the top.What really matters here, is the journey, not the destination. Ignorant idiots with soap opera mentality, will never realize that 'Fame' is about the struggles, anxieties and triumphs of these young people, not about their careers.Ironically enough, none of the very talented actors of 'Fame' made it in Hollywood. 'Fame' marked the end of an era. The end of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness. It's the last statement of a generation that had a voice of its own.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>High school. Years and decades later, some look back on it with fondness, others with embarrassment. But few find it easy to forget. It's one of the most critical phases of our lives, when changes come fast and furious whether we're ready or not. No longer children, not yet adults, irresistible forces buffet us, pushing and pulling us in every direction."Fame" did its best to capture this turbulent, chaotic period for its cast of young characters. For the most part, it succeeded. It meandered, but did feel like a slice of life. This movie holds a special place in the hearts of the Class of '80. We had just bid farewell to the sensational '70s, and soon to the end of three or four stimulating and sometimes difficult school years. We were headed out into the cold, cruel world, leaving home for college then parts unknown. As we approached our watershed event, this newly released movie was like a two-hour yearbook for us. We couldn't escape the titular song on the radio. That was us up there on the screen. Those were our friends, rivals and classmates as we had faced our own dreams, frustrations, successes and failures. Except that theirs were peppered and punctuated with lively tunes from Michael Gore.It's especially poignant for those who attended any of New York City's other elite, top-tier high schools, especially Stuyvesant, Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. Like the kids here, we were considered the best of the best. We had no auditions, but instead rigorous entrance exams. More than the Performing Arts kids, we were expected to change the world, although not necessarily become famous. Like them, not all of us made it. But the pressure cooker environment fostered extraordinary camaraderie and esprit de corps, not unlike the toe-tapping "Hot Lunch Jam" in the cafeteria. On our own graduation day, our spirits soared almost like the jubilant crescendo in the rousing finale. The film leaves us fittingly on a single, triumphant note at the end of "I Sing the Body Electric," pointing to the blindingly bright, boundless future and all the promise it held."Fame" couldn't have been set anywhere else. This story would never have worked in a small or suburban school. Los Angeles has a stronger identification with movies and television, but NYC is a mecca for all of the arts. Home not only to what was then called PA, but also world-renowned Juilliard, NYC is a cultural center unmatched by any other city in the world. "Fame" is also a time capsule of the rest of the city of the time, showing the seediness, grit and grime that was endemic of a New York still struggling back from the fiscal crisis that had nearly bankrupted it. But most of all, it showed the vitality, since muted by the inroads of Giuliani, Disney and tourism. Having it filmed in and around an actual NYC school - although not the real PA - helped give it a wonderful sense of verisimilitude.What I wouldn't give to be young again. But with "Fame," at least I can remember what it was like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good. Could have been great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A recent survey of children in the UK re-enforced the notion put forth by this film 27 years ago. That being more than anything else, young people want to grow up to be somebody famous. It used to be doctors and firemen that kids wanted to be. Now, everyone wants to be famous. Fame is a story of a group of kids accepted into the High School for Performing Arts in New York City. We seen them first audition, then take classes and learn about life for the next four years. The film has a lot of fine qualities, but ultimately leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied.Alan Parker's bold directorial style fits the story pretty well. The film has been classified as a musical, but more than anything it is a drama. Musical numbers and dance routines break out here and there, and Parker keeps them as close to realistic as they really could have been filmed. The acting is for the most part top-drawer with a few exceptions. The pacing is a little off, particularly toward the end of the film, but by that point, the story has already taken a few wrong turns anyway.First off, the auditions at the beginning of the film should have weeded a couple of the principle characters out. It seems unlikely that anyone would show up and audition for one department, then stumble their way through admissions to another. Some of these people just don't look that talented or interested to begin with. Once the first year of classes gets going, the film settles into a nice groove. The interaction between students and teachers is very well handled, and it leaves you wanting more. The film begins to lose itself later on as we see more and more of the students' lives out of school. Some of these people just aren't worth caring about.The film's biggest mistake is making the Ralph Garcy character so prominent. This guy is a boorish; self-centered jerk. A "professional a-hole" as he proudly declares on stage during his comedy routines. The audience is supposed to somehow feel for this guy and his tragic personal situation, but I was just hoping they'd throw his butt out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people you'll care about by the time this film is over. Try as I might, I still can't develop abs like Gene Anthony Ray had in this film.Overall this film is good. It is memorable, interesting, and full of daring scenes and performances. It runs maybe a little too long, and perhaps some of the wrong characters get fully developed while others kind of hover in the background. The musical numbers are great, and there is even a surprise or two waiting to be discovered by the time the film is over. Though not perfect, Fame will be a film that lives on in one way or another for many years to come.7 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fame! I'm going to live forever. I'm going to learn how to fly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVE this movie. It is way too bad they don't make movies like this any more, and that teenagers are more amazed by a bunch of trashy movies with big name actors and big time special effects, but not big time plots and characters.I'm 15 years old, a teenager in the "nothing 90's" (oh, so it's 2000 now, who gives a care?), and being a lover of musicals, 80's high school movies (The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, etc.) and those sort of things, I was recommended this by a "Fame fanatic", my aunt. I knew after the audition scenes that this was a perfect movie for me. It follows the lives of tear-jerkingly believable characters of several different backgrounds. I laughed, I cried, and I bought the soundtrack. The acting is so excellent that the first time I saw it, I'd forgotten that these were not real living, flesh people, only actors.There a some flaws, however. There are a few gaps in some of the characters, and the movie should have went on for another 30 minutes, although it was already about 2 hours and 30 minutes (which it didn't feel like). It is also outdated, and you sometimes can't help but laugh at how much it is.If you've never seen this movie, and you are a fan of musicals, arts, and realistic teenage movies, run, don't walk, to a local video store.Hopefully, Fame will truly live forever!My rating: **** (out of 5 *'s)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly hate musicals because music numbers just start out of the sudden and usually spoil scenes, but this one is completely different - it's simply brilliant. Plot perhaps isn't any challenge for the viewers, but the simplicity of people life stories makes this movie great.I've seen it at least dozen times and still I'm not tired with the plot, characters or music (I just love the soundtrack - it's the only soundtrack that I've really wanted to have and most probably will remain the only one that I owe).For me it's a must-seen kind of movie, great characters compiled with entertaining songs and a lot of things to think about after the movie end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story about potential.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie showcases a LOT of incredible talent. Fantastic performances throughout. The movie also is a great story about potential and how people use, abuse or ignore it in themselves. This is a story about students who look like they are all headed for fame and fortune. It shows the pitfalls along the way. We learn that talent is not enough. We also learn that many fall short and give up along the way. As an adult who was a teenager back when this movie first came out, it is a very bittersweet look at potential in us all and has us examine what we did with it in our lives, are we where we thought we would be? Yes, this movie is dated, it is over 20 years old, it HAS to be in some regard. But the story is timeless and will rank among classics of teenage movies and also always have a warm spot in the hearts of adults who grew up in the era. Highly recommended. Would make a great double feature with "Gold Diggers of 1933" just to show contrast and to see how Broadway has changed over the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Game Of Fame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alan Parker's 'Fame' beautifully showcases college-life of eight aspiring artistes. Many seem to have a problem with the open ending and ponder on questions like what happened to Coco after the porn shoot or what happened to Ralph and Doris etc. However, I think this works well as it points to the uncertainty of their future as that's how life is. The point was to show their struggles during the college years and Parker captures that very well making it easy for the viewers to relate to and bringing a nostalgic feel.'Fame' starts with some audition scenes which are hilarious. Then it shows which candidates are selected and that's when the story starts. Though it is labelled a musical drama, it doesn't follow the traditional musical genre. The songs do not appear out of nowhere. They are well situated within the context of the film and quite nice to listen to. 'Fame' also has that wild 70's feel. If this movie is the last of the 70s then it 'rounds' up the decade well.The actors, most of them in their 20s, do a fine job. There are those who are shy, naive and afraid, those who are wacky, wild and a little reckless and those who put a front but all these characters are striving for their dream which is to become an artiste. The actors brilliantly demonstrate this. I particularly liked Barry Miller, Paul McCrane and Maureen Teefy who play the three close friends and Irene Cara who as the vulnerable singer Coco.I had heard a lot about 'Fame' but I was under the impression that it would be a flimsy musical. I got a chance to watch it last night and I was certainly under the wrong impression. Even though many won't appreciate it, To me it is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It builds up--and then insults--its own characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fame", about teenage kids in Manhattan's School for the Performing Arts, looks right, feels right, and it sometimes sounds right--but too soon the film becomes a muddled soap opera about talented children reaching too far for their stars. The large cast does good work, and director Alan Parker has alert eyes, but sharper editing might have left some of Parker's pretensions out of the mix. After one student admits to being homosexual (not just once, to a girl student, but twice, to his entire class and teacher), he is seen in tight close-up putting on lipstick; this is done for a sniggering effect, which is stupefying once you realize the ENTIRE CLASS is dolled-up to look like characters from "Rocky Horror". The gay kid, bullied by the class loudmouth, isn't the only one we see humiliated. This manufactured slapping-down is then used several more times, against the promising disco queen, the wealthy white ballerina, the talkative dancer, the stand-up comedian, and the illiterate who may not graduate because of his failing grades. It's a big, smelly cart full of aged clichés. If people respond, it's due to the cinematography (which captures some of New York's squalor and dusty classrooms with a bracing realism), the propulsive soundtrack, and the cynical-funny talk. The characters are quite a different matter; probably resembling no real student at the actual school, they are plot-mechanisms, their pitfalls punctuated by a director who can almost be heard saying, "Look! See!" ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too obnoxious to care about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the traditional cinema musical, generally based upon a successful Broadway show, went into something of a decline in the late seventies and eighties, this period saw the rise of a new musical genre based around dance and pop music. Like "Saturday Night Fever" and its sequel "Staying Alive", "Flashdance", "Grease" and "Dirty Dancing", "Fame" is an example of this trend. The original title for the film was, apparently, to have been "Hot Lunch ", but this had to be changed when director Alan Parker realised that there was already a pornographic film with the same title. The change was doubtless one for the better; I cannot really imagine Irene Cara singing "Hot Lunch! I'm Gonna Live Forever!"The film follows a group of students through their studies at the New York High School of Performing Arts, which was a real institution at the time. It is split into sections entitled "Auditions", "Freshman Year", "Sophomore Year", "Junior Year" and "Senior Year", and hence takes place over a time-span of some four years. The opening scenes have something of the feel of a "fly on the wall" documentary about them, As the film progresses we get to know the various students and something of their stories. New York, of course, is a famously multi-ethnic city, and the film-makers were obviously keen to reflect this racial diversity by including at least one representative of most of the city's various ethnic groups (Jewish, Hispanic, Italian, Black, Irish and WASP). Dance student Leroy Johnson struggles with his academic work, which at this school is given equal weighting with performance, because he is illiterate. Lisa Monroe, another dance student, is dismissed from the course for not working hard enough, and switches to the drama department. Montgomery MacNeil, a drama student, comes out as gay, probably a more daring plot-line in 1980 than it would be today, when it is virtually compulsory for every high school drama to have a token gay character. I wondered if his Christian name was a reference to the gay film star Montgomery Clift. Raul Garcia, an aspiring stand-up comic, prefers to be called Ralph Garcey in order to hide his Puerto Rican background. His great ambition is to be the next Freddie Prinze- not the future Mr. Sarah Michelle Gellar, who would only have been four years old in 1980, but his father Freddie senior, another Puerto Rican comedian who died in 1977. Unfortunately Ralph seems to feel that the best way of achieving this ambition is to ape Prinze's self-destructive lifestyle. "Fame" was clearly popular in the early eighties, spawning a television series and a stage musical. That irritatingly catchy theme song provided Cara with a huge chart hit. The basic concept is obviously still thought to be a viable one, because there has been a recent remake (which I have not seen). Yet like many of the musicals of this period, although not perhaps as much as the likes of "Saturday Night Fever", the original film seems rather dated today. (The one which seems to have held up the best is "Grease", probably because that was always intended as a defiantly deliberate anachronism, being twenty years behind the times even when it is made). The song-and-dance numbers are lively enough, even if the music is not always to my personal taste. Yet there are other reasons, quite apart from its old-fashioned feel, why "Fame" is not my favourite film. One is that, despite the film's apparent aim of celebrating New York's ethnic diversity, too many characters are seen in terms of ethnic stereotypes. (African-Americans are bolshie with a bad attitude, Hispanics ditto, Jewish mothers are domineering and over-protective, etc.)Another reason I didn't like the film much is that too many of the characters are just too obnoxious to care about. I would agree with the reviewer who found Ralph a "boorish self-centred jerk" but unlike that reviewer I found several of the other characters equally unpleasant. I could not sympathise with the bad-tempered, petulant Leroy and his frequent outbursts of rage, mostly directed at his long-suffering English teacher. Nor with Ralph's girlfriend Doris Finsecker, as keen to deny her Jewish identity as he is to deny his Hispanic one. (She renames herself "Dominique DuPont", largely because she knows this will annoy her mother). Nor with the bone-idle Lisa. Irene Cara's character Coco Hernandez is difficult to sympathise with for another reason; not because she is a jerk but because she seems too naive to be true. She is taken advantage of by a man posing as a film director who offers her a "screen test"; she turns up at his apartment even though he is played as an obviously sleazy sexual predator. (Had he seemed more plausible this plot line would have had more credibility). Montgomery is one of the film's few likable characters, but the film does not concentrate on his story to any great extent. He largely functions as the school's kindly agony uncle, a shoulder for his heterosexual classmates to cry on. My final complaint about the film is that there are too many main characters. Even the film's two and a half hour running time is inadequate to do justice to all these stories, some of which could have provided enough material for a whole film in their own right, and few of them are fully developed. Alan Parker has made some excellent films, including "Mississippi Burning" and "Evita", but "Fame" is not really one of them. It is perhaps ironic for a film with this particular title that few of its stars, except Cara, went on to achieve any great fame of their own. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seeking a Spot in the Show Business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, a group of freshmen join the High School for the Performing Arts after being well succeeded in their audition. For four years, their dreams, deceptions, success, love and personal dramas are disclosed though the insecure Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy), the homosexual Montgomery (Payl McCrane), the aggressive Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray), the hopeful Coco (Irene Cara), the ambitious Ralph Garci (Barry Miller) and their friends until their graduation day.Twenty-eight years ago, "Fame" was a great success, with the story of teenagers seeking a spot in the show business, and I loved this movie and the soundtrack on CD. I have just watched "Fame" on DVD, and presently I would say that it is a good movie with a great potential only, but with too many flawed subplots. The story follows too many characters and leaves many situations without answer. I do not know whether Alan Parker had edition problems to reduce the running time of this movie, but what happened, for example, with the ballerina that goes to a clinic for abortion? What happened with Leroy and his teacher, did he fail due to his grammar problem? What happened with Coco after undressing her blouse in the apartment of that crook? The musician that plays synthesizer and his proud father are left behind in the subplot. Anyway, "Fame" is still a delightful entertainment and a cult-movie for me. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Fama" ("Fame")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you believe this movie was made over 20 years ago? It still hasn't lost its punch 20 years later.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its amazing after 20 years this movie still hasn't lost none of its punch and its too bad that they don't make movies like this anymore. I remember when this movie came out. I was 14 years old and I thought it was going to be another one of those idiotic teen comedies and so forth. Boy, was I dead wrong. This movie had a lot to go for it especially during a decade where a lot of high school movies of the 80's consisted of "The Breakfast Club", "Sixteen Candles","Pretty In Pink","Fast Times At Ridgemont High", "The Last American Virgin" and so forth. Fame consisted of eight talented teenagers all hotly pursing their dreams at the prestigious New York's High School Of The Performing Arts. Its a stunning combination of drama and pathos,but in the same level it's an explosion of pulsating song and electrifying dance numbers that made this one of the most memorable movie musicals of the 1980's. Director Alan Parker(of Midnight Express,Mississippi Burning,and others)brings to the screen a profusion of fresh young talent in front of the camera and behind it(like choreographer Louis Falco and composer Micheal Gore who won Oscars for the film's dynamic score and the title song he co-wrote with lyricist Dean Pitchford). The action here is very intense as it spills all over the Big Apple from the shadows of 42nd Street to the bright lights of the great white way and not to mention the sequences around Times Square. As for the characters who were then unknowns at the time it was a stark reality check as it follows the lives of several individuals from different backgrounds. Some of them made it while the others were just getting by and the rest knew the getting their fame would cost them the ultimate price. However,there are some gaps in some of the characters but after seeing it again it makes you wonder after 20 years that this film still has the emotional pull and from there it never lets go. The soundtrack to this movie is still great even after 20 years later. If you have never seen this movie brace yourself for some roof raising pleasure cause from the beginning its one helluva ride. Make sure that you get the director's version which contains additional scenes that were cut from the original print. NOTE: "Fame" also brought some unknown talent like choreographer/dancer Gene Anthony Ray,and also singer/ songwriter Irene Cara(who would got on to become one of the biggest R&amp;B/Pop singers of the decade--the Mariah Carey of her generation)and also two years later would become a subsequent TV series that would showcased the talents of Ray and other original cast members including Debbie Allen(which ran for five seasons ending its run in 1986). As for movie itself,its worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evocative and atmospheric musical drama (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spawning a long-running TV series and more recently a hit musical, "Fame" is an atmospheric musical drama, heavily evocative of the era in which it was made, and this contributes largely to it's appeal when the film is viewed today.The story follows a class of students as they undergo four years together at the New York High School of Performing Arts. The cast of characters includes wayward, illiterate black dancer Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray); insecure Jewish girl Doris (Maureen Teefy); closet homosexual Montogomery (Paul McCrane); frustrated musician Bruno (Lee Curreri) and Ralph (Barry Miller), a conflicted Puerto Rican with a tragic family background.Throughout the film we trace the characters' ascension from the first auditions, the Freshman year right through to graduation. It is fair to say, though, that the story is not the film's greatest strength. Quite a few plotlines are left dangling before we cut to the big finale. But the message gets through that disappointment, exploitation and probable failure are what await most of these aspiring young artistes. In spite of this very serious message, the film loses none of it's youthful exuberance.This is largely down to the enthusiasm and energy of some very-well cast performers. Paul McCrane is a hit as the sensitive Montogomery and he hits it off especially well with Maureen Teefy's Doris. Barry Miller is good as Ralph Garci, who nearly suffers the fate of his idol Freddie Prinze. The older players are also well represented, with Albert Hague scoring quite a few laughs as music teacher Shorofsky.Technically the cinematography is also very good for this film. It is very well shot and lit throughout. Alot of the younger characters are bathed in a very soft light that enhances their essential innocence and sensitivity.It is the music, alot of it intercut with the action, which truly puts this film in a class of its own. The now legendary scene with the kids dancing on top of the traffic to the tune of "Fame" is an especially enjoyable highlight. But also of note is Irene Cara's quieter ballad "Out Here On My Own" and the final rousing send-off "I Sing The Body Electric".These virtues lift the film above its incoherent plot, making it a lively and memorable tribute to the energy and the dreams of youth. Great fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tells the story of nine ambitious teens trying to follow their dream at the infamous New York High School For Performing Arts: Coco, the singer, Bruno, the modern Mozart, Lisa, Leroy, and Hilary, the struggling dancers, Ralph, the comedian, and Doris and Montgomery, the actors. While they all think they have what it takes to really reach their goals, they are going to need a lot more than just their talent. They will have to deal with rejection, heartbreak, education, pain, and love in order to achieve their fame."Fame" is one of the most entertaining, classic, and inspirational movies of all time. It has everything a teen drama/musical should have: extremely catchy, entertaining, Oscar-winning songs performed by the amazing Irene Cara, stunning dance numbers, a very attractive cast that makes you believe in the characters, and a great story, including the heartbreaking scene when Coco meets the video camera.Like I said, the cast is awesome. Irene Cara can really act, and it's not only her singing that makes her shine here as Coco. Lee Curreri is very good as Bruno. Barry Miller brings a lot of humor to Ralph. Maureen Teefy is great as the outcast Doris, and look closely, and you'll see Paul McCrane of "ER" as Montgomery.This is truly an amazing film. "Fame" really touched me and inspired me to keep following my dreams as an actor and singer. Any movie that moves me this much is a winner in my book. A must-see! The film really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer.</fullReview>

The pace creep-ed along like an old man. There were many moments that the film never came back to like Coco stripping. What happened to her? How about Garci's sister? Is she better now? What about Leroy? We learned absolutely nothing about him. What about the electronic piano guy? How about the rich girl that got an abortion? What happened to her?

		<shortDescription>vocal major, 2005.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually just graduated from LaGuardia HS, the HS that "Fame" was based on as a vocal major (2005). People do not know what LaGuardia HS is until I mention that it's the "Fame" school. In my four years of being a student there, I did not watch "Fame". In fact, I just saw it 4 days ago. There are two teachers from the movie that currently teach at LaGuardia, Penny Frank and Jim Moody.There were some things that did not connect, obviously. For instance, you would never do pointe freshman year. It captured the student's spirits very well, however we never broke into song and dance during lunch, we were too busy eating!! Some people will have their instruments and jam a bit in the lunchroom or senior lounge. In between breaks, the dance majors are still in their leotards grabbing lunch. Music majors have blackout days, where they come into school directly into the concert hall and not class and rehearse all day. What I do miss about the school is seeing people cut class to hang out in the hallway and work on their harmonies. Figuring out math problems while down the hall, a class would be studying their new Italian aria.I did not feel as if the movie was amazing. In terms of capturing the spirit of the students, it was incredible. The struggles that all the students went through was definitely a reality. There were many things left out in the movie, especially the endings of various situations between the students.I miss LaGuardia though. Never will I go to a school like that with people as interesting. I'm in college now and haven't really found people interesting enough to stimulate my mind. I am proud to be a graduate of the Fame school, for it was the best four years of my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prepare for 80's nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only watched this movie because I wanted to see it before I'm going to watch the new version.'Fame' is from the early eighties and one can clearly see and hear the stereotypical eighties' fashion style and music style. This gives me a somewhat nostalgic feeling of that period.The movie follows some students as they strive to become successful performing artists. They all go to school in New York and they all have so many hopes for their future.You really get to feel the eighties' spirit when you watch this movie and the movie has probably been spectacular at the time it premiered but I think that the eighties are very weird and entertaining. This movie is a classic of its time and I'm now looking forward to seeing the new up-to-date version of this same story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if I would class this as a musical, but it is certainly a teen drama with some songs and performances in it that I wanted to try, from BAFTA nominated director Alan Parker (Bugsy Malone, Midnight Express, Mississippi Burning). Basically the story is set at New York High School for the Performing Arts, where the newest students are training to achieve their goals to become great singers, actors and performers. The four students that the film mainly follows are black wannabe starlet Coco Hernandez (Golden Globe nominated Irene Cara), shy and less than confident Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy), gay and sensitive Montgomery MacNeil (Paul McCrane), and the often aggressive Raul Garcia (Barry Miller). The film follows their journey from auditioning to be in the school, singing and dancing rehearsals, personal downfalls in their bid to get somewhere, including Coco unintentionally going into pornography, and of course graduation with the whole gang performing on stage. Also starring Eddie Barth as Angelo, Lee Curreri as Bruno, Laura Dean as Lisa Monroe, Antonia Franceschi as Hilary Van Doren, Boyd Gaines as Michael and Gene Anthony Ray as Leroy. I mainly heard about the film first because of the title song "Fame" going to number one in the UK, and then again when Justin Lee Collins tried to get Irena Cera on board for the Bring Back... Fame reunion, which she refused. I will be honest in saying that I wasn't completely interested in the story, more the singing and dancing, but even that didn't stop me thinking this wasn't really my cup of tea, but it certainly wasn't bad. It won the Oscar for Best Music for Michael Gore and Best Song for the title song (it also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Song for "Out Here on My Own", Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music and Best Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy and Best Original Score. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I will always love FAME</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your looking for a movie with fantastic music, nice cast and a storyline that is not to difficult to understand; FAME is for you.I have several scenes that i love in this movie; some make you laugh, others make you contemplative. The editing i think is wonderful, really fast and often funny. Shure, maybe there would have been some more potential in the whole thing, all the story's stay somehow on the surface; maybe a bit too many characters are involved.But I don't care, because the real stars are......the musical scenes! One of my favorites: the hot-lunch-jam sequence. That piece is just so raw, funky and filmed in a special way (handcamera-style in "music-hell-breaking-loose"), its just electrifying! I miss this raw energy in todays music-clips; the only similar energy I found perhaps in Bette Midlers "the rose", all of the concert footage.Its about capturing something "wild" that is "realy" happening, and not doing it just perfect; take by take.So, FAME is a wonderful nostalgia-trip to when synthesizers where heavy and walk-mans not available.I recommend it once a year; sure not for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fame" is a very well done portrait of the students who inhabit New York City's High School of the Arts. The film focuses on a group of students who dream of making it big while they perfect their craft at the now famous school. Director Alan Parker allows each of the highlighted students to mature on screen, allowing you to feel a connection with each one. The music here is infectious and fun. The dancing is exciting and fresh. The film eventually became the basis for an Emmy-winning television series starring Debbie Allen and some of the other actors from the film. One of the more enjoyable "dance" films of the 1980's. Received Oscars for music. 8/10</fullReview>

This film excites me every time I watch it on a cable channel or on DVD.Here's hoping a special public screening will be held to mark the 25th anniversary of Fame's original release.Since the movie's 1980 release, a number of events have taken place: the High School of Music &amp; Art and High School of Performing Arts have merged and become the Fiorello LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts. Also, one of the players in this movie pursued a career in fashion design today. His name: Isaac Mizrahi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was well done but it also made me feel very down at times as well. For anyone that is considering show business this is a must see as it shows the raw deal in what goes on for these struggling workers. The soundtrack was definitely cool and the acting and dancing complimented it nicely. Some of the student's attitudes might have been a little far-fetched like Leroy's especially because I'm sure someone like that would've been kicked out immediately for refusing to read and such if this was the real High School For Performing Arts. The Coco screen test is hard to watch for any people out there with weak stomachs, please heed my warning. While it's very gritty I know it's the truth on what happens so in this respect the movie is right on. Overall it's entertaining and even though some parts drag on the majority goes by really quickly.Final Grouping:Movies: Probably would've skipped this one.DVD Purchase: Not something I'd need to see again and again.Rental: Worth renting at least once in your life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These days, it's sad to see FAME (1980) reduced to being nothing more than a footnote and a regular request at retro disco's in the UK. Hen nights are nothing without it. The title song from the film like a number of records played as a soundtrack to adverts, finally made it to Number One in the UK two years after it was recorded.A recent TV programme in the UK examined the whereabouts of the TV cast of FAME and it is on this that I decided to take a brief look back at the film that inspired it.Like SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER and FOOTLOOSE, FAME does make an effort to make a musical real and the sheer energy of the piece as we watch potential stars develop at the New York High School for the Performing Arts still prevails today.Highlights - HOT LUNCH JAM, the street party as Bruno's demo for FAME is blurted out through a ghettoblaster by his father, the ROCKY HORROR sequence, Coco's performance of OUT HERE ON MY OWN.One of Alan Parker's best</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Remember my name.' was the tagline for this movie - but there are not a lot of people in it whose names you'll remember. Such are the quirks of fame.and of *Fame*. The movie and its Oscar-winning eternally-80s title song were a huge hit at the time, spawning a hit TV show and stage show. Irene Cara was a household name - for about five minutes - and never again realized her full potential. But with *Saturday Night Fever*, *Xanadu* and *Flashdance* as evidence, it was clearly an easier time to pull off a musical. *Fame* is a fictionalized but not-entirely-glamourized look at the High School for Performing Arts in New York, we follow the lives of a group of students, each with the burning desire to succeed in their chosen art. From audition day to graduation day, we watch the personal and professional dramas of these actors, dancers, singers, musicians as they struggle to make their way through life while pursuing their dreams - though perhaps director Parker's film *The Commitments* portrays the struggle a little more accurately. Having also made *Bugsy Malone* and *The Wall*, Parker is obviously partial, not only to musicals, but youthful angst. There's Coco, Bruno, Ralph, Montgomery, Doris and Leroy - some charming, some irritating - but just like people we actually went to school with. The score is by the brother-and-sister team of Michael Gore (music) and Lesley Gore (lyrics.yes, *the* Lesley Gore of *It's My Party* and *You Don't Own Me* fame), and it's what makes this story come alive. And it definitely *does* come alive. In addition to the title track, the raucous *Red Light* and the wonderfully gooey *Out Here On My Own* all make this a joyful experience. The fabulous *I Sing The Body Electric* number at graduation makes us swell with joy, and we're as deeply proud as if they were our own relatives.or ourselves. As with all musicals, many scenes require a complete suspension of belief, but once suspended, it's as easy to swallow as ice cream (you mean, they *didn't* really dance on top of taxi cabs in Times Square?!). `Fame! I want to live forever! I want to learn how to fly!' Yeah.I did too. Back then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let us get the negative out of the way. Fame is full of stereotypes from the too sensitive and fragiled ego homosexual, to the jewish drama queen, to the brown skin latino who seems to prefer caucasions, to the inner city thug who speaks with bad grammar and has anger management issues. Even considering all of this, Fame is a treat to watch. I t has two elements which I think draw me to it. It has the vibrant atmosphere of a high school in which people learn and it has the meshing of various different cultures coming together. This movie was the "real world" before mtv put on it's show and it was "Survivor" before that took off. While certain scenes are reminiscent of "Lean on Me", "Bring It" or other High School fare, it has memorable scenes which stand the test of time. I came away with the idea that there is very little substitute for pure talent and there is no monopoly for the various talents among race or social class. Another conclusion is that despite setbacks, hard breaks and even poor decisions, the key half a dozen protagonist show how they could bounce back.</fullReview>

It took me a month to look everywhere for information, but 22 years is a long time for a movie, especially regarding the fact there was no Internet at that time. And yesterday, completely accidentally I've found it.I was just trembling when I was reading the comments on it, and I was very excited.

		<fullReview>Though the film, at first glance, is terribly dated by today's standards, is still worth watching. It shows that not everyone with talent will make it big and achieve fame. Many terrific characters dedicated to their dreams are intorduced here, from Coco, the gifted dancer/singer; Bruno, the talented but introverted keyboardest; to best friends Doris, Ralph and Montgomery (played by Paul McCrane, now Rocket Romano on ER), they are all extremely well-drawn characters who the audience can relate to.The music of course, is fabulous, from the famous title tune to showstopper "I Sing The Body Electric", poignant "Out Here On My Own" and beautiful "Dogs in the Yard", the latter sung by Paul McCrane. The only real beef I had was how the movie stopped so suddenly and did not resolve the loose ends among the characters. But don't let that stop you from watching Fame, the first definitive musical movie of the 1980s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little dated but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it's somewhat dated, Alan Parker's "Fame" has more heart and soul than most teen-oriented films of the 90's. The film, which later spawned a tv-series (which had a fresh cast ev'ry season) and a Broadway musical, follows a diverse group of teens over the course of four years at New York's High School for the Performing Arts. The opening audition scenes have their share of laughs (the woman who re-enacts "The Towering Inferno"; the guy who recites the female lines in "Romeo &amp; Juliet".) As the film progresses, and as we get more into the lives of Montgomery, Ralph, Coco, Doris, and Leroy, we share a fair amount of their joy and pain. The range of emotions here is more believable than the artificial worlds of recent Hollywood teen films.Of course, the movie is remembered more for it's music than anything else (evidenced by it's Oscar recognition.) "Hot Lunch", which unfolds as a timid Doris looks for a place to eat, is an uncanny classic. Likewise with "I Sing The Body Electric", which closes the film. And while on the subject of music, I must mention the character of Bruno; his world of synthesizers and electronic instrumentation was, as the music teacher put it, "musical masturbation" at the time, but would be commonplace in this decade.It may not be a classic, it may not be an epic, but it's worth seeing, especially to see Paul McCrane (now Rocket Romano on "ER") in his younger days.</fullReview>

I love it :)The music really does it for me, I went out and bought the soundtrack, I had the song "I Sing the Body Electric" in my head for days, then once I heard "Red Light" and "Out Here On My Own" on LP, I was hooked.The story is also great too, a group of young aspiring stars going through the ups and downs at the Performing Arts school. All with their own stories, strengths and weaknesses.Of course the music is incomplete on-screen without the dancing, and in Fame it adds to it greatly.This is one movie that I never miss when its on cable, I suggest you check it out if you haven't.Don't bag Fame on the merits of the TV show, this movie is the true "Fame", in my eyes, and it is done a disservice to a degree by the bad rep of the TV show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, it's rather ironic, but I was a featured extra in this film, and it was the highest point of my limited childhood film career."Fame" has become remembered more for the mediocre T.V. series than for the impressive film that started it all. It is a reasonably honest, if a little fanciful, look at growing up with stars in your eyes. It is filled with solid performances, interesting insights, and some great music and dance sequences. It's funny, touching, and dramatic, and ends with a bang.If only the arts could really be this exciting...If you haven't seen this movie, by all means, rent it. While it maybe a tad cutesy at some points, it also has teeth, and gives a view of the arts that isn't always rosey (and rightly so). If you haven't seen it in awhile, drop in on the characters once again. It still has the power to lift, even nearly 20 years later. "I sing the body electric..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this the ugliest cast in a movie, or what? Kitchen sink glamour. (Jack Warner referred to "Asphalt Jungle" as "that movie with ugly people". What the hell would he call "Fame" then?) Nothing is prettified here, and I suspect Parker actually wanted ugly youths for this thing. I can just see Parker leading the auditions: "You're ugly. Yeah, you're in." He did a similar kind of thing for "The Commitments", another movie I'd only watch for free. There are fortunately only a couple of musical numbers, so this isn't really a musical. It seems that every time a musical number starts the kids got a cue from Parker: "Okay, now...! Roll the music... And... Start acting stupid, everyone!" And they would. Kids acting stupid is what a lot of later-day musicals are all about, including the annoying hippie-trash "Hair". Hair Schmair. How does one shoot a musical? You get a bunch of dancers and tell them to act stupid during the musical numbers. It's really as simply as that. Choreography Shmography. "Fame" is almost never boring, and this is its strongest point. It's over two hours long, and somehow the disjointedness of the whole affair and the numerous sub-plots make it quite watchable, making one forgive and forget the cheesy and kitschy 80s feel of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fame: 2/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fame did something odd. It was not only a musical that was created originally for the screen (most are based off of Broadway musicals), but it spawned a TV series and a Broadway musical. Let me correct that sentence. Fame is not a musical. Musicals have song numbers in order to advance the plot or to show characters' feelings. The singing in this music is not used to do either; in fact, there's no use for it at all. People just randomly sing to fit in with the plot. And that's not the type of musical I know.The so-called plot of Fame has an onslaught of characters (who are all introduced at once-last time I saw that in a movie [Gosford Park] it had disastrous results) who audition for, and get into, New York High School for the Performing Arts. All of them are in for different reasons-i.e. acting, singing, etc. Quote-unquote drama unfolds as these middle-aged people pretending to be teenagers go through their four years.My largest complaint is that the high school is supposed to be selective. After all, it's a free college, and they can't let everyone in. So how is it that some people who are really bad get into the college? Obviously so that drama could ensue between all of these different people. And why is the person top billed not even in the movie until near the end, for no reason at all, except to make us feel uncomfortable? There's many unsettling situations that these untalented people get into, yet you can't feel bad for them because you don't know who they are! These relationships occur between people whose names you don't know. And these characters realize things about themselves throughout the course of the movie, yet you don't realize that, because you don't know what they were like in the first place.As for the singing, it pops in randomly (and is supposed to be humorous?) and does nothing. When the title song is sung, it's played in the middle of a street and before you can say Ferris Bueller everyone's in the middle of the street dancing wildly and off-beat to it. The song itself is fine, but the whole scene, like the whole movie, is unnecessary. Fame is an unpleasant movie, to say the least. I would say more, but most of the movie has thankfully gone out of my head. Just don't see it. You'll be doing yourself a favor.My rating: 2/10Rated R for language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT songs but has serious problems in drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film follows a bunch of students in the NYC High School of the Performing Arts. There's Coco (Irene Cara) a black singer who WILL make it to the top despite everything. She's helped by Bruno (Lee Curren) a white musician. Then there's Doris (Maureen Teefy) who wants to be an actress--but she's shy and scared. She becomes friends with Motgomery (Paul McCrane)--purportedly the only gay student in the school and is romanced by Raul (Barry Miller). Then there's Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray--who sadly died in 2003) who's homeless and a great dancer--but can't read. Then there's various teachers (Albert Hague, Anne Meara stand out) trying to teach the kids.The songs are GREAT (the title tune and "Out Here On My Own" were nominated for Best Song--"Fame" won), the dances are energetic and the young cast shows plenty of ambition and talent. BUT this film misses the boat in the drama department. Many plot lines are brought up and completely left open-ended by the end of the movie. Why did Coco do a porno? Did Doris and Raul remain together afterwords? Did either make it? How about Montgomery--what happened to him? And did Leroy ever graduate--and how? There are too many long speeches (Raul has two) and moments that just lead to nothing. I'm assuming there were cuts in the script--I can't believe the movie just left all this open. Still, it's worth seeing for the acting and, again, the music. There's basically not one bad song and the dances go full force (and at one point stop traffic--literally!). My favorites are "Fame", "Out Here..." and "I Sing the Body Electric" which is a great closing song. So I recommend it but can only give it a 7--the script really needed to tie up loose ends--and it didn't.Trivia: They wanted to shot this film at the actual School for Performing Arts but couldn't get permission. The dean of the school read the script and said there was way too much swearing in the film. That is true--there is a LOT of foul language but that's how high school kids talk. Avoid the TV version which abysmally overdubs it.</fullReview>

Well they leave a LOT unresolved. For example, we don't know whether or not Doris and Ralph get back together. Also some other plot points are left unresolved.I think this is what makes it an 8 rather than a 9.I don't normally like these kind of films, but something about Fame sets it apart from the other Late 70's-Early 80's musicals.Overall it's a fun film with great songs, but a sh*tty ending.

		<shortDescription>Is this really a musical?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie breaks down a lot of the expectations that most audiences have in regards to musicals. However, this movie is still very clearly a musical through and through.One of the biggest expectations audiences have going into a musical is that the characters will frequently just start singing and dancing for no reason. Parker decided to take a different route on how he presented the song and dance numbers. The movie revolves around a group of high school students as they progress through their four years of school at a performing arts high school. Since nearly every character in the story is a singer or dancer, it makes sense for them to sing and/or dance every once in a while. And since I'm sure every one of you knows at least one person that's involved in the arts somehow, I'm also sure you know that it's not completely out of character for these people to randomly start singing and dancing. The characters in "Fame" hold true to this personality trait. Whenever the characters start randomly singing and/or dancing throughout the movie, it may be "weird" according to societal norms, but for actual performers, it's something that could and often does actually happen in real life."Fame" also challenges the purpose of songs in the musicals. Normally, songs in musicals either are vital in progressing the plot or are simply for entertainment. The music in "Fame" does neither of these things. While the songs are vital to the plot, it is not in the conventional sense. Most of the songs in the movie are sung by musicians as they are auditioning, practicing, or performing, rather than simply being a tool to move the plot along. If someone were to take all the songs out of the movie the plot would not make as much sense, because without them the characters singing them would have to be removed from the script. Another thing that is expected out of most musicals is the big production number at the end of the musical that either ties all of the loose ends of the story up or celebrates everyone's good fortune. "Fame" still has a production number, but it fulfills neither of the expected uses. This production number takes place at the students' graduation. It serves as the final chance for both the audience within the movie and those of us watching the movie itself to see all of the characters perform before they go off into the "real world." None of the characters' story lines end with a sense of finality. No one is shown getting a professional job, or an agent, or even a relationship. The characters graduate and that's the end of it. For most audiences, they are expecting the final number to tie up loose ends. Sadly, these people will be left hanging.Even though "Fame" is definitely very unconventional in it's delivery, it is still very strongly a musical. The songs are still very vital to the storyline even though they aren't quite delivered how you would expect. In my opinion, it does a great job at trying to reach to both musical loving audiences and non-musical loving audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think some movies age better than others. I don't think this film aged well. It was made back in 1980 but looked to me like it was made earlier in 1970-which stands against it-I think it was a throwback to an earlier type of film for 1980 that was surprisingly well received when it came out. Personally I found it hard to watch to the end. I thought it was overly melodramatic to the point of pain a number of times. It started out being a comedy of sorts and then turned into something else with younger characters spouting profanity as if that was somehow part of being 'gifted' when all it did was make the characters look dumb which didn't add anything in the way of credibility to the movie. Irene Cara's character is from the city yet doesn't pick up on a guy whose fishing for girls to do porn. To make matters worse/even less credible, she agrees to do an 'audition' with Mr. Phoney and then starts to cry when he asks her to take off her top-but does it anyway. I thought that part of the film was pretty ridiculous. Basically I wasn't impressed with this movie very much. There was just one or two standout musical moments in the whole movie which I thought was basically a stink bomb of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Girl version" of Rocky?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think of this as a very entertaining period piece and in the tradition of Rocky I, Saturday Nite Fever, Chorus Line, and...probably 7-8 I can't recall right now. It's got a real zest to it, enthused performances, compared to DANCING WITH THE STARS winners, decent dancing, and a fabulous soundtrack. Speaking of the soundtrack, it's so cool that a '60s icon, Lesley Gore, along with her Brother, composed a true classic, in full modern style, "Out Here On My Own". (although, sad to realize that if Lesley had it out on a single/album, it might have had a cup of coffee on the Top 100, only).Buy this DVD used or go to the Library. Or buy it "new".I did see this flick in the movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strikingly original musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fame was a hip and contemporary 1980 musical that was an inside look at the lives of a disparate group of talented teenagers at the High School of Performing Arts in New York. The episodic film takes a close look at the inner workings of show business and what drives performers to go through the work and constant rejection that being in the business involves. The film opens on a particular freshman year at the school and concludes four years later.Along the way we meet Montgomery McNeill (Paul McCrane), the neglected son of a famous actress who despite his lonely childhood, still finds the business enticing. Maureen Teefy is wonderful as Doris Finsecker, a painfully shy teen who has been pushed into the business by her mother, but does come out of her shell at the school and discovers a talent for acting. Irene Cara plays CoCo Hernandez, a triple-threat know-it-all, who learns that she doesn't know as much as she thinks she does. Lee Curreri plays Bruno, an electronic keyboard genius who loves sitting in front of a keyboard but is at a complete loss at how to act in the real world. Barry Miller is brilliant in an Oscar-worthy turn as Ralph Garcy, a bitter Latino teen who is trying to bury his resentment about his father deserting him as a child by being a stand-up comedian. The late Gene Anthony Ray also shines as a dancer who only came to the auditions to partner a friend who wants to get in the school, but he is the one who has the talent, a star in the dance studio, but not so much in the classroom who constantly butts heads with Miss Sherwood (Anne Meara), the school's hard-nosed English teacher.Just like a real-life school, students come and go as the years pass, most notably in the sophomore year, where we meet Hilary Van Dorn (Antonia Francheschi) a snooty rich dance major who comes between a budding romance between CoCo and Leroy and has her own career aspirations derailed in the process.This film is riveting from jump as we watch students going through the painful audition process and struggle to develop their talent while keeping up their academic studies as well. The actors are pretty much perfectly cast, with standout work from Miller and Meara.Alan Parker's direction is breezy and energetic, giving all of his very talented cast a little time in the sun and Christopher Gore's screenplay is surprisingly bold and uncompromising. The musical numbers leap off the screen, thanks to some inventive choreography and strong vocals, particularly Cara, whose rendition of the title tune won the Oscar for Best Original Song.A movie that will have you tapping your toes and wanting to watch over and over again. The film inspired a long running television series, with Curreri and Ray recreating their movie roles, and a remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>somewhat too scattered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New kids come to audition for New York City High School of Performing Arts. Leroy Johnson is a tough kid dragged to help a girl audition but he gets picked instead. Bruno Martelli is more interested in modern music. Doris Finsecker is shy pushed by her mother. Lisa Monroe is a dancer since childhood but finds herself falling behind. Coco Hernandez (Irene Cara) is confident at everything. Montgomery MacNeil is gay. The movie follows these kids and their teachers over the next 4 years.The beauty of this are the various unknown actors. The drawback is also the same thing which suffers from a lack of focus on a specific character. The numbers of characters are so many and the time spent is so vast. It becomes a series of disjointed vignettes. It does get into the foreign world of the performing arts and some pretty interesting dramatic aspects. Gene Anthony Ray is electric in his audition scene. There are some great memorable big energetic dance sequences like the cafeteria and on the street. They have 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'. Some characters are inevitably more interesting than others which is different for every viewer. It is simply a bit too scattered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining musical drama that could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fame is, at least to me, not a flawless film and it is easy to see why people wouldn't like or connect with it, but I found it to be a good, entertaining film. It is true that Ralph is given too much prominence and he is never really likable while some of the other characters are barely fleshed out and that the ending is far too abrupt and riddled with loose ends that were crying out to be tied up. Some of the dialogue is also a little rambling in places and with a structure that could have been tighter than it was. Fame, while very of the time, is very competently made with the style of filming appropriate for the type of film and what themes are explored, that some of the song and dance numbers are shot like a music video didn't come across as that much of a problem personally. The songs are terrific, the timeless title song, the infectiously catchy Hot Lunch Jam and the poignant Out Here on My Own are the highlights though the ending number I Sing the Body Electric is fun enough too. The score also won an Oscar along with the title song and deserved it thoroughly. The choreography is toe-tapping and spirited, especially in I Sing the Body Electric. The story captures the high school performing arts atmosphere really well, how fulfilling and fun yet punishing and competitive it is and has themes that anyone would relate to, ones that were relevant then and while not as much reasonably relevant now. While the characterisation is not perfect, there are a few good characters like Leroy and Coco. The performances show the actors very into their roles and enjoying them, Barry Miller does overact but if there was a favourite in the cast it would be Irene Cara, who had the best singing voice of the cast and the one with the best songs. In conclusion, has some imperfections in the writing department but musically especially the film while an acquired taste was personally entertaining. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful idea: Musical much better than the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie, I have to say that I found way too many problems (girl getting pregnant, coco becoming a porn star, Doris smoking, Leroy not graduating, and many more) that it took away from the light spirit of the movie and made me quite uncomfortable watching it and laughing at some jokes that were revolved around these problems. Even though people make jokes about these things, this film made me realize how bad these things can be. The musical was much better because it focused on one main problem- Carmen going into drugs. Even though there were smaller problems, they did not take away from the main problem. The musical had funnier jokes and the characters all seemed well built. It also had a great and very useful message saying that if you want to get somewhere in life, you need to work hard for it and not get distracted and fall into drugs for example. Again, the movie had just as much wonderful potential as the musical had but it was taken away because the writer over did it with the problems thinking it would enhance the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>spontaneous soul-drenched dance numbers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers, Katherine Hepburn and Frank Sinatra, fame is associated with glitz and glamour, big parties, more money than you can ever could dream off and millions of adoring fans all screaming your name. But what they don't tell you is that fame can also be associated with a world of no trust, self loathing, and drug abuse, loss of a perspective or reality and heart break. For every rags to riches story, is a slow painful descent from the heavens and the stars into a hell were you constantly face the dark side of humanity. For every Beyonce there is a Marilyn Monroe, for every Clint eastwood there is a Kurt Cobain and for every Jerry Seinfeld there is a Michael Jackson. Fame has the beautiful, yet macabre ability to change some people's lives, and destroy others. So why do we risk so much and seek it so adamantly? Everyone has their own reason for wanting fame, but the most common is our quest for acceptance, and when you're a young teenager in the most populated city on earth, you can still feel more isolated than if you were the only person there. 1980 was the very forefront of the massive boom in coming of age films, which details the lives of young people and their trials and tribulations of the difficult and confusing transition into adulthood whilst trying to recover from pain of watching their childhood end. But whilst later films like Dazed and Confused and American Pie took more of a light hearted and humorous tone, it was Alan Parker who brought us a more realistic, gritty and niche magnifying glass into the lives of teens in New York City. They come from all walks of life, from the poor Bronx to the right upper eastside of Manhattan, however what they all have in common is a whole lot of ambition, dreams and talent and insatiable hunger for fame, but the world is cruel and not everyone has what it takes to make it. Over the course of; Auditions, freshman, sophomore, junior and senior year we follow the lives of; Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray) the hot headed naturally gifted dancer who can't read, Montgomery (Paul McCrane) a ultra serious thespian struggling to come to terms with his homosexuality, Ralph a street wise compulsive liar, Bruno (Lee Curreri) who is by far ahead of his time and lastly Doris a personality less shrinking violet who soon learns to blossom. Besides Doris who seems forced by her mother to pursue a life in the creative arts, the exact motivations for each of the main characters reasons for wanting fame is generally unclear and the film never really explicitly defines them, but as the audience we don't care because in each of these kids we see a little bit of ourselves, and thus will them to success with all our hearts. Similar to a Robert Altman film we weave effortlessly through the ensembles lives, experiencing their uplifting highs as well as their crushing lows as if we were actually standing right next to them throughout. Warning don't expect any fairy tales and happily ever afters in Fame; there is abortion, exploitation, attempted suicide, racial divides, death and drug abuse in Christopher Gore script that never stops shocking you and sending you on an emotional roller-coaster, as you immerse yourselves in the lives of these teens, laughing and crying as they do and eventually falling in love with them. Working so expertly with such a young cast of relatively unknowns and producing such a excellent piece of filmmaking, wasn't a flash in the pan or fluke by Alan Parker, because you just have to look back to the toe tapping all kids gangster musical Bugsy Malone as a further demonstration of Parkers ability to work so well and nurture young talent into giving such breath taking performance. In particular the one that stood out to me the most in Fame was Barry Miller as Ralph we was able to pull of the most dynamic and layered character with ease and charm, but never being afraid to lay out his entire soul to the audience. You just have to look at the scene he shares with his mother, sister and preacher in church as an example, a scene absolutely dripping with raw emotion. I personally was one of those people to fall in love not just with the characters but with the film as a whole because it has the grace of ballerina, the power of a Ballard and the ability to provoke thought like a Shakespearean actor. Fame stands fearless, toe to toe with controversy and bat an eye lid, but it's not serious all the time there is a swimming pool full of fun gushing into every scene; the boys in the toilets trying to see into the girls changing rooms and the spontaneous soul-drenched dance numbers, that gallivanted a whole generation of New Yorkers to risk a beat down and try to pirouette on top of a taxi if you haven't already laughed enough. Bring him a well deserved BAFTA nomination, Fame sits aptly next Mississippi Burning and American Express as some of Alan's greatest crowning achievements, which helped him win BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award, the highest honour the British Film Academy can give any filmmaker in 2013. While the immediate legacy of Fame was the double Oscar Winning sing- along inspiring song named 'Fame' named after the film which won the film an Oscar for best original score and a Oscar for best song for Michael Gore. But what really stands out was the films ability to influence later coming of age films in the likes of Footloose and The Breakfast Club, however it should come as great surprise to know that the film only ranked at #42 on Entertainment Weekly's 2006 list of the "50 Best High School Movies". Shocking!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fame wears its heart on its sleeve -- unashamedly and it's brilliant. Recently I rediscovered on Itunes the song 'I Sing the Body Electric' and I just can't fault it. I realised it's one of my favourite songs. So much to love about it -- the beautiful singing of the different singers, in their own way; the lyrics; the orchestration and the blend of rock, gospel and classical styles. The song's ending is perfect. The song seems to embody the energy and poignancy and passion of youth, as did Alan Parker's much later film The Commitments. Sure, you can be cynical about putting a group of kids on screen and getting them to swear, sing and dance and emote, but if you put that aside, Fame rocks!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie! It could have been a really cheesy movie about kids wanting to make it big in show business so they learn all about it at a special school. That would have been disastrous. What makes FAME work is that you do have aspiring actors, singers, and dancers wanting success and dreaming big but they are given a hard wake up call about the rigerous demands that fame costs. Plus, what sets this film up is the fact that real life delimas hit these kids SUPER HARD. You don't get milk toast problems like bad acne or boyfriend trouble, you got exploitation, abortion, illiteracy and a genuine fear of being inadequate. There is not a single bad performance in this movie and that is saying something considering the unknown, at the time cast. As Debbie Allen said in the this movie and in the TV show, "You got big dreams, you want fame, well fame costs! And right here is where you start paying, in sweat!."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't have to be a fan of musicals to enjoy Fame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Musicals are something most people tend to have pretty strong opinions about either leading one way or the other. There are those people who adore musicals and others who despise them. I place myself somewhere in the middle of these two ends of the spectrum. I don't hate musicals by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm not particularly fond of them. I don't particularly enjoy the whole idea of characters randomly breaking into song for no reason, especially when it doesn't further the plot whatsoever. My suspension of disbelief is shattered when the characters begin singing away their issues with no clear motivation as to why. On stage there is a lot of greatness that can be done with musicals, but on film I try to steer clear of them. However, if I had to recommend one musical, Fame would definitely be up on the list. It is a musical that places its musical numbers in appropriate and relevant spots. The film is really a drama before it is a musical. Plus it centers around a group of characters who are the kind of people who would break out into song and dance in real life. Obviously not to the extent that these characters do, but that's because Fame is still a musical.Fame is about a group of high school students who go to school at a prestigious performing arts school in New York. The film follows a large ensemble of characters from their auditions to get into school all the way to graduation. Obviously it is a very character driven story and, for the most part, each character is very interesting and develops a lot throughout the movie. The characters span all sorts of personalities, backgrounds, and attitudes towards high school. But they all share one thing in common, and that is a love for performing arts. And it is through this that they can all relate. And they do all relate through some method or another. Friendships develop and enemies are made. Each character intertwines with the others, some more than the rest, but it all accumulates into a great character study.In a film with so many stories going on and intertwining at the same time, a directors juxtaposition skills have to be tight and concise. Alan Parker is a very skilled director, and he shows it in the beginning of the film. The film begins by introducing us to all the characters through their auditions to get into the school. It makes for a great opening to the film. Each character is introduced in some unique fashion and we get a good sense of whose going to be important and what archetypal role each character will likely play. Of course by the end of the opening I started to get the feeling that there were going to be a lot of characters. And there were a bunch. Towards the middle of the film a lot of the smaller roles stopped showing up as much and it was clearly defined which were the central characters of the film. However, towards the end of the film Parker's ability to juxtapose these story lines started to dwindle. There are three main characters that become the central focus of the story and the others sort of fade away. We don't hear from some of the other characters for a long stretch of time until they are brought back up towards the end.I'm still trying to figure out the ending and whether I liked it or not. It is very abrupt and leaves all the characters stories open ended. Nothing seems to be resolved in the end of the film. One could make the argument that this is a smart element to include in the film as it leaves it all open to interpretation. But I was still taken aback by the abruptness of the ending and its lack of explanation or catharsis. The film does end with an incredible musical number with a very powerful song. I still feel like I would have been happier if a little more work towards the storyline had gone towards the ending.Fame's greatest quality is its great balance between the fantastic music and its sincere dramatic elements. There is a deep story here that deals with the difficulties of growing up as a teenager and coping with the world around you, especially when you are trying so hard to express a passion for something so close to your heart. I said before that each of these characters comes from very different walks of life and this plays heavily into this storytelling aspect. There are some incredibly gripping monologues delivered brilliantly by the actors. The film is really well written to begin with, and some moments of the film are tear jerkingly gripping. There are some truly powerful moments in Fame, both through dialouge and music.Fame is good as a drama and a musical. It has lots of great songs that are performed by great actors that have a lot of acting talent as well as musical talent. I was very impressed by how great some of the dancing and singing was in this movie. Fame might have a few too many characters, causing it to get a little lost towards the end of the film. The ending is surprisingly abrupt, but can still be effective depending on how you interpret it. I enjoyed Fame a lot more than I thought I would and I would recommend it to anybody, even those who aren't big fans of musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Students go through four years at a NYC school for the performing arts. It gets off to a terrific start, as students audition for the various classes. These early scenes are well edited and full of energy, providing glimpses into the key elements of music, dance, and drama classes. Much of the middle of the film is devoted to exploring the backgrounds of the various students, and this is where it bogs down and feels too contrived and melodramatic. The music is good throughout, highlighted by "Out Here On My Own," "I Sing the Body Electric," and the title song. The students are played by mostly unknown actors, and ironically, for most of them this film was the height of their fame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Drama, Low Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who watched Bob Fosse's "All That Jazz" (1979) first minutes when Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is casting a few dancers to his show and we seen thousands of them dancing to the sound of George Benson's "On Broadway", and there are a few cuts when Joe and his crew are rejecting most of this dancers. Well, this first ten minutes of Fosse's classic equal half hour of Alan Parker's "Fame". All we seen on the screen is a bunch of young people trying their best in musical numbers, dance numbers and acting numbers, people working hard (or not) to be admitted in a art school. After they're get into what they like and the classes starts they need to proof to others and to themselves that they're capable of performing their arts on stage.The movie focuses on a small group of actors, dancers and musicians trying to find their place in the world. This world most precisely is an chaotic and loudly Bronx, New York. Here Irene Cara, Barry Miller, Paul McCrane (best performance here and better known as the adorable and hateful Dr. Romano from "E.R."), Eddie Barth, Laura Dean and others actors play several characters on the way to success. Between their dramatical ascension (sometimes funny moments) and auditions and lessons there's time for some musical stages (best scene is when "Fame" is played at the street with everybody dancing) and a few boring songs and musical numbers.As a drama film the movie works very well, and the unknown cast made the film looks very nice, something almost like an documentary about struggling teens. As a musical it's quite tedious sometimes and there's not enough interesting numbers. Not to mention the fact that all the dance numbers are confusing, didn't expressed emotion enough, and all the dancers are dancing and jumping in a very confusing way sometimes. There isn't order while they dance, looks like a rebellion of dancers that worked very wrong. Director Alan Parker made better in his future films ("Evita", "The Commitments" and "Pink Floyd The Wall"). But that doesn't mean that all the drama scenes were good. No, there's too much drama in some scenes (the dance teacher at the hospital and other scenes). If it wasn't for some funny moments or funny characters this could be a depressive movie. The best dramatic scenes are played by the acting class when the teacher says to his students that they need to show a painful moment in their lives and present to class the stages of fear and angry. That's when we find out that one of the characters is gay and he's in love for his annalist, the other hates to present herself singing at a child's party, and the one whose worst day was when he discovered that his idle Freddie Prinze had died. Those are some the richer moments of "Fame". It's also a good film if you enjoy those brain dead reality shows where unknown talented (or not) persons are performing live before a million of viewers. I liked many of the characters of this movie mainly because they're nice, they come from different backgrounds and had some good stories to share. The difference of "Fame" and those reality shows is that in the film you don't have a screenwriter trying to "sell" you a image, saying that a character is good and the other is bad, and you must vote because he's cute and not because he's singing and dancing. TV manipulates too much and at the end many of the contestants are only participating because they want to be on TV, making a fool of themselves sometimes. It's a public humiliation (not as hard as it was showed here when the talented actress Coco was deceived by a guy who wanted her to be in a film and it turned out to be a pornographer). Perhaps "Fame" lacked of a criticism or it has a few of it to show but it's more an entertaining film. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie and its subsequent TV series followup has become the iconic stand-in for what is great about America. Fame is famous for its music and performances. There are several standouts including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara*, and the superb Gene Anthony Ray. The latter who plays a walk-on dancer with no academic or other than "street" credentials is an amazing personality and is worth watching for what is essentially a portrayal of himself. A wonderment to behold, as one king was apt to say.The plot follows an interesting format - chronological at times, genre at other times, personalities in some cases ... but, it all really ends in a kind of mush.Where Parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive - with the extremely poignant and sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score that matches the performers step for step.The climax of the film is a climax for all times. And this climatic complete cast of many many talented musicians and dancers and music is thankfully repeated throughout the credits. These are one set of credits that are well worth sitting through ... an achievement for the ages. The music by Christopher Gore is a gift to behold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected FAME to be an uplifting film but it ended up the opposite. The overall plot which follows the lives of several determined students attending a performing arts school has strong potential. However, FAME builds its characters up beautifully and then leaves us with so many questions when its over. I was very surprised when the graduation scene pops up -- we thought the DVD had skipped or something. All of the characters have internal and external conflicts of some sort and virtually none of them are resolved when the movie ends! You might think there are too many characters, but its probably too many scenes. Its evident the film was cut up and shortened because its sometimes lacks transition. I think Laura Dean as Lisa Monroe is my favorite character. I really connected with her character's ambition and following her heart. Boyd Gaines as Michael, the stereotypical poor student who can't read but is a divine dancer, is also very good. I didn't especially like Irene Cara's character of Coco, but this is not Cara's fault since her script is weak and her character is not fleshed out. Her voice is beautiful and hearing her songs warrants watching the whole film. In summary, the film could use many improvements, but the quality actors and great music earn its place in film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's early on a Sunday morning, and thanks to the miracle of satellite television, I've just finished viewing one of my all time favorite movies, Fame. I've read some of the other user comments and I too, can feel the age of the film. The story is predictable at times, but the music, atmosphere and energy of the film more than make up for its flaws.I can remember seeing this film in the theater and I remember a tag at the end telling what became of the characters. Does anyone remember viewing this version?Watching the movie again really filled in the gaps for me personally. I don't think I fully realized how much this movie impacted me. It made me fall in love with a character. In fact, my favorite character in the film is the city in which it is set. This character called out to me and welcomed me to its shores almost a decade after seeing the film. New York City also provided me the opportunity to live forever as I studied performing and struggled to keep pace with its gait. Ultimately, time, change and terrorism pulled me away from my love, my city, but watching this film again rekindles my memories (good and bad) of my favorite city.As a movie and theater fan, I despise musicals and child actors. In the real world you just don't break out in song, and not all children are cute. This is the one movie for which I break my rule. The young actors here breathe in their co-star (NYC) and out flows a bit of the mosaic that makes this movie so enjoyable. If you are reading the comments to decide whether to invest the two-hours in this film, I say yes. Your reaction and journey with this film may not be as personal as mine, but love it or hate it you will have a reaction - and I'd be interested in someday reading your thoughts on this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely Loved this movie! Seeing it 21 years after it came out, I can only wish now days movies could be as entertaining as this was.It has a great soundtrack, perfect for dancing along to, many young and attractive actors, interesting dancing, and it's just fun to watch how all the characters mature and become adults through high school! It's very inspiring to anyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie came out, I was about 17 years old, I remember the chill that ran up and down my spine, following this story. At the time I was a teenager in Los Angeles, a city definetly not short on energy..but no New York.This movie so inspired me, that after graduation from High School in 1980, I moved to New York to study Theater, and still make home here today.And that to me is the real catch of this movie, it was a movie that offered some inspiration, it was one of the most real movies, I've ever seen that dealt honestly with that awkward period, being a teenager, and especially a gifted teenager.One thing I noticed a lot of commentors mentioned about Fame: That too many stories were left open, well think about it, how many of your stories were closed when you left high school?...remember High School was ONLY the beginning.I rate this movie a 10 out of 10...and my only wish is, that we heard more from this incredibly talented cast..especially Irene Cara.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so great. I loved it!! The first time I saw FAME was about 2 years ago on HBO, i think. I had watched the beginning to towards the middle when I fell asleep. I had always told myself to rent it but always forgot or it was never in. Finally I rented it and watched the whole. After the movie ended I rewinded and watched it again. I loved it! It's so great. FAME is about kids struggling in a performing arts school in NYC. You look closely into the lives of Doris, Leroy, Ralph, Coco, Liza, Montgomery, and Hilary. From the audition to graduation you see there triumph, there pain, there ups and downs. Now, most people consider FAME a musical. I don't. I consider FAME a drama with music in it. I mean it wasn't like Oklahoma or Annie, it wasn't like in the middle of a scene you'd break into a song about the subject. A rock drama, something like that. From the upbeat Hot Lunch, to the eternal "FAME", to the soothing "I sing the Body Electric" Fame is a movie I will never forget. I give it a 10/10!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very flawed and outdated. It is very episodic and many of the episodes come out of nowhere and is inconsistent with the flow of the movie.Having said that, this movie is rare for the Teen genre. It features mostly plain looking energetic people from a (refreshingly) varied background from the most multicultural city in the world. This movie has so much energy that you can't help but to root for these kids, who after they graduate will enter the hard life and will most likely, not achieve Fame.This is one of the most 3 dimensional teen films to have come out of Hollywood in the last 20 years and filmmakers nowadays should have taken a lesson from this movie before making the current load of vapid teenflicks.</fullReview>

It was good that Alan Parker had chosen all kind of outsiders like the jewish girl, the black men, the Puerto Rican, the rich mans daughter, the gay and it was good to see how they make their way. I believe It is a very realistic film because many of the actors and actresses in the USA are unemployed and have not such a good life like Leonardo di Caprio (but sometimes more talent).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching films and wondering about the experience is made that much richer by comparing the films and comparing the wonder.It is a bit more fun when the films are similar, like sequels or remakes. I've recently watched the 2009 remake and liked it a lot. That is because the camera was given the energy, the hunger, the risky curiosity of the kids. The investment was made in the capture of the thing. So instead of watching some kids with juice, we became them.This is an entirely different film, about as different as you can get. The camera and all the cinematic art is hidden. Your place in it is the same as if you were watching a documentary, like "Mad Hot Ballroom," which has some of the same components.All of the investment here is in the kids, their characters. There are engaging songs, designed not to engage you in the song directly, but the characters you see associated with the songs. The actors have juice, unlike in the remake. These kids put everything on the line. They are not mature powerhouses, but there is an appeal to getting honesty instead of craft.None of these kids had a meaningful career. But they did make something that matters, and once should be enough.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the series of realistic movies about music (like Footloose, Saturday Night Fever). This type of film minimises hollywood gloss, using as many unknown or fresh actors as possible and minimises "I feel a song coming on" moments and other movie-musical cliches. If anything, these movies are closer to movies than musicals. Music is everywhere in Fame, though. Its about dance, theatre, movies and playing instruments - yet instances of any of these are fit into a real-life situation, like kids trying out for a special talent school, or rehersals or performances. For those who aren't really fans of musicals (i am, but i know some people are not), no-one spontaneously bursts into song during Fame. Or when they do it is made seem spontaneous and immensely fun. And fun is the key element in Fame. Like Footloose and Fever, there are definite moments of hard-edged drama, but unlike the other two, there is more than enough fun to be had. You probably like the characters in Fame a lot more than you do in those other two also. The opening audition section very cleverly makes you interested in this quirky cast of characters, and you gladly follow their adventures for the hefty running time thereafter. Well-directed by Parker, Fame is still fun, exciting and involving decades later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can remember hearing the soundtrack to this film all throughout my childhood. As a young child, I was forbidden to watch the film seeing how it was rated R, but thought it was wonderful anyway because of what it dealt with: the Performing Arts. Now, almost twenty years late, I've just watched it again and I must say that things look a whole lot tamer today than they did then. What was the big deal anyways? Frankly, I think that this film is Alan Parker's masterpiece. This is the film that he'll be remembered for, if not for the story of it but for the music of it and the dichotomy of his actors, all of whom were virtual unknowns when this film was released back in the spring of 1980. Of course, this film spawned the hugely successful television series of the same name and even a live in concert album (which I owned as a child).If anything, to me this film is a look back at a time that is no more: my childhood and the early 1980's, when life in general was so much simpler than it is now, when the only upheaval we had was actually electing an actor as President of the United States!This a film that certainly deserves more than one look.My rating: 3 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, okay so that quote isn't from the movie, it's from the stage musical, which is WAY better! Having read all the reviews on this movie and found them all to be positive, I have to wonder if I saw the same film! The one I saw only had one major song, that being the awesome title number (which, don't get me wrong, I love!) and nothing else really of interest. The characters were flat and the story line totally predictable. Some films don't age well, and this one doesn't.If you really want to see this kind of story brought to life see if you can get a chance to see a good (notice I say good, the bad productions can be very painful) version of the stage musical. It can be awesome. It's set after the movie, has way more and way better music, more believable characters and a (if only slightly) better storyline (lines like "If you've come here expecting your going to live forever, or envision dancing on top of cars down 42nd street, you're humming the wrong tune!). That being said, amongst the theatre crowd at the university I go to, you've suffered the ultimate shame if you've performed in Fame...still it is a fun show to do and can be a blast to see...this movie on the other hand, while legendary is a flat outdate yawn that doesn't at all live up to it's reputation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was on TV last night. I painfully forced my way through it, and barely made it through. First of all, except for Leroy, Hilary, and possibly Coco, NONE of the other students we are supposed to care about have any discernible talent. It's like HSPA had no standards, just sign on the dotted line and you're in. The story lines were grating and obvious. Doris was just impossibly awful. The gay guy was such a thrown away cliché (funny how that school had only one gay guy, right...) I liked the Leroy character, but calling your teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent Leroy packing. Lisa looks like she'd rather be anywhere else, and since she wasn't any talent, I wonder why they kept her. I would have rated this one star (awful), but the music wasn't that bad, and I did like the premise. It just would have worked much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody broke out into spontaneous song and dance at my high school. Of course, I also didn't go to Juilliard."Fame" was a sort of transition film, bridging the gap between the more traditional movie musicals of the 1960s and 70s and the MTV-style musicals of the 1980s. In "Fame," characters do break into song, but when they do, the song looks more like a music video than anything else.Some of those songs are terrific (like the iconic title number performed by Irene Cara), and some are just stupid, like the lunchroom number. The movie is full of hot-button issues and melodramatic subplots that would make any tweener salivate, but the film is nearly impossible to take seriously once you're past the age of, say, 25. Still, it's directed with a fair amount of style by Alan Parker, and it goes down easily enough.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The passion is what makes Fame special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Fame when it first came out. It deals with the high school class of 1980, which was coincidentally my year of graduation. I saw the movie in the summer between high school and college and, being a performer myself, it holds a special place in my heart.The biggest criticisms of Fame usually have to do with continuity, and there are definitely some story lines that either are not completed or don't make sense. However, those problems are more than made up for by the passion and emotion of the characters and the incredible music.I saw it again recently and was surprised that I still loved it as much as I did the first time. Fame is often compared to Flashdance, which I don't think is fair. Although Flashdance has some great music and Jennifer Beals is gorgeous, I think Fame is vastly superior in the development of its characters and the complexity of its stories. For anyone who truly loves the arts, this is a must-see movie.</fullReview>

Obviously I've watched the original musical, and I like the actual musical more.In some parts of the movie it was actually quite touchy.Personally I love every production of Fame since I am a musical person and the stuffs that happen in the movie are quite realistic.Due to the time restraint, the director needed to cut out a lot of scenes compared to the actual musical, some of them are quite important, and i agree that there are lots of loose ends for the characters. But this "mistake" is understandable.If you have not watch the original musical, and you're into teen's movie (well, not those teen movie like confession of the teenage drama queen and mean girls) you will like this movie.

		<fullReview>Irene Cara and a gaggle of unknown actors and actresses are students in New York's High School for the Performing Arts. They learn dance, music, drama, and the required academic classes. We follow a group of students who all have their own troubles.While the majority of comments on this film at the IMDB are positive, I have to admit I was expecting a bit more from this film. The soundtrack is superb stuff, and earned a well-deserved Oscar for both the complete score and the theme song "Fame". Irene Cara, Gene Anthony Ray, and Anne Meara turn in memorable performances (the other actors could actually be real-life struggling P.A. students, they are so unsure of themselves in their dramatic scenes).But the plausibility of the entire film is at stake here: one would think the school's standards are much higher. And if so, then how could untalented people like Doris Finsecker, Lisa Monroe, and Ralph Garci get in? There are too many subplots left incomplete by the big final musical number: how did Coco deal with her little smut film? Did Coco ever hook up with Bruno? Did Leroy make ammends with his English teacher and pass? What happened to Hilary after her abortion? It all comes to a close so fast that I am convinced there was some post-production editing flaws involved. As another reviewer put it, I wouldn't be surprised if there was another 30 minutes out there somewhere in a film vault collecting dust actually tying all the loose ends together, but as FAME exists now, it feels incomplete and ultimately unsatisfying. Not to be condescending, but I expect all the positive reviews are from people who actually want (or wanted) fame just as bad, but haven't (or didn't) tasted it yet and the film gives them hope. That's fine, but judging the film as a piece of cinema, it does not deliver the goods.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had been alive in 1980, perhaps this film would have appealed to me. However, I saw it on TV last night and the only words that spring to my mind are 'terrible' and 'outdated'.The lack of a coherent plot line interrupted only by random musical outbursts only help to worsen this film. I found that the character profiles are no longer relevant to the current generation, but mostly just struggled to understand the plot.However, the random musical outbursts were the main annoyance for me. It was like a musical without the singing, and instead just people dancing. Whilst the choreography was fantastic (and indeed the only highlight of the film), such a scenario as seen in the film would be most implausible in real life.Don't waste your time unless you really admire dancing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter what you've heard, "Fame" is not a good movie. It's not worth the investment of over two hours to watch stereotypically troubled teens dancing, singing, learning, and staring at girls in the dressing rooms.Every cliché finds a cozy little home in this movie. There's a gay teenager looking for acceptance. That would have been great if it had been treated as anything more than a secondary plot point. There's a ghetto kid who has too much attitude-- what, was I surprised? And guess what? They all want to become big stars, finding fame and fortune, and they'd all be willing to crawl over their own mothers' smoking corpses to get it.Oddly enough, this film is remembered for its music. But in actuality, the only moderately good song is "Hot Lunch Jam," which is still too cheesy to be of any real quality. The two most popular songs are nothing, either. "Fame" is meaningless fluff drowned out by the sheer spectacle of a massive dancing-in-the-streets scene. And "I Sing the Body Electric" (what in Bubba's name does that even mean?!?!?!?!?) is just an incomprehensible joke.Bad acting, tasteless dialog, and hack direction (it is, after all, from the director of "Evita") are only marginally helped by Michael Seresin's appropriately ordinary camera work. But cinematography alone cannot carry a movie, especially one as uninspiring and pointless as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty Yet At times Moving Look At Performing Arts And Its Students</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fame was released in the U.S. a year before I was born; I was too young to ever remember the original version of Fame- and yet I heard and read numerous things about it. Such as the fact that it spawned a TV series and that its soundtrack was led by the Irene Cara, Giogio Moroder hit, 'Fame'.Fame was arguably the first of its kind to portray and showcase the world of performing arts in the form of a feature length film. The lives, the struggles, the hurdles the students and some of the teachers undergo themselves were under the eye of the viewers.The performances were great, yet one which caught my eye in particular was Gene Anthony Ray, who played the troublesome yet promising Leroy. Angry, frustrated and at first rude, his character later became less angry and frustrated and more committed to his studies- not just with the practical in the performing but in the theoretical too. Irene Cara was good as Coco- the scene with her taking her blouse off while some pervy director was filming her was rather discomforting to watch-, as well as Paul McCrane for his amazing portrayal of a vulnerable but closeted homosexual trying to cope with life and enrolling on a performing arts school in New York, after he had been kicked out of the military when he told them he was gay. Ralph played by Barry Miller was interesting but at times, his character did grate on my nerves.The choreography was excellent, there were some good dance numbers involved and the 'hot lunch' scene in the cafeteria was worth watching. Another scene that was great was when the 'Fame' song was played and all the kids started rushing out into the streets of New York and danced wildly and without a care in the world. It was a street jam like no other.The only star to ever truly benefit from this in the long run was and is Debbie Allen- she later became a producer, director and star- though she mostly worked behind the scenes on shows such as Everybody Hates Chris and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Paul McCrane later went on to star alongside Peter Weller in the movie, 'Robocop', where he played a villain and E.R. as the judgemental, obnoxious Doctor Romano.British director Alan Parker shot this really well- he allowed the performers to dance, act, sing to their hearts content without wanting to interfere with and affect their styles.Throughout the duration of the movie, we see the various stages the students encounter during their 4 years- from their auditions to freshman year, all the way up to graduation in New York's High School For The Arts.Fame is one of those movies which caters for or is aimed at a particular audience that isn't necessarily the general mainstream movie loving community- it is definitely NOT for everyone.I for one enjoyed it because I have an interest in the arts- not technically in terms of being a performer because I am not one but as someone who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be channelled through hard work, commitment and passion towards what one does with their talents. Therefore, if you are an aspiring dancer, actor- or just someone who is creative, you might be interested in a movie such as this- though whether the events in Fame are anything like what it is in a performing arts college/school in real life, then that is a completely different matter altogether.The 2009 remake of this movie was released recently and frankly, it virtually pales by comparison. As for the original Fame, almost 30 years on though yes it is a bit dated but it is still a great movie, nonetheless.It's not an outright classic but as a 80s cult classic, in line with other 80s dance hit movies, such as Footloose and Flashdance, Fame hits the spot. Isn't it a coincidence that all those dance movies begin with the letter 'F'? Gritty, moving and intriguing, this one is worth a watch.</fullReview>

Christopher Gore's effective screenplay owes its mastery primarily to his believable, well written characters who are easy to identify with.The young cast deliver well weighted, hardy performances that sure up Alan Parker's professional direction. Special mention to Lee Curreri, Irene Cara, Gene Anthony Ray and Anne Meara as the English teacher who struggles to keep her students focused on their academic achievements.Michael Gore's soundtrack is a treat and features Irene Cara's hit single "Fame".Monday, September 29, 1997 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspired. It also blows cold on the hot spots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This tells me that I have a problem with the sort of storytelling that Alan Parker was drawn to early on. Vocations happen for the reason that they happen, but I have an incompatibility. Still, I have only seen three, so far. * Evita, that I do not feel incompatible with at all. The first time I saw it, it felt too cold and bleak, I wanted to switch off. However I found that it grew on me. A long story about someone who grew up in the cold, needing to get out of the cold, not so fussy about how that was done, it gets so that one cannot be as fussy as a person needs to be. Someone who climbed to the top, but without the in-tune-ness that would make that other than a pr victory. Evita, an opera already developed for the stage. I found that it grew on me and echoed a lot that I could feel to have reality, but I did not find it too painful or threatening, etc. I can afford to consider it to be a masterwork. * Bugsy Malone, I should consider this as a masterwork too. Except that get to know it better it seems to be rooted in the belief system that has been dominant over the past twenty five years. To me it is a celebration of worldviews that create the dispossessed classes and as one of those who did not do so well the past twenty five years this is way too painful stuff. Except that the music and dance is so brilliant, maybe just seeing it occasionally it can regain the grandeur of the first few times that I saw it. * It is early days with my getting to know Fame. The commentary mentioning how come they could not film at the 46th Avenue school. Yes. So far I find the music and dance to echo the spirit of those other two that I have on DVD. Just there is a tension with the rough parts of the story that blows the thing. Hot Lunch. When Parker was inspired to notice that other film, I assume that inspiration was saying something but that I am likely to misunderstand what Inspiration meant and what Parker really understood. I experience the film to be in chains. The single take steadycam scene is an example of what shows me that it is also inspired. I experience the DVD commentary as underlining that. Quality, but chilling. Used to be I apologised for everything, but recently I am more the opposite and this example from a non-underclass makes an interesting case study. I am not at the stage of considering Fame to be a masterwork, despite the power of the dance and song. The dominant mood for me is the strip done for the camera. I note that there is a remake due in 2008 and that this has shown the potential of this theme. Just here the potential works in opposing directions. A crushing day to day reality. For me, this is chilling. As with Evita, it echoes real problems that I have faced, but in different ways. This reminds me of the trouble that I have had from the arts worlds, UK especially, as a blatant gargoyle type. The gargoyle phenomena is real and a strong factor in my experience of the arts. Would that all arts products were like this Fame, reality would be easier to pigeon hole. One side of our local main road has switched to continental style open air cafés. I used to consider the pre-café road as a local Tel Aviv, a place to develop basic girl skills in 'noticing' people, including cute ones. The new look allows big mouths a comfortable seat for hassling such as passers by who are obviously transgendered. Hassling does not appear to be considered as evil but as good and moral. The other side now has a community arts facility being built on two thirds to three quarter of the land previously fully occupied by a church that needed cash for renovations and they doubtless look with respect to the arts, not to the gargoyle making side. How does a gargoyle face this? I recently discovered Uncle Buck of 1989 and now I have this Fame. * I am leaving this as a temporary comment, a first reaction. I doubt that I will get around to updating it or looking at Fame again, but the memory of it could give me fresh insights into my problem re Bugsy Malone. This links with my comments on All American Girl of 1994 and Harry Potter 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although at first glance this movie looks like the story of your parent's high school life (and many people will try to tell you that this movie is WAY outdated)... and I admit that that was MY first impression.... but honestly,the 'lessons' that are learned by the heroes/heroines are def. NOT outdated. Who doesn't want to be famous? And who doesn't want do be accepted my their peers? And the homosexual guy-isn't there a whole controversy today about gay marriage, blah, blah? This movie, though released in the 80's still addresses some of the biggest issues in today's world. This movie does have a little too much profanity and nudity for my taste, though. (thus the 8/10 rating)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fame" had been one of my favorite movies for years! It is not just an 80's musical movie of "that" high school in NYC, it is LEGENDARY- people no longer refer to the High School of Performing Arts but "the Fame school"!!The characters are real, they are not "Hollywood" and their stories are real. The film follows them through the four years of school, starting with a powerful monologue by one student at Auditions and finishing with a spectacular graduation show.Apparently some find the broadway show better, however it is my opinion that you should definitely see this movie anyway, and then have your own view. For anyone who enjoys movie watching and would like to have the "classics" down, this is surely one of them. It is an example of one of those movies that was really great, with actors that we loved for those 2 hours, and then never saw them again... they are classic "Fame students".make FAME live forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>New York is the setting for this tale of success and failure in the world of upcoming stars. I liked this movie in a very few things: its theme is original, and few movies have succeeded to approach like this. But time wore out this picture, and what it remains is a story of how much you sweat and fight to be someone at show business. Director Alan Parker shows here his typical eye for the struggle themes, and made "The Commitments" with much better results. A medium movie, to see sometimes, not always. Recommended to everyone who seeks a place to shine.</fullReview>

You look closer into the lives of 5 or 6 of the students: Doris, Ralph/Raul, Montgomery, Coco, Leroy, and that blond chick. 2 hours and 14 glorious minutes of drama, music, and dancing.

		<fullReview>Fame, I think, was the best movie that I have ever seen. In ways it was funny and dramatic, but that is what makes a movie. True, it has a few loose ends, actually a lot, but I still think that it is a terrific movie. Some of the funny things happen in the audition at the beginning of the movie. I think it is hilarious when the girl tries to act out O.J. Simpson in "The Towering Inferno" and Raul/Ralph goes around to every art department saying that his father was great at every one. He says that his dad danced with the Rockets and left Ralph his tap shoes. The Rockets, as far as I know, are made up of women. And the tap shoes were just regular shoes with bottle caps on the bottom. Also the guy who read the lines of Juliet in the Romeo and Juliet play was funny. One thing about the movie that just turns me on is the music. I have never heard anything like it!!! My favorite song is "I Sing the Body Electric" and my second is the theme song itself "Fame". Irene Cara has a great voice and is a great actress. I like the way the movie focused on many ethnic groups. It showed all of the kinds of people there actually are in what is now called "La Guardia School of the Performing Arts". This movie showed the triumphs and trials of many young performers, including Angelo, Doris, Bruno, Coco, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary, and Liza. They all had a hard time, but made it their own way. This movie could have added on about another 30-45 minutes (before the graduation), but it is still my favorite movie no matter what!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, all the negative comments that get made about this movie (too many loose ends, occasionally disjointed...) are true, but that doesn't change that this is a wonderful movie, and one that has held up over time.Made several years before the John Hughes Brat Pack movies, Fame really does a great job of capturing the voice, the naivete, the selfishness and the selflessness of youth. You care about these characters as they have to learn about the world around them. Their voices are real, and they remind me of teenagers I knew in the 80s and teenagers I see in my classroom now.And I haven't even mentioned the music yet... If the closing number of "I Sing the Body Electric" doesn't make smile, then nothing well. It's a great closing scene to a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the energy from this movie doesn't enter your system and light you up, please turn yourself in for an autopsy NOW. I saw "Fame" in its first release (btw, a movie released in 1980 isn't an '80s movie, it's a '70s movie) and couldn't sleep for at least a day. Dramatically it's a bit uneven, tho' storyline strengths knit it together well, but the music comes to the rescue every time. Interestingly, the "impromptu" street and cafeteria jams are no better (but every bit as good) as the staged choral numbers, which really are the full-throated heart of the movie. If you're looking for a movie that reminds you of high school, or even of your high school play, you'll more than likely be disappointed. If you want powerful music from energetic singers, this is your show -- "42nd Street" for kids not lucky enough (hah!) to have lived through the Depression. And yes, I think it would make an xlnt double bill with "42nd Street." 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fame is a wonderful movie about the high school of performing arts in NYC. We follow several students throughout their high school careers and watch them grow. We see them go through all the crap that is high school, the tragedies, the triumphs and the temptations. We want them to succeed, crying over the tragedies, and rejoicing in their triumphs.These actors, dancers, musicians and singers are all phenomenally talented. The music is memorable and is a wonderful fit for the plot.I just can't help but wonder why some of these genuinely talented people never made more of a name for themselves on screen after this movie.Gotta see this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Soundtrack Film of the 1980s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laughably over-the-top and over-performed soap opera with a constant musical twist. "Fame" is nearly a totally sickening mess that is too long, too silly and too stupid to ever become very interesting. A group of students at the New York School for the Performing Arts are the focus as we see them from their acceptance into the program all the way through to their graduation after four years of work. There is the quiet girl (Maureen Teefy) with over-protective mother (Tresa Hughes) issues, the illiterate street thug (Gene Anthony Ray), the gay guy (Paul McCrane) with a famous parent, the Puerto Rican jerk (Barry Miller) with religious and family issues, the talented but shy music whiz (Lee Curreri) and finally you have the poor naive girl who can sing and dance (Irene Cara). These six characters end up being flat caricatures that whine and bitch throughout the entire 135 minutes this exercise goes on. Director Alan Parker could not wait to taint his name after the impressive "Midnight Express" with this soundtrack-driven dud. He and writer Christopher Gore (who got an Oscar nomination for the screenplay, go figure) would rather have chaotic dance sequences played to late-era disco-styled sounds than to ever get any forward momentum from the wide range of performers. Then again the actors are all so awful that maybe that is the reason they are strangely ignored at times throughout the movie. The only glimpse of interest from the cast comes from Anne Meara (as the English professor who butts heads constantly with Ray) and from James Manis (as Curreri's cab driving uncle). These two are not around enough to add anything significant to the picture though. All of the main performers never did make it in the movies (big surprise). McCrane is the most recognizable with his "E.R." background and even a short turn as one of the prison guards in "The Shawshank Redemption". The booming soundtrack is the only saving grace as the theme was on the lips of most everyone in 1980 (it did win the Best Original Song Oscar for that year). When you get past the top couple of songs in "Fame" you have very little good to talk about. The picture has that ugly New York look to it that makes you think of films like "Midnight Cowboy" and "The French Connection" (this is not a good look for this production). The direction is unclear, the screenplay is contrived and the whole thing is little more than over-rated music video-styled bore. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was in Best Buy a year or two ago. I saw the soundtrack for "Fame", and I decided to buy it. One of my favorite movies at that time was "Flashdance", and I loved the Irene Cara song "What A Feeling" (still love the movie and the soundtrack). I knew that she sang Fame, so I wanted to buy the CD. They didn't have the DVD though. When I went up to the front to pay for my CD, they had a bunch of copies of it on DVD! I was so excited! I just had to get them both. Later that night, my parents and I watched it during our traditional Saturday night movie. All I can say is that I was entertained every second of this movie. The music was great, the acting was perfect, and the movie was overall a wonderful experience. I was a little upset when the movie ended, because I didn't want it to end! It was just before school ended, and I watched this movie to death over the summer. I'm watching it right now, actually. This movie, along with Flashdance, has inspired me to be a performer. It will definitely live forever, and has already learned how to fly! One of the best experiences of my life! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Fame was a great movie. I thought it really captured the essence of a New York City public high-school and race relations of that time. I actually saw the T.V. show before I saw the movie. I didn't know Fame was a movie up until recently. Just like the show, I found Fame the movie very intense although Fame the movie was more sexually explicit. The song Fame by Irene Cara is an inspirational song. The song, show and the movie I believe were way ahead of its time even by today's standards. I don't know what else to say about this movie other than I would recommend it. The show was brought back many times. None of which were ever as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People could say that this film has dated but they would only be referring to fashion. Everything about it is honest and real and although some of the characters are cliched the believable performances and strong script keep it together. I was actually apprehensive when it came to watching the film as I couldn't forget the cheesy leg warmer fest that had been the TV show (which I did watch of course but there were only two channels in Greece then and I was 10 or so...)The film has great music. Dance numbers. The works. However all that is secondary to the story, they compliment it instead of overshadowing it. And as the story goes, it is true that several threads of the story are not adequately explained (at least not in the version I saw) but why should that matter? I can imagine my own ending for them, for poor Coco and that sleazy photographer and the girl who had to have an abortion (and I can't forget how funny and tragic the scene of the girl's monologue about what a great dancer she's planning to be, all the while not realising what she's on about until the very end of the scene).Everything about the story was amazing but those that really did it for me were Doris, Montgomery and Raul/Ralph both in terms of performances and of their stories. Those three were very believable and sweet together.I gave it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the other review and had to comment. No, this film doesn't tie all the loose ends up in a neat package. That's what makes it to poignant. This film is one of just a few delightful musicals that you can file in the "Slice of Life" folder. It chronicles a handful of teens who are given an extraordinary opportunity and shows how they cope with it. We watch them develop over four years in their high school and then we see them graduate. We have no idea what will happen to them next. But that's not the point of the film. The point is that the choices they make and the obstacles they overcome contribute to who they are. All the things they go through don't dull their desire for FAME, they are still out there, fighting, everyday to get it.I think the ambiguity of the ending only makes it a more powerful picture. It's truly a classic as few films are brave enough to allow the audience to draw their own conclusions. I appreciate films that allow me to think and use my own imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this film was released, it was an apparent flop.Someone decided, a few years later to make a TV series from it. I remember watching in the early 80s just after Top of the Pops on a Thursday...never missed an episode.Then the film was released on video (to cash in on the success of the series) and I was sorely disappointed with it.However a few years after the series left our screens, I watched the film again and it grew on me. It had a raw edge that the series was never allowed to have.The characters in the film appeared to be rather more seedy (maybe gritty is a better description) than in the series (even the very innocent Bruno Martelli had more bite) and most importantly, the film introduced me to The Rocky Horror Picture Show (another film I thought was rubbish on first screening).Now more than 20 years on, I have occasionally caught an episode of the series on satellite television and have now come to realise how crass it was...the film however is now a cult classic and has now been added to my DVD collection, wedged in between Grease &amp; Saturday Night Fever (I might even add Flashdance &amp; Footloose to this section one day).</fullReview>

This is also a great example of director Alan Parker's(Mississippi Burning, Angel Heart, Midnight Express, and yuck!! "Evita) work. A truly great film that really shows what its like to be studying to have a career in performing arts, and also reminds us of that time period.

		<fullReview>If you ever try to make a film, view this one. "Fame (1980)" has many starting points and one culminating point. It all comes together in the "Body Electric" song. The denouement is left open for individual reflection. This film is not, to my mind, about the characters on the screen. It is about us - ordinary everyday people -who wish to succeed. It is about opportunities, realising who you really are, and chances missed. Question: "Are we all cut out to be "stars"? "Well are you?" How do you measure up against the competition? Not in your mind - but in reality? Today, "Fame", may seem a little dated in style. But it is nevertheless relevant in more ways than many other films of this genre are today; perhaps in more ways than most imagine. Merely consider: Ethnic, religious and other cultural groupings - in all their variations. How many similar films featured similar comparisons in the same way in 1980?This film is beautifully edited with a well-mixed sound track. There are, however, some aspects of the edit and mix I would have done differently. But this is 25 years later!To the people who pan de Palma's work, especially "Fame" I say: Try to do it yourself!John CTIFS RSA</fullReview>

Truthfully, I feel sorry for the people in the cars who have to wait in heavy NY traffic not because of an car accident or a pothole, because the dance kids have to break out into a impromptu dance number.I'm not saying this film doesn't have a good premise, but the way it is executed almost makes me want to execute the guy agreed to make this(which is ironic considering I like Parker's The Wall and Angela's Ashes and almost feel pity he was put here to direct). The plot follows a group of teens who get accepted into the NY school of performing arts and shows how tough it is too get in and how tough it is to stay in. There are some moments of insight and even some good performances. But the overall corniness and horrible quality bring this film to a halt. Blah. D</fullReview>
