		<shortDescription>Generally despised and loathed "video nasty". I liked it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I FINALLY got to see this infamous shocker after hearing about it for years. 'Antropophagus' a.k.a. 'The Grim Reaper' is one of the most despised and loathed of all the so-called "video nasties", and director Joe D'Amato seems to be regarded as little more than a figure of fun for many. The people who hate this movie usually call it "boring", "dull", "too slow", and so on for the most part, and then complain about the bad taste of the two infamous gore scenes towards the end. One involving a pregnant woman, the other the killer. I won't go into any detail regarding either scene so as to not lessen their shock value. Now, the strange thing is I inadvertently watched the DVD of 'The Grim Reaper' which cut both of these scenes out, and while I was sorely disappointed not seeing them, I didn't find the rest of the movie dull at all. In fact I thought the movie managed to create quite an effective feeling of dread and suspense throughout. While I don't think the movie is as strong as Fulci's 'Zombie' (which also starred Tisa Farrow), I enjoyed it a lot more than say, 'Zombie Holocaust', which is generally rated higher by many hard core horror fans. So make of that what you will. My advice though is try and see the original uncut 'Antropophagus' for maximum effect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Demented D'Amato Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Immediately banned in many countries after its release, Joe D'Amato's Italian Gore Classic "Antropophagus" of 1980 is a truly disturbing and immensely scary video nasty, and fans of ultra-violent and nasty Horror should not be disappointed. Potential viewers have to be warned, however: You need a strong stomach for this! The uncut version of "Antropophagus" features some of the most graphic and disturbing and goriest acts of violence you will ever see in a movie, and if there was a ranking of the most out there gore scenes ever brought to screen, this sick little flick would easily make it in the top 10! I don't want to give the most shocking scenes away, but I assure that anyone about to watch this flick can prepare for extremely horrid gore scenes.A couple of tourists travel to a Greek island which they find deserted at their arrival. It quickly becomes clear that something evil is haunting the place. Something with an appetite for human flesh...Whether you like it or not, "Antropophagus" is a movie that you will not forget quickly! In case you don't like gore this is not your type of film, but in case you do, avoid any censored version and watch this demented Cult-sicko uncut. There is simply no point in watching cut versions of Exploitation-King Joe D'Amato's movies, and "Antropophagus" in particular is a movie that is intended to shock, so the uncut version is essential. Apart from its shocking violence, "Antropophagus" maintains a very scary atmosphere, and its cast includes many familiar faces for Italian Horror fans, such as Tisa Farrow and George Eastman (whom Spaghetti Western fans might also know).In case you are easily offended, avoid this movie! But if you're a fan of Italian Gore films and Exploitation, you should certainly not miss this one! I advise my fellow Horror-fans to get a beer, lean back and start to enjoy the sick imagination of Joe D'Amato... When the movie reaches its climax, you will only be using the edge of your chair!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary as hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a rather jaded horror/exploitation fan, rarely do I find anything that actually shocks me or scares me to the core (although there are some D'Amato films I refuse to ever watch!). I was rather disappointed with his "masterpiece" Buio Omega, so I didn't have high hopes for this one, either. But when I found a copy of Anthropophagus, I couldn't pass up the opportunity. I popped it in not expecting to be all too wowed by it, and boy, was I surprised. This is the first movie in a long time that I can honestly say scared the life out of me. Most D'Amato sleaze isn't worth a second thought, but I found myself engulfed by Anthropophagus. Not very often do you find exploitation films that are actually scary, as they're usually just shocking and grotesque. This makes D'Amato's film very unique to me. What I think he did better than most schlock was that he used actual tricks of the scary movie trade, rather than just thinking of the most vomit worthy ideas imaginable (which are still present here). He uses horror techniques such as great cinematography, character development, and perhaps the best part, one hell of a fear inspiring monster.The horror starts in the opening scene, when two teenagers on a beach are killed in a very gory fashion. We learn more of these two later. It cuts to the main characters, a group of family and friends: Andy, Maggie, Daniel, Arnold, Carol, and a kind stranger, Julie, who they decide to let come along. They're all heading for a small island in the Mediterranean for some vacation time, except for Julie, who's there to meet up with those two killed on the beach. They arrive to a mysteriously deserted town, save one woman who disappears from sight often. As night falls, the group soon fears that something horrible is happening, and they begin to panic when a pregnant Maggie goes missing. They decide to search the house they're staying in when they find Rita, a blind girl who is a friend of Julie's. She says something has killed everyone on the island except her, because she is the only one who can sense when the killer is coming and is able to hide. Later, when Carol finds Julie and Daniel kissing, she runs off and locks Julie in a cemetery, while all but Rita and Daniel go to find her. Unfortunately for those two, Rita senses the killer later that night, and Danny is butchered. The terrified survivors then set out to unravel the mystery, rescue the still missing Maggie, and find the strange disappearing woman. One by one, the victims fall to the Grim Reaper, leaving Julie and Rita alone with the slowly approaching monster. Can they escape?Anthropophagus manages to be a very effective scary movie without any flash or special effects by going back to the basics. Simple techniques like creaking steps or strange sounds in the basement helps build tension, and the release is some of the scariest jump moments I've ever experienced. The scene where the group is searching the basement is one of the most eerie in the movie, and then, completely unexpectedly, Rita jumps out of casket with a knife in her hand. I literally jumped from my chair. After these scares, it manages to keep the atmosphere, because whatever is stalking them, whatever this monster is trying to kill them is still an unknown to the audience. When he's finally revealed in the bedroom, my stomach dropped out. His appearance is so strange, so grotesque, that it makes him one of the most fear inspiring creatures ever in movies. What makes him scary is that you can see that he's still just a man. He's not some strange sea creature or alien. He's an insane, disfigured, and emotionally tormented human being running rampant (he's actually a very sad character). Instead of having him kill everyone in an insane, bloody onslaught, he chooses his victims carefully, stalks them, and dispatches them in unexpected and disgusting turns of events. Included are some of the most appalling scenes ever thought of, most notably the bite out of the fetus. Displays such as this not only make Anthropophagus a legitimate scare fest, but keeps it as hardcore horror. D'Amato really works his magic with this one.Of course, nothing's perfect. A big problem with Anthropophagous is long, drawn out scenes of characters slowing walking around the island, either doing nothing or searching for survivors. These scenes are extended within an inch of their lives, and are meant only to pad running time. That's what I found wrong with Buio Omega: too much filler, not enough action. When you get to the last half hour, then the movie flies into gear and knocks you out with a punch, but other than that, there are some notable events here and there, but it's mostly rather dull. Still, just that last half hour makes it one of my favorite thrillers of all-time, and personally, one of the scariest movies ever. Of course, this is unusual, because not only is D'Amato not known for thrillers, but this movie is usually considered simply dull, gross, and an over-the-top video nasty. Too often are movies cast aside simply because of grotesque content, with no other aspects considered. This is never included in lists of actually good movies, so most people are probably going to disagree with my review. I'll say it boldly and proudly; Anthropophagus is one hell of a horror movie, and is one of the scariest movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably One of My All Time Favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie under the title of The Grim Reaper. Most of us fans of the movie probably have as well. Surprisingly, I had never heard about this movie until a few years ago. I remember watching it and think that there was something about this movie that was above most of its competition. Of course, I hadn't seen the uncut version of the film yet so I was just going off of the atmosphere. When I was told what I was missing in the uncut version I had to find it. Obviously, I did. And it wasn't through Shriek Shows new DVD.A group of people, including Tisa Farrow of Zombi 2 fame, set sail to a secluded island. Upon setting shore, they notice that no one is in site and begin to find dead mummified bodies throughout the town. They don't realize that an extremely impending figure has murdered everyone on the island and they are next.Sounds simple and it is. George Eastman who plays The Monster even says in an interview that this movie was only made to make money. There was nothing artistic about it. But, nevertheless, the movie is great. Obviously, this movie is not for everyone as some find it boring and over-hyped. I happen to love this film. The sense of impending doom covers this movie from top to bottom. And the 2 particular controversial scenes are great. Sure, the special effects are terrible but it is the thought of what is happening that makes you realize how sick this really is.I am not a huge fan of D'amato's works but this movie is excellent. For any real collector of horror, this is a must have. By the way, I did end up picking up The Shiek Show release of the movie. It is well worth having. But, if you can find the original American version of the movie I would get it also, under the title of The Grim Reaper. The music selection in certain scenes are different. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the fans of truly sick stuff....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty cool movie, although I do reckon that you need to be a little sick in the head in order to truly enjoy Joe D'Amato's wicked imagination. "Antropophagus" (LOVE the title!!) is a notorious video-nasty because it contains shock-sequences that ...well...aren't exactly for the squeamish! The pivot figure is a savage and bloodthirsty man that prowls a Greek island (Greek islands are dangerous tourist places apparently...anyone remember 'Island of Death'?) and devours pretty much everything and everyone that crosses his path. The film focuses on the encounter between this maniac and a group of young tourists that coincidentally strand on the island. Apart from the downright nauseating gore (he eats a fetus, for Christ's sake!), this is a rather suspenseful and atmospheric Italian horror film that surely ranks among D'Amato's best work, alongside "Beyond the Darkness" and "Death Smiles at Murder". In case you're a fellow Italian horror fanatic, you'll love the cast that includes George Eastman, Tisa Farrow and Serena Grandi. True, there are some really tedious moments to sit through but the gore is rewarding and the music is terrific. There equally is some gratuitous sleaze to enjoy, as well as some nice photography. Due to its violent and raw nature, "Antropophagus" is one of the most cut films ever. Avoid any version that says "Grim Reaper" on the cover because that's the version that leaves out all the sweet nastiness you're so desperately looking for :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very crude and disturbing horror with one of the most sinister killers ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have already seen this classic formula in horror films, in which a group of young friends go on vacation to a far-away land, only to find their trip cut short by a series of fortuitous and gory events, followed by an imminent death. "Antropophagus" manages to stand out in its own way, by offering a genuinely frightening villain, extreme gruesome deaths and a perfect setting for the story. I have always thought that the locations of a horror film sometimes have a greater role than the central characters of the story. In this case, the scenario in which the action takes place is a beautiful island in Europe; a beautiful island indeed, but also a devastating scenario that causes a feeling of isolation and vulnerability.In "Antropophagus", a group of travelers go on a trip to Greece and are joined by a young woman named Julie, who asks them for a ride to an island because she wants to meet some friends. The group agrees to go to the island with Julie, except for Maggie, who stays on the boat, because she finds herself unable to walk due to an ankle injury. When the group leaves, a creepy man breaks into the boat, killing the sailor, and taking Maggie with him. While the group explores the seemingly deserted island, they come across a rotten dead body, so they rush back to the boat, only to find it adrift. Julie suggests taking shelter at her friends' house, and when they get there, they find the family's blind daughter in an utter state of panic. The teenage girl, named Henerietta explains them that her family was killed some days ago by a lunatic. Later, the friends find out that most of the island residents were murdered by the same insane killer, a man named Nikos, who feasts on human flesh and is now out to get them. I have seen hundreds of horror films and I can honestly say that I am not easily frightened. While I can see that certain horror villains, such as Michael Myers, are frightening and creepy looking, that's basically it; I can acknowledge their creepiness, while not necessarily being afraid of them. With this film, I was genuinely afraid of the antropophagus (performed by the surprisingly good-looking Luigi Montefiori). The cannibalistic villain appears as a gruesome man, with hideous scars all over his face, shredded clothes and most of all, a very sinister smile and crazy eyes that give the impression that he is a wicked combination between a man and a ravenous wild animal that is about to catch his prey. The antropophagus is definitely one of the most intimidating villains I have seen and his image is haunting. "Antropophagus" features some very effective chase sequences full of suspense and desperation, in which the killer unstoppably goes after his human prey with ferociousness in his eyes and a deranged smile. The gore is plentiful and intense, which made my stomach turn once or twice, while not necessarily making this film a torture show. I admit I am easily impressed by gore and I tend to dislike extreme brutality, even when it looks ridiculously fake. However, just like I feel about "Cannibal Holocaust", sometimes gore is justified, when is not just there for the sake of seeing guts scattered all over the place. In some cases, like it happens with this film, the crudeness of the gore contribute to evoke feelings of vulnerability, despair and even anxiety. The lead actress is Tisa Farrow (Mia's less known sister) who gave her last performance in this film, in which she accurately provided everything we expect on a lead girl from a classic horror movie: she's beautiful, but also angelic and innocent. Her character is likable and nice, but also capable of becoming a warrior towards the end and facing that horrible man that is out to get her. And speaking of the devil, the antropophagus himself is played by Italian actor Luigi Montefiori (who goes by the name of George Eastman in this film). I have never seen Montefiori in anything else, except "Antropophagus", but I honestly have to say that this is one of the scariest horror villains I have seen in basically 20 years as a horror fan. His performance should be praised, as well as the makeup artists who turned the handsome Montefiori into a horrible beast-like creature that literally gave me nightmares. To this day, "Antropophagus" remains as one of my favorite horror films, although in all honestly, I don't see it very often, because I actually find it scary and even depressing for moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Antropophagus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An group of tourists offer to give an American, Julie(Tisa Farrow), a ride to an island village where pals of hers(..a French couple we see killed at the opening of the film)were supposed to be waiting for her. Deciding to remain on the island for a spell, the group find the village without people, providing quite an ominous suspicion that something's amiss. When the sailboat they were riding is sent away mysteriously into the sea adrift, the group ponder why, holing up in the home of Julie's friends, awaiting for the night to fall, hoping that the boat would return to shore. The remaining members of the group do find a person in the village, but she remains elusive warning for them to leave the village. They then find the French couple's blind daughter who is deeply traumatized. But, what none of the visitors plan on is encountering a dangerous, psychopathic cannibal(George Eastman, in hideous make-up, with unhinged eyes..his build works to enhance how scary he looks as he approaches victims)without an ounce of humanity. He seems devoid of anything remotely civilized and there's a reason revealed later involving his son and wife in a raft isolated in the middle of the ocean.Aristide Massaccesi(Joe D'Amato)and George Eastman craft quite a sickening tale which has given "Antropophagus-The Grim Reaper" an assured following. "Antropophagus" is the very definition of a slow-burner as it idles along showing the tourists walking throughout the village(..modeled after the Greek Islands and looking eerily similar to Narciso Ibá?ez Serrador's "Island of the Damned")attempting to find any citizens. I love horror films which show visiting outsiders finding a complete village abandoned like a ghost town as if they just vanished off the face of the Earth, and seeing our cast moving throughout and finding no one certainly worked for me. I think this beautifully sets up just how monstrous the film's predator really is..such a menace that he empties a city of it's people. I think Massaccesi's decision to not show the killer until 50 minutes in will test the patience of many, but I felt that the director was building the dread of his arrival. I mean, we know that someone is on this island somewhere and I felt that Massaccesi wishes to keep him hidden for as long as possible. His impact to the film, when he does arrive, is immediately felt when Eastman's fiend bites a plug of skin from the neck of a victim. He'll also bite a chunk of flesh from a throat later in the film when he pulls a victim's face through the hole of a mansion's ceiling. The most infamous death concerns the removal of a fetus from a pregnant victim's womb(..Massaccesi said it was a rabbit)taking a bite out of it. You also see the aftermath of a cleaver stabbed into a victim's face. Massaccesi even pays homage to Spielberg with an underwater attack at the very beginning reminiscent of Jaws. There's even the eating of intestines that will leave many jaws dropping to the floor in dismay. Massaccesi has shown(..as Buio Omega will prove)that he isn't afraid of making films with disturbing subject matter and scenes with (in)human behavior that shock. I think the film's finest moments occur when Massaccesi shoots the use of candle-light at night through the darkened rooms of the French couple's home with Julie and Bodin's Daniel encountering a frightened innocent hiding from Eastman's monster, and specifically the Roman catacombs where Eastman's lair of eaten bodies is located(..this is very akin to the work of Lucio Fulci with the presence of remains, corpses, skulls, bones &amp; red-eyed rats running about). The film also has a nifty sequence where Julie finds a hidden room where Eastman's sister kept many of his first victims through the breaking of a mirror, in the mansion of a family who worked for the village. Also, cool is a suicide where a woman decides to hang herself, and Julie, at one point, is trapped in a gated graveyard by a jealous Carol(Zora Kerova; who was upset because Daniel preferred Julie over her). A young Serena Grandi has an early role as the pregnant victim, Maggie, who is found by her husband in the catacombs. I think "Antropophagus" is very similar to Fulci's works at the time(..from "Zombie Flesh Eaters" into his more sadistic 80's gore flicks)and just as willing to push buttons, repelling weak-hearted audiences. To those of us who have seen a bunch of these movies, though, the impact isn't as severe, but I find his unflinching ability to shock rather amusing. But, I think it can be sensed, here, that when inspired, Massaccesi can create a sense of atmosphere. With the amazing setting, Marcello Giombini's often haunting music score, and Enrico Biribicchi's lush cinematography, Massaccesi had all the tools to make quite an impression. Unlike many, I didn't have any problem with the pace because my eyes were taking in the location and how it was brought to the screen. And, Eastman is quite an impressive beast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated shocker with a deliciously foul stench</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A perfect example of a "notorious" film that has been canned by many and seen (uncut) by few. As I have been in the latter bracket for years, I thought it was high time I chucked in my two cents worth.Not only do I like "Antropophagus" very much, I think D'Amato has been unfairly maligned. His "Emmanuelle and the Last Cannibals" (see my review), for example, is classic trash, and never less than enthralling. It zips along and delivers everything the ad art promises. It isn't dull and it's nicely shot, too. His "Beyond The Darkness" (see review) is also righteous exploitation, a shameless look at a deliciously revolting subject.Which brings me back to "Antropophagus". Often criticized for being boring, badly made and slow, it is none of those. Its island setting is atmospheric, D'Amato creates creeping suspense, and George Eastman, as the flesh eater, is memorably hideous. And the scene involving the removal of a fetus and its ingestion is just want genre fans ordered.There is a creeping sense of death and decay surrounding this fine horror entry and I, for one, appreciate its stench.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big George goes Greek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big George 'Luigi' Eastman 'Montifori' wreaks havoc on a Greek Island in a film I'd only ever seen in severely cut form (under the title 'The Grim Reaper'). Is this film any good in it's unedited form? Well, I liked it.After two German tourists are murdered on a beach, we get to meet Tisa Farrow (of Zombie Flesh Eaters and The Last Hunter) who appears once again in an Italian gore film, this time getting a lift to a Greek Island from some holidaymakers, including a pregnant woman, her husband, some guy, his sister, and another guy and a sailor. The sister does tarot cards and doesn't like what she sees, and she doesn't like Tisa either because the guy she fancies keeps putting the moves on Tisa instead of her, even though due to the very blurred copy I watched both of them looked almost exactly the same.They all sail to the island and find it strangely deserted. The pregnant woman hurts her leg, and is soon kidnapped by someone who cuts of the sailor's head (and puts it in a bucket for safekeeping). The rest wander around town, catching fleeting glimpses of a mysterious woman and finding another survivor who keeps rambling on about how someone killed everyone on the island. Our poor victims gather in a house, wandering what to do, and how to get back to their ship, which is now adrift. Plus, a storm hits the island.I'll warn you now: Even though you get to see a couple of killings near the beginning, it's fifty one minutes before Big George puts in an appearance! What a sight he is though, all seven foot of him done up like some one man zombie army. Once he shows up, he tries to munch down on those who remain, but who will survive and will we get to see a certain character eat his own intestines (which was entirely cut out of the British print)? Although slow, and cheap, Anthropophagus neatly builds up the suspense so when Big George does appear he's really creepy and daunting. The whole empty island thing helps the film a lot (as it did in Island of Death and The Wind)?maybe folks should make more films set in Greece. And is it just me or does this whole premise rear it's head in Stephen King's Desperation? You know, the 'one person killing an entire town' thing?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Also known as "Man-Eater" or "The Grim Reaper". This film is a definitive must-see for all lovers of those 70s Euro horror trash flicks!!! Nearly the whole time there is nothing happening, the actors behave as if they were in a soft porn and the special F/X are pretty cheesy! But "Antropophagus" has his very own charm that makes him so enjoyable: the last 15 minutes are a real splatterfest and main actor George Eastman is giving an immortal horror film performance with playing the insane man-eater. Two notorious scenes made this movie being legendary:- in one scene George Eastman tears out the embryo out of the stomach of a pregnant woman. - at the end a heavy wounded man-eater starts to eat his own guts...Not to forget that trash mastermind Joe D´Amato was really able to create a pretty creepy atmosphere! If you liked "Antropophagus" check out his great "Erotic Nights of the living dead" - a semi-porn zombie shocker that also stars the outstanding George Eastman!!!Euro horror trash at its best!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously creepy and pretty dang grisly, if kinda slow exploitation favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got to see this gem, my first taste of Joe d'Amato's work. I was struck quickly by two things. One, that the film is quite slow moving, as many have criticised it for. It is probably a tad too slow, which is why I can't give it the highest score, since if it had been say, five to seven minutes faster I wouldn't have had to check my watch a couple times to see how long was left. However despite the slow pace, the film, for me had a vice like unnerving grip at many points, with its flashes of grue, desolate island locale and of course the promise of some legendary gore to come. With Tisa Farrow (Zombie Flesh Eaters) and Zora Kerova (Cannibal Ferox) among the tourists present, somewhat unfortunately on this doom laden place the film is a feast for Italian horror fans, even without George Eastman lurking. Eastman, when he gets to really shine towards the end makes for a truly vicious and maniacal adversary but ingeniously, is slightly more shaded a character than your average murderous terror, giving a whole lot more interest and even an odd sort of sympathy. Sure he's evil, but one gets the sad feeling things could have been better for him. Nothing to complex, but it does go a little beyond generic yar boo hiss the evil monster territory and George Eastman conveys it brilliantly. As to the two real famous bits, well, if the principle sounds really gross to you than the scenes probably will be, though if jaded like me, they'll most likely just make you grin. I can't right now recall if there was nudity, but it doesn't matter, this is less sleaze and more a spooky horror piece. Some will no doubt find this boring, overrated, silly, etc, all the usual criticisms of this sort of thing. Personally, though not quite my top Italian horror outing, I thought this was really rather awesome stuff. At the very least, give it a whirl (uncut only).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow-Moving But Ultimately Satisfying Horror/Sleaze From Joe D'Amato</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing about D'Amato, is he can take the most straight-forward film and make it over-the-top and sleazy...and that's why he's one of my favorite directors. He always goes just a little "too far" and I commend him for that. In ANTHROPOPHAGOUS - ol' Joe is up to his old tricks - but this time, he saves his over-the-top elements til the end for maximum impact, and otherwise weaves a pretty atmospheric (yet admittedly slow-paced) horror film. Not the constant shock-fest of BUIO OMEGA, nor the all-out sleazy exploitation of EROTIC NIGHTS OF THE LIVING DEAD - ANTHROPOPHAGOUS is more of a serious horror film with some "shocking" scenes thrown in for good measure.This one starts with a group of vacationers who decide to head to a secluded island for some R&amp;R. Turns out the island is nearly uninhabited, and when the vacationers get stranded there - they start to piece together what happened to the original inhabitants of the island. Turns out a cannibalistic weirdo still roams the island, just waiting to pick off anyone who crosses his path. And soon enough, the vacationers will get to meet him face-to-face...A lot of people down ANTHROPOPHAGOUS for it's slow pace - which I can't really argue - but overall, the film is handled competently. The story is drawn out slowly and the island sets and backdrops are simultaneously beautiful and yet still creepy and atmospheric at the same time. The "bad-guy" is also suitable creepy and bugged-out looking - and the gore scenes at the end make up for the slow pace as the last 20 minutes or so are pretty fast-paced. There are some decent throat-bitings with tons of blood - a decent intestines-eating, and of course, the notorious fetus-eating scene which is the reason that the un-cut version of this film is so sought after. That scene is pretty cool - but is very short and still appears to be cut down. Overall, not my favorite D'Amato film - I'll still stick with BUIO OMEGA or EMANNUELLE IN America - but ANTHROPOPHAGOUS is worth a look too, if you go into it knowing that you'll have to wait a while for the "pay-off"... 8/10</fullReview>

Up until now, I thought "Buio Omega" (aka "Beyond The Darkness") was about the only film I found to really live up to its notorious reputation, while still being a reasonably good film. And as far as I'm concerned, after just having watched "Atropophagus", it still is the only one. Plain and simple, "Antropophagus" was a mild disappointment of the boring kind. It couldn't fascinate me the way "Buio Omega" did, mainly because it drags in so many places, it becomes tedious very quick. So, a bunch of characters on a holiday - all good folks, as they don't drink alcohol, they don't smoke, do drugs or have sex either - get stranded on a Greek island. Not ship wrecked, just stranded as they loose their boat. They find an abandoned village, decide to spend the night there, and rather later than sooner, some mysterious killer starts abducting and killing them off one by one. It takes even longer for them to figure out exactly what's going on behind their backs.Now, D'Amato sure knows how to present us grisly images, creepy settings and at times inject his film with a bit of atmosphere. He also knows how to make gore look good on screen. But building up tension, clearly isn't his strongest skill (he does try, but doesn't really succeed). Also, the man has absolutely no clue how to make a decent film (with an interesting plot or how to construct a proper mystery) nor does he know how to get on with the story. The acting is awful, the dialogues are close to moronic and the movie suffers too often from scenes in which nothing is going on, really, and even senseless &amp; illogical things occur. Like for instance, those two guys deciding to leave the village to go down to the beach to try and look for someone who was still left on the boat. Now, instead of walking down the hill, to the sea, one of them is suddenly seen walking up the mountain for no apparent reason, only to find some ruins of a castle. Him finding them by coincidence, is very convenient to the plot, of course, as it proves to be one of the hideouts of George Eastman, our demented Cannibal Man from the title of this film. And when it comes to his character, I'll admit I was thankful they gave him some sort of background story, as to why he became what he is. Though it was a very thin explanation, with little info and no elaborations, at least there was one. That did put my fear for this being merely a film about an unknown cannibalistic lunatic (of whom we learn nothing) on some island to rest.On the other hand, the subplot about the mysterious woman in black was severely - shamefully, even - underused. Of course, you suspect from the get-go that she has certain ties with Eastman's character, but all she ever does, is stand behind a couple of windows. Well, actually, she does something else too (later on in the film), her act making up for a fine, short-lived scene. But what she does, doesn't add anything to her character, nor the story. To switch to a positive note again, Eastman's make-up was good. It really succeeds in making him look gruesome and menacing.Then there was that one scene, earlier in the film, when a couple was investigating a basement. Another highlight, that's at the same time also a low-point. Suddenly and very obviously, some set assistant out of frame, just throws a kitten on a piano. A fantastic fake jump scare, of course. Well done, D'Amato! But then, the real shock-scare comes on, and that one really is priceless. Behind our couple, is a barrel. Suddenly, a woman covered in blood from head to toe, jumps out, screaming, waving a knife. Great shock-moment, I agree. But only if you don't think about it. If you do, for a second, then explain this to me: The barrel was filled to the top with blood - I presume, or was it wine? Inside, was a woman (waiting to jump out). Now all that time our couple was searching the basement, that woman was holding her breath in that barrel of blood? Or was she drinking the wine? This is typically D'Amato throwing logic and plausibility out the window, only to favor presenting us his precious shock-moment. It turns a cool moment, into sheer stupidity.The musical score was at times, uh, both amusing and interesting. The big mansion near the end was a great location. And the film had that typical late 70's/early 80's gritty feel to it. But it takes more than all this to make a good film, doesn't it? The couple of death scenes we do see, are fine and bloody, with decent make-up effects. And the two most notorious gory shock-moments (which only happen near the end), are well worth seeing. But the whole film really isn't worth sitting through just for that. You might just ask a friend who was the film, to show you the nasty bits and be done with it. But make sure it's the complete uncut version.I understand the cult following this film has (D'Amato, George Eastman and the few gory bits, I imagine), and I am glad I finally saw it myself (it is kind of a must-see, if you are into obscure &amp; vintage Italian exploitation horror). But I can't say I watched a good film here. I would like to flunk it, even, but looking at it from all possible perspectives, I find myself able to conclude that as an exploitive shock horror feature, trying to be sickening &amp; unsettling (and hoping to upset your stomach), well... it does succeed. So there you have it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't see it for the gore, see it for the scares!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antropophagus from director Joe D'Amato is a pretty notorious movie, mainly for making it's way onto the infamous UK "Video Nasty" list. When your hear about this movie you probably hear about its gore, mainly 2 infamous scenes that cemented its place in the list. I think this reputation hurts the film though because, in all honesty, the gore in this movie is pretty weak (except one scene that I will get to). People go into this movie expecting a very nasty and extremely gory horror movie but come out pretty disappointed at the shoddy gore effects and extremely slow pace...Well, that's because they overlooked all the great and more subtle things that the movie DOES deliver on.First off, this movie is creepy, a combination of atmosphere, music and a wonderfully over-the-top performance from George Eastman make this movie one of the spookiest Italian slasher flicks I have ever seen. Scenes of characters exploring darkened corridors by candle light are some truly creepy scenes and sort of remind me of more classic horror movies from decades before. There are also some really great jump-scares too. The cat is cheap, but effective, the girl popping out of the wine barrel is definitely effective and lastly, the scene at the end where Eastman's character emerges from the well nearly stops my heart every time I see it! There is some fantastic atmosphere in this movie as well, the deserted Greek town is beautiful but haunting, whether they are walking through the halls of a house or the streets of the town there is always a feeling of something not quite being right.The Music heightens the creepiness of all the scenes so well. Some might consider it to be annoying but I would call it nerve-wracking. Finally, and most important, is Eastman's character... this man is disgusting, disturbed and definitely somebody you would NEVER want to meet in real life. He towers over everyone with his immense stature, the make-up is excellent in giving him a monster quality. His performance is so over-the-top but it provides the energy the movie needs to keep it going.If there is one thing that I think sets Joe D'Amato apart from the rest of the Italian horror directors, it's the way he ends his movies. All his movies I have seen contain a wonderfully shocking and over-the-top climax. I think Antropophagus has the best climax of all too. I will try not to give too much away but basically Eastman's character reveals how truly mad he really is (as if he could be any madder) and in a fit of insanity we finally get rewarded with the one truly excellent and extremely disturbing gore effect that wont leave your mind for days to come.Everything else is pretty standard when it comes to Italian exploitation but I do think it's worth mentioning that there are some above average performances from Tisa Farrow (Zombi 2) and Zora Kerova (Cannibal Ferox) that make the characters a little more likable than your average slasher.In the end, I think Antropophagus is a really great Italian horror that should be appreciated for it's scares, not its gore. Don't listen to the hype, cause it's misleading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>D'Amato Devouring His Children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(contains major spoilers)If you grew up in the 1980's, obsessed (like me) with the magazines "Fangoria", "Psychotronic", and "Cinefantastique", the term 'Video Nasty' may have held a sort of dark reverence. Coined in the UK after the passing of their government's 1984 Video Recordings Act, 'Video Nasty' came to refer to all those movies that either had cuts forced upon them before release, or (in the best cases) were simply banned outright. A list was generated by the BBFC (British Board of Film Censors) of all the films deemed nasty, thereby single-handedly creating a must-see list of which dreams are made for all the shock-loving young ones ? like myself. One of the most infamous of these titles was Joe D'Amato's Anthropophagus, aka The Grim Reaper, Man Eater, The Zombie's Rage, ad nauseam.The film takes place on a deserted Greek island, where a group of mostly coupled tourists come across a young, terrified blind girl ? the only person seemingly left on the god- forsaken rock. The little village is completely devoid of its inhabitants, despite the fact that all their belongings still seem to be in place. No one so much left, as they seem to have simply disappeared into thin air. The hysterical girl can't provide any clear answers; just that she's terrified of a creature that stalks the land, smelling of rot and blood. In classic '10 Little Indians' fashion, the tourists began to disappear one by one, or in the best cases, two at a time. Discovering a diary that explains just who/what the 'creature' is, the survivors thus far soon have no choice but to confront this hideous terror, as their sole means of escape from the island soon becomes sabotaged.I must emphasize that Anthropohagus contains two of the most notorious scenes in the annals of Italian Horror, if not in all of horror. If there were ever to be a Canon of Cinematic Gore, they would be required reading/viewing. You see, the 'creature' is in fact a once-normal man, having been forced into cannibalizing his own dead wife and child after the were shipwrecked. This drove him insane, of course, and he eventually came to devour the entire inhabitants of the little island he later happened upon. As for one of these notorious scenes I mentioned above, the now-Cannibal eventually gets to kidnapping the one tourist who's about nine months pregnant. In what can only now be described as classic D'Amato fashion, the Cannibal forcibly rips the fetus from the woman's belly and devours it right in front of her dying eyes (Yes, you read that correctly). The other legendary moment ? the finale ? I'll leave mention without description.Born Aristede Massaccesi in Rome 1936, D'Amato was one of the most infamous filmmakers in exploitation cinema. The name D'Amato was one so laden with notoriety that getting away with renting one of his films before you were eighteen years old was considered the greatest of feats in the eyes of underage video-store goers. And when I found The Zombie's Rage on video as a kid, knowing that it was actually Anthropophagus, it was as if I'd won the lottery ? although yes, it was edited.In the early '80s however, D'Amato hit a glorious stride with a trilogy of feverish, demonic gore films (which include Buio Omega and Absurd) of which Anthropophagus is the second and best of the lot. Tisa Farrow heads the cast along with Italian cult-cinema icon, and frequent D'Amato collaborator, George Eastman. Eastman portrays the Cannibal with a method-intensity that's incredibly terrifying, and therefore so pleasing to my always-hungry horror-gland; in particular, when he stalks his victims at night.One thing can almost always be said about a D'Amato film: no matter how disturbed, disgusted, offended and/or repulsed one is by the content, it's very hard to argue against how beautifully they're shot. D'Amato loved the camera, had great respect for the technical aspects of the medium itself, used lighting not just to highlight actors and actions, but to forcibly instill mood and tension onto the viewer. There are moments during the nighttime chase scenes in Anthropophagus that can chill me to the bone just by thinking of them. The blue light of the full-moon night, and its accompanied bursts of bright lightning, fill the chase with a matchless anxiety ? you don't want Tisa and the blind girl to get caught, but you don't want the beauty of the scene to end either.So why so any self-respecting Horror fan see Anthropohagus? Because I must acknowledge and accept the turn Italian Horror made during the '70s, for better or for worse. The level of popularity that gore, ultra-violence, and exploitation garnered in that decade has yet to recede (and likely never will), and not just in Italian and Euro Horror, but in genre the world over; something deep down inside my moral imprinting whispers to me that this fact is possibly/probably wrong on many levels, both personally and politically. Anthropophagus creates an ethical catch-22 for me, which is perhaps the reason I love it so. The film is revolting, offensive, utterly devoid of sympathy or romance, yet it contains a professional technique and visceral allegro that is so attractive to my amoral retina.With this trilogy of horror, D'Amato and Eastman conjured some of the most grotesque and nightmarish cinematic imagery man can think of ? imagery that reminds me of the Black Paintings of Goya, or the work of Joel-Peter Witkin. One my laugh at the comparison, but I had yet to see a film that could compare to Goya's Saturn Devouring His Children (the most frightening painting I've ever seen) until I finally saw the uncut Anthropophagus again as an adult a few years back. Before, as The Zombie's Rage, I was caught up in watching something I shouldn't ? funny thing is 20 years later, watching it as Anthropophagus, I still feel that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gory, but fun Italian, cannibal/slasher film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven tourists get stranded while visiting a Greek island &amp; come to learn that the entire place is completely deserted. While searching around, one of the girls finds her friend whom she was planning on visiting on the island, hiding away &amp; covered in blood. She keeps saying she can "Smell him" but the group has no idea who she's talking about. Eventually the boat they came on drifts further out to sea while they are gone, a friend goes missing &amp; a mysterious woman is watching them from afar. Soon they begin to fall prey to a a demented looking, cannibalistic boogeyman, that butchers &amp; then eats them up. With the body count quickly rising, the remaining survivors must try &amp; get off the island &amp; stop the vicious maniac, but can they? or will they too fall prey to this cannibalistic maniac?ANTHROPOPHAGUS is a pretty entertaining, if albeit brutal Italian horror film that should please fans of the horror genre looking for a pretty scary, suspenseful, atmospheric &amp; gory horror film, that definitely is not to afraid to cross the line in terms of gore &amp; violence. The direction by Joe D' Amato is really good as he manages to capture the beautiful scenery of the Greek island well on camera &amp; the film also tends to go over the line in terms of the gore &amp; kills, more particularly in a disturbing scene wherein the killer devours a woman's baby &amp; that's not all, other kills are pretty brutal as well, as we see a half torn scalp, two vicious throat bitings, a bloody hanging, a severed head in a bucket, a meat cleaver in the skull, a vicious stabbing &amp; at the climax, the killer devours his own guts! D' Amato also manages to deliver a few suspenseful scenes, more particularly when TISA FARROW is dangling by her tied wrist in a well, with the maniac below crawling up the wall to get her &amp; the Greek island is both beautiful &amp; quiet eerie at the same time. Most of the acting works &amp; the characters seem to mesh well together.That said ANTHROPOPHAGUS does have a few short comings, the score is relatively silly, especially the opening music that sounds like it was taken from an Italian comedy &amp; the film has quiet a few slow spots that I felt could have been written around, even shortened to make the film tighter &amp; more suspenseful.All in all, ANTHROPOPHAGUS is strictly for fans of Italian horror cinema. Those raised on the kiddie horrors of the 1990's or even some horror fans with weak stomachs are best to stay well away! Remade in 1999 as ANTHROPOPHAGUS 2000 by German goremeister Andreas Schnaas but it was so scantly distributed, that you would have a better chance finding the almost impossible to find sequel ABSURD (a.k.a. ANTHROPOPHAGUS 2 &amp; MONSTER HUNTER) in comparison.*** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerie because of the Greek ghost town and atmosphere, brutal because of the good gore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creepy and unsettling Italian slasher that without being pretentious pays homage to American slashers and at the same time capitalized the success of the American style back in the early 80's.The Uncut version has raised controversy mainly because of two gruesome sequences including the cannibal eating a woman's fetus and the later being his demise when he tries to eat his own guts after being slaughtered. Two magnificent scenes for lovers of gore.Still, the movie is not all about blood, gore, or brutal death sequences. "Antropophagus" is a suspenseful movie that creates a creepy atmosphere based on an eerie Greek ghost town, an easy to follow but interesting plot, and believable performances (specially by Tisa Farrow and George Eastman).The score is also perfect and creates the other half of the movie's atmosphere and dark vibe.By any means a let down, I'd say it's a worth Italian slasher with excellent gore, perfect creepy atmosphere, and terrific art direction.A must see for those who enjoy good gore and tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Europe as the self-devouring beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D'Amato's horror film is notorious from its placement on the UK's video nasties list, and certain scenes in it do push the viewer into the outer reaches of stomach churning disgust. The film also has a reputation as one of the worst films on the list, with accusations that it is boring, inconsequential, absurd. It doesn't even seem to be popular amongst D'Amato aficionados. Yet it's a striking work ? full of atmospheric tension, horrific visions and the caustic misanthropy about contemporary society which was D'Amato's stock-in-trade.The film begins in the luxurious setting of a Greek island, where a couple of German tourists ? swim-wear clad and equipped with the mod-con accoutrements of the early 1980s ? are sunbathing and swimming only to be attacked and murdered by a mysterious figure. This offers a prologue to the main action, in which the same attacker menaces a larger group of Italian tourists who are island hopping and who happen to stop on the killer's island because they've picked up a boat-hiker who is going to be working there as the companion of a blind girl. As usually happens in a stalk-and-slash film, the killer ? a giant cannibal played by regular D'Amato collaborator George Eastman (who also scripted) ? picks the tourists off one by one and murders by munching into their necks and chomping on their flesh.The tourists are a typical bunch of middle-class twenty-somethings, concerned with sightseeing, their relationships and grabbing some sun. One of the party happens to have an interest in Tarot cards, and she reads those of one of her companions, a pregnant woman. Unhappily, she sees nothing in the cards, which she takes to suggest that the querent has "no future." This prophecy has an echo of the Sex Pistols' corrosive refrain in their God Save the Queen, a song which predicts the same "No Future" for English consumer society of roughly the same era. And like the Pistols' great anti-Monarchist song, D'Amato's film identifies the cause of no future as coming from those at the top of the social pile. We discover that the cannibal is a scion of a wealthy merchant family, who live in what looks like a typical mercantile, colonial mansion on the Island. This fellow has been involved in a shipwreck, and found himself forced to squabble with his wife in a lifeboat over the body of their son, whose carcass was now the only meat they had. The wife objected, and the man stabbed her in a desperate struggle for survival, after which he seems to have developed a taste for human meat which he satisfies on his murderous spree. But there's something about the scene in the lifeboat which is emblematic of the struggle for survival, the Darwinian survival of the fittest which Capitalism foists on us all. In encountering the cannibal, the tourists are encountering the truth about the system which allows them to afford such luxurious holidays in the first place.D'Amato emphasises this sense of characters encountering the truth about themselves through their encounter with the cannibal by a series of shots in which they see themselves reflected shortly before seeing him. The German tourist sees himself reflected in the cannibals knife, the first dead Italian confronts a mirror shortly before death and later the boat-hiker has to smash a huge mirror in which she is reflected in order to find her way into his lair and discover his secrets. The cannibal, as in Sondheim's contemporaneous 1980 Broadway musical Sweeney Todd (later filmed by Tim Burton) is a ideal image of a Capitalistic society in which man devours man, a rampage of anthropophagy which ends here with the cannibal literally chewing on his own entrails, a self-devouring monster.The film's most infamous scene depicts the fate of the pregnant woman, whose unborn baby is ripped from her by the cannibal and the foetus devoured, fresh from the womb. There can be no more visceral an image of a child born into the world of No Future than this, yet those who see it as mere unnecessary nastiness on D'Amato's part might reflect that it has a partial real life analogy in the treatment meted out to Sharon Tate's unborn child in the Manson gang murders as well as a rather more classical forebear in the famous Goya painting of Cronos devouring his child (in D'Amato's film, the father looks on as his child is eaten by the cannibal, but if the mirror analogy holds, he is looking at an image of himself).Often in D'Amato's films, white Europeans are seen as cursed with a culture which is deadly, cannibalising and exploitative. In setting Anthropophagus on a Greek Island, D'Amato traces that cannibalistic tendency back to its source in the classical civilisation of the Greeks, here stripped of its Romantic, idealized associations and seen as a devouring demon ? a Minotaur in its island lair, feasting upon the young who are delivered by ship for sacrifice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Reason to Avoid Greek Islands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of young adults go to a Greek island, where things go from bad to worse when they find that everyone on the island -- with the exception of a blind girl -- has been killed. Clearly, they didn't see the exploitation film "Island of Death" to learn why Greek islands are bad. What they encounter is a man who is more beast than anything, with an insatiable thirst for human blood and flesh.This film has floated around under various names -- "Grim Repaer", "Man Eater" and the misspelled "Antropophagus" to name a few -- for quite some time, gaining notoriety for its banned status in England and two scenes which had to be cut when it was finally released (one involving a man eating his own intestines and the other with a baby being ripped from a womb and devoured). The hype is more than enough to get people to see the film, though it's tame by today's standards. (I hate to reference "Island of Death" yet again... but if you want to be shocked, the goat scene in that one easily outdoes anything shown here).I enjoyed this one. There's something about older horror films, even those with poor film quality, that have a value to them modern films lack. And the cannibal, played by George Eastman, is a disgusting creature in his own right. Even without the publicity or the previously cut scenes (now restored in many versions) Eastman is convincing and works well. (For what it's worth, the blind girl is also pretty cool -- on par with the blind girl in "Castle Freak" -- and I'm very glad they scripted her in to this one.) Decent plot, decent characters, decent blood and gore. Unless you're impatient with older films, this is one that is worth your time and I can see myself seeing it again and again if the opportunity presents itself. Make sure you get an uncut copy. You don't need those extra scenes to enjoy this film, but if you're going to view it, you may as well get the full effect and see what lead to the banning in the first place. You'd be surprised what gets people riled up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into Antropophagus aka Man-Eater (man i have a tough time, pronouncing that) I knew a couple things about it. I knew it was a classic of euro horror and I knew that it was supposed to be pretty gory. And I would say both are true. While watching the opening credits I also found out that it was directed by Joe D'Amato, big time sleaze/horror director. After seeing Buio Omega and this one really gets to know his style of directing.Antrophoghagahasus....Man-Eater is about a few wealthy people taking a vacation and visiting an island. What they don't know is that the island people have all vanished, thanks to one of the coolest villains in horror history. No joke. So obviously they arrive to the island, and bad things start to happen. Simple but fun.I hear people find this movie dull, and I can totally see where they're coming from. In the beginning especially there were a few instances I caught myself not even paying attention. But these day-dream episodes didn't happen again and I was pretty happy with the following results. The movie (uncut) isn't full of gore, but it has it's fair share, especially the ending which was funny as hell. It's one of those moments where you're telling yourself - He's not gonna...he's not...Awesome! - Actually there are two moments in this film that gage that type of reaction.If you're into euro horror, you've most likely already checked this out, but if you're just a horror fan looking for something different, this is one flick I would definitely recommend. It has D'Amato directing, pretty girls, cool gore, some nice suspense and a pretty badass villain. 8 outta 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking back these days at the movies on the list of Video Nasties drawn up in the early 80s by the UK's Director of Public Prosecutions, one is often left wondering what all the fuss was about. In the case of "Antrophagus: The Beast" AKA "Antrophagus: The Grim Reaper", with its infamous ripping-out-a-fetus-and-chomping-on-it scene, it is easy to see. However, fetus grimness aside, 'Antrophagus' is a disappointing horror which neither lives upto the hype of its infamous set-piece or the promising first act of the movie.The film begins with the slaughter of a young couple on a pleasant beach on a remote Greek Island by something which emerges from the sea. Sometime later a young group of holidaying tourists (friends of the slain couple) arrive and find the island deserted Mary Celeste style. They begin to investigate, catching glimpses of a mysterious woman before they finally stumble upon a hysterical blind girl who tells them of a monster whose presence she can smell from the odor of blood it carries. From there the members of the group are gradually picked off by something which is eventually revealed to us to be a disfigured and insane George Eastman.Unfortunately, while the first third establishes a convincingly uncomfortable atmosphere courtesy of the island and the house, and the build up to the monster's reveal is quite well done? after this the film deflates quite quickly. For all its hype there is actually very little in the way of action/gore and after the plot has revealed itself we still have to suffer a lot of shots of people walking around like they have done for the whole of the film upto that point. However, it should be noted that the film does attempt some modicum of character development and has some only-just-sub-par acting in order to carry the viewer through the boredom?even though it falls short of the mark. And then, the fetus eating scene (in fact a skinned rabbit)! Sure, this is a gruesome and repugnant idea, but to be honest the scene isn't shot that well, doesn't really make sense, fails to repulse, and so ultimately disappoints.It's a shame really as every now and then you catch glimpses of what could be a great movie, but the editing, the acting, and (to be honest) the monster, let it down and (while it's much, much better than the follow up 'Absurd') still bores where it should scare, and elicits yawns where there should be screams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Anthropophagus" is a flawed Italian shocker.**SPOILERS**Julie, (Tisa Farrow) manages to get herself along on a trip with a group of friends, including Andy, (Saverio Vallone) Daniel, (Mark Bodin) Maggie, (Serena Grandi) Arnold, (Bob Larsen) and Carol, (Zora Kerova) that will take them on a trip to a small island in the Greek Sea. When they arrive, they find it completely empty and almost abandoned. Forced to spend the night in the town, Julie takes a walk through the house and finds her friend Henriette, (Margaret Mazzantini) who's blind and stricken with paranoia about the disappearances on the island. As tensions start to mount and they begin to turn on each other, they realize that a vicious killer is after them. However, it's not just kill them that he wants to do.The Good News: One of Italy's most notorious films, this one is a lot better than many give it credit for. The main reason for it's in-famousness, the unrelenting gore, is in abundance here. There is a bloody machete in the head, a couple stabbings, a chunk of the neck bitten out, and a very special scene that is the cause for it's infamous nature, which I won't reveal for the uninitiated. It's incredibly gory, though, and comes as a complete shock when it happens, as it's not an expected scene in the situation. It's quite a sight to behold. Beyond that, the film has a couple of things going for it. The main one, though, is the old school vibes it has. It is nice to school old Gothic flavors mixed into a gore film, and we get a large amount in here. The candle-lit walks through darken rooms, the winding corridors, stormy nights banging in the distance, and a quite creepy scene where one character walks through a large tunnel, using only a torch for light, and comes across a large number of ancient skeletons, lying in the walls of the catacombs. That there screamed suspense, with a pay-off of equal proportions. The mixing is even handled nicely, with the right balance taken between them and keeps you uneasy through the whole movie. The film also does set-up the story quite nicely, with the continuing revelations of the killer slowly coming to light in a series of coincidences and discoveries that shed some light on the killer. It's quite nicely handled.The Bad News: The film is quite slow for the most part. It quickly starts off, does the usual exposition and gets the characters introduced, but then it dangles for a while and nothing happens. Granted, the Gothic scenes are nice to watch, but only one has anything resembling a pay-off, leading to nervousness as to when something is going to happen. The action comes in spurts as well, so it seems even more slower than normal. Also, I mentioned earlier about the big Gothic feel to this one, and while there is one here, it does inter-cut with the flow of the film. When it needed to go for the jugular, it stopped to show an exercise in Gothic flavor that wasn't all that necessary. While nice to look at, it does slow down. The biggest flaw is the killer. This is one of the less-scary killers in history. Other than killing people, there really isn't anything done to him that makes him scary to viewers. His look is also a problem, and makes him look more laughable than anything.The Final Verdict: The pacing is the film's real problem, but that still should not deter you from seeing this long lost gem. It's bloody, suspenseful, and full of the deliciousness that makes Italian films so worthwhile. Gorehounds will like this one, but those that aren't big fans of their films will want to exercise caution with this one.Rated NR/R: Extreme Graphic Violence, some mild Language and very Brief Nudity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anthropophagus is one of the few films on the Video Nasty list that is still banned in Britain in its uncut form to this day; and that really isn't surprising. While the film only features two heavy scenes of extreme violence, these two alone are good enough reason for the BBFC to get its scissors out and Joe D'Amato's Eurotrash masterpiece features a continually morbid and graphic tone throughout. The film kicks off with a sequence that could have come from any other slasher movie and sees a couple viciously savaged while trying to relax on a picturesque beach. This sequence sets exactly the right tone for the film; as while it's derivative of a huge number of slasher movies; it's clear that sleaze director Joe D'Amato is going to take this one further than we're used to going. The plot is splendidly simple, and sees a group of tourists arriving on a remote island after suffering boat problems. They soon realise that the local population has disappeared, and there's something sinister on their tail...and this is one psychopath that is never going to listen to reason! The Greek island setting is superbly realised and the uninhabited settings make for a great location for a film like this to take place. You would expect this movie to suffer from poor production values, but actually that isn't the case. Despite the largely very poor acting (from esteemed cult figures such as George Eastman and Tisa Farrow), the film is well shot and D'Amato utilises a series of macabre elements, which ensures that the film works as a horror movie as well as a grisly shocker. The killer at the centre of the movie really is a great creation and something far different from the norm. While the murderer is a definitely beast, D'Amato gives him a human quality and some attempt is made to show how he became what he is - which overall makes the whole thing much more shocking. This film is notorious for a scene that involves The Beast and a pregnant woman, and it lives up to its reputation of being sick beyond belief. However, you've got to respect D'Amato for this; as merely having the balls to show it is something that most director's lack. The ending of the movie is superb, and provides a great climax for the title character. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to fans of Euro horror...just so long as you've got the guts!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How anyone can say this is better than its sequal "Absurd" goes beyond me. I saw this film (uncut) straight after Absurd and kept wondering when it was actually going to start - there is one initial scene where a guy on a beach gets a meat cleaver through his head (extremely unrealistic effects) and then the next "excuse of gore" is a head in a bucket which is so pathetically unreal I nearly split my sides with laughter !!!! The so called famous fetus eating scene is about the only thing that could atract anyone to watch this film and even that is poorly done. The whole concept behind the idea is definatly sick if you sit there and think about it but the effects really are poor and as for everyone talking about suspense and quality music - oh dear, I don't think you watched the same film as me. There is far too much cheesy greek "plate smashing" music, too many scenes done in the dark - to the extent where you can't actually see half of the film - and just no need to watch it - not even out of curiosity !!!! Trust me, do not waste 90 mins of your life watching this one - it is dire !!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Eurohorror in the Aegean Sea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ideas and atmosphere of this film come from great, universal horror themes: a secluded and creepy Greek island, lost tourists, the tragic-horror story of a man who had to eat his wife and child in order to survive while lost at sea, a scary old mansion ...all wonderful horror (and with a genuinely tragic monster, the backbone of all great horror). The scene in which Tisa Farrow is hanging in the well and George Eastman (the cannibal monster) is reaching out to grab her is masterful suspense, and the scenes of Eastman eating the fetus and his own entrails remain shocking today, 25 years later. I've found myself comparing many different secluded-island horror movies to this one, most recently Stuart Gordon's "Dagon," but also "Shockwaves," both great but neither quite evoking the atmosphere and classic horror that Antropophagus does. The Greek folk music piece early in the film draws me back, whenever I hear it, to the dark side of the seclusion of the little islands in the Aegean Sea (the only other film in which I have heard this song is "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" ...needless to say, the use of the song in MBFGW came off as terribly irritating to this gorehound). Though the cuts I have seen of Antropophagus could stand to be cleaned up (and converted into one language throughout the film), these cosmetic problems should not be translated into "slow" and "dull" to modern eyes. This film is spirited and delightful, with all of the suspense and grue of its era packed into 90 minutes. Absolutely essential viewing for the Eurohorror fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outrageous "Video Nasty" shot in a beautiful setting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Anthropophagus", in my opinion is a misunderstood flick. I've mostly seen reviews in which a couple of particular scenes are mentioned and not much else, those being the fetus scene and the killer's death. While these scenes are the highlights, I believe it offers more.The setting of the film is absolutely beautiful, with the island location being showcased almost as much as the characters themselves. While I can not argue that it is slow at times, the film focuses on atmosphere, and a mid section that is almost "gothic", at night during a storm in the abandoned mansion. The film pulls no punches, as pregnant and blind women are disembodied and disemboweled without any remorse. The scene where the killer is seen inside the locked room after the door closes and all is thought to be safe is particularly effective.While none of the stranded tourists are particularly memorable, the cast is diverse enough to keep the story going, and their relationships and troubles with one another add to the mayhem. The movie is almost post-apocalyptic and hopeless in tone, since the island is all but deserted and the group is trapped without modern fixings."Anthropophagus" is a gruesome shocker, and also basically a slasher, but has more mood and setting than people often give it credit for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of tourists head to a Greek island where they are puzzled to find no one around. Eventually, they run into a blind girl who can't solve the mystery but tells them of a man who smells like blood. That man would be George Eastman, who was forced to commit some horrible acts while stranded at sea and was so traumatized, he had no choice but to go cannibal on his friends and neighbors when he returned home.No one watches this for the story, and there are a few standout gore pieces. However, if you're watching it for the gore, be sure to avoid the cut versions. If you get one of these instead of a full version, it will make even less sense and you get no payoff. :) Anthropophagus isn't as shocking as I'd been led to believe, but it does have its own grimy, nasty charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't look for great acting in Joe D'Amato's gory horror flick. This is strictly low budget. In fact D'Amato, known as "The Evil Ed Wood," was never concerned with production values in his over 200 films. He was out to make money, and that was his yardstick for a good film - it was profitable.This film, properly known as Antropophagus, along with Absurd (Horrible) and Buio Omega (Beyond the Darkness), have given him cult status among horror film fans.It does have one great thing going for it. It was filmed in Greece and has a Greek soundtrack. Splendid! A lot of it was also filmed in Italy, and that is good, too.If you see the uncut version, as I have, you will gain 3 minutes of gore over the American version (The Grim Reaper), including the pregnant woman scene.The movie was the last for Mia Farrow's sister Tisa, who went on to become a nurse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is simple- a group of tourists wander around a deserted island and fall victim to a zombie-like, cannibalistic killer. The pacing is a bit slow for about the first half of the movie and the acting isn't Oscar worthy but if you've seen any other movies by Joe D'Amato that will come as no surprise. That being said I found it to be very atmospheric, the island had a cool, creepy look to it. That, for me, made up for the pacing. Once the movie gets going it definitely delivers the goods in terms of gore. You've got fetus eating, stabbings, some facial reconstruction, disembowelment, intestine eating, etc. It's all done in graphic detail and the fx are pretty decent. Over all I thought this movie was pretty good and it lives up to it's reputation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Antropophagus is directed by the master of sleaze Joe D'Amato. He is famous making a lot of nasty and controversial movies, and often experimenting with gore and sex in them. Most of his movies are crap, but he has a few very good and memorable movies, and one of them is Antropophagus. This nasty and atmospheric movie, tell the story about a group of tourists who take a boat ride to a small Greek island. After they arrive they find the island complete deserted. After they have searched the town on the island, they return to the boat, there they find that the boat has drift away for no discernible reason and a pregnant member of the group has disappears without a trace. A storm is coming, so they decide to take refuge in an old family mansion. In this house they meet a blind girl that lives in fear, she doesn't know what has happened to the rest of the town, but is terrified of a man who she describes as smelling of blood. The group decides to uncover the mystery, but soon they find themselves being stalked by a madman.Tisa Farrow (sister of Mia and star of Zombie 2) stars as Julie in the leading role, she does a fairly good job. George Eastman stars as the monstrous monster, he also wrote the script together with D'Amato. Antropophagus is a brutal and atmospheric film, with atmospheric I mean a dreamy one like in many Euro horrors. Antropophagus is also famous for two nasty scenes that are truly disgusting. I won't spoil you anything, just recommend you this little nasty masterpiece. So if you want to see this feature, than be certain to NOT see or buy the US or UK release known under the title Grim Reaper, that's because it's cut to pieces. Shriek Show released a nice 2-disc release a few months ago, so I recommend you to buy this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much is written about The Grim Reaper. Immediately banned in a lot of countries, been heavily cut, hard to find an uncut version. Well, indeed, it's hard to find an uncut one, mostly they clock in at 88 minutes, my version was the double disc from Schriek Show. Clocking in at 91 minutes, even that it is written on the cover that it's 88 minutes, a mistake. So what can you expect from this much acclaimed flick. A good start, then a slow and a bit boring in between and it's only the last 15 minutes that makes it worth watching. It isn't gory at all, and the blood flows not very often. as said before, only the beginning on the beach is worth watching and of course the two scene's that have been removed from most versions who are in tact on the double disc, it's the removal of the fetus and the eating of his own intestines. It was never frightening and some effects are really poorly done as the head in the bucket and the death of the blind girl, when they zoom in on her you still can see her breath. Anyway, as the forums are saying, a must have if you are collecting video nasties or much spoken flicks. You've been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie in theatres back in the 80s. But I don't remember it being this lame. The Media Blasters/Shriek Show is a heavily edited version. Most infuriating is the fact that the trailers provided on the DVD show some of the gore that has been edited out.A group of friends decide to take a vacation on a Greek island. But first there's the a long intro kill. A couple goes to the beach. The girl goes swimming and sees a boat, swims to the boat looks in it and sees something that makes her scream. Whatever she sees we don't get to see. Then we see blood appearing in the ocean. The guy is listening to music on the beach and his head will meet an axe.Back in Greece, our group goes to the posh house at which they stay, but there something wrong. Some ghostly woman appears but hides from them. In the basement they find a hysterical woman covered in blood, who warns them of someone. Finally, in minute 52 (!) we finally meet our flesh eater who spends time in some real underground catacombs associated with some church. There we get to see one of the two decent gore scene in the movie.Our villain dispatches a couple of our friends but eventually meets meets a cruel and ironic death.This movie in its rated version is painfully slow, with very little worth seeing. One can't care about any of the characters. One good things is that we get to see why the anthropophagus became an anthropophagus. Presumable there's some connection to the opening scene, but since we don't see that in its entirety, as it is, part of that intro is pointless. The scenery is great, being filmed on beautiful and fascinating locations.I can't recommend the rated version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Aristide Massaccesi, better known as Joe D'Amato, had a long career and by the time of his death his filmography consisted of nearly 190 titles. While most of this work was done in the pornographic genre, he also directed mainstream movies; and even when the amount of horror movies he made is small when compared to the rest of his films, those were the films that made his name famous and recognized worldwide. D'Amato, whose work in the exploitation genre earned him the title of "King of Sleaze", pushes the boundaries of horror in what could be labeled his most "serious" movie, the infamous "Antropophagus".The movie is basically a slasher about a group of friends are on a trip across Greece enjoying their vacations. During their trip they meet a young woman named Julie (Tisa Farrow) who is also visiting the islands. She tells them about a wonderful island to visit, and they agree to take her there, but when they arrive to the island, they discover that it is apparently deserted. The only living person they can find is a traumatized blind girl named Rita (Margaret Mazzantini), who only speaks of the mysterious monster that has killed the population of the island."Antropophagus", written by D'Amato and his regular collaborator Luigi Montefiore (who also acts in the movie under the name of George Eastman); is a very well crafted movie that slowly builds the suspense and the tension to a perfectly orchestrated payoff. Fans of D'Amato and of exploitation in general criticize this aspect of the movie, but I feel that the slow pacing the film has is terrific as it increases the power of the last 20 minutes.Tisa Farrow makes a very good performance as Julie, and she definitely is the professional among the cast. while she never reached the success of her sister Mia Farrow, Tisa was always competent and gave the best in every movie she appeared. While the rest of the cast is less impressive, Margaret Mazzantini and George Eastman (Montefiori) do give great performances in their roles. The beautiful Mazzantini is very good as Rita, the blind girl, and is very convincing in her role as a traumatized teenage girl; Eastman is perfect as the madman who haunts the island and this is probably his most memorable role in a D'Amato film.D'Amato was known for making good use of every location he stepped in, and this movie is no exception. The Greek locations give an exotic look to the film, and the deserted town really increase the feeling of isolation and despair the film gives. His camera-work is very effective and together with the slow pacing D'Amato manages to create an eerie atmosphere very different to his other horror films, like the shocking "Buio Omega".Of course, being a movie where most of the budget went to pay the cast, "Antropophagus" lacks good effects; however the make-up is really good for the budget, and D'Amato makes the wise decision of hiding it during most of the film to let the audience use the imagination. The famous last 20 minutes of the film are filled with gore that it is both imaginative and well-made for the budget. These scenes are definitely not for the squeamish, as the look better than one would expect in a b-movie.Despite its problems, "Antropophagus" is truly a gem in the horror genre that, like most of D'Amato's work, has been tragically underrated. Probably D'Amato was not a brilliant or visionary director, but he knew his craft, and knew it well; and he left us minor masterpieces such as this one. "Antropophagus" is definitely not for everyone, but those interested in something different will be really pleased. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hype surrounding this film is just that, hype. It is quite honestly the most boring 'horror' film I've ever seen (and I've seen Oasis of the Zombies!) if you can even call it that. The whole stigma of the film and its controversy was the fetus eating scene which, quite frankly, was not all that spectacular. The version I saw was the recently released 2 disc 'uncut' edition from media blasters/shriek show and I swear that it was still cut. Even so, unless they cut out a huge helping of gore and interesting plot, it would still suck hard. I had been waiting to see this film, uncut, for about 10 years. The anticipation was killing me and when I saw the 2 disc uncut edition for 10 bucks I had to get it. What a waste of 10 dollars that was. Before I discuss the plot let me set the record straight: I LOVE horror films, B-movies and anything that the average person would dub as complete garbage (ie: anything released by Troma). That said, this movie was still the most boring, uneventful piece of trash I've ever witnessed. The plot was so sluggish I wanted to shoot myself (there was plenty of fast forwarding after sitting thru the first 30 minutes), the gore was limited and/or nonexistent, the fetus eating scene looked like it was cut and it was still boring as balls. I know Joe D'Amado is hit or miss, and I've enjoyed a number of his films, but unless you want to see his worst movie ever then stay away from this film. Anthropophagus, more like Anthropo-wheres my f'n $10 back for this crappy movie? End review.</fullReview>

Then a guy with oatmeal glued on his forehead appears and kills some people and it's supposed to be like...mad gory. So then he kills everyone except a girl and a blind chick. They run up a staircase away from him for like...ever. You could go microwave your dinner on that scene alone. Then old boy is on the roof and he rips one of the girls up through the roof and her face gets jacked up, he then gets stabbed in the foot and falls of the roof. Then something happens in a well and a girl gets pulled in there with a rope or something and then some people run up and that's it. Ta daa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One hell of a nasty film. Deserving of it's reputation - however, bar two scenes, it's extremely dull and tedious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released as "Antrophagus: The Beast" in the UK and as "Antrophagus: The Grim Reaper" in the US, this film from director Joe D'Amato in it's uncut form is still technically banned in many countries today. One of the notorious 'Video Nasties', this sure does deserve it's reputation as being one sick and nasty film. But this is only because of two infamous scenes really, and other than these two scenes there is nothing memorable about the film whatsoever apart from it's tediously slow pace and it's stupid characters. I had originally rated this film as a 1 star, because frankly it was painful to sit through it was just so boring. However, upon further thought, I decided to be so generous to bring the rating up to 2 if for no other reason that to praise the make-up and special effects department which pulled off two very sick and realistic looking gore-filled scenes. "Antrophagus" begins with it's irritating, yet eerie score accompanying the opening credits as a young couple walk arm-in-arm down the narrow streets and alleyways of a picturesque Greek town. They go for a swim on the beach and are murdered by an unknown assailant, who we later discover to be a cannibalistic...eh... zombie of sorts. His main course arrives in the form of a group of irritating yanks who travel to the island with this woman after they agreed to accompany her after breaking her camera (Smooth). They find the island and the coastal town completely deserted, save for one mysterious woman who they keep seeing wandering around. It isn't long of course until they find that they are stranded here and at the mercy of an unstoppable killer, who begins to slice and chomp, before ringing in desert in the form of a fetus.Before directing what was to go on and become a pretty popular cult-favourite here with "Antrophagus", Joe D'Amato directed many soft-core porn films such as "Emmanuelle in America" (1977), "Emmanuelle Around the World" (1977) and Emmanuelle and the White Slave Trade" (1978) among others. "Antropophagus" is often praised as being D'Amato's first 'straight' horror film, in that it takes itself a tad more seriously than his previous films. And indeed it is serious; he attempts to make a chilling and taut atmosphere and I'll give him credit, he did pick a superb location for the movie. The deserted narrow streets of white buildings was quite eerie looking and this would have worked to his advantage more had he mastered a very important technique called EDITING or maybe quickened things along by adding in a few more murders. Because not only are we slow to get to the island (Just on the half hour mark I believe) but once there, nothing happens. The characters moan and complain and attempt to seduce each other but that's it for a good twenty minutes at least - nothing else happens! It's all talk, talk, talk. I found myself fast-forwarding through some scenes. The violence and gore itself is kept at a minimum, but by god, in two scenes D'Amato really does push it to the extreme. The monster, or whatever the hell he is, rips out the unborn fetus of the pregnant woman and begins to chomp on it. This scene was so realistically done (They just skinned a dead rabbit and covered it in fake blood) that the film makers apparently were questioned on whether or not it had been real. Ludricious, I know, but it just goes to show how pig-headed people can be. And the final scene where the beast is finally slain - with a pick-axe - he gathers his spilling guts in his hands and in a last moment of madness, proceeds to chew on them greedily. At this point I felt like vomiting... And hey, there was also a pretty decent scene at the start where some chap got a meat cleaver embedded in his face. An 'unofficial' sequel followed a year later titled "Absurd", also directed by Joe D'Amato. Overall, this is a very low-key and boring slasher, but is also quite nasty and shocking for about five minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe D'Amato's Antropophagus (as it is titled on screen) is a movie I had heard of for years as being one of the sickest ever made. Needless to say, I had to see it for myself. I kind of wish I hadn't, as the movie is so dull and stupid the near legendary reputation it had is now obliterated.A group of people travel to a Greek island for a vacation and find it deserted. They are eventually picked off one by one by a cannibalistic psycho (George Eastman). That's it. Oh well, plot is not something I necessarily look for in an Italian gut-muncher, but even the least demanding fan has his or her limits. How many scenes of characters walking around can one take? How much banality must one sit through to get to the next gore sequence? Two scenes gave this movie it's notoriety. The first and most infamous scene involves the cannibal monster removing a pregnant woman's unborn baby and eating it. This scene is more of a straight-up gross-out than a truly effective horror moment, though the setting (a dimly lit crypt) gives it a creepy atmosphere. The second is the finale in which the monster eats his own intestines. This, however, falls short of being truly as repulsive as it sounds, because all the guy does is stick the guts in his mouth and keel over dead. I was waiting for him to gulp down a mouthful and see it ooze from the open wound in his belly.The gore scenes deliver, and the movie has a few moments that boast an effectively seedy atmosphere, but that leaves you with seventy-five minutes of not much, including wooden performances, bad dubbing and inane dialog. Tisa Farrow's mind-numbing performance makes her acting in Zombie look manic by comparison.Basically, fast forward to the scenes involving George Eastman as "The Grim Reaper" or "The Beast" or whatever he's called as they're pretty much the only ones that are the least bit interesting. I'm a Joe D'Amato fan, but even I cannot defend much about this truly terrible movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves it's notorious reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A boatload of tourists go to a deserted island and run afoul of a vicious deranged cannibal (a genuinely creepy performance by the hulking George Eastman). Director/co-writer Joe D'Amato makes inspired use of the remote lush tropical setting, expertly creates and sustains a strong mood of pure flesh-crawling dread, and handles the extremely disgusting gore set pieces with lip-smacking nasty brio. Wile the opening third is laboriously slow and drawn out, the story fortunately picks up steam and really starts cooking when the boat passengers reach the island: The island location projects a profoundly unsettling feeling of isolation and vulnerability, the cannibal's filthy corpse-strewn underground lair is a truly scary place, and, of course, the moments of intense hardcore splatter deliver the disgusting goods (stomach-churning highlights include a meat cleaver to the face, a severed head in a bucket, a couple of torn out jugular veins gushing blood, the infamous fetus eating scene, and the gloriously gruesome climax with the cannibal munching on his own intestines). The cast do a decent job with their roles, with acceptable turns by Tisa Farrow as the appealing Julie, Severio Vallone as nice guy Andy, Serena Grandi as the pregnant Maggie, Margaret Mazzantini as the blind Henriette, Mark Bodin as the amorous Daniel, and Zora Kerova as the jealous and superstitious carol. With his brawny build, hideously malformed face, greasy, stringy hair, heavy breathing, and snaggle teeth, Eastman registers well as a very menacing and frightening bogeyman figure. Enrico Biribicchi's pretty and picturesque cinematography gives the picture an attractive sunny look and makes nifty occasional use of a hand-held camera. Marcello Giombini's wonky synthesizer score does the spine-tingling trick. But it's the movie's fiercely pronounced and unapologetic element of deep-seated sickness which gives the proceedings an extra rough and scuzzy edge; the mean and morbid atmosphere is so powerfully rendered that it's sure to make you squirm. A worthwhile Italian horror splatter item.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing to me how many people comment on these old Italian horror films saying things like: "Don't watch this movie and expect to see 'The Godfather...'" This film can't be compared to big budget Hollywood productions. In many ways, it's miles better than anything else out there because films like "Anthropophagus" achieve an emotional effect greater than films like "The Godfather" on a fraction of the budget.There are two famous scenes in "Anthropophagus" that people tend to focus on because they are so shocking. If you've seen as many Italian horror movies as me, you'll find these scenes to be typical of the genre, albeit a little excessive. The things about this movie that I really like is the editing, the acting and the music. George Eastman makes for a perfectly creepy bad guy. He's big and intrusive and believable. The setting is perfect: a strange deserted island. The gore is over-the-top and D'Amato delivers it as usual.It would be impossible to find a movie nowadays that's this effective with such a budget. Nothing but vintage Italian greatness here. I recommend the Shriek Show version which includes the uncut masterpiece plus a whole disc of extras.8 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what grind house movies are all about. They lack most of the things that one would think, make up a good movie (i.e.- no budget, no name actors, poor art direction, rough cinematography, etc.). But this is exactly the type of movie that you expect nothing from, and it gives you an unbelievable amount of entertainment.If there is any way you can get a hold of a print of this film, or have a chance to see it at a revival house, I suggest you do. It is much better to watch on film than it is on DVD. I believe this film is a sequel (one of many) to the film "Zombie A.K.A: Dawn of the Dead" originally directed by George A Romero. The Second Zombie film was done by Italian director Lucio Fulci and was entitled simply, "Zombie" here in the U.S.Truth be told, I expected little from this Italian import campy horror flick. But as the film progressed, I realized that it is just the kind of nostalgic grind house film that select demographics will enjoy for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious film for having the scene where Luigi Montefiore scoffs down Serena Grandi's baby being screened on British TV as a 'clip from a snuff movie' - and I ask myself do the people who reported it actually know what a snuff movie is? Anthropophagous certainly isn't a snuff movie. What it is, is a very tedious 'monster on the loose killing various stupid Italian actors on an island' type of film. Starring Tisa Farrow in what must be her most embarrassing film career moment (if such a thing is possible). The film never really gets going until the last ten minutes when the aforementioned gore scenes kick in. And are they worth the wait? Well not really, no! The baby eating scene is obviously a skinned rabbit pulled from under the actresses' dress. Although Anthropophagous' demise is quite amusing as he proceeds to eat his own intestines as they fall out of his body after being pick-axed in the stomach. It's the sort of film that fans of the genre have to see, but I found reading comments and seeing stills from the film far more interesting than the experience of actually spending 90 minutes watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe D'Amato (real name: Aristide Massaccessi), were he alive today, would have made a worthy addition to the "Masters of Horror" pantheon. With only two well-known horror titles in his vast (and largely pornographic) filmography, he has freaked me out on more occasions than directors with dozens of scare flicks under their belt. His first entry, 1979's "Beyond the Darkness" (aka "Buio Omega" and "Buried Alive") would score within a serious Top 5 list of my favorite films of all time; a mix of evisceration, romance, bloody death, and genuine fright, it remains one of the best horror films ever made, despite its low budget and overall crudity. D'Amato, who made a career prior to directing as a director of photography (check out his excellent work in 1972's "What Have You Done to Solange?"), has a knack for framing images with an uncomfortable urgency that goes unseen in many slick, overproduced horror films today. There is an aura of discomfort in films like "Darkness" and "Anthropophagus" that transcends the works of De Palma and Polanski; and, while working in a genre that is generally paid little respect, D'Amato is keenly aware of how fear resonates in an audience.Okay, okay...I know I'm biased. I'm a big fan of Euro-horror, particularly that of the Italian school (though I will admit the country has produced its fair share of stinkers), and given my appreciation of "Beyond the Darkness," I will try to keep the gushing accolades to a minimum."Anthropophagus" is effective in spite of (or maybe because of) its straightforward story line. Lacking the macabre eccentricities of "Darkness," D'Amato instead tells the story of a group of young vacationers (led by "Zombie"'s Tisa Farrow) with basic traits (Med Student; Pregnant Girl; Tarot Girl; Photographer) who dock at a remote island, only to fall prey to a maniacal cannibal (George Eastman--"Baba Yaga"). That none of the characters leave a lasting impression is beside the point--we are invested in their plight (no matter how idiotic it sometimes seems) because of the endearing anonymity of the performances, which border on the visceral, faux-documentary style of "Cannibal Holocaust" (only better).From images of faces illuminated by lightning strikes (a tired convention that works well here), dark nights, howling winds, foreboding locations (embodied in a terrifying mansion in the middle of the island), and a pervasive sense of doom and dread, D'Amato crafts a horror masterwork that is as suspenseful as it is gruesome. Eastman's cannibal is kept off-camera until the film is over halfway finished, a tactic that--like the deliberate concealment of the shark in "Jaws"--works to great effect (even if that make-up doesn't hold up too well when submerged). The island itself, with its decaying ruins, hidden passages, and booby traps, is the stuff of worst-case-scenario survival nightmares; factor in Eastman's effectively imposing (and astonishingly savage) human monster, and you have an interesting gloss on "The Most Dangerous Game." Sure, the characters do stupid things (like go off on their own when a threat is clearly lurking), and you won't remember their names (hell, even their faces are as blandly anonymous as their backstories), but D'Amato irons such palpable terror out of the story that survival is the focal point, overriding all other elements; in "Anthropophagus," knowing a character's innermost thoughts plays second banana to dodging a swinging pickax. Eastman, who wrote the script, has panned the film and his passionless writing, but D'Amato takes what could have been simply a poor gore film and elevates it to something of Fulci-esquire grandeur--like "City of the Living Dead," it makes no excuses for its madness, and works almost in spite of itself.</fullReview>

As tensions start to mount and they begin to turn on each other, they realize that a vicious killer is after them. However, it's not just kill them that he wants to do.Tedious, slow paced flick with little logic, no surprises and no brains. It fails to even create a spooky atmosphere nor does it build up any kind of suspense.Unrated for Extreme Graphic Violence, Profanity and Brief Nudity.</fullReview>

Nothing looks real, most things can be expected, the killer is rubbish! you would actually expect him to be some kind of sea monster from the start but that would of been hilarious if it was!The dead bodies looked tatty, grotty, not scary and un-human like.the setting was nice but not used to good effect, the lighting in the house at night was ridiculous! You couldn't see the characters half the time and the sound was poor quality.The music used sounded like a comedy show, it was appalling!The worst part of the film is th ending, Oh my God what a terrible ending!!! The man kills it with a pick axe and it says 'the end' It makes you think why you had to watch this pile of trash just for that! The worst horror I have ever seen, it doesn't even get you scared at all! I laughed at it because it was all expected and no horror techniques were used to good effect at all. A shocker to watch overall, my rating 2 out of 10. I hope many other modern day horror lovers agree with this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A typically lurid slice of exploitation from prolific director Joe D'Amato (who later teamed again with Eastman to make the entertaining ENDGAME), don't be lured into seeing this film on the strength of the cannibalism and gore. In fact, there is little gore in the entire film, although when it does arrive it is very extreme. For the most part, things are slow and extremely dull, without much action happening until we're well into the final third of the film. This makes it very hard to sit through, and it also reeks of cynical sleaze for sleaze's sake. Instead of being frightening, the film just turns out to be unpleasant, and laughable in places where it should be scary.Things start off well with one of those old machete-in-the-face shocks, but this is all the action we're going to get for an hour. We're then introduced to a bunch of young, dumb tourists who roam around a deserted island endlessly (think TOWER OF EVIL), finding a scrawl on a window reading "Go away" and generally doing very little. There are far too many scenes of people sitting around talking and even a pointless 'romantic' sub-plot. Yes, this is boring.Events pick up for the final half-an-hour, which to the film's credit actually does manage to have some creepy scenes. One shot of a man walking through a tunnel with a burning torch and discovering scattered skeletons while Gothic chords screech out on the soundtrack is near-perfect, and it's a shame that the rest of this film has been up to now so uneventful. From then on it's a series of murders, of the typical stabbing and throat-biting variety. Two gore scenes have made the first infamous; firstly, when the Beast eats a foetus (rumour has it to have been a rabbit), and then the climax, in which the monster's stomach is hacked open and he devours his own intestinal tract - although this proves to be unintentionally hilarious instead of disturbing.The acting from the young cast is of a low standard, and the dubbing is particularly bad at some moments, where absolutely no attempt has been made to tie the words and the lip movements together. Characters act in unbelievable ways, and indeed various actors and actresses become interchangeable. Tisa Farrow is the only one we really get to know, and she repeats her ZOMBIE FLESH EATERS role of an investigative woman who avoids being killed to end up as one of the survivors. George Eastman plays the baddie in some patently fake-looking papier-mache like lumpy makeup, and is menacing only because of his vast physical presence. If you're expecting excitement and action, then it would be wise to look elsewhere, as this is a very slow-moving and boring affair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good, but works in spite of itself?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthropophagus (or The Grim Reaper, which is a cooler title) is a mostly terrible, unspectacular, and uneventful horror film that slowly stalls through it's non-plot, with some minor chasing and bloodshed during its brief conclusion. On most grounds, it is an undeniable failure. While it features the same goofy problems of every Italian horror flick from this period (terrible dubbing, bland acting in service of non-characters, and a story and sequence of events that don't seem to have been thought out in any logical fashion), this film creates a bigger sin than others of its ilk; it's about absolutely nothing for most of its scant runtime. Most Italian splatter flicks from this era are garbage, but entertaining garbage, and occasionally well-shot and insane garbage. But this film seems to exist in some sort of narrative black hole.The film follows a group of 6 boring tourists who travel to a small island for some bland fun: Tisa Farrow (who was briefly bitten by the acting bug just like her look-a-like sister Mia minus having, you know, any talent and never becoming famous), this guy who I think is supposed to be the male lead, but he doesn't do much and disappears for the entire last act of the movie (only to show up in the last 5 seconds to save the day!), this other guy who looks EXACTLY like the other guy, even down to having the same face and wearing the exact same clothes, he has a pregnant wife (uh oh!), this guy who is younger than the other two guys who falls in love with Tisa Farrow's charm and beauty, and Zora Kerova who completes the pointless love triangle by being in love with younger guy. Zora also acts as the one person who has a bad feeling about their trip to the island, as every one of these movies requires the crazy hysterical skeptic who turns out to be right about the evil amongst them. It's an easy way to work around characterization. Anyway, after an underwhelming opening kill, it takes the film almost an hour before the killer shows up and one of the central cast members is killed. An hour. It's amazing how long the characters are safe for in this film. They wander around, sleep in a spooky house during a thunderstorm, and wander around some more outside, and everyone is always A-OK, the killer is no where in sight. And then BOOM thunder reveals he's in the house with young guy and requisite blind girl. And the biggest surprise is that the cannibal maniac is actually kind of scary, genuinely.But his brief first appearance past the halfway mark of the film turns into another lengthy absence and he disappears for another half hour (!) only to show up again for the last 10 mins. D'Amato must have been going for a less is more approach, and normally I'd agree, but when the rest of the film is so static and uneventful and not particularly effective at sustaining any consistent mood or dread (though there are occasional moments that are decent at building this), it seems like an odd choice. D'Amato, the epitome of the lowest dreck of Italian cinema, and from what I read more interested in the business side of filmmaking than the artistic, either was genuinely trying to make a spooky film that didn't rely on only gore and sex (in fact, there's no sex or nudity to speak of), or they had no budget and most of the film is filler. There's no doubt the film is meandering and boring for 90% of its runtime, and the characters somehow feel like mannequins AND are blandly over-developed ("I sometimes work at a TV studio" "I'm in pharmacy, only 2 more tests and I have my degree").So it's a waste of time....except that killer is eerie! He's barely in the movie, but maybe that makes his appearance more effective. The make-up work is on the cheap side (as is all the gore), so some shots of him look better than others. But I must admit the chase/well climax kind of works because he is genuinely intimidating and threatening looking, and the music is actually kind of cool. It's an odd film because it is SO bland and uneventful, it doesn't seem right to suddenly have the cast be attacked by a giant scary madman with a gross face. A cast this minor and a plot this scant and atmosphere this lacking should feature a predictably lame villain, but in this case he's actually scary. And that well climax is a cool idea and is pretty suspenseful, though it doesn't milk the idea to its full potential, and then is kind of ruined by the film's stupidly abrupt ending.And disappointingly, most of the characters get off easy and get pretty minor deaths (except of course for the pregnant woman whose fate is the only one in bad taste, therefore it's the only memorable one). Zora Kerova is practically killed humanely for this type of movie (merely gets her throat slit, off screen I should add).So it's almost a complete waste of time, except for that killer, who fascinates me. He's like an uncontrollable, rogue element who doesn't seem to belong in the film, which is what makes him so off-putting and eerie. He doesn't conceivably belong in the movie; he's too creepy of a killer for a movie this uninvolving and pedestrian. So in that way, the movie stayed with me, despite 90% being a real slog. Is it worth it? That depends on whether one wants to put the time in to watch a worthless film with an underused but uniquely unsettling killer. He deserves to be in a better film. Anthropophagus just screams for a remake.</fullReview>

The fact is that the actress in the scene is Serena Grandi and the scene is just a great joke!The movie was banned in england for its violence.Some really scary scene, with good pathos was realized in this horror flick, together with excellent special effects.Even if it has its highs and lows it's one of the best gore movies of the 80'sSo, if you can't stand lots of blood and gore don't look for this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average and at most times tedious video nasty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antropophagus is the first Joe D'Amato film I have seen, having heard quite a bit about the director and his works. I was kinda excited to finally sit down and watch this, as I have heard a lot about it, and I am currently trying to watch all the video nasties so having got a hold of another one delighted me! Unfortunately this one, after getting to a promising start, descends into nothingness for too long, before finally getting to the gore in the last 20 minutes.The story is extraordinarily simple: a group of people arrive at an island to find it is totally abandoned. Unluckily for them, everyone is actually dead, and a deformed cannibal is running loose murdering and eating anyone he can. So, over the course of the night and the next day the group are one by one dispatched in gruesome ways.Now, the lack of an interesting plot does not annoy me, in fact, this movie COULD have been very good. The opening is quite promising, but most of the middle section of the film consists of the group wandering aimlessly around the island. These scenes drag on for way too long, and eventually become very annoying. There are some scenes here and there which are well shot and are full of atmosphere, with a sense of dread permeating the air. When the maniac is first revealed in the house, it is a pretty terrifying scene, and the build up is fantastic. Likewise, the chase at the end is fantastic and incredibly tense. It is moments like these which show that D'Amato has some skill as a director, but he does not know how to build tension and keep it for a long period of time and he just does not know how to keep a story going.For example, there is a subplot with a lady in black who we see stare out of a couple of windows. This is all though, the obvious mystery surrounding her and the murderer is not developed at all, leaving nothing at all. The acting and dialogue are god-awful, and there are numerous unintentionally funny scenes (like the awesome product placement segment on the boat, you will know it when you see it). However, the gore, when it comes around, is well done and suitably sick. There are two scenes in particular which have become rightly famous for being over the top and depraved.Overall, Antropophagus is not a bad movie, nor a good one. Despite the many poor qualities, the movie definitely has strengths which lift it above being poor. I would recommend it to people who are intent on seeing everything nasty, but with a warning that it is very slow.2?/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of many movies banned in the UK during the whole "video nasty" scandal of the 1980's, Antropophagus (aka numerous other possible titles) comes from the warped mind of Joe D'Amato (written by D'Amato and George Eastman) and, finally seeing it uncut after all this time, comes across as quite a disappointment.Tisa Farrow (Mia's sister and also known to horror fans from her appearance in Zombie Flesh Eaters) stars as a woman who wants to visit friends on their rather isolated island and manages to convince a pleasant group of people (one of whom is pregnant) to help her get there. But when they arrive it's not long till everyone realises that things are not good. Something deadly is afoot.It's a strange experience watching this movie because it's easy at times to see exactly why people find/found it so shocking while other times show it up for the low-budget, highly flawed, really rather dull shocker that it is.The acting is just about what you'd expect from something this notorious (ie, generally pretty bad) but this is not about the acting. It's about the shocks and the blood and the guts. They're not flying around on screen every five minutes but when they do that's when you start to get your value for money, as a gore-fan (others need not apply).Sadly, the rest is just not good enough. It's too slow, it's incompetent, it's full of some terrible practical effects including the worst severed head I have ever seen in my life and the painful soundtrack sounds like someone recorded a Casio keyboard attempting suicide.Worth watching to see what all the fuss was about but it's not that entertaining and not a classic of the horror genre, in my eyes.See this if you like: Absurd, New York Ripper, Cannibal Apocalypse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Antropophagus, or the more bland, less fun title The Grim Reaper is competent entry in the early 80's eurohorror cannon. Eurohorror is not for everyone. You must be open minded to badly dubbed dialog, questionable character motives, acting, and giant lapses of logic. All this in exchange for great atmosphere, style, and creative violence. The emphasis is on the visual. A group of travelers (among them Mia Farrow's sister Tisa!) on a boating trip to some small Greek Island start to die. Pluses: The villain is creepy, a truly menacing presence. There is an effective blind character who knows when the killer is close because "he smells of blood!" There is a suitably disturbing sequence involving a pregnant woman. Now, the version I saw was edited, there was no baby munching, but that doesn't take away from the intensity/perverseness of the scene. Negatives: Standard shortcomings</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Italian horror movies from the '70's and '80's especially, are not really know for their subtitle or overall brilliantness. Let's face it, they always have low production values and has a cheap look over it, with actors in it that really can't act. In essence all of the movies are also the same with its story and development. "Antropophagus" is really no exception to this all but has as a big difference that it's really well developed and build up, which provides the movie with a great horror atmosphere that is both tense and gory, despite being predictable from start till finish.Next to the gore, also all of the other typical Italian horror movie elements are present here; many young characters, a scary kid (although she is only scary in one sequence), cannibalism and a psychotic monster like killer. No sex or nudity present though this time, which was a bit of a surprise.The movie is really well build up. It features many scares and false-scares. Also the tense ending does not disappoint. It also definitely helps the movie and its tension that the killer his face isn't shown until about halve way through the movie. It makes the movie more mysterious and tense at the same time, which also really adds to the atmosphere. Also the environment adds to this atmosphere. The movie is set on a small Greek uninhabited island, where all the former residents were slaughtered. It makes the island empty, moody and claustrophobic, which all suits the horror genre really well of course.There are also two sequences that make this movie a memorable one and through that also makes it distinct itself from other genre movies. The first is the one in which our psychotic monster rips an unborn fetus out of the belly of a woman and starts to eat it, while the dying husband is watching and the second one is the ending when the killer is starting to eat his own intestines after being stabbed in the belly. Really some unforgettable and gory sequences. The movie is filled with also some other great gory sequences and scare moments, such as the head in the bucket and the Irina Karamanlis suicide. The movie is also helped by it's killer, that is a great character, who is also quite scary looking.The budget for the movie obviously wasn't very high. Like with all Italian genre movies is the case, the sound is terrible, the movie cheap looking and the actors are amateurs. I also at the same time adds to the charm of the movie and it gives B-slasher movies like this one (because let's face it, this is a B-movie, no matter how well its made) a big cult following. And in that perspective, this movie by specialist Joe D'Amato is definitely one of the better ones out of its genre.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the american -cut- version. Too bad, because i missed the two notorious scenes that people have been talking about. Still it was a very well made film. It takes its time and manages to built tension and cinematic progression. I was really impressed with the musical score, but only to realize that the version i saw used pre-existing music from a film called "kingdom of spiders". It was orchestral (quite an unusual sound for Italian horror) and took me by surprise. The story has a wonderful creepy feel to it, nice use of a Greek "ghost town" and traditionally creepy scenes (like the use of catacombs with human bones). Very impressive, but i still want to see the 2 notorious scenes i missed because of lousy censorship rules, or editing. Whichever caused me to miss out on Massaccesi's (aka D'amato)original vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anthropophagus... a video letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthropophagus - The Grim Reaper ? Its grim alright. What a disaster this film is. This is a prime example of hype gone mad. I waited for this so called video nasty gem for ages in its uncut form but what a waste of time &amp; money. Its awful. Not awful in an old bad acting video nasty way but plain awful in every way. I'm a massive horror fan, especially the nasties and this doesn't come into either category. One bit of gore at the beginning when a dozy guy gets a meat cleaver in his head (how exactly his brains start coming out I'll never know) then (a big mistake) the director puts a long winded 'plot' into his film ?? 45 mins of nothing. The acting to be fair isn't that bad but the dubbing is as usual awful. The actual monster when you finally see him looks like he feel asleep into his bowl of porridge and didn't bother wiping it off... I thought the film would be saved with the ending gore but nope, afraid not. The bit where he kills a pregnant woman and eats her foetus is over hyped. You hardly see anything. Sticks his hand up her dress while she lays on the ground and pulls out a red bag and puts it to his mouth. This was probably shocking 15 years ago but i've seen worse being served up in my local kebab takeaway. Actually, the owner looks like the monster too. A girl gets pulled through a roof with plenty of blood but again, doesn't look real because its too close up. The monster finally gets stabbed and begins eating his own intestines. Believe me I know how he feels as I felt like doing it also after watching this. The actual print of the film is quite good but the sound is very bad. I kept having to turn it up just to hear what they're saying. You know the films in trouble when the extras are better than the film, right ?!! A long documentary (65 mins) about the director which I thought was very fascinating &amp; the usual Trailers then a Zora Kerova &amp; George Eastman (he played the monster) public appearance thing (11 mins), which was quite good also. As you can probably tell I wouldn't recommend the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What gets me the most is the great reviews this pile of junk gets, this is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. Wasting about 1 hour just to introduce us to the bland characters, who are free loving hippies sailing on some yacht near the Turkish islands of Yalepha, we learn to not care about them at all. Once they land on the island, the suspense should begin but all we are shown is vignettes that are typical, the "sex starved guy", the "screaming girl", etc, etc. This was boring as heck and once the crazy monster, played by some half bald idiot in bad make-up comes on the scream, I had to laugh. The supposedly "wicked scene" was nothing but a plastic baby being devoured by the monster, yeah, that's really gruesome! Of course, the end is also typical, instead of attempting to kill the monster, he comes to the survivors of the slaughter and gets a small spike in his head, why didn't they just shoot him in the first place instead of dragging this worthless film over any longer? Grade F.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The notoriety is because of the gore. The movie itself is a disappointing film of two halves?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this movie is disappointingly inconsistent. Like most Itallian horror films. The character development is pretty much null but that's not why I watch them. Italian horror films can be very stylish and take you on some memorable rides. The first half of this movie is unspeakably dull. We get a cornucopia amount of scenes with characters walking around and doing absolutely nothing of note on a deserted island. It just goes on, and on, and on to the point where I almost wanted to shut it off. The musical score is very weird, and unlike anything I've ever heard before. I will give credit to a few things. The second half piles on the suspense and some excellent atmosphere, but what the hell was Joe D'Amato going for before this? It really makes my head spin. The killer (Chillingly played by George Eastman) is one of the most frightening characters I've ever seen, and the scary thing is he's not technically a zombie, he's a cannibal! He just has an insatiable need to munch of people's body parts. It was really, really creepy. The gore scenes have given this movie its notoriety. We get a meat clever in the face, severed head in a bucket, a throat gets ripped out and blood gushes out all over the place. We also get nasty stabbings, an Axe in the stomach, and two of the nastiest scenes you'll ever see in a horror film. We get the famous fetus eating scene, and someone eating his own intestines! Those two scenes are the reason this has been labeled a video nasty. Wonderfully sick stuff! The acting isn't worth mentioning except for Tisa Farrow. She was the main female in Zombie as well. She did OK. Make sure you avoid The Grim Reaper at all costs! It cuts out the two main gore scenes. Final Thoughts: If it wasn't for the extremely boring first half, this would most likely be considered a classic horror film. The second half has a lot of memorable stuff in it that will stick with you. It's a pretty twisted movie that warrants a recommendation on its reputation alone. Just avoid The Grim Reaper, and prepare yourself for an agonizing first half?5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cannibal slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot = A young woman and friends sail to a small Greek island only to discover that everyone has vanished, upon investigating they come across a blind girl who claims a monster has killed everybody, which turns out to be a disfigured man with a taste for human flesh and the group of friends quickly become his main course.I know this movie more as "The Grim Reaper" besides it's other title that I can't even pronounce. Only a few slashers have touched upon mixing Cannibalism with straight up slasher, but this one seems to go all out there, but only in the uncut version and there are several scenes which make this movie hard to watch, like the infamous fetus scene. But other than those scenes this movie is far from perfect, for a start the bad lighting makes it almost impossible to see especially the night scenes and most of the characters aren't very likable and the only standouts are from Tisa Farrow and Geogre Eastman who plays the psychotic madman.I also found the storyline quiet interesting and the setting of the Greek island is both eerie and beautiful at the same time, and the background story on the killer is both thrilling and unsettling to watch at the same time, The scares are all in the right places from the opening scene all the way through to the final showdown between heroine and killer, kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through.All in all Anthropophagus is something of an acquired taste, but a slasher with a interesting storyline mixed with true terror and sickness is a true rarity in slasher movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God bless the Italian sleaze industry and their endless array of seventies and eighties gory trash movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthropophagus tells the tale of some ill-fated vacationers out on a boat and looking for good times and better sex. They have the misfortune of landing on the island home of a cannibalistic ex-seaman and are just in time for dinner. So, with belly grumblin', our hero, the 'Beast', stock, hunched forward, and face partially covered with what one can only assume is something akin to leprosy, goes out on the prowl for food. Each victim he offs in any number of nasty ways, at one point even pulling a baby out of a mother's womb and eating it. Yeah, it's that nasty. The plot thickens as the survivors realize that most of the townsfolk are MIA and that the fella that's after them had been lost at sea years earlier and had turned from average joe to joe cannibal, munching on his wife and son in order to survive. The film climaxes with a fight between the lone survivors, a man and woman, and the 'Beast' and ends with old Beastie being impaled and left for dead, which of course only means that they had to leave the film open for a sequel and with the image of the Beast munching on his own guts.Plot-wise, Antropophagus is a bit slow. The trademarks of D'Amato's films (the gore, the sleaze, and the nudity) aren't featured here as prominently as they are in many of the director's other films. This fact has led many fans to label Anthropophagous 'boring'. However, I find that the film is a pleasant change of pace for a director who's always demonstrated that he has no problems making films that only work on the most base and primal levels. D'Amato actually takes the time to build tension here, and creates a film that manages to do more than simply gross out the audience in the process. In the first hour, we have a total four murders?but we only see the monster once. Instead, D'Amato spends much of the first hour of the film driving home how trapped our protagonists are and how desolate and empty this once populated island has become.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the UK's earliest 'video nasties', Joe D'Amato's infamous 1980 film, 'Anthropophagus' is not for the squeamish. Centering around a group of tourists who become stranded on an island with a cannibalistic killer on the loose there, hungry for guts. George Eastman plays the beast whose face looks as though it's covered in oatmeal, running around and devouring people. Great gore shots include the infamous 'fetus-eating' scene and the disgusting 'gut-munching' sequence where Eastman swallows his own innards like a fat kid in Burger King. Shriek Show has released this killer movie on a two-disc DVD, I suggest you pick it up if you dig your gore flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original slasher flick... it is what it is!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For horror fans, this is one of the original slasher/video nasty films, and therefore carries a little respect, and a little consideration for it's failings.My copy is the slightly edited "Grim Reaper" as opposed to the original and supposedly un-cut "Antropophagus". It is annoyingly dubbed, whereas I would prefer subtitles were it in a foreign language. Strangely I couldn't quite be sure of this... the blind English girl is definitely speaking English.. but as for the others?? Oh well, I digress! Much of the movie is badly lit... the screen is too dark, and although this could be construed as being spooky or mystifying, I think it's rather unnecessary. Likewise the music is confusingly dramatic, seems to appear in all the wrong places. Maybe this is a technique designed to unsettle the senses, but either way, makes viewing difficult at first.Basically, a nutball psycho is loose on an island, and some people visit the island. Slash, stab, chew, gore, mess. Surprise, bluff, suspense, inevitability. What more could a slash/horror fan want?? In two words "nostalgic value". I rated a "4" for originality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but here goes anyway.The Grim Reaper is about a group of tourists who end up on an island where they are subsequently terrorised by a mysterious disfigured man intent on killing them all one by one.A friend happened to have this on DVD, which we proceeded to watch. I have to admit I was completely oblivious to what would come next.And what came next was without a doubt one of the best movies of all time, if not *the* best. The acting was brilliant and completely believable, the dialogue some of the finest I've ever heard. The action just breaks all out from the very beginning of the movie, and I found myself genuinely terrified. I could not believe that the murders taking place were actually fake, and I have to admit I would say that if I did not know any better, I could swear they had actually committed murders on set to make them as realistic as they were. The blood, wounds, and gore involved are outstanding.On top of all this, the fantastic production values and camera work involved only added to the suspense and air of tension. I found it hard to believe this movie was made in the same year as the first Indiana Jones movie, as the special effects and production in The Grim Reaper (aka Antropophagus) are far superior. In fact, some of the scenes are so similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark that it made me wonder if the two projects had shared locations and background sets. If they did, and it is very possible, then they made much better use of it all in Reaper. In fact, this film completely knocks Indiana on his head. If you ever catch both movies on at the same time on different channels, I'm sure you'll know which one truly deserves your attention.As it happens, Reaper was very hard to follow, and toward the end I found myself wondering what was going on. Obviously I'd spent too much time talking amongst my friends about how brilliant and grossly underrated piece of work this was, and missed all of the unique plot twists. However, it was not enough to halt my enjoyment. Just be sure to pay extra special attention, or it's a case of blink-and-you'll-miss-it.All in all, a magnificent piece. This should have won some awards back in its time (timeless as it is anyway), not least Oscars for best production and best director. A nod to director Joe d'Amato and leading actress Tisa Farrow, although everyone involved in Reaper just did an outstanding job. There are not enough words in the English language available for me to appropriately praise this masterpiece of modern cinema.All that is left for you to do now is to enjoy the experience for yourself.Dom's grade: A+++++++++++++</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tisa Farrow added another gory Italian horror film to her resume when she starred in this 1980 shocker from the director of Buried Alive (1979) and Trap Them and Kill Them (1976). Not quite as gory as you'd expect, it's more interested in character development and atmospheric locations. The dubbing is typically atrocious and the opening scene of a young man being meat-cleavered on the beach is unoriginal and amateurish, but there are some surprisingly good moments. The young blind girl who can literally smell the presence of Anthropophagus is fairly clever. Try to see the unedited version, even if the original Monterey Video cover box kicks ass.

		<fullReview>While I've never seen any of Joe D'Amato's porn films I have seen quite a bit of his Emanuelle series, sword &amp; sandal flicks, and horror works. Regardless of what genre he's working in his films are always kinda hit and miss.The Grim Reaper is definitely a miss. How can anyone expect to make a likeable movie if absolutely NOTHING happens in the first 60 mins. (except for two minor kill scenes in the opening 5). Compared to D'Amato's previous horror attempts (Buried Alive and Trap Them and Kill Them), The Grim Reaper is incredibly dull. There isn't any of his trademark sex and sleaze or graphic gore (although there was some).I don't want to completely trash the film since the last 20 or so mins. were pretty creepy. George Eastman as The Grim Reaper was quite effective and very eerie. Too bad D'Amato didn't use this idea to full effect.As far as old Eurohorror films go you could do worse, but that's not saying much. Rent at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps inept is too strong a word for Joe D'Amato, but the man's films exhibit no style, an over reliance on the zoom (both in and out), and a complete inability to make one give a damn about their bland, one dimensional characters. In Antropophagus, we're introduced to half a dozen vacationing dullards with flimsy and uninteresting back stories, and are supposed to care when the (badly made up) killer begins to stalk them. It's one thing to make a horror movie on the slow boil when you have some ability to create atmosphere, but D'Amato relies on ponderous dialogue (lots of it) and unimaginative set-ups to establish his story. There's the usual assortment of cheap thrills and unconvincing gore effects(slow zoom in!), and the cheesy electro score by Marcello Giombini reeks of a rush job done on the cheap. Bar a reasonably effective scene in some catacombs, there's not much here for more discriminating horror fans, and it certainly lacks the gruesome pleasures of Buio Omega.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe D'Amato's entry into the incoherent gore movie sweepstakes is pretty ridiculous, but is very watchable, especially in its uncut version. The plot is basic, the acting is, to put it mildly, horrific, the special effects are crude (very HG Lewis), the music is plodding (it reminded me of the "random notes" score for "Night of the Demon"), the bad dubbing is almost an afterthought, it simply adds to the deliriousness. Like most of the era's incoherent gore movies, the characters stumble about in a completely fatalistic fashion, taking little interest in the deaths of their friends, and somewhat bored with their own demises. Yet, I suppose that adds to the weird, dreamy atmosphere that most of these movies have. Quite accidentally, there are some creepy moments, Eastman/Montefiori, is effective as the hulking, zombie-like killer cannibal. Even though I knew they were coming, the usually excised gore scenes were actually pretty shocking, in a kind of "what the hell exactly am I watching?" way. D'Amato could definitely pull off these sort of shocks, though, "Emanuelle in America" is probably the greatest exploitation film of the 70s, just for that reason alone. The image on the Shriek Show DVD isn't very good, though that probably isn't their fault, the sound, however, is awful, I guess it doesn't make too much difference, though. I liked the interview with Zora Kerova and Eastman, but I fell asleep about 10 minutes into the "Joe D'Amato Uncut 2" documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD ...The late film director, Aristride Massaccesi had more pseudonyms than I can even begin to remember. One of his most famous was `Joe D'Amato', beneath which he produced numerous sexploitation films, mostly starring Laura Gemser (Black Emmannuel) followed by a string of gruesome horrors, the first of which was The Erotic Nights of the Living Dead.Antropophagous: The Beast remains banned in the UK today as being liable to deprave and corrupt. In all honesty, it is just a gruesome, one-man zombie film. A family are shipwrecked and, in order to survive, the father suggest eating the offspring. Not very pleased with this idea, his wife throws herself onto his fishing knife. He eats them both and by the time the dinghy arrives at a Greek island he has become a cannibalistic maniac, butchering and eating all those who get in his way; definitely worthy of the name, The Beast.A group of travelers arrive on the island only to find it abandoned. That's one hell of an appetite the Beast has. He chows down on the group until only two remain. He's about to murder one when the other comes along and kills him with a pitchfork. Refusing to die with an empty stomach, the Beast decides to munch upon his spilt intestines before he falls to the ground, dead.The gore highlights include A) one chap who is so enraptured in his own walkman (check out those headphones) that he fails to notice the Beast creeping up on him until a hatchet is planted in his skull; B) another chap has his throat torn out by the Beast's ferocious bight; C) a severed head turns up in a bucket of sea water; and D) Zora Kerova (Cannibal Ferox &amp; New York Ripper) has her throat sliced. Don't let Antropophagous: The Beast's reputation, plus these gory factors fool you though. In its entirety the film can occasionally be quite tedious. The music, cinematography and script really aren't much to brag about so certain horror fanatics may feel disappointed with the film.I intentionally left out the infamous baby fetus-eating scene from the aforementioned gore list. Why? Because this is probably the reason the film is banned over here. During this incredible scene the film takes a huge leap down the ladder of taste to a far more disgusting level. I, for one, lost control of my jaw when I initially saw this. It isn't that gory but the idea of such an act, which thankfully was never repeated in another film, still has the potential to disturb.Worthy of its cult following, if you're into this sort of thing. A lot of people preferred the sequel, Absurd (AKA The Monster Hunter) which more an Italian version of Halloween than a sequel to this standing-by-itself horror movie. Whatever you do, avoid the Madusa release of Absurd ?cause it's cut to pieces. Go for the uncut Monster Hunter version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A typically lurid slice of exploitation from prolific director Joe D'Amato (who later teamed again with Eastman to make the entertaining Endgame), don't be lured into seeing this film on the strength of the cannibalism and gore. In fact, there is little gore in the entire film, although when it does arrive it is very extreme. For the most part, things are slow and extremely dull, without much action happening until we're well into the final third of the film. This makes it very hard to sit through, and it also reeks of cynical sleaze for sleaze's sake. Instead of being frightening, the film just turns out to be unpleasant, and laughable in places where it should be scary.Things start off well with one of those old machete-in-the-face shocks, but this is all the action we're going to get for an hour. We're then introduced to a bunch of young, dumb tourists who roam around a deserted island endlessly (think Tower of Evil), finding a scrawl on a window reading "Go away" and generally doing very little. There are far too many scenes of people sitting around talking and even a pointless 'romantic' sub-plot. Yes, this is boring.Events pick up for the final half-an-hour, which to the film's credit actually does manage to have some creepy scenes. One shot of a man walking through a tunnel with a burning torch and discovering scattered skeletons while gothic chords screech out on the soundtrack is near-perfect, and it's a shame that the rest of this film has been up to now so uneventful. From then on it's a series of murders, of the typical stabbing and throat-biting variety. Two gore scenes have made the first infamous; firstly, when the Beast eats a foetus (rumour has it to have been a rabbit), and then the climax, in which the monster's stomach is hacked open and he devours his own intestinal tract - although this proves to be unintentionally hilarious instead of disturbing.The acting from the young cast is of a low standard, and the dubbing is particularly bad at some moments, where absolutely no attempt has been made to tie the words and the lip movements together. Characters act in unbelievable ways, and indeed various actors and actresses become interchangeable. Tisa Farrow is the only one we really get to know, and she repeats her Zombie Flesh Eaters role of an investigative woman who avoids being killed to end up as one of the survivors. George Eastman plays the baddie in some patently fake-looking papier-mache like lumpy makeup, and is menacing only because of his vast physical presence. If you're expecting excitement and action, then it would be wise to look elsewhere, as this is a very slow-moving and boring affair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe D'Amato produces a creepy film that will scare the willies outof you...if you do not dwell on the proceedings too much.Tisa Farrow hitches a ride with a group of tourists to a mysterious,isolated Greek island. The group includes a pregnant woman, herhusband, a psychic and her boyfriend, and the leader (and Tisa'slove interest). On the island, the village is completely deserted.They arrive at Tisa's employer's house and find their blind teenagedaughter, who has been hiding from a psychotic monster who hascannibalized everyone on the island. The group then spends therest of the film fighting off the killer, and discovering the gruesomereasons behind his killing spree.This is the R-rated version released by Monterey Home Video, butit is still very effective and scary. The killer is one ugly, ticked offdude. D'Amato does not resort to planting a mask on him, just tobe unveiled in the climax. He lets natural lighting reveal the killer'sfeatures. The creepy abandoned village (save one crazy blonde)also works well. The editing here is very crisp, adding to thesuspense. The dubbed English voices are also adequate. Thefilm plays like good Lucio Fulci.The minuses here are also a little scary. Because this is editedfrom the original version, there are a few loose ends here andthere. The infamous "fetus scene" is trimmed, and it is obvious.The rest of the cast, save Farrow, go through the motions of beingvictims. There are not very many memorable scenes for the actorsto work with to create any sort of sympathetic characters. Thescreenplay will often take incredible leaps in logic, as castmembers wander off by themselves, or forget to defend themselves when they are getting murdered. The special effectsare also hot and cold, with one memorable scene with anobviously fake severed head in a bucket of water. I have seenmore realistic papier mache heads in children's puppet shows.The ending is also abrupt, possibly the result of more postproduction tampering.D'Amato, never my favorite director, does some very good thingshere. He uses locations to the fullest extent, making for a verybelievable abandoned island. His direction is over the top, butmanages to scare at the same time, much like Wes Craven'sdirection in the first "Scream." Actually, this might be ripe for aHollywood remake, with better effects and a cast of recognizablefaces...nah, they still would not get it right.I do slightly recommend this film, but it is not for the squeamish,and this is not for those who are looking for a "fun horror film." "TheGrim Reaper" is grim, and pretty good.The version I saw was rated (R) for strong physical violence,strong gore, very mild profanity, brief female nudity, and adultsituations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Likeable and interesting. Eastman is great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a watchable thriller despite the "boring" comments. The unlikeable cast are despatched in a variety of delightful ways--especially the blind girl, Greta, while the Beast, played convincingly by a debonair George Eastman, manages to emit a masterful air. The devouring of foetus is nicely done and the gory climax is almost laughable. Still, Joe D'Amato has created quite an interesting film from such limited resources. Long may its legend continue.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, REALLY dull apart from...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being one of the top video 'nasties' in Britain, anyone watching this will have high expectations for sincere blood-letting/female torture/animal mutilation. The opening suggests a promising film - woman reduced to blood in sea by unseen killer, boyfriend left with a splitting headache. However the rest of the film is sooooo boring. There is the one instance when the 'Beast' is glimpsed when a flash of lightning lights up the otherwise pitch black setting which is fairly effective but aside from this there are the just the two scenes near the end that justify viewing. Given that the American version is cut in two places, I can only guess it it these two scenes which are cut. The first and best (for originality) involves the 'Beast' strangling a pregnant woman, reaching up inside her and pulling out the half-grown baby and taking a bite. It has to be seen to be believed. The other interesting moment comes at the very end when the 'Beast' is pick-axed in the stomach and his guts fall into his hands (amid much ludicrous groaning) before he chews on them as he dies.These two scenes really are the only points of interest for gore fanatics who will find it tedious even to fast-forward.Non-gore-lovers stay well away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, scenic Italian horror with potent gore scenes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many of his contemporaries, Aristede Massaccesi/Joe D'Amato was a highly uneven exploitation director. He made pretty good films in most popular genres (horror, action, sci-fi, XXX), as well as many bad ones. I feel this is one of his better ventures into the horror genre, along with the notorious BUIO OMEGA (BEYOND THE DARKNESS) and the 1981 sequel to this film, ROSSO SANGUE (MONSTER HUNTER).ZOMBI 2's Tisa Farrow (the less appealing and talented sister of Mia) stars here as Julie, a woman heading to a small Greek Island to help care for the blind teenager daughter of some friends. She meets a group of vacationers on a cable car and they agree to take her to where she needs to go on their sailboat. Those on board include nice guy Andy (Saverio Vallone), tarot card obsessed Carol (CANNIBAL FEROX star Zora Kerova), her useless lover Daniel (Mark Bodin), pregnant Maggie (Serena Grandi, credited as "Vanessa Steiger") and Maggie's husband Arnold (Bob Larsen). When they arrive at the island to drop Julie off, a few decide to go exploring. By nightfall, several people have turned up missing and they discover not only the town is empty but that they're stranded (the ship has drifted out to sea). A few townspeople eventually surface; a mysterious woman who's lurking around and the blind girl, who's found bloody and in a state of shock. Turns out there's a big, brutal, scary-looking, facially-deformed madman (George Eastman in convincing make-up) lurking around the island, killing and consuming victims.The best thing about this movie is the scenery and D'Amato makes good use of the desolate and picturesque locations. A huge, crumbling old mansion with hidden rooms and a catacomb full of bones, skulls and decaying dead bodies being feasted on by red-eyed rats are just two of the great locations that add to the overall atmosphere. It's a pretty nice looking film well photographed by Enrico Biribicchi and the score from Marcello Giombini is excellent and creepy. There's also plenty of blood to satisfy the gore hounds, including a decapitation, a hatchet in the skull, neck slashing, gut-munching and one notorious scene involving a fetus which may have single-handedly landed this on the coveted Video Nasty list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, don't sit down and watch Antropophagus expecting a five-star classic on par with The Godfather. If you do, you will be disappointed. However, if you're stuck in on a rainy day, this film may be what you need.There's no real story to speak of. Basically, some people end up on an island where some ugly looking guy is going around killing people. The people themselves are trapped on the island where the guy (who I shall call Mr. Killer for the sake of simplicity) stalks them, breathing heavily as he does.There are quite a few scares in this film. Not big scares but a few minor scares. The scary thing is that Mr. Killer is just killing for the sake of it. At least some screen villains try and provide justification for their actions; Mr Killer just kills for the fun of it. And you never really find out why he is the way he is or why he is killing. There is one vague flashback which tells us nothing at all so it's up to the audience to draw conclusions on Mr. Killer.The film is slow in parts but overall, it's not too bad and Mr. Killer is genuinely creepy. You don't always see him but you can hear his breathing as he gets close to his victims.As I said, don't expect a brilliant top-notch film but it's the perfect movie for when you're really bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Italian gore classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe D'Amato's "Antropophagus" is a classic piece of Italian splatter.It boasts no less than three major veteran genre actors like Tisa Farrow("Zombi 2"-1979),George Eastman("Absurd"-1982)and Zora Kerova("Cannibal Ferox"-1981,"The New York Ripper"-1982).D'Amato manages to create some moments of genuine tension,including a deadly encounter in cannibal's macabre lair.There is also a nice amount of gruesome gore,including a legendary scene where George Eastman rips out woman's fetus.To sum up if you consider yourself a fan of Eurohorror you can't miss this film.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American version is cut? That's bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was an Ok rental. The thing I actually thought they did really well in this movie is atmosphere. I think the atmosphere of the entire movie is really spooky and scarey. And you really do get the feeling the group is stranded on this island and you can relate to that 'trapped' feeling. I rented the American version and it did not have the cut scenes referred to. The baby getting chomped and the madman eating his guts. Those 2 scenes would have made me give this movie a potential higher rating for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Antropophagus" is the slowest and dullest of all the Italian cult/gore flicks. No doubt.I honestly can't think of one redeemable aspect, therefore I am going to recommend it to insomniacs only. The gore scenes are average I guess, but I would much rather watch something that wouldn't be such a struggle to get to. Stupid 20 somethings vacation on a deserted Greek island; are stalked by the towering cannibalistic madman himself- George Eastman. The much talked about fetus and self-cannibalism scenes just don't cut it for me.The premise is good, sadly Joe D'Amato's execution is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Video Nasty that does not live up to the hype!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, CONCERNING MAKE-UP EFFECTS, BUT NOT PLOT*** Well, Well. After years of video collecting, countless hours of fast-forwarding, and the occasional decent flick, I have finally got my hands on a copy of the infamous Antropophagus. I used to read old Threat Theatre catalogs, and issues of The Dark Side magazine, and I heard about all the Video Nasties, and Exploitation, and Trash, and think to myself, man it would be great to get my hands on some of that stuff. It all seems so rare and obscure like a cult collectors dream! But as i started to find ex-rental copies and bootlegs at flea-markets and such, I came to an even more shocking conclusion: Most of this trash, really is trash. Hardly are any of these films truly gorey or impressive, none of them live up to their American counterparts. I would gladly trade in my Francos, D'amatos, and Fulci's, any day for old-school Raimi, Savini, and Peter Jackson(New-Zealand). The definition of a Video Nasty, in truth, is simply any film that the British find offensive. It doesn't mean it's good, or that it will even shock you, it means that the British are far too easily offended!And so we have Antropophagus. From cult favorite, Joe D'amato. The version I own has the most ludicrous dubbing I have ever seen in my entire life, along with japanese subtitles. In the beginning of the film we are quickly treated to one of the better moments when a male victim laying on a beach receives a hatchet to the face. But sit tight, because that's all you get for the next hour, until finally the title character shows up. It's frustrating to say the least, when watching a horror movie, if the "Bad Guy" does not even appear ONCE during the first hour. I mean it, not even one shot of his face until the last 30 mins of the film. George Eastman plays the Antropophagus Beast, or the Grim Reaper, depending on which version you own. All in All, he is creepy, a good slasher'stalker type, but more laughable, than say Micheal Myers, or Jason Vorhees. All of the horror elements in this film are strictly routine, by the numbers type of fare. However the atmosphere created is unique. Although it is poorly executed, you can see the potential for something scary, within the great landscapes and sets on this island. Too bad the lame dialogue and ridiculous off time soundtrack ruin any possibility of suspense. I will admit one thing... unlike Jesus Franco and Lucio Fulci, I do like Joe D'amatos directing. This may sound like a long shot, but I like the way his films look, especially Emanuelle in America. He has good camera movement, and his films benefit greatly from a widescreen presentation.But back to the issue at hand. The gore scenes in this effort were far and few between (Yes, I have the UNCUT version!!!). Perhaps, judging by the cover and by the general buzz about this "Nasty" I was expecting some over the top gore-fest similar to Evil Dead or Bad Taste. Well I couldn't have been further from the truth. The amount of blood and guts in this film amounts to about 1 min of screen time. Theses moments consist of 1 hatchet to the face, 1 sword to the back, a couple of slit throats, 1 hanging and of course both the infamous "Fetus for Lunch" and "Auto Cannibalism" scenes. The first, is so quick and built up that its done before it even begins. Antropophagus reaches into the pregnant character and pulls out what looks like the fetus of a small animal, proceeds to take a single bite- and then Bam! -the scene ends!!!!!! What??? All that controversy over 20 seconds of that?? I could have made a more shocking scene on my Dads camcorder with a $20 budget. Talk about a rip-off. Anyone expecting some grotesque display of horror of the most graphic nature, will either throw their remote at the television set, or laugh themselves silly.On to the only other highlight or "lowlight"- depending on your point of view- of this movie. The scene in which Antropopo eats his own intestines. Again, i can't say enough how much of a disappointment this was. Antropopo takes an Axe to the chest (albeit, it's a hefty blow to the sternum), which looks incredibly fake. He then stuffs his mouth with some (half-decent) looking intestines that he pulls from said axe-wound which opened his chest. Then he collapses, and the movie is over. To be honest I found the goriest scene in the whole film to be when a girl victim is lifted through a hole in the roof by her neck. That seemed to be more shocking than either the fetus or intestines. I was expecting the most visceral thrills but this and the few other glimpses of gore were so quick and unimpressive, that as a gore-hound I was truly disappointed. There were no painfull close-ups or slow motion techniques used to glorify the bloodshed, which may make me sound sick and desperate, but I argue that this is what the typical fan of this kind of film will be looking for. If not, why would someone bother to go through all the trouble of locating an UNCUT copy, I ask??Bottom line- If your looking for a good fun romp with lots of carnage, try Don't Go In The Woods (1980), or Night of the Demon (1980, or more standard stuff like Dead Alive. If it's D'amato your looking for, I would suggest some of his more entertaining work like Troll 2, or the any of the Ator series. He also has quite the line of Porn and Erotic material, most of it easy to find, if that floats your boat. But if you MUST HAVE Antropophagus, I wouldn't recommend paying more than 10 bucks, as the best part of the movie is looking at the classic cover of the box it comes in. * 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts with two tourists on a small greek island being killed by someone, or something. We are then introduced to several more tourists who happen to have a boat and are cruising the islands. They decide to travel to this particular island because a woman has asked them for a ride and since they broke her camera they agree. When they arrive they find the islands small village deserted except for a mysterious woman who disappears. Attempting to return to their ship, they find it has drifted away from the shore and realise they are stuck on this seemingly deserted island. The rest of the story is pretty obvious and straight forward, typical stalk 'n' slash material. There are two versions of this movie available. The original cut is called anthropophagous and then theres an american produced version called the grim reaper which cuts all the decent gore scenes out, changes the opening titles to accommodate the name change and replaces the original music, for some unknown reason I cant figure out. I have seen both versions and anthropophagous is far superior to the grim reaper. Having said that neither are very good. The first half is quite slow, the second half picks up a little but is still poor even by low budget italian gore film standards. The greek locations are nice and certainly different for this type of movie, but when all said and done this movie sucks. Dont bother with this one whatever its called.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather disappointing D'amato nasty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of D'amato's more infamous works, thanks to its inclusion on the BBFC Video Nasty list in the 80s, Anthropophagus is a rather tawdry and technically poor film enlivened by a couple of brief scenes of sickness and a fairly exciting finale (at least in comparison to the rest of the movie).George Eastman plays the title monster, a man who turns to cannibalism after being stranded out at sea with his wife and child. With no food, he eventually loses the plot and decides it would be better to eat than have someone to chat to; his nearest and dearest end up as main course and dessert.Eventually he winds up on a small Greek island and chomps his way through the inhabitants. However, fresh food soon turns up in the form of a group of holidaymakers who arrive on a yacht. Its not long before they too begin to fall prey to the slavering cannibal.D'amato's film is shot on a shoestring budget and is amateurish in pretty much all departments. Camera-work is shoddy, direction poor (at one point I am sure a passerby strays right into shot?D'amato just keeps on shooting), and the script plain laughable. Eastman is a big bloke, and therefore fairly imposing, but his lame makeup and idiotic grimace makes him not in the least bit frightening.In true D'amato fashion, there is some gore and scenes which are nasty in nature (in particular, the removal and devouring of a foetus), but, on the whole, the effects are too poor in execution to be taken seriously.Things get better slightly towards the end, with a nifty scene in which the killer gradually closes in on a woman dangling by one hand over a well (at least it looks like a well), and finishes with a silly-but-gruesome demise for the cannibal (he eats his own intestines!). However, this is neither the best, most shocking, most sleazy, nor the most bloody D'amato effort, and those watching this based on its notorious reputation will probably be disappointed.</fullReview>
