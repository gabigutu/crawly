		<shortDescription>One Hell of a Gore Fest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the classic Joe D'amato, George Eastman film "Anthropophagus". The movie is about a man, wife and child who are shipwrecked out at sea. After days without any food the man goes crazy and eats his family. Upon return to his home town (the little boat they were on somehow brought him back) he murders and eats everyone in the town. Sometime later a group of tourists come to the town only to discover the horror of what has happened.This was a good remake in many ways and a bad in only a few. First I should start with the gore. The original film was gory for the time but pales in comparison to a movie like "The Beyond" or "Zombi 2". The remake, however, is one of the goriest films ever. Schnaas takes the role of the beast in the movie and kills people in many innovative ways. For instance, he bashes someones face in (literally) with a rock and then disembowels him. Then a later scene he gains the power to remove a womens head with his own hands making it look pretty easy. And of course two of the most controversial scenes are in the movie taken right from the original.Second, the acting was actually not bad for a movie filmed with what looks like a camcorder. The main stars of the movie play their roles appropriately even if the script is a bit dry.Now my only complaint with this film was it was missing the utter dread that made the original movie so good. This movie is not creepy at all. Although, I will say it's always dreadful to see someone being chopped to pieces with an ax but I am mainly talking about the atmosphere. It was very bland but the movie more than makes up for it with the gore scenes which lets's face it, make this movie.I would have to say I love this film and recommend it to anyone that is a shock/gore fanatic. 8/10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthropophagous 2000 (1999) * 1/2 (out of 4) German director Andreas Schnaas' remake of Joe D'Amato's infamous Anthropophagous is pretty much a direct rip and follows the same storyline of vacationers stuck on an island and being terrorized by a cannibal. I've heard a lot about Schnaas but this was the first film of his I've seen. He's got quite a reputation for gore and the film doesn't disappoint on that level. There are all sorts of insanely violent scenes with tons of gore but the special effects are so incredibly poor that you can't help but laugh at them. It's that laughter that gives this film its charm, ala an Ed Wood movie. Technically speaking everything here is pretty horrid and doesn't hold a candle to the original flick. The famous "abortion" scene is also done here but not nearly as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, before I begin, I must emphasise that I am NOT bias against trash films. In fact, I LOVE Schnaas films, Nikos The Impaler is one of my most favourite films of all time.But this was complete SH*T, Andreas tried to make the tension a little bit slower. Which ultimately failed, and just made the film Painful to sit through. I must admit though, the gore wasn't too bad, but there was so much of an abundance I felt a bit cheated.Thing that made Anthropophagus (The Original) good, was how scary George Eastman was, but somehow, Schnaas, even in his make-up, isn't scary AT ALL. I think I speak for all Schnaas fans that Schnaas should just stick to playing a Cleaver wielding, masked maniac.Anyone wanting a good horror film, watch Anthropophagus, a good trash film, watch Nikos. But please, avoid this excuse of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>totally inept fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this really shouldn't work. it's shot on video which is always a bad thing, the acting is bad - especially when the actors try speaking English. the sex scenes are laughable - the type where characters bonk away without removing their underwear apparently.the gore is badly done too - it makes blood feast look professional! people having their insides pulled out by the villain just seem to be standing there and allowing him to do it!despite this, it's good fun - the gore (despite it's low quality) is yucky and even funny and there's lots to see in the film - it's made with enthusiasm.worth a watch with pre knowledge of how bad it all is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wholly fun and enjoyable German splatter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going to a beach-front getaway, a group of friends hoping to have a fun time together slowly realize their dwindling numbers are the result of a cannibalistic murderer running loose and try to stop his rampage before it's too late.This here was quite the fun if prototypical German splatter effort. As is par for the course with those kinds of films, this one tends to get the majority of it's positives from the continuous and over-the-top splatter effects for the utterly graphic kills, and even though the low-budget shines through from time-to-time the film gets by more on the cleverness and quantity of the effects. From the marvelous opening, where one victim is repeated hacked up with an axe before being viciously scalped, to a savage double-murder in the woods where one is disemboweled and gutted while the other is removed of his esophageal tract, and the later scene where one is impaled with a wooden pole, there's plenty of rather gruesome and nauseatingly graphic kills here that give this plenty of crudely-styled spectacle that goes quite nicely into the film's rather enjoyable and explosive pace. The here here is so fact and frantic that there's little stopping it from unleashing a multitude of fine gore effects from the next one as these scenes manage to set-up the absolutely amazing finale that one-ups the original in excessive gore combined with the big action that comes along throughout here as this has a fine series of scenes that build up really well. There's some excessively fun action scenes in here that make-up the blistering pace here with several great escape chases through the abandoned town and out into the surrounding woods where they get into close encounters here, even managing several scenes here that outdo the original as the pregnant friend slaughter, the great brawl with the killer as the remaining friends engage in a long showdown and the wraparound here in the caves gives this a great sense of fun. Along with some rather fine Gothic-flavored suspense scenes, these hold this one up over it's few minor flaws. The main problem here is the same prototypical problem the other German splatter efforts feature as the ludicrously low-budget effects here give themselves away on nearly every occasion as the use of plastic mannequin heads for the bodily dismemberment rarely matches up with the performer in terms of facial features while the rough edges and plastered skin look ridiculously fake before the fake blood and intestines get featured. Though it tends to run a bit too close to the original in terms of going shot-for-shot too many times for it's own good, it's all the flaws found here.Rated Unrated/NC-17: Extreme Graphic Violence, Nudity, Graphic Language, strong sex scenes, mild drug use, extreme violence against children and graphic violence against pregnant women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arrrgh ... trash as trash can...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will never understand why anyone would like to do a remake of MAN EATER, but this direct to video does fine in recreating the non-stop gore-approach of the original.It's from a gorehound for gorehounds (only).From a technical point of view the movie is okay. Storywise it is stupid as hell. But who cares if you got all that lovely killings? Me. - That's why I only vote a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not Schnaas' best work ( which is Violent Shit 2) but all in all ok. As always the "actors" are crap, but that's not the essential thing in his movies. The effects are the most important thing in Schnass' production, and they are really great in this one. There's actually not that much gore in it, but the scenes that made it are super and the baby-eating scene is no less than brilliantly sick and twisted... just as we like it!!! I wonder what Schnaas could do with a Pearl Harbor budget!?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original stays unrivaled! -- Possible spoilers! --</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diligent readers of my reviews probably know that I´m a huge fan of director Joe D´Amato and his great exploitation-movies, so I had high hopes towards this German "Man-Eater"-remake.Well...The most important thing of this flick seemed to show a plenty of amateurish gore-F/X. Okay, they were well executed for this kind of film, however very tiring after a while! And director Andreas Schnaas ("Violent Shit 1-3") was just able to transfer the longueurs of from D´Amato´s classic, but unfortunately not the creepy atmosphere! The notorious embryo-scene is more disgusting, but the charm of this great original is nearly totally missing, so there´s no reason at all to sit this through again!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Andreas Schnaas strikes again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this retelling of Joe D'Amato's cult classic 'Antropophagus' from the 80's, a marooned lunatic preys upon hapless teenagers.Joe D'Amato was, in all honesty, not the best director. Carving his name in a niche market of extremely gory and often hardcore pornographic films, his status diminished more and more, until he died of a heart attack in 1999. Mostly, he is remembered for his morally and stylistically repugnant films like the 'Ator' and 'Emanuelle' series, in particular 'Emanuelle in America', but also for his bizarre horror efforts, such as 'Buio Omega' or the aforementioned 'Antropophagus'.So already you have a sort of love him or hate him situation. Andreas Schnaas evidently despised him, because where 'Antropophagus' was offensive, 'Anthropophagous 2000' is inept and borderline unwatchable.It all becomes very clear when you sit through a love scene between a long-haired weirdo and his girlfriend who looks like Chong Li from 'Bloodsport'. The, dare I say, dialogue is laughably bad and sometimes totally inaudible. After the scummy sex scene, they are both murdered by our main antagonist, Nikos Karamanlis. The sex is ugly, the gore is over the top and the acting is ludicrous, but you knew that already.The question is, is it worth it?No. D'Amato's films were pretty terrible, but like many other video nasties and exploitation films from that time, they have a certain twisted charm, especially some of the soundtracks.'Anthropophagous 2000' has virtually no redeeming qualities. You will probably laugh a few times, but I doubt that was Schnaas intention. The exposition delivered by the titular cannibal in particular is just unbelievably bad.Not uncommon for Schnaas. Part of a burgeoning scene scene in the 80's, his previous efforts such as 'Violent Sh*t' or 'Zombie 90' are funnier than this, but technically even worse. Other well known members of this movement were Jörg Buttgereit and Olaf Ittenbach. Both have made vastly superior films to anything Schnaas has ever done.Now it probably sounds like I'm knocking him pretty hard, but the truth is, you can absolutely watch 'Anthropophagous 2000'. My advice would be to get highly intoxicated first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fun gore fest from Andreas Schnaas!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthropophagous 2000 (1999) is your typical Andreas Schnaas gore movie, in this one he pays homage to the classic video nasty from 1980 (Anthropophagous the beast), and makes it even more fun and A lot more gory in the process!! :o) If you don't know the story, well it's simple, it's about this cannibalistic loner who preys on a group of young people who come investigating in his area, one by one he kills off the group in a manner of revolting ways........ some of the gore is cheap looking but some is a lot more realistic, just some of the examples of the gore are: axe in the face, guts being pulled out of peoples throats, baby being pulled out of a pregnant woman's stomach, and then chewing on the baby's head, gruesome stuff!!! All in all this movie is well worth checking out, especially if your fan of GORE, i really enjoyed it, it's not Schnaas best movie tho which is Violent Sh*t 3: Infantry of Doom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Critics and fans alike can rejoice with this, the newest feature from Germany's master of low-budget scares, Andreas Schnaas.ANTHROPOPHAGOUS 2000 is nasty, gruesome, and just completely sickening, but certainly fun to watch. Filmed with completely professional actors and in some gorgeous locations, its really true that Andreas has taken leaps and bounds in filmmaking. This worthy remake of THE GRIM REAPER could use only one thing - a U.S. release! Maybe then, fans could see the beauty of some true German madness!!!</fullReview>
