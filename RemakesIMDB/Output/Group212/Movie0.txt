		<shortDescription>Decent as Far as Television Films Go...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Initiation of Sarah", a remake of the 1978 television film, is also a TV-movie that aired on ABC Family's "13 Nights of Halloween" special. The film is about two sisters, Sarah and Lindsay, who are off to college. Turns out, unfortunately, that the sorority that Lindsay plans on attending is run by a coven of evil witches who practice in the occult, and they have been rivals with Sarah's sorority for generations. As Lindsay's behavior becomes increasingly strange, Sarah begins to worry about her sister's well being. But these sorority witches will have to make some sacrifices to initiate Lindsay into their sorority, and Sarah plays a large part in their dark ceremony. Now it's up to Sarah to save both herself and her sister from the sorority sisters before they both become victims.This is a made-for-television movie, so I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised by the film's overall quality. The story is pretty interesting and well written, I have never seen the original television film so I can't compare the two, but as far as I'm concerned the plot was fairly well constructed. It's a little corny at times, but I was expecting that so it wasn't too big of a deal. The acting was pretty well done, extremely good for a TV movie. Mika Boorem is the leading lady playing Sarah, and she does quite well. Morgan Fairchild plays Sarah's mother (or whom she believes is her mother, who is actually an evil witch herself), which was rather interesting because she also had a role in the original film. And Jennifer Tilly (who played in "Bride of Chucky") plays her role also very well, as usual. There were a few really neat moments and sequences throughout it, and the special effects were decent enough, but nothing spectacular.Overall, "The Initiation of Sarah" is an enjoyable, fun little horror movie. It's not really "scary" by any means and those who are immune to the horror genre won't find anything remotely startling, but it serves well as a good little movie to enjoy during the Halloween season. While "The Initiation of Sarah" is no masterpiece, you have to admit, it's pretty good for TV-movie. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts slow but ends in a conflagration.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on ABC Family's "13 Nights of Horror". I began watching it because of the cast, specifically Summer Glau of Firefly and Serenity (The 4400, Sleepover, etc) renown. It's a slow starter, but if you're a fan of mild horror and teen flicks, I think you'll find enough to keep you interested. The actors seem to take some time to get into their roles, but around the halfway mark the performances become quite sound and the plot really starts to click. Jennifer Tilly delivers a solid, if slightly bizarre, performance as the nutty occult professor, and Morgan Fairchild can't help but please as the image-conscious, pushy sorority mother. Basic plot, no spoilers: twin sisters arrive at Temple Hill University as legacies to the elite sorority Alpha Nu Gamma. Sarah, the blonde one (Mika Boorem) is trying to live down a history of being "the weird one" and a cutter. Lindsey, the dark one (Summer Glau), is trying to live down a history of being Sarah's sister. They elect to rush Alpha Nu Gamma until strange things start happening and Sarah decides to rush the rival sorority and discovers that the rivalry is not just about who dates the hottest guys or throws the best parties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be put in movie theaters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gotta say, for an made for TV movie, the Initaition of Sarah is pretty good. With all the other "horror" and "scary" movie crap out there this should have be put in movie theaters. The special effects may not be all that great, but it's still got a nice plot and twist to it, and doesn't ruin a single bit of it. I especially appluade the actors' performances and I've become a bit of Mika Boorem (is that spelled right?) fan after seeing this. And true the movie may not be all that scary, but it adds a great feel to the whole Halloween theme. I've never seen the original film at all, but after seeing this I've been dying to!!!! The Initiation of Sarah is one of the greatest made-for-TV movies ever and should've been put on the big screen. ABC Family really delivered this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Each decade our favorite monsters get some kind of update. This can be a good thing or can turn ugly. In the 80s we had classics like 'Fright Night' and 'An American Werewolf in London.' The 90s of course would be a very different era. A lot of movies and TV shows were being aimed at the tween set. Shows like 'Sabrina, the Teenage Witch' and 'Buffy, the Vampire Slayer' gave monsters and their adversaries a make-over. Not to say this was a bad thing, but perhaps a certain edge was lacking. The influence of shows like these would be seen in other projects. Take this made for TV movie for example. Naturally, a remake of another film is going to bring the concept up to date. The problem here I think however, is that the filmmakers tried a little too hard to be hip.Pros: Adequate performances. Has some nice ideas. A good twist or two. Moves at a decent pace. Strong production values, which make the film look like it were for the big screen.Cons: One dimensional villains. Messy script. Forgettable score. Weak visual effects. Totally lacking subtly. Anticlimactic finale.Final thoughts: The 1978 original is a treat, but isn't exactly sacred property. This re-imagining had the potential to be a solid update, but failed. A strong story and characters are ditched in favor of clichés, abundant CGI, and blatancy over nuance. Plus, the film crosses the border of ridiculous more than once. Had it not taken itself so seriously it could have been fun. Can't win 'em all I guess.My rating: 2/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent for what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My long-standing opinion about remakes is that they should simultaneously pay homage to the original and bring something new to the table -- the latter is why the 1998 PSYCHO remake sucked so badly. THE INITIATION OF SARAH remake fit the criteria, though it's no better or worse than the original. It is, however, quite different. The 1978 version was CARRIE meets the original SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR GIRLS; this version is the THE CRAFT meets the remake of SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR GIRLS by way of CHARMED.Twins Sarah and Lindsay Goodwin are now 18 and headed for college. Soon they find themselves pitted against each other when they're coerced into joining different sororities... initially unaware that the two sororities are run by rival covens of witches. Morgan Fairchild (who essentially played Joanna Garcia's role in the original) hams it up as the mother of the Goodwin girls and Jennifer Tilly brings a new dimension to the character originated by Shelley Winters, the creepy house mother at P.E.D.Like the original, the film suffers from being made for TV. The hip, witty one-liners are corny, many of the low-budget CGI effects are hokey, and some of the acting borders on camp. That aside, there are some unforeseen twists, it's well structured and the characters are likable... though Fairchild and Tilly's characters should have been fleshed out a bit more. And as it ended, I couldn't help but think it was a pilot for a TV series. Certainly has that sort of vibe.Each version of the film is reflective of the era in which it was made, so I can't denounce this one for being so different from the Kay Lenz version. Unfortunately, the remake had the potential to be so much better, if only it were made for theaters instead of television. It certainly has its moments and its charms, so take it for what it is: a derivative made for TV horror movie aimed at teenage girls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yay!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize I'm gonna sound extremely spacey but i want this movie so much its not even funny.But don't assume that because I'm gushing you'll like it to. Some entertainment just takes certain people to like. Others probably will hate this movie, but i love it.I love the chemistry between the characters, Jennifer Tily's oddness, the typical but sweet/sincere protagonist boy.I really want this to go to movie or Im gonna have to stalk ABC Fam till its on air again and tape it !eww!I don't think there is anything spoiler like in here, but just in case.oh and by the way does anybody agree?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an absolutely awesome underrated comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my point of view this movie isn't labeled properly and therefore is highly underrated. It's clearly a comedy, and a very hilarious one.I mean, if hot girls aren't enough of a reason to watch a movie like this for you then you should know that the plot is awesome.From an evil hot(most of the times) witch that hits on dudes by mixing coffee with their own sweat to awesome back-flipping Jedi mind-tricks, it's all there.But the best of all is that it doesn't feel like other movies of the same kind... You don't realize you are actually appreciating it until your muscles hurt from laughing so hard.I guffawed my bowels out, and i'm glad I watched this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average but not bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notable points were: 1) Joanna Garcia... This is the first time I've seen her and she surely can turn heads around. Very eye-catching and the bitchy role suited her well. She did a good job.2) For a TV film, it was decent quality...Cant expect much more than what it delivered for a TV film.3) The campus scenes and the college backdrop was really nice and spectacular. Whoever decided the filming locations gets a Thumbs Up!4) I've seen Mika Boorem before in Smile and thought she was fabulous in that film, here she is OK.5) Summer Glau was below average here...she looked a little mechanical like her character from Terminator...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am a Summer Glau Fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Initiation of Sarah is her worst movie but I give it 9/10 it's not like Mammoth or Serenity which are excellent it's all about witches it's not my sort of thing but being as that my favourite actress is in it I decided to give it a try I focus on 3 things: 1. Character Development 2. Story 3. Acting The rating of mine falls short due to the awful music score. people say it's slow I don't think so I can take slow films. watch it and you'll be impressed. The character Finn in this serves the purpose of a comedy relief. Jennifer Tily makes up for her role as Bonnie in Family Guy. Summer Glau has been and always will be my favourite actress I base my acting on emoting as most of these users do I will always like her movies.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Took Me By Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pretty good I wasn't sure if i would like it but it caught by surprise just as it caught Sarah by surprise when she found out she was a witch and Lindsey just had magic blood.I didn't think what follows would be as good as it was.Twin sisters Sarah (Mika Boorem) and Lindsay (Summer Glau) are excited to attend Temple Hill University, where they will likely join Alpha Nu as their mother Trina Goodwin (Morgan Fairchild) was a previous member. Sarah finds herself immediately drawn to Finn, a student adviser that invites them both to Pi Epsilon Delta's rush week party. At the party the sisters are introduced to the Alpha Nu President, Corrine (Joanna Garcia), but Sarah ends up leaving the party in tears after accidentally spilling a drink on Corrine. Lindsay follows Sarah and accidentally breaks her ankle. They're brought into the Pi Epsilon Delta house, where Dr. Eugenia Hunter (Jennifer Tilly) introduces herself as a friend of their mother. The sisters are surprised to find that Lindsay's ankle has been healed. The following day Corrine ingratiates herself to Lindsay during a meeting at Alpha Nu, during which time Corrine takes the opportunity to take an eyelash off of Lindsay and pocket it.Sarah is approached by Dr. Hunter, who tells Sarah that they both possess magical powers. This unnerves Sarah, especially after Dr. Hunter later tells her that the Pi Epsilon Deltas and the Alpha Nus are mortal enemies locked in a fight of good against evil, and that Sarah is the One- a person who could disrupt the balance. Sarah is further warned that as the One, the Alpha Nu wants to sacrifice her to the Eternal Flame with the Knife of Truth in exchange for immortality. Sarah tries to approach her sister with this, who angrily tells her that Sarah has always been the focus of attention as opposed to Lindsay herself and Lindsay ends up leaving in tears. After Corrine's vice-president Esme (Tessa Thompson) informs her of the fight, Corrine uses this to persuade Lindsay into joining the sorority in return for beauty and a chance to outshine her sister - an offer Lindsay eagerly accepts.Things grow more tense after Lindsay is forced to stay in the Pi Epsilon Delta following a fire and after making up with Finn, Sarah discovers that Trina Goodwin is not her true mother and that Trina actually killed their birth mother after a failed ritual. The Alpha Nus had believed her to be the One, which had been proved to be false after the Knife of Truth refused to cut her, as it will only cut the flesh of the One. Sarah also learns that the Alpha Nus are willing to kill her if they can't have her, which prompts her to try to rescue her sister from their clutches. She initially seems to be successful, as Lindsay appears to want to leave the group, but this is soon revealed to be a trap to capture Sarah and force her into sacrificing herself willingly. However everyone is shocked when a struggle reveals that the true One is actually Lindsay rather than Sarah, as the Knife of Truth ends up nicking her throat. They also find that the Knife can cut through anything if it has the blood of the One on it.Corrine immediately imprisons Lindsay in preparation for her initiation into the sorority and kills Trina Goodwin, as she is no longer of any use to Corrine. Sarah escapes with Finn and the two end up having sex in order to keep him from being sacrificed in a ceremony where the Alpha Nus will throw virgins into their Eternal Flame to keep it burning. Sarah and Lindsay are both initiated into their respective houses (Sarah into Pi Epsilon Delta, Lindsay into Alpha Nu) and Lindsay is horrified when she discovers that the Alpha Nus are intent on sacrificing her. Sarah manages to successfully rescue her sister, almost dying in the process, and after a struggle pushes Corrine into the Eternal Flame. After they return back to the Pi Epsilon Delta house, Dr. Hunter uses Lindsay's inner power to heal her and the film ends with Esme walking off with a little bit of the Eternal Fire in a small cauldron.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sororities + witchcraft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Corinne (JoAnna Garcia) leads a ritual sacrifice but the girl turns out not to be 'The One'. Eighteen years later, twins Sarah (Mika Boorem) and Lindsey Goodwin (Summer Glau) are freshmen at Temple Hill University. Sarah has supernatural powers. Lindsey is desperate to be popular by joining the best sorority Alpha Nu Gamma. Corinne is the big sister and still looks exactly the same as 18 years ago. The secretive sorority Pi Epsilon Delta led by professor Eugenia Hunter (Jennifer Tilly) is in a timeless fight against Alpha Nu. Sarah befriends outcast Vita (Amber Wallace) while dorm RA Finn (Ben Ziff) falls for her.The movie is trying to do a lot of things and ends up rather bland. It's definitely not scary especially on ABC Family. It has the looks of a TV movie. There is no tension as a thriller. The movie spills its various secrets in unexciting ways. It's also rather blasé about dangers. She's told that they're trying to kill her and she's simply chatting it up with the boy in the library. Jennifer Tilly really plays down her character. Lindsey is a really dumb character. She is somehow mentally defective. There seems to be some good story material but it's not put to good use here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining, well-done occult movie that puts "The Craft" to shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is amazing, and definitely not something I'd expect from ABC Family. It's captivating, mature, and has a twist that I absolutely didn't see coming. The actors show talent beyond their years, the story keeps you guessing, and it's one of the few movies about the occult that doesn't make me ashamed of how commercialized witchcraft has become. There's a lot of universal themes that really give it heart: finding greatness in the most unlikely of places, learning to accept and embrace your inherent differences, and of course, fighting like (and against) all hell for the people that you love.I believe what makes a great fiction movie is its ability to seem like it almost could be real. Granted, the demonic sorority sisters, the existence of "The One" and the super-cool magick tricks are a bit of a stretch, but there's a lot in the movie that's believable. For example, the relationship dynamic between Sarah and her sister is easy for anyone to relate to, especially if you've ever felt like you were overshadowed by a sibling. The struggle of good vs. evil is something that we all fight with at some point, if not every day of our lives. And the desire for acceptance at all costs...I know I shudder to think of the things I've done in the past to try to get the popular girls to like me. This movie makes it very easy to relate to its characters, even the minor ones. I know my bet friend in high school was a dead ringer for Vita. And for all those stickler Wiccans out there, the initiation ceremonies of both sororities are actually similar to real coven initiations, i.e. the kisses, the wording of the pledge, etc.This is really a great movie, people, much better than the original. It's got character, it's got flair, and it's got intensity. Definitely two hours well spent. Oh, and just in case you're wondering: my ABSOLUTE favorite part is when Sarah runs off to save Finn from being sacrificed in the eternal flame. I couldn't stop laughing. It was beyond priceless; can't believe ABC Family actually showed it, lol.Blessed Be.</fullReview>
