		<shortDescription>Stan &amp; Ollie (&amp; Penelope the goat) bid farewell to the silent era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the title suggests an examination of the twisted obsessions of Ed Wood Jr., 'Angora Love' is in fact a Laurel &amp; Hardy comedy, a diverting short which offers a heart-warming tale of two guys and the goat who refuses to leave them alone. Much of the humor revolves around the boys' efforts to hide the goat, Penelope by name, from their grouchy, goat-hating landlord, Edgar Kennedy, who gives one of his definitive grouch performances here. Apparently the premise held some special significance for Stan &amp; Ollie, for they reworked it twice more with sound, first in the 1931 short Laughing Gravy, in which several of the gags from this film are re-enacted, and then just a year later in The Chimp, which borrows only the basic premise.Angora Love, which was made in the spring of 1929 but not released until December of that year, was the last silent film made by Laurel &amp; Hardy. It was originally accompanied by a music-and-effects track, but, contrary to an earlier post, there was never dialog on the soundtrack.One of the best sequences occurs at the beginning, when the guys and the goat "meet cute." Penelope, having been fed a dough-nut by Stan, fixates on him and refuses to go away. Obviously, she wants more. The boys' attempt to give her the slip is funny and also rather poignant, at least from the goat's point of view. Cinematographer George Stevens helpfully offers us a tracking shot filmed from the goat's subjective P.O.V., or, as we might call it today, GoatCam. Once the trio is holed up in the boys' apartment the atmosphere gets somewhat claustrophobic, but the gags keep on coming. There's some silliness involving Stan's aerobics work-out, and a painful routine in which Ollie repeatedly steps on a tack. There's also an elaborately messy attempt to wash Penelope, and a sequence involving foot-rubbing which, despite the guys' innocent personalities, might strike some viewers as suggestively homo-erotic, or in any event kind of weird. There's also a quick throwaway gag involving a sailor and a prostitute that never would have gotten past the censors a few years later; it's understated but unmistakable, and not typical of Laurel &amp; Hardy, but amusing in a raffish way.In a sense it might have been more appropriate if Stan &amp; Ollie had concluded their silent movie career on a spectacular note, perhaps with one of those rousing, garment-ripping riots that seemed to erupt so frequently in Culver City at the time. Still, while Angora Love is not one of the team's liveliest silent comedies, it did serve as a useful prototype for two of their talkies, and is plenty amusing in its own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If this was Laurel &amp; Hardy's Swan Song to the Silent Screen, how come they used a Goat?".....Schultz (my buddy)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHENEVER an idea was successful during those "Golden Days" of the Silent Movies, you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated; although "Reworking" is the term that is used. Of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us, for success in the Movies or TV always leads to a trend; with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit Movie or TV Program.TO this last premise we strongly disagree; for this is copycatting or plagiarism, plain and simple.THIS, the last Silent Laurel &amp; Hardy Short, surely must have been quite well received; for ANGORA LOVE (Hal Roach/MGM, 1929) was reworked on the Roach Lot, not once, but twice over the next three years. We were treated to LAUGHING GRAVY (Roach/MGM, 1931), in which the Goat was replaced with a cute, little puppy-dog. Also, the weather is transformed into the dead of Winter, in the middle of a blizzard. They also made other line-up changes with substituting Landlord Edgar Kennedy with Landlord Charlie Hall.THE second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP (Roach/MGM, 1932), which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct Circus, to which Stan and Babe were former employees. The Circus paid off its employees with their assets and the Boys received the Chimpanzee as their final payday.BACK to our original 'victim', today's subject, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? THE short starts off simply enough. The boys encounter the Goat on the street and the Nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house; after Stan feeds a doughnut to her. The comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between L &amp; H and slow-burn exponent, Edgar Kennedy, their Landlord. The incident's impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night. And as luck would have it; their room is situated directly above the Landlord's quarters.IN addition to the noise, the bathing of the goat, its odor and Landlord Edgar's suspicions about Laurel &amp; Hardy's having another person illegally in the room; we were most amused by a little throw-away gag, which may well have been missed by the Censors. While admonishing the boys about the noise they'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person's being in there overnight, regardless of their sex.ITS camera shot is made from inside The Boy's room, over their shoulder. With Edgar in the hall and facing them, he warns; "Remember, this is a respectable establishment!" Just as he says this, a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the Landlord; followed by a uniformed Sailor, who cocks his hat forward as they pass! POODLE SCHNITZ!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Listen, you guys are getting my goat".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Turner Classic Movie historian Ben Mankiewicz cites this Laurel and Hardy short as their last silent film. The opening title card states it's 'the dramatic story of a goat', and I guess you could call it that if you want, for me it was just funny. After the Boys make their acquaintance with said goat outside a pastry shop, the animal is immediately befriended by Stan with one of the tasty morsels, thereby making a friend for life, or at least the twenty minutes or so of this picture.Having just watched their 1928 silent "Habeas Corpus", I noted a gag they repeated here when Ollie falls into a huge hole in the street filled with water trying to outrun the goat. I thought it might have been the same location used, but this time the street corner building was occupied by a shop whereas in the earlier film it was just a large drab structure. I suppose it could have been urban renewal.Following the boys to their room in a hotel, the goat becomes an unwanted guest, with constant attempts by the landlord to figure out what all the noise is about. Edgar Kennedy was the perfect foil for these kind of roles, and his effort to proclaim his establishment as a respectable hotel leads to a sight gag of a sailor following one of the tenants to her room down the hall. That was probably pretty risqué stuff for 1929 but it slipped by to the amusement of this viewer.I'm not enough of a Laurel and Hardy student to know if this was one of their better silent efforts, but it was amusing in most respects. If made today, I don't think the PETA folks would have taken kindly to the way the boys manhandled the goat getting him to take a bath, but it didn't look like the animal minded too much. Somewhere along the way it rewrote the rule book on reproductive anatomy, since the short ended with three cute but tiny goats emerging from under a cabinet. Not baaaad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of their best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1929, over 85 years ago, was a pretty prolific year in terms of films for Laurel and Hardy and this one also came out back then. It is black-and-whit and we still do not hear their voices, even if it is not a silent film anymore. As usual, it runs for 20 minutes roughly and with this one Laurel and Hardy try to satisfy the steadily-growing number of audience members who loved to see animals in movies. This one has a goat from start to finish. The duo takes care of her, but hides her from a landlord. When the police officer finally finds her in the end, a cute surprise is waiting for our heroes. I must say the only thing I liked here were the last 2 minutes. Some nice drama and comedy and of course the cute ending I already mentioned. Everything before that is fairly forgettable and not as funny as I hoped it could be. Laurel and Hardy have many funnier films out from the late 20s and early 30s. Maybe it's the goat's fault, maybe the writer's. But I do not recommend this one. The last 2 minutes are not worth sitting through the first 18. Thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Short from Laurel and Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angora Love (1929) *** (out of 4)Funny two reeler has Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel walking out of a pastry shop when a goat begins to follow them. They eventually lose the animal but two nights later he's back and the duo has to take them to their hotel room where chaos follows since the landlord is in the room below them.This film was remade by Laurel and Hardy as LAUGHING GRAVY and that there is considered by many fans and critics to be one of the best movies the two men ever made. This one here isn't quite as good as that film but there are still enough funny moments here to make the film worth watching. The one thing I noticed while watching this is how good a sport both men were and especially during the scenes where they're trying to give the goat a bath. They really get their hands dirty so to speak and these scenes get some of the biggest laughs as does the water fight towards the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. A goat manages to snap its rope and escape and the shop owner assumes it has been stolen and tells a policeman. The goat runs towards Stan and Ollie eating ring doughnuts, and a boy thinks that they are the ones that stole it, and the goat keeps following them till Ollie falls into a deep puddle. The goat has followed them for two days, all the way to a hotel room in St. Paul with the Landlord (Edgar Kennedy) sleeping right underneath, and when the goat is being noisy Ollie reminds Stan that they will be thrown out if they bother the Landlord. Ollie tries to relieve his aching foot, but he ends up taking the shoe and sock off and massaging Stan's foot, and the Landlord is bothered when Stan tries to knock a piece of wallpaper that the goat pulls off back in place. They hide the goat under the bed, and the before the Landlord goes back to his room, he reminds them it's a respectable hotel, as a woman and a sailor walk by the door. Just when he gets in bed Stan gets out again to do some exercise with his stretch bands on the door, which wakes the Landlord again, but he catches Ollie demonstrating how to do it quietly. After the Landlord leaves, the boys notice a stink, and they know they have to wash the goat, and getting the tub and water ready they tread on a pin and a mousetrap. Stan makes Ollie accidentally poor water on the floor, and water leaks through a hole in the Landlord's ceiling, and is almost woken by the fuss of getting the goat washed. A Neighbour (Charlie Hall) interrupts them knocking on the wrong door, and the Landlord is awake ringing the police reporting a murder will happen, then goes to deal with the boys. Ollie throws the tub water on Stan for annoying him, and manages to soak the Landlord instead, so a little water fight starts, and the Neighbour joins as well. The Landlord gets the Policeman (Harry Bernard) that comes to investigate the report, and he spots the goat, assuming that the Landlord stole it, so he takes him away, and Ollie says he never wants to see a goat again, but the film ends with three baby goats coming under the door. Also starring Charley Young as Mr. Caribeau. Filled with good slapstick and all classic comedy you want from a black and white silent film, it may a little grainy at times, but it is an enjoyable film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film was remade by the team just a few years later,...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Laurel and Hardy's last silent film for Roach Studios. However, since the public had a real thirst for "talkies", this same short was re-made by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes. LAUGHING GRAVY was essentially the same plot except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord--not a goat like in ANGORA LOVE. This whole goat angle is the worst part of the film. While you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog (after all, it is snowy outside), why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless. According to the plot, the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it. Huh?! This just doesn't make any sense--if it had been a giraffe or a cow, would they have done the same thing?! Apart from being an unconvincing plot, the movie itself is pure Laurel and Hardy, with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians. This film features quite a few laughs, but unfortunately isn't one of their better films to wrap up their silent careers. This aspect of their careers just seems to have ended with a whimper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laurel &amp; Hardy in their last silent movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No this is not an Ed Wood movie. "Angora Love" is Stan Laurel's and Oliver Hardy's last silent movie. The end of an era! In the '20's Laurel &amp; Hardy left a real mark on the silent movie genre with movies that are still popular and being watched and aired regularly, this present day.It's a shame that this movie is however not among their best.The premise of the movie sounds good and is good. The boys team up with a goat this time, which of course leads them into trouble and for us some hilarious situations to watch. It however at the same time is extremely silly and just totally unbelievable to watch the boys doing comedy stuff with a goat. Most of the jokes in the movie still work good but the movie just however never gets truly hilarious or memorable. The comedy and story really feels lacking at times and is mostly too simple and predictable.Of course still good and fun enough to watch for the fans but still a slightly disappointing last silent Laurel &amp; Hardy entry.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Talking Laurel and Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released on video in 1987, 'Angora Love' was one of the disappointing short, talking Laurel and Hardy films. An inferior variation on 'Laughing Gravy', but still part of the Laurel and Hardy corpus. I watched it once and don't think I've watched it since.</fullReview>
