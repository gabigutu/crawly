		<shortDescription>Archetypal Laurel and Hardy comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LAUGHING GRAVY Aspect ratio: 1.37:1Sound format: Mono(Black and white - Short film)During a heavy blizzard, boarding-house tenants Stan 'n' Ollie hide their dog from an unsympathetic landlord (Charley Hall) who threatens to evict them if they don't follow the rules. Chaos ensues...Archetypal L&amp;H comedy, played and filmed to perfection, as the boys' efforts to protect 'Laughing Gravy' meet with disaster at every turn. Ollie's attempts to get back into the house without being noticed by the sleeping landlord is only one of the film's many highlights, leading to a precarious rooftop episode (!) and a series of blunders and disasters. Fine comic timing, excellent set-pieces, great fun. Directed with typical gusto by L&amp;H regular James W. Horne.The film exists in three separate versions: It played theatrically as a two-reeler, following the elimination of a third reel in which Stan comes into an unexpected inheritance. This material has since been restored to a second version which omits the original's ending. A third edition - which appears to exist only in colorized form - contains ALL extant material, including the inheritance AND the original ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not their best work but good laughs nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laurel and Hardy are still together despite having one empty pocket book between them. They have a reasonable room in a hostel but have to keep their dog, Laughing Gravy, hidden from the landlord else they'll be put out on the street. One winter's night, Gravy's constant barking threatens to expose them so they take action to keep him hidden ? with limited success.As always, the Laurel and Hardy shorts are perhaps less important for their plot than they are for the often wonderful sequences that the plot device allows for. Here the plot device is an `illegal' (in terms of contract) dog. The ways they try to hide the dog and the consequences of their actions are funny without being wonderful. As usual Hardy's (and a lesser extent, Laurel's) looks to camera make it all better than it actually is.Unusually for their shorts, the conclusion of the story allows for a scene of touching honesty between the two, as Hardy becomes quite vulnerable with Laurel. This was a refreshing addition to the mix which, while not tear jerking, was unexpected. As always (for me anyway) Hardy steals the show with his looks to camera but Laurel is as subtle as ever. Charlie Hall is making a bit too much effort but is OK.Overall this isn't the greatest of their work but it is a good example of everything I love about them as a duo. Their talents make this short better than it probably should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meat and two veg with gravy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Abbott and Costello, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Morecambe and Wise, The Two Ronnies, Pete and Dud a.k.a. Derek and Clive, The Blues Brothers, Matt Lucas and David Walliams etc, etc these are just a tiny percentage of comedy double act's, the comedy duo's, that throughout the age's have entertained us all. Each with their own twist and turn of a gimmick that set's them apart, but in the final solution following, at times, the tradition of smart-aleck and buffoon.However, there is just one pair that set themselves very much apart from the herd, originators and comic geniuses that no one has surpassed, surpassed by either skill, wit and personality the late, great Laurel and Hardy, British born Stan Laurel (1890 - 1965) and his American counterpart Oliver Hardy (1892 - 1957).Their first outings were of the short silent movie variety, consisting of at least two reels in length, a reel being often around ten minutes long, this first short together was to be Slipping Wives (1927). Their first talkie was Unaccustomed As We Are in 1929, the advantage that both Laurel and Hardy had over most of their silent movie companions were that they adapted very well to this new genre. The Music Box (1932) won them an Academy Award for best short film, their only such Award.Yet again, the famous Hal Roach Studios had a part in the making of Laughing Gravy, along with the writing credits to H.M. Walker (1885 - 1937) who with a vast order of merit as writer of dialogue and title creator for works for many of the silent, and not so silent, era's shorts. A snippet of Laurel and Hardy titles that includes Night Owls, Another Fine Mess, Below Zero, Brats and Our Wife. Directed too by one James W. Horne (1880 - 1942) whose career started out as actor way back in 1913, then progressed to writer then director of many, many shorts and full-length movies.Then what about poor Laughing Gravy? Well, he, or more be it to the point she, went on to work with Laurel and Hardy twice more in Pardon Us (1931) and The Bohemian Girl (1936) as well as working in other Hal Roach (1892 - 1992) productions.Laughing Gravy was filmed between the 2nd and 18th of February 1931 and released April 4th of the same year, and it is here, in this studio setting, we find this enduring duo shacked up in lodgings, one dark cold winter, and of course with their tiny pet dog Laughing Gravy, who has been sneaked into said bed-sit. It's in this predicament that poor old Laughing Gravy is finally found out by the mean spirited Landlord, with the assistance of the bungling and inept pair in the room above, of course.So begins the absurd battle to retrieve this poor unfortunate mutt from the grasps of the freezing, howling winds and heavily snow ridden night. This is typical Laurel and Hardy starting out with good behaviour that very quickly turns to fanciful farce, with the ever blundering pair digging that inevitable hole so far deep that only sheer stealth and luck could bring them back over the edge and back to normality. Laughing Gravy is a wonderful insight into the world of this dynamic comedy duet, their antics and slapstick timing, and our joyful laughter at their own hilarious and often painful expense.It is the ever-comic mental and physical abuse, which Oliver has to suffer, and suffer in silence, by the hands of his slimmer partner Stan, that makes this pair an extremely unfortunate accident-prone comedy act. It is Oliver's camera baiting, his looking directly into the audience and pleading for sympathy and understanding, and in this technique, this interacting with the audience, that has been turned into a powerful tool that both enhances the comedy and draws us into the plight. This alone, has Laughing Gravy warming our hearts to the duo's plan of action and its dire and hysterical results.Around a week after initial shooting, extra scenes were added, a third reel, an extra ten minutes that does deviate from the first two reels, but non the less is just as funny in conjoining all three reels nicely, albeit a story in itself. This third reel had been lost for some decades, until the 1980's, and is now available as a full package. If sought out in the right places, the three different versions of Laughing Gravy, the original English language release two reeler, the three reel foreign language version (in English too) and now, the whole three reel's in 30 minutes of glorious computer generated colour can now be squandered at our leisure, for always. Another fine mess? On the contrary, a fine comedy feast with lavishing of laughter and gravy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Things We Do For the Love of a Pet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the more well-known of Laurel &amp; Hardy's shorts. I remember when I was a kid this one was shown all the time ? although without that extra reel, which wasn't re-discovered until 1985. They don't seem to show Laurel &amp; Hardy shorts on TV anymore which is a real shame; there's a whole generation growing up knowing little about the duo.In this one they try to conceal their little dog Laughing Gravy (possibly the only dog in cinema history to have a film named after him rather than the other way around) from their pint-size landlord, the permanently grumpy Charlie Hall. Of course, they're unsuccessful and when the landlord pitches the dog out into the snow, Ollie braves the elements to smuggle it back in. As always, the boys complicate things by attempting to haul Ollie up the side of the building using a couple of sheets tied together ? with inevitable results. Although the snow is obviously fake and the location is a set, the film really does succeed in making you feel the cold as the boys slide around on the roof in their nightshirts.There isn't that much dialogue in this film ? or at least in the first twenty minutes ? nearly all the humour is physical, punctuated by a number of long despairing looks into the camera from Ollie. Stan stares at the camera too on occasion, but you can tell there isn't much going on inside his character's head. He looks at the camera and you can almost hear the cogs creaking as they turn.The laughs are pretty solid and arrive at fairly regular intervals until that final reel when things change entirely. It's not difficult to see why it was cut from the original because it just bears no relation to the rest of the film other than the fact that it is a protracted build up to a decent punch-line involving the dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Charley Hall?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the pantheon of character actors that supported Laurel and Hardy over the years Charley Hall is second to Jimmy Finleyson as their constant foe (or victim). Hall was a good journeyman comedian, and appeared in many shorts besides those with the boys. Inevitably they irritate him (which may be why Finn is somewhat higher in the rating of their foes - Finn reacts to their comments, sometimes asking for mistreatment, but frequently being somewhat in the right; Charley usually just is bad tempered. In BE BIG Ollie and Stan are trying to get some ice cream for dinner at home that night. Charley is selling ice cream, and repeatedly tells Stan that they don't have Chocolate (apparently Stan's favorite). Finally instead of rattling off all the flavors he has, Charley grits his teeth and decides to list all the flavors he doesn't have! It still doesn't work.It's very possible that Charley's best performance against L &amp; H was in LAUGHING GRAVY (possibly THEM THAR HILLS is equally good - but that was one of two shorts that are interconnected). LAUGHING GRAVY stands on it's own feet - it was a sound version of the silent short ANGORA LOVE, about the difficulties of the boys sneaking a goat into their rooming house when it won't stop following them. Later this plot would also be used in THE CHIMP, with a chimpanzee as the animal they have to keep hiding from their landlord (Billy Gilbert). But here it is Hall who is the landlord, and has been having problems with these two roomers some time before the short begins. He keeps being awaken by them and keeps threatening to send them out into the snow drifts outside. Stan has a cute little dog, "Laughing Gravy", and does not want to put the dog out into the snow. But there is a no-pets rule. The short expands on how they boys try to keep the dog in the room, but try to keep Charley from finding out. The results are usually at Ollie's expense, although both boys get locked out at one point. Ollie keeps getting soaked, and Charley keeps getting angrier and angrier at Ollie's making one disturbance after another. The culmination is when they are washing the dog, and Stan sees Hall staring at them - and pushes the dog out and starts washing Ollie's head in the soapy water instead!They are told to leave the boarding house. Here an interesting thing developed. It seems that many of the Laurel &amp; Hardy films had scenes shot that were cut out (and not necessarily by television). Few of these have been found, though occasionally we know what they are (the Spanish version of PARDON US has a sequence involving the boys saving the warden's daughter from Walter Long during a fire - which apparently was in the English version too, but finally cut out of that version). In the case of LAUGHING GRAVY a ten minute sequence involving Stan getting a telegram and Ollie dying to know what it is about was dropped. They are packing when the telegram is delivered, and Stan reads it, but quickly folds it into his pocket. Ollie keeps asking what is on the telegram, but Stan says it's nothing. Ollie gets so annoyed, he starts singing a song, "You'll be sorry when it's too late...when our friendship has turned to hate!" Stan finally gives in, and gives Ollie the message. Stan has inherited a fortune from an uncle - but he has to give up his friendship with Ollie, who the uncle could not stand. The sequence is not a bad one, but one realizes why it was cut - it did nothing to further the plot line of the short. In fact, it was rather weak in comparison with the rest of the short (and costs the short a "10" out of "10" - it gets a "9" as a result). Still it is nice to occasionally see a lost sequence returned to any film.The real conclusion is when Hall (holding a hunting rifle) is waiting for the boys and Lauging Gravy to leave the boarding house. But as they are about to leave they hear nailing. They open the door and see a policemen has put up a quarantine sign there - Stan and Ollie can't leave with their dog now! Shocked beyond endurance by this twist, Hall says there is just so much a man can take. We see him walk off the camera's range. Then we hear two shots. The policeman enters to check the body, while Stan, Ollie, and Laughing Gravy head back upstairs. A really good conclusion to the short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is typical hilarity with pathos.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a huge fan of Stan and Ollie since I was a boy. This was the first film of theirs that I saw.I have it on video now, along with many others and never tire of watching it. Every character is superb, even the dog. You really have to feel sorry for the landlord who should never had let Messrs. Laurel and Hardy stay in the first place. To be able to make a comedy as good as this with so few characters and in the one room (there are some outside shots) indicates the genius of these pair. There are few comic actors of their ilk around today. The dialogue is the king today whereas it was the visual gags that was paramount for Stan and Ollie, and that can be seen to great effect in this movie. I am no prude but vulgarity was not needed by Stan and Ollie to make you laugh, and laugh at this film you will. Sadly missed and 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dead Of Winter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The humor of Laughing Gravy operates on the premises that 99% of the audience are pet lovers. Therefore anything that Stan and Ollie do to keep their little pooch Laughing Gravy from being tossed out to the elements of winter is absolutely justified. Even if landlord Charlie Hall has a no pet rule in his establishment.And so most of the film is spent with them trying to get the little guy past the watchful eye of Hall. Remember this is the dead of winter with snow falling on the ground. Best moment in the film is poor Ollie in his nightshirt falling into a rain barrel partly frozen over. I get susceptible to pneumonia just looking at him.The last part of the film also has Laurel getting $1000.00 inheritance from his uncle providing he severs all connection with Oliver Hardy who has held him back for years. Funny thing is that those are precisely the words Ollie said about Stan. The World Court in The Hague would have a problem deciding on the merits of counter lawsuit has to who held back who. You be your own judge.Stan and Ollie do prove that friendship can survive a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>your face will hurt from laughing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stan and Ollie live in a rooming house. The room is located on the 2nd floor. The night is cold and snowy. Having a mean landlord is not a plus. Stan and Ollie find a mut in the freezing cold of winter. Being humanitarians and virtuous Stan and Ollie have to engineer a way to get the dog ( Laughing Gravy ) up to the nice, warm room. Try as they may they just can't seem to find a way to get the poor pooch up to the room. Many attempts are made. The last one succeeds much to their relief. Granted the dog does get taken upstairs with some success. That is just half the boys problem. The fact that the landlord has a double barreled shot gun is the other. You have to see what is CLASSIC old time comedy at it's best. This is performed never better than by the grand masters of comedy, Laurel and Hardy. See this movie if you can. Better, buy it if you can ( it is currently out of print ). The laugh will be on YOU to enjoy again and again.</fullReview>

When the landlord discovers the dog he throws him out on the street in the cold snow. Laural and Hardy have to rescue the dog and make sure the landlord doesn't find out. You can understand the mayhem they will cause.The typical Laurel and Hardy humor, which is quite amusing, is a little too predictable here. This short gets funnier near the end, but the first half wasn't that good. Well, one little surprise was funny in that first half. Still, I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

Hardy falling in a barrel of water is certainly the highlight.Laughing Gravy (1931) ** 1/2 (out of 4) extended 3-reel version Foreign markets got this extended version with an extra reel, which really hurts the film.

		<shortDescription>A great example of how a Laurel &amp; Hardy short should be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very typical Laurel &amp; Hardy short. It's filled with some typical and very well executed slapstick humor. This is a great example of how a Laurel &amp; Hardy movie should be.It's no secret that Laurel &amp; Hardy made their best picture together in the early '30's. This movie is definitely one of their greatest and most enjoyable ones.The first halve of the movie is mostly filled with slapstick comedy. It's most definitely the best part of the movie. The comical slapstick moments are typical and amazingly funny, mostly due to the fact how well executed and timed they are. The second halve of the movie drags on for a bit too long and doesn't rely anymore so much on its slapstick and visual humor. If only the movie would had been about 10 minutes shorter, how great than it would had been. Not saying that it isn't great or enjoyable enough now but yet the movie had more potential of becoming truly one of the greatest or most memorable Laurel &amp; Hardy shorts.Their mishaps with Laughing Gravy the dog are funny and provide the movie with its best moments. Also good are the comical moments with the landlord played by Laurel &amp; Hardy regular Charlie Hall, who of course doesn't like the boys having living a dog around in his house. Still it makes me wonder why they didn't gave James Finlayson the part and why didn't Arthur Houseman played the drunk in this one? I missed the both of them in this movie and I had the feeling that the movie would had been even a more fun one with them.A near perfect slapstick comedy, that more or less falls short of greatness in its second halve, which prevent this movie from being the best or most memorable Laurel &amp; Hardy comedy short but nevertheless it's one of their most fun and typical comedy shorts around.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of their best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Laughing Gravy" is a black-and-white short film from almost 85 years ago and even if that is such a very long time, they already had sound back then. It is certainly a bit strange to see that this one here was released in April as it has such a holiday spirit attached to it. The dog is a nice watch for young audiences while the two protagonists are for the grown-ups. And there is something in here that other Stan&amp;Ollie shorts are frequently missing: elaboration on the friendship of the two. However, of course there is also the usual slapstick humor, the mayhem the two cause which always has Ollie end up in bad situations and finally of course the camera shots on the desperate, angry face of Ollie and the clueless face of Stan. Horne directed this one, Walker wrote it and these two made many films with the legendary comedy duo. All in all, a fine watch. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Narratively marginal, but structurally sound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy stuck together through thick and thin; one pocketbook between them - always empty." - The opening title card of Laughing Gravy.Laurel and Hardy's comedy short Laughing Gravy is probably the funniest thing in film that ever dealt with the ideas of hypothermia and suicide, let alone those two topics together. In a humorous and well-spent twenty minutes, we see Laurel and Hardy as roommates in a small apartment, housing their dog they nickname "Laughing Gravy" against the landlord's policies. After the dog's incessant barking wakes up the landlord, along with Laurel and Hardy breaking their bed and having the plaster on the wall crumble on top of him, the landlord (Charlie Hall) finds the dog and proceeds to throw him out the window. This leads to a series of comedic improvising by Laurel and Hardy to get the dog back as soon as they can, as well as not waking their landlord up from his slumber.Laughing Gravy is simplicity well done, as the general bulk of Laurel and Hardy shorts are. The most evident issue here, however, is that this is an early talkie short, so you get the feeling that writer H.M. Walker, at that time, wasn't totally sure of how to structure dialog for a short/feature-film. As asinine as that sounds, after we've been graced in America with films with sound for over eight decades, it's easy to overlook that idea. However, the lack of distinguished dialog and conversation in Laughing Gravy had the ability to make me forget I was watching a short with sound half the time, as music constantly plays in the background.Other than that, there's little else to say about Laughing Gravy other than the situational comedy in the picture works for a surprising twenty minutes, and that the ending, as unexpected as it is, finds ways to be darkly funny in a way I would've never expected an American short from the early thirties to be. The short is a simple, effective piece of early-American comedy, but not on par with the numerous other fantastic shorts of Laurel and Hardy, or the ones directed by James W. Horne.Starring: Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Charlie Hall, and Harry Bernard. Directed by: James W. Horne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Too much" to a few, but very funny to the rest of us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stan and Ollie share a flat in a boarding house, along with their little pet dog Laughing Gravy. The landlord finds animals to be a nuisance, however, and denies the poor thing entrance, despite a biting snow-storm outside. Our heroes are determined not to let their pet freeze to pieces, of course; and there's your plot, involving the boys' attempts to get the dog inside without the landlord getting wise about it. Being largely a remake of their last silent effort, ANGORA LOVE which had reached theatres only a couple of years before, LAUGHING GRAVY is arguably a superior work. The boys are given more opportunity here to contextualize the material to their personalities; the affection shown to their pet is almost touching at times, more so than their somewhat odd encounter with the goat of the earlier film.Surely the material here is quite simple, if observed superficially, and the outstanding force of imagination which coins the very best work of the boys was, perhaps, being saved for later efforts such as HELPMATES and THE MUSIC BOX. Even so, it's quite striking how Laurel and Hardy, when in their prime, were able to conjure the simplest of material into something distinctly individual. One sequence here which always makes me howl with laughter (the first time so much so, I remember, that I literally fell off my chair...), has the boys trying to give their pet a much-needed bath. Again, though the humor is very much physical, its effect relies heavily on the personalities of our heroes, and a viewer's degree of familiarity with them. Though the landlord is to eventually declare their behavior to be "too much" of a burden, at least to the rest of us, the story of GRAVY should be a "laughing winner."

		<shortDescription>Laughing Gravy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. It should be mentioned this film was originally only 20 minutes, but extra footage was found giving it an extra eight minutes. Stan and Ollie are sharing a room together, along with their dog "Laughing Dog" (how he got that name, I don't know), and the Landlord (Charlie Hall) has rules about animals in the house. So after Stan's hiccuping, and the bed breaking, Gravy starts barking, and the Landlord puts him outside in the cold snow, and Ollie goes to get him back, falling into a water barrel being a highlight of his attempt. Back in the room, the bed breaks again, and Gravy is put up the chimney, and when the Landlord's gone, Stan and Ollie have to climb onto the roof to get the dog back. Luckily the Landlord is knocked out by falling bricks, while Stan and Ollie have to wash, starting with Gravy, and they can't even do that without something (funny) happening, and when the Landlord comes round, he wants them out. In the rediscovered part of the film, Stan and Ollie are about to leave with Gravy, when Stan receives a letter to say he will inherit his uncles' fortune, as long as he isn't near Ollie. Ollie is curious of this "private" letter, but of course he understands after why Stan refused to let him read it. In the end, Stan decides to tear up the letter and forget the fortune, not for Ollie, but because of Laughing Gravy. Filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film, it is an enjoyable film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laurel and Hardy in the Doghouse!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] It's the dead of winter and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are sleeping soundly, except Stan has the hiccups which cause their dog, Laughing Gravy, to bark. They weren't supposed to have a dog up there and if their landlord found out, he'd throw them out. More noise finally causes the landlord to go up to their room. He discovers the dog and throws him out. Stan wants to go out and rescue him, but Ollie decided to do it. He crept downstairs and found Laughing Gravy, only the door blew shut and locked on him. He calls to Stan who throws down some bed sheets tied together and lifts up Laughing Gravy, but forgot about Ollie! He's hit on the head with a flower pot because the landlord took him for a dog. Stan sent the sheets back down for Ollie and he almost made it up, but he fell into a barrel of ice water instead. He walks in frozen stiff.  Getting back into bed, the bed crashes to the floor which awakens the landlord who heads up stairs. Stan hid Laughing Gravy in the chimney. The landlord tells the boys to be out first thing in the morning. He leaves then Ollie goes up the chimney after Laughing Gravy. He get's stuck but finally get's out--filthy! They try taking a bath which proves unsuccessful. Then there was a knock at the door. A man gave a telegram to Stan, informing him that his uncle had passed away and made him his heir, however he would only get the money if he didn't hang around Ollie anymore. Ollie was offended that Stan tried to keep that private and sent Stan on his way, keeping Laughing Gravy. Stan ripped up the telegram. Ollie congratulated him and called him his pal, but Stan only did it because he didn't want to leave Laughing Gravy. Stan and Ollie head downstairs dressed because after the bath incident, the landlord ordered them out in 15 minutes when suddenly a policeman entered and placed the house under quarantine due to small pox, so no one could leave for six months. The landlord said it was too much for him to take, went into his room and blew his brains out. A pretty good Laurel and Hardy short. Them having a dog was a good idea. Veteran Laurel and Hardy player Charlie Hall is the landlord. Happy 71st birthday to Laughing Gravy, by the way! Anyway, I recommend Laughing Gravy to all you Laurel and Hardy fans out there!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A LAUREL &amp; HARDY Comedy Short.Stan &amp; Ollie are sharing a room in a boarding house with their cute canine, LAUGHING GRAVY. Trouble is, mutts aren't allowed on the premises and what the Boys go through to keep theirs hidden shouldn't happen to a dog...A hilarious little film, one of the best, although ending with a suicide is a bit much. Highlight: Stan &amp; Ollie on the roof. That's Charlie Hall as the ferocious landlord.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Their Best Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last 10 minutes of this film, which were discovered in the 1980s, was a work print. It has been inserted into Laughing Gravy in most video releases available these days. It was never the intention of Stan to have it included in the American release. After watching it, it is clear why. It just is not funny, and it slows the pace of the ending. It just does not belong there. Stan and his collaborators where smart film makers who had one criteria that each film was based on: "Is it funny?" As a life long lover of Stan and Babe, I found the missing reel interesting but not funny. I have seen everything that they did together and Laughing Gravy IMHO is not one of their best. But they turned out so many really great (funny) films that it is easy to forgive them.If you really want to see them at their creative best check out Scram!, The Music Box, Them Thar Hills, Helpmates, Below Zero, The Chimp, Men O'War, Blotto, Towed In A Hole, Beau Hunks. Parts of Pardon Us, Pack Up Your Troubles are also very good, but the very best example of the comic chemistry between them can be found in Sons Of The Desert. If they could be remembered for one film, my vote is for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty ordinary,...except for how the film ends--that's quite the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For most of this short Laurel and Hardy film, the fare is pretty typical of many of there films--with Stan and Ollie there usual lovable and stupid selves. However, they also have a cute dog that COULD have made this movie very "schmaltzy"--but fortunately, the dog is cute but the film doesn't get too wrapped up in feeling sorry for the pooch. However, late in the film--completely out of nowhere--Stan receives a letter about an inheritance (provided he dump Ollie for good). I cringed as this seemed like an obvious and cheep ploy for pathos (using sadness in comedies to pull at the hearts of the viewers). And so I found myself feeling a bit disappointed until it turned out that the writers for Hal Roach were actually NOT trying to manipulate the viewers--the end is wonderful and so, so cynical! I give this movie an 8 because again and again, it could have degenerated into phony sentimentality but in the end, it remained truly a comedy.</fullReview>
