		<fullReview>This movie is so rich in brilliant ideas and gags, it makes you forget the few weaknesses in the story and the characters.These minor weak spots are the only reason why the leading actors cannot excel in their usual way. Esp. the role of Christian Ulmen is just to 'normal' for him to show his true talent. Nora Tschirner is well casted, but she also didn't have the opportunity to show what she's capable of (btw, she is very beautiful and charming, hope to see more of her in the future!).Fortunately, an old football saying applies to this movie: the team is the star. Some of the supporting actors do a very good job in portraying the different types of soccer fanatics resp. their wives.If you're into football/soccer yourself or you know somebody who is, you're destined to recognise yourself/this person somewhere in the movie.Definitely worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I read the summary of FC Venus, I thought to myself, hey, why not give it a chance. Perhaps I'm in for a surprise. After all, the premise sounded way too predictable to not include an ironic twist that would make the movie at least half enjoyable. To my disappointment, it merely followed through with its paint-by-the-numbers storyline.If you're looking for any kind of message, how shallow it might be, look somewhere else. Not even a contrived "women can be powerful" message can be found here since too many circumstantial things happen before and during the final game (I have to be a little vague because I don't want to spoil anything for those inclined to see this movie).It was obvious how the movie tried to go for the typical Hollywood drama without being cheesy and having the feel of being German, i.e. a pretense sense of realism. The skills of the soccer players were held to such a low level that it almost looked ridiculous. I'm a better soccer player than those guys who are supposed to having played soccer for years. However, the film failed even more miserably when the supposed suspense scenes kicked in. Like a train wreck, it was hard to keep your eyes off it since they serve as a text book example for bad filmmaking.If you are young, female, and into soccer, you might enjoy this film. If any of these traits don't apply to you, by all means, stay away.</fullReview>
