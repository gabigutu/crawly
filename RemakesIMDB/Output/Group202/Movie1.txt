		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is to me one of the best none English/German movies ever seen. I can't really comment on Director or any other visual elements in the movie because it has been quite a while since I have seen it, what I can remember very clearly though is the characters. Although the predecessor of my comment states that the characters were not very real (and this is a rather valid point) I do not think that that is a negative thing. I think it is almost beautiful, almost comic how frank, cruelly honest they are. See, this is what makes this movie so very good, it's different, original, and because of it's obvious or even fake superficial and still rather insightful characters. It's almost comic. This movie really is worth watching, but only if you can see the beautiful in what seems to be the flawed.I recommend this movie to anyone who'd like to see something a little different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a mirror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I was not interested in this movie. Mainly because I don't particularly like Van Gogh and Katja Schuurmans. His movies were 'too arty farty' for my taste and I detest his manners (or lack of them). And I regarded Katja as a nice piece of ass who wasn't a real actress. How wrong could I be...I decided to rent the DVD after reading reviews and I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know if it was the intention of Van Gogh to hold up a mirror in front of people like me, but that's the effect the movie had on me.The same way I didn't regard Katja as a proper actress, the character of Pierre Bokma didn't take her seriously either. In return, Katja had an attitude towards people (like Bokma) because they don't take her seriously as an actress. In a way, this is reflected in the choice of the cast. Katja is a soapy and Bokma is a classic play actor. I found it quite refreshing to see Katja act very well. Even playing that she played a role (towards Bokma) came out very good. She really has a talent and actually can act. I was both delighted and ashamed of myself that I had judged Katja only because she played in a soap and looks gorgeous... I still don't like movies like Costa! but I'm not the target audience for those kind of movies. Interview is very well written, well played and if you like to see a great little gem of a movie, go see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great dialogue makes this one of the best Dutch movies in years...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Theo van Gogh did it again, and Theodor Holman earns every bit of respect on writing one of the best dialogue-movies I've seen in years. Pierre Bokma proves once again to be a great actor, and Katja Schuurman proves she's more than just a pretty face. Her role as a spoiled actress is greatly ironic, 'cause most narrow-minded viewers have only looked at her in this respect for over a decade. By playing this role with such finesse, she maybe proves to be exactly the opposite.If you don't like Theo van Gogh as a person, please don't take that as an excuse to bomb his movies. "Interview" shows his (and Holman's) talent. The way Pierre and Katja don't want to be in the same room with each other, but can't leave each other at the same time; the way this is combined in "Interview" made me proud of Dutch cinema. Just like "Karakter" did, and just like "Van God Los" did (among others...).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above average artistic huis clos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dutch film director Theo Van Gogh has always made it a point to shock his audiences.All of his films have been successful in that respect. Interview is a film which has its own elements of shock value.At the core of this film are a famous actress and a not so unknown journalist who knows the art of manipulating things.The good thing about them is that they are elementary symbols of arts and its relevance in our contemporary society.This is something which must be construed as this film's redeeming aspect.There is enough shock for audience as in Interview what starts as a slick television exercise slowly gets degenerated into an artistic huis clos where human emotions are challenged in order to play a game of winner or loser.This game is nicely fought as it signifies the victory of a common man over an influential person.Interview is a film which will surely influence many people either a young student film maker who might like to copy its low budget style.This is because the entire film takes place in a single room.Whenever a European film becomes a hit,Hollywood makes its usual attempts to copy.This film has also been made by Steve Buscemi. It is for the audience to decide which is the better version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a suprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all: this movie is Dutch spoken, If you don't know the people and/or the language, I think it's a lot less interesting.Theodor Holman en Theo van Gogh where the main reason to go to Tuschinski in Amsterdam and watch this movie. Alright, alright, stop laughing. I admit: it was purely for Katja Schuurman. Just her, and her nice body. No lies, only the truth, I'm Honest. Like the characters..Because I hate spoilers you won't find any in this review. But there can be only one conclusion. This low-budged production, shot in the living room of Katja Schuurman, is a very very nice movie.Pierre and Katja deserve a loud applause, great, great acting. While you're giving an applause, do clap also for Theodor Holman and Theo van Gogh, because the story and the cinematography are intriguing and a pleasure to watch.But, you ask yourself yearning, Why is this picture so interesting, why is it alright (understatement)? Well, Katja is hot. The framing, the close-ups, the use of light and shadow, it's all a pleasure to watch. Katja is hot. The chemistry between the main characters bursts out of the screen and keeps your attention. Katja is hot. The plot twist is not entirely unpredictable but it fits in and gives the film its charm and leads to a nice ending. Besides, the movie gets the corners of your mouth upwards frequently. Katja is hot. Please. Go see this movie. It won't disappoint you and if it does, it ain't a big torture to see Katja for 1.1/2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not convincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, you have to judge this for what it is and that's a low budget film. The effort is certainly worthy of praise. Theo van Gogh is a gifted director, Thomas Kist a good DP and the actors do a fine job. The film's problem lies in it's screenplay. Yes, Holman has created self-conscious characters and given them confrontational, brutally honest lines that certainly exceed the quality of dialogue in the average Dutch production, but I didn't find the characters psychologically valid, especially Katja's. They never struck me as real people. Holman doesn't display a true understanding of the human psyche, which is unfortunate for a psychological thriller. Therefore, it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minimalistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film with so little action, and so few people, it has a tremendous dialogue and great drama between Pierre and Katja - sometimes a little overdone, but generally the tension is so strong you can't take your eyes from it.As good as it is, it has its flaws too. Sometimes the journalist really slips off his professional stance which he now and then tries to uphold. I think a real journalist would not do that - as all pros, journalists tend to keep professional, even when doing a job they don't like, or even more so in an unpopular work situation. As a pro and seasoned vet, Pierre should have kept to his professional attitude more.Likewise, the dialogue goes off the map and then takes its time to get back on track. This is in a way a little tiresome, but also quite intriguing and one of the reasons the film came out so good. A beauty mark so to speak.This was my first van Gogh film, and I'll be sure to see more of him whenever I can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drama with the gravitational pull of a black hole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a way nothing much happens in this movie, but the incredible tension of love/hate between the main characters really captures you and sucks you in. Excellent acting. If you're a guy and don't like dramas it is still worth seeing it for the scene where Katja (the character) watches here own TV series :)9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A revolting cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This films has Theo van Gogh written all over it. A big, fat and pretentious pile of crap. Katja Schuurman and Pierre Bokma are quite good but seem to lack any clue of where the script with its clichés is supposed to take them. The end is insultingly bad and gives the impression of a tight deadline. Despite seeing some of his other films and tv appearances, I gave Theo van Gogh the benefit of a doubt but he blew it completely. Some clever references, some great shots, and even an occasional joke aside, this film has left me completely untouched. OK, maybe left with a bit of rage for spending money to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blah blah blah?.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On The third of November 2004, Muslim extremists assassinated director Theo Van Gogh because of his inglorious portrayals of their culture and beliefs. Did he deserve this merciless fate? No, of course not. Because everyone in this world is entitled to an opinion and if Van Gogh wished to express his using the medium of cinema, he had every right to it. This "Interview" dates from the year before the controversial filmmaker's death. It's a typical Van Gogh film, entirely set in one interior location and introducing two main characters constantly talking. It actually looks a lot like that other film of his, "06", only the protagonists are now face-to-face, while "06" exclusively featured two people talking over the phone. I admit I started (and continued) watching "Interview" for the most shallow reason possible: the starring of Katja Schuurman. This ravishing Dutch actress has the face of an angel, the voice of a siren and a booty that would even make the most popular Hollywood actress jealous. In this, she plays the part of a successful actress who gets interviewed by some sort of Bosnian paparazzi guy. They constantly argue, play with each other's feelings etc etc etc? The script is tedious and nowhere near original or compelling. Although it probably was Van Gogh's intention, it totally doesn't feel like an artistic piece of cinema, as there's no style to detect anywhere. Not even a bit of exceptional camera-work or memorable music. This is a complete failure and I don't really feel obliged to give it more praise simply because the maker is death. Avoid! Watching a train rush by is more exciting than this.</fullReview>
