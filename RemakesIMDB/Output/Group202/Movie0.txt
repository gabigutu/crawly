		<shortDescription>A fun little movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise here is that Steve Buscemi is a washed-up political reporter who is assigned to interview a tabloid-fodder actress known for her direct-to-video horror movie sequels (played by Sienna Miller). Neither one of them wants to do the interview but they wind up spending the entire evening together and (maybe) revealing a bit of the real person behind their defenses. The whole thing is a little contrived -- it's the sort of piece where both characters spend the first half complaining about how much they dislike the other, but neither one is willing to leave or ask the other to -- but the snappy patter and excellent performances sucked me in and I happily went along for the ride. Of course Buscemi is great, but Miller was surprisingly good as well, digging into the part of a sex symbol who isn't taken seriously with a lot of enthusiasm and self-confidence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My evening with a celebrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Interview" is something of an old fashioned two character drama updated to cover questions about just how much of the information we get in today's media saturated world can be trusted.The plot is simple. News magazine writer Pierre, who in his salad days was a top political reporter, has fallen from grace and is now lucky to pick up celebrity profile interviews. One night in New York he is assigned to interview a beautiful actress known for B movie horror films and highly sexed cable TV fare of the "Sex in the City" variety. Her only real claim to fame seems to be that she underwent a breast reduction operation, getting her implants removed.Through a fluke what starts off as an interview so disastrous that both want to immediately end it, turns into an all night affair when he bumps his head in a fender bender accident outside the restaurant where they meet. Rather than going their separate ways, they wind up going to her spacious loft where they spend the next few hours bobbing and weaving around each other like a pair of good middle weight boxers. And over the course of the evening, we learn quite a bit about both of them, or so we think.Steve Buscemi, who also directed, gets good marks for his acting, but even better for his work helming this story. He keeps it moving along with such energy and such conviction that one hardly notices that this is a two character set piece probably better suited to the theater and a small theater at that.The real revelation for me, though, was Sienna Miller, who I had never seen before and know virtually nothing about. She sparkles as the under appreciated sex symbol who goes along with that game because it has made her rich and famous. But there would appear to be a lot more to her than meets the eye, and luckily for us, she is not played as the clichéd dumb blonde with a heart of gold Hollywood usually trucks out in this kind of story. Miller's character is smart, at times highly manipulative, and more than able to handle herself in a verbal street fight.Whether in real life any actress, much less any journalist, would reveal their deepest secrets to a total stranger is highly questionable. But then part of the plothere is that we never quite know how much of what they say is the truth, and how much is manufactured. This is very much a story about how the media and celebrities use each other to attain their own ends.So what we come out with in the end is people who are smarter than they seem, but maybe a little less ethical than we would like them to be. And first and foremost in that category is the journalist, who we come to realize is not only capable of stretching the truth when it suits his needs, but also of betraying confidences if that will further his career.Miller's character is less easily defined, though, and some of that may be the script's fault, or some of that may be by design. There is a spot near the end of the film in which Miller's character clearly puts the mask back on. She re-establishes the wall between movie star and the member of the press who is there to interview her, nothing more. What that says is that most of, maybe all of, what happened on this unusual night was an illusion. Was it just the under appreciated actress proving she was much better at her craft than people thought? Was it a girl pigeon holed as a bimbo proving she was just as smart as the condescending intellectual reluctantly interviewing her? We never quite know in the end and that may be "interview's" one failure, because in the end, we really want to like the actress. We're just not sure if we do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stuck with Fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The film is based on the original screenplay by Theodor Holman and a 1993 version directed by Vincent Van Gogh distant relative Theo Van Gogh, who was shot and killed in Amsterdam. Theo Van Gogh, a renowned journalist, once said "I prefer covering the war between a woman and a man." With this remake, director and actor Steve Buscemi does a wonderful job of doing just that.The set-up is simple enough. Buscemi plays a political journalist whose editor believes has lost his edge and is now assigning him fluff pieces. Enter the fluff piece ... a beautiful actress who is known more for her off screen "romances" than on screen talent. Sienna Miller plays the actress Katya and delivers an outstanding performance; by far, the best of her career. She is all over the place with the role, but stays focused on the internal torment and remarkable people smarts that Buscemi's Pierre is lacking.Along the lines of "My Dinner with Andre" and "Before Sunset", there is an enormous amount of dialogue and interaction between the two leads, who are on screen 95% of the time. Quite a statement in human nature's preponderance to pre-judge others, this is like peeling back the layers of an onion as each character uncovers a bit more about the other over alcohol, screaming and tender moments. Of course, the whole time the viewer is skeptical about which stories are real and which are fabricated or embellished for the purpose of the moment.Really an interesting film and directed with a nice touch by Buscemi, who is also at his usual high level of acting. Don't miss the quick glimpse of the real life Dutch star Katja Schuurman, who was in the Van Gogh version of the film. She is the lady who steps from the limo and greets Buscemi's character. A must see for those who love the structure of scenes with dialogue rather than special effects. And remember, there is always a winner and a loser.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was originally made in Netherlands (2002) by a Dutch Director Theo Van Gogh. As I am staying in Amsterdam, that know-how interested me and on top of that I have a liking for Steve Buscemi (obviously after seeing Fargo).This is a story of a political journalist Pierre Peters (Steve) who is given a job to interview a B-grade movie celebrity Katya (Sienna Millers). They meet each other at a restaurant, dislike each other instantly, part their ways and immediately bump into each other again to land up in Katya's spacious flat. The remaining story unfolds with each of them trying to outsmart the other by being witty. There is a final twist in the movie that makes the viewers satisfy.Both the characters are complex, especially of Katya ? and I should say that even though Sienna Millers has tried her best and acted well too, still her character remains un-defined and shallow. This is the major slack in the scripting. Steve is wonderful and decent in this role. This is a special kind of cinema ? mostly experimental ? where the camera revolves around two characters in a room. But obviously Steve would have found the original movie so inspirational that he took the challenge to Amercianise it ? with him on the driving seat as Director and Lead Actor.Good movie, especially if you are of a kind you are a risk-taking movie goer, and open to different kind and genre of cinema.(Stars: 6.5 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Review - Interview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Interview proves itself an actor's dream. Co-written and directed by Steve Buscemi, the film is an insightful, at times intense exploration of the nature of celebrity, as experienced by a world-wearied, overly cocksure political journalist who'd do well not to underestimate his beautiful interviewee.Buscemi is Pierre, the flailing reporter who begrudgingly finds himself waiting to interview Katya (Sienna Miller), the latest in a long line of flash-in-the-pan Hollywood It Girls. As played by Miller, Katya is a charming, supercilious, seductive, wild-tempered, pouting, screaming enigma, proving much more densely layered than the Paris Hilton clone who first presents herself to Pierre at the restaurant an hour late, tiny handbag yapping with the sound of a miniature dog mobile ringtone. While it's clear the uninterested and impolite Pierre initially cares very little for his subject, a strange relationship begins to emerge between the unlikely pair as the evening takes a turn for the unexpected, with an injured Pierre invited back to Katya's spacious loft. Once here, moods swing violently, old wounds re-open and skeletons emerge from closets, an uneasy air of sexual tension underscoring the proceedings.Buscemi is certainly an excellent director of actors, himself not only in fine, sharply skewed form, but also earning from Miller possibly her best performance to date. This is literally a two-character piece, and thanks to the powers of both actors, Interview remains in constant command of our attention. If there's one complaint, it's that the film at times feels overly stagey, but this is a small grievance when weighed against the superior performances on show. The hand-held digital camera-work ably services a voyeuristic plot, and the script crackles with caustic repartee.The remake of a film by murdered Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gough, Interview is a tight, engaging drama with a thick nasty streak and an acutely barbed final act. It's a fine showcase for both Buscemi the actor and the filmmaker, and promises excellent things to come from Miller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It felt like it was half finished. I expect Buscemi was meant to be the villain of the piece but I ended up feeling far more sympathy for his character than I did for Sienna Miller's protagonist.Maybe that was intentional but it left me feeling less than satisfied with the ending and at a running time of under 80 minutes, it felt like there could have been a lot more to the story. While I can appreciate films which leave you to fill in the blanks as you see fit - such as the otherwise completely dissimilar "The World According to Garp" - this film felt like it could have benefited from another half hour of story. Perhaps redemption of either character or revenge for/reversal of the trick Miller's character pulls on Buscemi's.That said it was extremely well written and directed and the performances by both leads were pretty exceptional, hence a high score, but for the dissatisfaction I felt with the ending it would have been an 8 or even 9 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interview Works Amazingly against all Odds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much more interesting and better done than I expected. I'm usually not an advocate for remakes, but when they are done to honor the original film instead of to simply make money I'm all for it. This one does that and more and is the best remake since The Departed. It works for a long list of reason's, most particularly because of the performances. Buscemi is fantastic as a slime ball and always has been. This is one of his better performances of the last couple of years. He relishes in this character, and it shows. He is funny, and disturbing at the same time. Sienna Miller has been becoming a better and better actress over the last year or so. She deserved an Oscar nomination for her performance in the underrated Factory Girl last year, and deserves another one for Interview. She plays a roll similar to herself, or at least her image. Many people say this is easier, but it actually isn't. It is extremely difficult and very emotionally draining. It is rare to find a performance like this that works so well. She is stunning, and deserves better work. The style of the film is interesting. This is thanks to Buscemi's odd, and very experimental direction. Against the odds it works, and elevates the film above just strong acting. Much of the style can also be attributed to the screenplay. The dialogue and characters are expertly drawn. They also are odd, and occasionally stilted, but that's part of why they work so well. It's been a long time since such a stilted and mediocre script worked so perfectly. Even when I say all this though I must say I did have some problems. While I was consistently entertained the "message", if you will, never quite came across. It is a strong one, and should have been paid more attention too. The director of the original film was a strong advocate for free speech, and stood for many wonderful things. He was murdered in 2004 tragically for offending someone with something he said and believed. This film is obviously channeling his beliefs and I just wish it had either forgotten them, or drawn them a little better. However it still works perfectly as an entertainment, which is after all the point of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good sparring between two good actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of Theo Van Gogh's film of the same name. This is the story of a self important reporter forced to do a celebrity interview with an actress "best known for who she sleeps with". Good but far from deep-despite what the film thinks-sparring between characters is an amusing if at sometimes uncomfortable 85 minutes. The joy here is watching the actors do what the do best. The real joy here is watching Sienna Miller who proves she really can act. After a few borderline roles and a cringe inducing performance (at least in the trailer) in Stardust she proves that she is oh so much better than we are giving her credit for (clearly she really isn't just an actress best known for insulting cities and whom she sleeps with). If there is any flaws its a couple of odd twists that seem to occur just to have something dramatic happen and to prove what bad people the characters are. Its a minor flaw.Is it worth seeing? Yes. But I don't know if it really needs to be seen on the big screen</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good job by Buscemi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a solid effort by Steve Buscemi and his co-star Sienna Miller. It would do well as a 2 character play on the 99 equity circuit. Buscemi lays good ground work in developing his character early, while Miller shows her stuff gradually. I found them both believable and not typical Hollywood movies fakes. The things that happened to them seemed real, and the writing was solid. I was impressed by Millers effort, she showed the person and the emotion behind her character. Buscemi took the time to let the audience gradually learn the people behind the show-biz mask. I cared about both people which is my fundamental requirement for any art form. I get pleasure from real professionals doing a god workmanlike job. Kudos to both!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is weird. It starts out interesting enough with Steve Buscemi playing a political reporter who has to do a story on starlet Sienna Miller and can't really hide his contempt for this.But it doesn't go anywhere. It's a chamber play, 90% of the film take place in the starlet's loft. The two of them go back and forth and the producer's would probably try to sell this as a soul striptease, or an emotional tour de force, but it's totally pointless.The dialog most of time is artificial, both characters say and do things that just feel unnatural. And all those dark secrets they're supposed to reveal in the process are boring and disappointing. The screenplay is not funny, it's not clever or philosophical, neither dramatic nor mysterious.And after almost 90 minutes of this you ask yourself: why make a script-driven movie if there's nothing to say?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely horrible, and it pains me to say that. I have been a fan of Steve Buscemi for years and watching this made me doubt him as an actor, director and definitely as a writer! The dialogue in this movie is just horrible and completely unnatural... I should go back through the DVD so I could quote something, but I really do not want to see any part of this movie ever again. Here is my attempt at recalling some of the dialogue:Steve: I am angry and bitter. Sienna: I should just kick you out of my apartment, but instead I am going to kiss you Steve: I am possibly gay, oh yeah, and my daughter is dead... I just thought you should know that just so I could make this situation more awkward. Sienna: I love you, Ihate you lets do some drugs.The end.Don't see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a movie such as this, with a clever premise of a former brilliant journalist being demoted to interviewing starlets there should be some TENSION.I kept waiting for it. For some genuine cat and mouse play. So I forgave a lot of atrocious scripting and lack of character development.I mean Steve calls Sienna the C word when their interview breaks down in a restaurant and she then immediately rescues him when he gets injured outside the restaurant and brings him back to her apartment? Puh-lease. And the worst artificial wound I've ever seen on film, starts out real big, pouring blood, and then a bag of frozen peas shrinks it to gnat-bite size in 5 minutes. Yeah.And then what should have been reasonable dialogue to keep audience engaged is flimsy and unbelievable. He gets access to her personal laptop and breaks into her files while she's on the phone? They fight over the TV remote? He gets to French kiss her? Oh right maybe that was the payoff for Steve the person.I did watch to the end. I almost expected wedding bells in true Hollow-wood style but no, I was left dangling and not caring one whit.Don't waste your breath or your $4.00 (bargain bin at the local).4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve is better than this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Steve Buscemi. He is the real deal as an actor and as a director. He has done elite work as a performer and as an artist. Everyone fails somewhere, in some endeavor. Not a big deal. We all fail with some regularity in our lives -- at least, those of us who are human. So, this is a somewhat clumsy apology for the failure of "Interview." Here's the thing. It sucked. It sucked so badly I was knocked back on the couch, even if said collapse could be attributed to the four Budweiser American Ales (new brand) and three vodka Collins drinks I downed in order to be able to get through an hour and five minutes of the film. I will admit to being too weak to make my way through the rest. I had to turn it off, out of respect to Steve. I am not even close to being ready to concede that Buscemi has regressed as a director -- say, from "Trees Lounge" in 1996 to "Interview" more than a decade later. "Lounge" was the real deal, believable even if incredible in a few spots. What made it credible? I don't know for sure, but it stayed true to its turf. In "Trees Lounge," Buscemi's character gets to make out with Debi Mazar's hot and inebriated character. "No way!" you say? I say, "Way!" It's all about the setting, environment, and setup. I could very well buy that happening at Trees Lounge. Raise your hands, all who are chronic alcoholics. I see out there . . . not many hands, but a few. I have my hand raised. I am a long-time drunk and failure. I feel this gives me a modicum of "credential" in assessing films that leverage the motifs of drunkenness, addiction, and failure. -- But of course, that is delusional. Just because I am a f*&amp;kup does not mean I have any ability to assess a work about f*&amp;^ups. But forgive me. I digress. What makes "Interview" so bad is the contrived circumstances that are twisted in shape to enable the plot device of having a somewhat geeky journalist get in bed with a paparazzi wet dream diva. There are many bad devices that should have been edited before going full tilt with this one. Look, diva stars don't do B movie schlock. They don't do B horror movies. They do manufactured crap romance pieces. If they aren't pop superstars out of the gate or genuine teen stars that get great coverage with films like, I don't know, "Mean Girls" for instance, then they remain B movie actresses and never achieve celebrity. This movie got the sequence of events wrong in the "celebritization" of the object of the interview. Beyond that, the dialogue was so contrived and artificial as to be painful. I am not sure if the shortcoming should be attributed to the delivery of the actors or to the script, but the banter was not credible. The circumstances were not credible, and the movement toward increased intimacy of the two leads was not credible. Now, maybe it could have been credible. . . . But it wasn't credible as presented. It really failed, really badly. The babe lead would not have gotten into the male lead, given the setup. And even if we allow for the intervening set of circumstances that re-united them, . . . I'm sorry. This thing devolved into really bad meta-melodrama. Hey, if you don't agree, feel free to attribute it to my progressive loss of sensibilities due to advancing age, substance abuse, and life. If you want to see what Steve can do as a director, see "Trees Lounge." Okay. I am still a confirmed Buscemi fan and I love him. Just burn that copy of "Interview." Peace. Out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious media commentary, but agony to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A journalist of international politics is sent to interview a sexy soap opera star, but the situation heads in a wrong direction from the beginning. The interview turns into a furious battle of wills and a complementary spiral of deceits.Bogus, stereotyped, downright repulsive. "Interview" is pure agony to watch as the narrative progresses without any credibility while the dialogue is making you wince in all its pretentiousness. This is truly like watching a bad soap opera. Nevertheless, thanks partly to some intriguing "acting of acting" by Buscemi and especially Miller, between the lines the film succeeds in discussing its problematic theme: the relation between a journalist and an actor, in which information and truth become tradeable goods and instruments of power. At its best, "Interview" manages to widen its scope even to a deeper social commentary about the impossibility of commodified social relations. In a mediated society of spectacle, all human relations become nothing more than acted roles, and a genuine contact can no longer be attained.Despite the interesting - even if extremely pessimistic - argument, "Interview" suffers too much from empty, meaningless and stagnant dialogue. The essentially trivial questions of 'who betrays whom' and 'what is the "truth" about the characters' grow into excessively important motives for the narrative that quickly starts to repeat itself. The result is an unpleasant and contradictory watching experience. In the end, "Interview" is hard to like in spite of some serious effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Either over edited or poorly written from the start, leaving a really pointless story that is an entertaining enough cat and mouse game to get your attention, but takes it nowhere.Both Buscemi and Miller do great jobs acting, and it would be fair to say Buscemi did a great job directing. But the story...Unless the point of the story is that actresses and journalists think more clearly and sharply as they drink, smoke, and snort more, there is no point. The only other possibility is to provide an extended product placement piece for odd cigarette lighters.So I'm guessing that there was an assumption made somewhere that should have been explicit and developed in the film or a key part got edited out post-production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In case you're wondering, this story was not written by "the" Theo Van Gogh (brother of the famous Dutch painter) but his great-grandson who wrote and directed the original "Interview" in 2003 a year before he was shot, stabbed &amp; partially decapitated by a ticked off Muslim extremist who didn't like his movies.The only reason I'm mentioning this is to illustrate that Theo Van Gogh's films certainly had an effect on people. I haven't seen the original Dutch "Interview", but based on the story re-told here I see the kind of biting wit &amp; satirical finger-pointing that packs a punch. While I seriously doubt anybody will get assassinated over this film, I'm sure it may (good naturedly) ruffle a few feathers in the world of self-important journalism and Hollywood tabloid reporting.Steve Buscemi plays an arrogant political journalist who is sent on a fluff assignment to interview a soap opera/B-movie celebrity (Sienna Miller). He's rude from the outset, but due to his grandfatherly appearance and self-deprecating, sarcastic wit he has a certain charm that's fun to watch. He's a character we love to hate, and that's what makes this film work.Sienna Miller is well cast as the starlet known for her love affairs &amp; bust size more than her talent. But she's shown to be intelligent and good natured, so again we quickly become attached to her character even though she is a Hollywood cliché.What follows, in a very minimalistic, stage like show, is the torrid volley of love-hate banter between these two egos, each seeking to dominate the other. If you like the characters, then you're set for a fun and sometimes suspenseful ride. If you don't like them, well then I can see you becoming bored or annoyed.Really, though, who doesn't like Steve Buscemi &amp; Sienna Miller? Here they have an interesting chemistry, at times father-daughter, at times more like bickering exes. And always one is trying to one-up the other. In the second half they raise the stakes, building momentum to a big finale which I found very satisfying.If you're a fan of plays or films made from plays, particularly ones where characters love to antagonize each other like "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" (1966) or "A Streetcar Named Desire" (1951), with a somewhat claustrophobic 1-on-1 presentation, then give this playful movie a shot.</fullReview>

The movie is about two people who when they meet, think they come from two totally different worlds but come to find that they have more in common then they first suspected. The acting is amazing from both the actor and actress. Also the portrayal of human nature is accurate and how great or poor one's character/morals can be is awesome. To quote Steve: "It's a character driven movie that makes you ask questions." There was a good balance of comedy and drama with an attention to detail. It'll suck you in from beginning to the surprising end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When he dies I hope they preserve Steve Buscemi and slice him up to figure out how someone could present such a Cretan, regardless of how his character is written on the page. I will always remember his persona from the first time I discovered him on screen in Reservoir Dogs, as the non-tipping Mr. Pink of Quentin Tarantino's crime tale.In the case of the film Interview, we are very lucky that he decided to pursue funding for what for many was a very individual film in the hands of the original filmmaker Theo van Gogh. Van Gogh's background was ostensibly journalistic and his outspoken voice got him eventually killed. That Van Gogh's treatment of his subject matter may have been more for explication than entertainment, this adaptation may be better than the original.Generally American remakes (I don't know why Hollywood constantly does it) are not as good as the originals. Al Pacino was in the remake of Scent of a Woman (ugh?!), and was award an Oscar for his acting in the thing! The TV series The Office with Steve Carell is a remake of an excellent British TV show that is so far above the American simulacrum, that I am embarrassed to admit that it is playing in a country I inhabit.But the Interview remake has a lot going for it that the original doesn't. Steve Buscemi does double duty as director and lead character, political journalist Pierre Peders, assigned the task of doing a fluff piece on the flavor-of-the-week Sienna Miller's self-involved actress Katya. At first this seems like a thin plot to hang an entire film on, but the movie touches on several cultural flash points that are sure to cause controversy in the viewer.There's a particularly vibrant live feeling about the film, and this comes about primarily due to the way the scenes are directed. Buscemi's direction is to tap into the truth of the relationship between Pierre and Katya, and this does come off as caustic at times, but the actors always seem like real people.The look of the flick is well-matched to its themes. Three camera operators shoot consistently each scene from specific vantage points so that many of the reactions from the actors are spontaneous. This is a two-hander and Buscemi and Miller carry the entire feature, and the dynamic that ignites between the two is memorable and will leave you thinking through much of what the characters say and do as the screen fades.The film at times may feel a little too much like theatre. Things happen without a convincing amount of set up. We may wonder why Katya brings Pierre into her apartment in the first place. Some viewers may see it motivated by a sense of guilt on her characters part. Once inside it seems that each character needs the other to fulfill a need. This is never overtly expressed and director Buscemi allows the viewer to supply some speculation.Whatever reason works to drive the story, the needs of each character come out in caustic, sometime violent ways, and the integrity of each is shown as completely devoid of substance. You may feel that the conflict is a standoff, and that viewpoint depends on what your value system dictates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive portrayal of dysfunctional interaction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a political journalist's unconventional interview an actress who is known for who she sleeps with rather than her work.I was completely captivated by the film. "Interview" is quick to get down to business, and within 10 minutes of the film, all the character and plot ground work is already laid down. I was the most impressed by the script of the film, despite only 2 people being in the film, it never felt boring. The tension and power struggle between the two is portrayed very well. Katya is an unstable person, highly self centred and has no respect for others. She is ambivalent to most issues, such as asking Pierre to leave and then to manipulate him to stay a few seconds later. She is emotionally labile, switching from like to hate within seconds, manipulative and thinks dichotomously. Katya provokes so much counter-transference in me, I kept thinking "How could she do that". Together with the substance abuse and her chronic fear of emptiness, she is truly disturbed. Whoever wrote the script must have worked with a psychiatrist, as Katja's behaviour and speech is quite suggestive of borderline personality disorder.Sienna Miller is really good in her portrayal of Katya. At first I thought she was the laughing stock of the film as she was deemed to be "playing herself", an actress who is known by reputation rather than her work. Through her portrayal of Katja, I am impressed that she used this exact stereotype to overturn what people thinks of her.I am genuinely impressed by this film. It is a tight 80 minutes of dysfunctional interaction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>has the same appeal, and the minor drawbacks, of modern theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interview, a remake of the Theo Van Gogh film from a few years back, is a taut tightrope act between two characters who can't stand one another and seem somehow fascinated all the same. Whether or not that fascination, or even that resentment, is genuine is also part of the sort of guessing game; is she really giving out who her real self, or is she actually mopey? The dialog is revelatory though, the kind that makes for great theater, where we're given two characters and a whole bottle of neuroses poured out into a one-night thicket, which is probably a convention too at this point with theater. But Buscemi makes it compelling cinema, for the bulk of it, before it starts to reel into the realm of the twisty-psychological guessing game- final twist included- that should seem natural but feels a little more of a contrivance. You really can't stand these people (or actually Miller's character), but you never want to look away from what they'll do next.It's about a political journalist (Buscemi) assigned to a "fluff piece", begrudgingly, with a hot young starlet of B-movies and TV (Miller), and after a bad dinner interview, or would-be interview, and a bad knock on the head in a taxi cab as Buscemi is leaving the restaurant, she invites him up to her place to clean his wound and suddenly the interview starts up again. Curiosity, coy word games, and the search for some kind of truth- about work, love, oneself with drugs, and the little dark secrets that come out of nowhere, take up what is 3/4 of the film's running time in the loft. One might wonder why this film needed to be because of Van Gogh's original film from years before (which, by the way, had the actors playing their characters with the same names, and as a real serious actor playing against a real TV star).But Buscemi, as writer, director, and actor, is never one to stop his form of weird fascination too. He's such a strong presence in Interview because he remains the 'voice-of-reason' even as his character drinks and drinks and tells a tragic story that didn't really happen like it was told. And Miller gets the juicy mind-f*** role, where she can go between all the roles that an actress goes through in melodrama while peeling past the layers to show, well, even more layers. By the end we probably don't know her any better than when she sat down for a drink at the restaurant, except perhaps that she loves getting into character and messing with someone who has no idea who she is, in work and in life.When Interview is at its best, it combines fine performances with a beat after beat of dialog that does a double-cross: it's playfully self-aware of the situation, but at the same time the two characters go for truths about one another that take people sometimes years to get at in 'real' relationships. That it's "game"-ness almost leads it into feeling like an indie-movie lark goes without saying; it's small, compact, and with enough to say in 82 minutes without overstaying its real-time welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Buscemi's "Interview" is the remake of a 2003 Dutch movie of the same name (which I haven't seen, therefore I can't compare this to the original). Buscemi did a fine job behind and in front of the cameras. It was great to see him playing an atypical, much more serious role than usual - Pierre, a political journalist who's set to interview a blonde diva, B-movie star Katya (Sienna Miller, who surprised me with a good performance after her bloody awful turn in "Factory Girl", easily one of the most cringe-inducing performances I've ever seen). They end up at her apartment for a long night of talking, drinking, and secrets revealed.Buscemi and Sienna have the right chemistry, plus his smart script and directing find the right pace for this kind of movie, so their long conversation never gets boring. The somewhat unexpected ending adds a cynical touch to the narrative that'll be loved by some, and sound a little too sour for others. "Interview" manages to be interesting enough for its 84 minutes, without being absolutely fascinating, but still compelling to visit. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pierre is a political reporter, assigned to write a fluff piece on Katya, a superstar who acts in slasher movies and a successful show about single girls in the city. The interview, at a restaurant, goes badly. She's late, he's unprepared and rude. After leaving, he bangs his head in a collision and she takes him to her loft to clean the wound. Provoked by alcohol and competitive natures, the interview resumes. She takes phone calls from her lover, Pierre reads her diary on her computer. They discuss wounds, he expresses concern, father-daughter feelings arise......For a short movie, this really goes deep into the psyche of our two main characters. But whereas you would think that the interviewee is the bitter, rude, anger filled celeb of old, it's actually Pierre, who spends the majority of the film feeling sorry for himself, and licking his wounds, both physically and mentally.Miller here is the voice of reason for a while, and when she feels more comfortable, she in turn opens up to him, and this in turn makes him realise her vulnerability, almost creating an uneasy father/daughter type relationship.Buscemi directs the film with with an interesting eye, and he's predictably brilliant as the bitter reporter. But it's Miller here, who's completely fantastic as the star, and in just a few minutes of being on screen, she goes from Jude Laws girlfriend, to compelling screen presence.It easily he greatest performance, and its a gripping watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie reminds me « Chinese coffee » starring Al as it's a closed evening between 2 characters. Here, one great enhancement is Sienna's loft as it's big and spacious so she and Buscemi have a lot of space to breath. Beyond, i feel also like watching a real TV show as it's almost uncut. The big difficulty in that kind of movie is to keep up the rhythm and here, it's almost done. Sure, 80 minutes are enough, sometimes i lost the flow of the dialogs, other time, i look for the time left, but at the end, it was a great evening : Buscemi, who looks like an old Maccauley Culkin, is a cool guy and Sienna is this hard to catch babe whom the movie is all about : part spoiled brat who know she is sexy and plays with men but also a frail, fragile young woman terribly romantic and caring. For Sienna fan, it's a must see all the more than Sienna is the first actress I know to play so much actress in her movies (« factory girl », « 2 jacks », « nous york », « the girl »). It's funny to see pictures of Katja Schuurman in the loft and that she appears at the end, going out of a limousine : During the movie, i really thought that it would finished in a confusion, as Sienna would have been revealed to take the place of Katja but it's not the case. In all cases, this movie is the remake of the dutch movie starring indeed Katja, with who I have already a good connection (see my reviews about « Costa ! »).NB: if her phone ringing with the dog barking was a bit irritating, it made me a bit smile however as it recalled me that i did almost the same thing during a internship: in the office, i chose a miaow for incoming mails and it brought fun in working hours!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remarkable film directed by the talented Steve Buscemi, is something of a tour de force. It is essentially a two-hander starring himself and Sienna Miller, then aged 26. Pulling off a two-hander which lasts as long as a feature film takes a great deal of talent and ingenuity, and there are few occasions when anything like this has occurred successfully. I would say that this film largely succeeds, therefore, at the impossible. It keeps us watching two people for 84 minutes. Try doing that in real life, much less on the screen. I can't imagine how Buscemi ever raised the money to make this risky film. He must have called in all his chips. Anyone with two eyes in his head can see that he pulled it off on screen and got lots of plaudits, but I doubt whether it ever earned its costs back. Presumably he worked for nothing and Sienna took a low fee. But even then, there's a crew to pay. How did they do it? We'll never know. But it was a foolhardy enterprise well worth undertaking. At least they can all feel good about themselves, and those few of us who have seen the result think all the better of them for it. I never really thought of Steve Buscemi as a serious figure before I saw this, because he often plays goofy guys in films and he never came to the fore in my consciousness (what little consciousness I may have). He always seemed to be hanging around as a supporting player in things, but you know, I am more interested in actresses, aren't I? But that brings me to Sienna Miller. I used to meet her and her sister when they were children and they were very polite, interesting, and pleasant kids. It also seemed obvious to me that Sienna had something special about her. But who thinks a kid is going to become a movie star? And yet sometimes they do. That was in the days when I was friends with her exasperating father, a friendship which ended badly. (I never met her mother, as by then the girls had one of their stepmothers.) So angry was I with Ed Miller, for good reason, that for a long time I refused to watch any movies with his daughter in them. However, due to my fondness for Terence Rattigan, I went along to the Old Vic to see one of his plays and there was little Sienna, now a big smiling girl with a huge personality, dominating the stage with plenty of charm and talent, and I thought: 'I've had this girl figured all wrong. She may be the daughter of Ed Miller, but what the hell, she's not him, she's her, and she's really got it and I must not hold anything against her.' So I broke down and watched one of her movies, and this was the one. I rush to confess that she is a really impressive person, chock full of talent and oomph, and long may she take part in Interviews, and I hope she gets stacks of Oscars, which doubtless she will do sometime if she keeps on like this. But let's not forget she is also dynamite on the stage, and I would say even more so than on screen, and that is saying something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To make a short story long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movies was written, directed and stars Steve Buscemi. This trio involvement spells potential problems because it so lends itself for the artist to indulge in his work. Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of Buscemi and have a crack at anything he's involved in, unless he dares go in the horror genre; I draw a line somewhere. The performances by Buscemi and his co-star Sienna Miller as well as a good part of the dialogue satisfied my expectations but I don't think there was sufficient material in the script for the length of the movie. Hence, I thought it dragged in many parts of it and would have made a great short story film rather than a feature-length one. Sienna Miller character was excellent writing and she was a pleasant surprise by the time the movie ended. It is a smart drama. I understand why Buscemi evidently cared about it; the character is right up his alley, as witty yet non-comedic roles go. There are no supporting characters in the story; it's sort of a one on one thing (lucky Steve). I doubt you will like it; you may if you dig his work and know it well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A contemptuous political journalist Pierre Peders (Steve Buscemi) is assigned to interview a soap opera star Katya (Sienna Miller), much to his annoyance. After a brief and unsuccessful chat in a restaurant, they decide to call it a day but due to an incident on the street, Katya invites Pierre to her loft apartment and they end up talking all night. Both have troubled pasts and there's plenty to discuss, but the tone of the conversation keeps changing. Moments of sincerity and sneering sarcasm take turns ? is there a seed of friendship to be found in the end or is it all just a mocking joke?The style of the film is kept close to reality with hand-held cameras but the story doesn't come across as completely convincing. Maybe the point is to examine the nature of conversation with two people who are no strangers to twisting the truth to achieve their own goals, but the constant sneering makes it hard to get truly engaged in the characters' lives. This must have been intentional though, as in the end the film paints quite a cruel picture about human relations and the unreliability of people.Besides the two stars, there are few characters in the film and most of the story takes place in one apartment only. Both Buscemi and Miller play their roles with understated charm and especially the former is very good in his role, as always. Even though Interview is not among my favourite conversation films, Buscemi alone makes it worth seeing for friends of dialogue-driven character dramas. I also recommend it to fans of movies about reporters and the ethics of journalism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite a simplistic plot, Interview is a very nice example of good film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A political journalist (Buscemi) is sent on a clearly beneath-him assignment to meet an attractive B-list soap star celebrity (Sienna Miller). He makes a mess of the interview, but winds up at her Manhattan loft apartment following an unfortunate car accident. Thus begins an intriguing two-character plot arc in which the mismatched couple argue, drink, snort cocaine, argue some more, and ultimately find some common ground as they both loosen up and reveal some secrets.This is the second time I have watched this film. I remember seeing it almost two years ago and enjoying it quite a bit. Same thing happened on this second viewing. Interview is, essentially, a lengthy conversation piece and therefor depends almost entirely on its acting. And both actors were splendid. Steve Bushemi who also directed the film delivered a great performance; he's a very talented actor and a household name and I wouldn't expect anything less from him. The stunningly beautiful Sienna Miller demonstrated, once again, that she's not only a pretty face but can act as well. Just like her character, Miller gets a lot of bad press but I've seen most of her work and she's actually quite talented.The direction was impeccable and kudos to Buscemi for making this film such an entertaining, engaging and wild ride and also for not trying to extend the running time. Clocking at 84 minutes and despite a simplistic plot and setting, Interview is a very nice example of good film-making. Definitely recommended.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's interesting because this film is about hurting each other. I believe you can't hurt somebody you don't care about and you can't be hurt by somebody you don't care about." Steve BuscemiThe Dogme 95-esque filming manner of Interview, a remake of a 2003 Dutch film by Theo van Gogh, draws on the bare elements that films require; actors and recording equipment. The film is set majorily in Katya's loft, and as the fly-on-the-wall bystander in the open-plan apartment, leaving the room without knowing a conclusion to the situation is bottom of any voyeur's to-do list.Baring in mind that mainstream films often rely on spectacular scenery, extraordinary events or one-man-can-change-the-world approaches, it is thoroughly encouraging to occasionally spend a close hour and a half with only two character, and not be able to decide who is good or evil. Much like the time we spent with Jeffries in Rear Window, or the sales team in Glengarry Glenn Ross, the characters confide copious amounts of past histories which the audience have no license to be knowledgeable of.A physical scar catalyses the movie into a deep intricate account of their personal inner lives. The war and political journalist shares tales of his compelling past with close relatives; his brother's suicide attempt, his ex-wife's death, and his daughter's heroin overdose. Equally, Katya has a larger than life history, a drug habit, smoking endless cigarettes and an untruthful relationship with her boyfriend. Although the film does take two extraordinary lives, there is no evidence that anything seen or heard is the truth and could quite easily be Pierre's alcoholism and Katya's cocaine snorting resulting in flamboyant imagination.Like in any script; conflict drives the narrative. There are no explicit goals attempting to be won or achieved, but a greater focus on the struggle to maintain supremacy. Katya's role in society ? purely being a stunningly beautiful "actress" ? lends herself to being celebrity with little reason for success, obliging Pierre to take superiority on the importance scale. While the film twists and turns its way through personal trauma, the erratic audiences' empathetic emotions fluctuate accordingly. Generally one might align themselves with either Pierre or Katya, but the film will bring the imagined character-spectator relationship into question at some point during is running time, and probably subsequently when the DVD player is switched off.In Interview, we find out a hefty amount more about the interviewer rather than the interviewee. If the journalist undertook his customary research and interview preparation, we would be left with the boringness of another Katie Price interview concerning her latest perfume. The ignorance of each other's toil provides opportunity to enquire into irrelevant issues on both parts, and as sexual tension turns into a familial relationship, sparks fly in all directions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'And in this corner of the ring...'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>INTERVIEW is a smart little independent film adapted from the 2003 Theo van Gogh film by the same name, a film that drew a lot of attention based on a script by Theodor Holman, which in turn was based on an idea by Hans Teeuwen sparring the famous Dutch actress Katja Schuurman with actor Pierre Bokma. In this adaptation Steve Buscemi reworked the Holman screenplay with the help of David Schechter, changing the female role to a tabloid type bombshell actress (also named Katya, played with razor sharp clarity by Sienna Miller) with a disgruntle political reporter Pierre (Steve Buscemi) whose career is on the skids requiring that he take lousy assignments such as this interview to stay alive.Other than a disastrous opening in a classy restaurant where the two characters realize they are ridiculously mismatched as an interview pair, the entire film takes place in Katya's loft. Katya appears shallow and short of goals and Pierre only acquiesces to complete the interview when he suffers a head injury and is invited for ice and drink to Katya's place. What ensues is a battle of wits in which each of the two characters discovers more about each other than either cares to disclose, and after a 'mating dance' of sorts the two return to their separate corners of the boxing ring - each having a final twist on the other's private life. It is a play within a play and the words make all the difference.Sienna Miller is becoming one of the more important actresses on the screen and in this role she proves her mettle in a superbly nuanced role. Steve Buscemi may not have been the optimal choice to play Pierre, but he is sharp to watch and is never short of intelligence, both as an actor and as a writer/director. Not an action movie and not a film for those who need strong narrative, but for viewers who enjoy the barbs and wit of a sparring match, this is a well-made example of the genre.

Always enjoy his characterizations, and the fact that Sienna Miller is in it as well was not a deterrent (even though I hated her character in "Factory Girl," though perhaps her portrayal was accurate). "Interview" started out well enough, but it eventually tried to be far more clever than it actually was. Much of the situation and reactions that occur make no sense whatsoever, and the ending implies that each character had an elaborate scheme to "get" the other (at least that's what I got out of it). And as far as Pierre's big secret, well, I didn't see how it could be used as a threat at all, which is what Miller's character does with it in the end. So, while quite watchable, this is not a film I'd recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tricky Question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Pierre sits down and tells Katya that he hasn't seen any of her films and that he usually does journalism related with politics, the actress is a little disappointed. She is a sensation; beautiful woman with a TV show and some B-Movies but truly better known because of the people she sleeps with and her sex scandals?Kind of like Sienna Miller, and Sienna Miller plays her. After a brief discussion and other events, a talk in a restaurant becomes a talk in Katya's apartment, and a long one. Now "Interview" begins, which covers a conversation that is everything but what the title declares. And when I say everything, I mean just about everything that can occur in an hour and twenty minutes. "Interview", directed and starred by Steve Buscemi, at first seems something like "Out of sight", where opposite attract, but then it turns into something like "Tape", where we experience various plot turns in a little space in a short amount time. However, in the end this film is not like "Tape" either, although it has similarities I'll explain later. First, the differences. "Tape" is a movie about a relationship; "Interview" is a movie about relationships, in general. "Tape" puts everything in the table with honesty; "Interview's" characters seem to be hiding things all the time and at one point the movie becomes a deception game, a competition where the more intelligent wins. Don't get confused, there's also a relationship in the movie; a relationship of two opposites filled with sexual tension, but sex goes into a second level of importance. It's surpassed by words that make the movie about general relationships. In other words, we are captivated by the sexual tension but not as much as by what the characters say and discuss. We are blinded by their changes of moods in a piece that's also slower than the unstopping "Tape". Also, it's more difficult with two than with three. Buscemi's direction here places the acting as the main factor. He is 'that' actor who is always there but we don't always recall. Well, you won't forget about him after watching his work here: you won't forget his face, his temperament and his naturalness: he's a real person. And Sienna Miller is another story. I'm sure every review about this film contains the comparison I made above, but I personally believe that it takes an actress of great courage, personality and talent to take on a role like Katya's considering her situation. It's not superficial because Miller really has a reputation, but if you ask me I'll tell you her performance here is fantastic, full of ever changing sadness and joy, a lovable smile that will make you fall in love and a perfect American accent. If something is similar to "Tape" here, is the challenging photography and editing work. This is a remake, and the same crew who worked for the original film in Holland went to the States to work with Buscemi. Theo Van Gogh, the director of the original and inspiration for this project, developed a shooting system with three digital cameras at the same time. Cinematographer Thomas Kist took care of that and Kate Williams edited it. Great job. Considering "Interview" as the deceitful game it is, I'll ask you one question, and think about it because it may not be as easy as it sounds: Who is better at deceiving? An actress or a journalist?</fullReview>

But the script is over-written and the plot is often ridiculous. His "finding" revealing information on her computer is just off-the-charts stupid. The premise of the movie could be good, but it was so over-wrought it failed. The endless "personal revelations" scenes were simply TMI, and would never have happened in that kind of situation. The twist ending was mildly entertaining (hence 2 stars instead of 1), but it shows Miller's character to be much smarter and virtually psychic about Buscemi's next moves than she would ever have been.

		<fullReview>This movie was showing on TV and instead of watching the news again or a boring talk show I decided to give it a go.The entire movie takes place inside the actress' house. Where Pierre Peders conducts his interview of Katya. As time drags on, and by drags I mean the kind of dragging that leaves you screaming and clawing to try and get away. Katya is a typical mindf*** who plays every possible d***-tease she can. She's obviously unhappy, and into snorting crack and playing games with men. Not only that but she's not in love with her fiancé.Pierre on the other hand wants one thing, or well 2 things. To get as many secrets out of this washed up actress as he can and to bang her. Which is disgusting because he's old enough to be her father and actually insists on role-playing him for 20 minutes. So after kissing him in the first 15 minutes Katya drags him through every sort of sharp glass, thistles and etc. you could imagine because she's bored, pathetic, lonely and craving attention.The only thing worse than this movie is my review. 'Interview' is complete and utter garbage. The script is regurgitated out over and over again. Both the actors gargle out the same lines 5, 10 and even 15 times. For example "I have just one last question", "I hate you", "Why are you doing this", "I'll just be going now". etc.This movie pretty much makes women look like the ultimate machines of male manipulation and paints a really fake and false picture of what journalism really is.Even after almost getting his end in and actually really befriending the girl, he steals her diary and sells every one of her secrets... FOR JOURNALISM!!!! (ROAR)!! Oh well, I suppose he deserves the massive scoop after putting up with all of her disgusting mindgames.I have no idea what kind of person could have such a boring life to sit through and watch the entire movie. I can't believe I got cold-shouldered into watching it. If I can give you any advice, please, whatever you do, please do not watch this horribly boring movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stellar piece of acting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: Pierre Peders, a political journalist, gets a for him unusual assignment to interview Katya, a diva and celebrity most known for her constant appearances in the tabloids. Pierre is very reluctant to do the piece, which he considers to be beneath him, and when Katya is over an hour late, the interview turns out to be a disaster. They leave quickly but after a small accident where Peter bumps his head he get invited to Katya's apartment. There an intricate game with different levels begin where both try to use the other to each owns personal ends.Comments: A remake after a Dutch original which I haven't seen (but must confess that I want to see it now) but it does seem to be very able to stand on its own legs. A rather unusual movie with basically just two persons battling it out in a interesting game and relationships. It pays to keep focus for the pace of the movie change quickly and the entire relationship between the two can turn on a single word. Actually, it wasn't bad to see it on DVD so I could go back and check what exactly was said and done some times.It is a very good story. Complex and entertaining. Always evolving, twisting and turning like it has a life of its own. But it is also very dependent on the two main actors. And they both give stellar performances. Steve Buscemi is deeply underrated in the movie industry and he often outplays everyone from the supporting bits he is far too often given. So, for me, it is no real surprise that he once again gives a solid performance. Buscemi is presently one of the best and to watch him act is reason enough to see any movies of him. In Interview he also has taken up the role of director and writer, adapting the movie from its original. And not surprisingly, the effort is flawless, as the story turned out so captivating, engaging and entertaining as it did.More surprisingly then is that Buscemi is actually challenged by Sienna Miller about best the performance. Miller has a very difficult role to portray the beautiful, manipulating and very complex diva. Her character twists between mania or depression in a second and everything is very believable. I had no doubt anytime or felt that she went over the top. It's a stellar performance and proof that Miller is much more than a beautiful face. Under Buscemi's direction she gives a stellar performance and it is a little odd that she doesn't turn up in bigger roles in bigger movies. She has got the talent and looks for it.Strongly recommended movie, especially if you want a change from the more common highly explosive action pieces of the blockbusters? 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..slowely becomes contrived and repetitive.The concept of this movie is an old one. I'm not sure which movie was the first to bring it to the silver screen, but as recent as 2006 we had 'Five Fingers' with Laurance Fishburn which, like this movie, doesn't exactly pull it off.The one that most definitely does pull it off is of course 'The Interview' from 1998 with that other Matrix icon: Hugo Weaving. I've never seen the original Dutch version by van Gogh, nor do I wish to. Watching a Dutch person trying to act is like watching a bad TV commercial trying to to be artistic.Steve Buscemi is a wonderful actor and proved with this film that he can also write. The trouble with the movie is that near the end it loses focus too much, there are too many illogical scenes and we already know what is about to happen.I personally like my movies with at least a satisfying ending. And although the performances were quite strong, the movie could have been much better if they had worked on the ending a tad more. It felt like they got tired after writing the first 3/4 of it and then just gave the rest a good once over.Too bad, 6/10</fullReview>

Check it out for the roller coaster theatrical energy and professionalism; and because of the production values and attention to the demands of the film medium, it works just fine as a movie as well (thankfully!).And, I should add; it was nice to see Buscemi playing something straight for a change. He so often gets cast in "concept" pieces that straightjacket him. It's odd: "Interview" is a concept piece, too: Except that Buscemi is allowed to breathe here, and that's so nice to see. It's nice to be reminded every now and then that he can hold his own in this regard; that he can play a human being.And he really can.</fullReview>

Their conversation devolves into hurling of insults, with Pierre calling Katya the "C-word". They split, and then as Pierre is driving down the street she sees him get injured in a car accident, and she invites him in to her place to comfort him.Completely unrealistic.

		<shortDescription>Good in a "quaint little drama" way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Buscemi directs, acts, and co-writes a small Indiewood movie with Sienna Miller about a political journalist who ends up interviewing a Hollywood star he knows next to nothing about. At first they don't like each other, and then after an accident they find themselves in her sprawling studio apartment going through the levels of emotion and attraction as becoming two people physically attracted but absolutely not meant for each other.It's a nice "short-story" sort of film, the type of narrative that fits into a short story but managed feature length. For the most part it was interesting and fun, especially since I'm a pretty big Buscemi fan. I liked it most because Buscemi played an jerk-after-my-own-heart, a venomous commentator who doesn't realize that half the problem is that he's as shallow and unimportant as his detested subject. Sienna Miller was all over the board.Except for a rough and unnecessary twist-form of ending, it makes a nice little dramatic comedy, a great exercise in acting, and a fun Indie-mentality small film. Recommended for people who just want a quiet night with some wine.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think, the movie is all about revenge. A simple interview turns out to be a war of minds and egos. In the end, we know all the deepest secrets of the interviewer, and absolutely nothing about the star. Sienna Miller disguises herself very successfully and misleads Buscemi, making him reveal himself; lose his cocksure appearance and his fake credentials. Surprisingly she does all these with honesty and her honesty beats up the hypocrisy of the other. It makes you keep watching and does not let you lose track of the dialog's in spite of the one shot in one room. Good dialogs, good acting, good movie. Do not play the game with someone who can play better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I write this little piece after my second viewing of the film( yesterday &amp; today), which holds up pretty good after multiple viewings. 'Interview' is a small but interesting film that focuses only on dialog and acting. Pierre, An over-the-hill (formerly successful) political journalist is forced to interview the 'actress' Katja, whose more famous for who she sleeps with than for her 'films'. The social rules are quickly thrown overboard as Pierre confesses he hasn't seen any of her films, which he also rates as B-films despite never seeing one. Katja storms out, calling Pierre unprofessional &amp; a jerk. Through bizarre circumstances (she causes Pierre's cab to crash)they end up at her apartment...where the interview continues. We discover Pierre &amp; Katja's strange life philosophies, different colours of personality and deepest secrets throughout the film and a real close connection is made with the characters as they lose all social etiquette and really talk about what's on their minds( of course the amount of alcohol &amp; drugs consumed is a factor). The end is pretty decent, though I found the twist to be unnecessary. It's a small bonus but the film would've been just as good without it. The love/hate relationship between Katja and Pierre may not be 100% realistic but it's very interesting. The film didn't bore me for a minute, mainly because the dialog was smart &amp; the film was deep and real at times. I didn't detect any Hollywood clichés and that's a rare quality these days. I can honestly say this is one of the few films of this year that's really worth watching.It was the first Sienna Miller film I saw but I'll definitely take a look at her future films. She delivers a great performance as does Steve Buscemi. Her performance is brilliant at times but also borders on over-acting. Most of the time she's believable, just one or two scenes I found her over-the-top. Buscemi is good, as always. 'Interview' is certainly not his best performance but I think he got everything possible out of the part. The on-screen chemistry is very good and you can tell Buscemi lifts Miller's performance. Buscemi's direction is great, I hope we won't have to wait so long before seeing another Buscemi film. It's his baby and he can be really proud of 'Interview'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>INTERVIEW is such a timely film for the "celebrity" hungry world of today in journalism with the need to grasp "each and every morsel" of information about a celebrity that will sell magazines or newspapers. And Sienna Miller is tremendous in her role of Katya, a young "with it" actress who lets it all hang out and then she encounters an INTERVIEW like no other. Steve Buscemi and Miller light up the screen with an intensity and dialog that is ripping, angry and very much reflects what is happening at this moment of time on wanting to nail the perfect story.However, the twist at the end of the film is a wonderful scene and once again, Sienna Miller is at the top of her game in handling "the lies we tell each other" photographed in the glamorous loft settings of New York. What a powerful film and such chemistry between two great actors, Buscemi and Miller. So, will there be another INTERVIEW, or is this the final one?? Only Katya can answer that question.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interview is the latest in the long tradition of films that treat the audience to a verbal match of wits, a psychological joust, often between the only two people in the entire film. Hard Candy is another recent example that comes to mind and I will admit to liking that one more than I did Interview.For some reason it is very entertaining to watch people manipulate one another on screen, trying to guess what, if anything, is actually true in what is taking place. But in this case I found that I didn't really care that much about these two characters, although I recognize that both Bescemi and Miller put forth admirable acting jobs. In the end they both seemed rather empty and ruthless, not really worth the time they took from my life.Just last night I watched Sienna Miller in Factory Girl, another portrait of a Beauty Gone Bad, only this time not getting to spiral up and over at the end. Is it only my imagination or has on screen smoking once again become de rigueur for the young chic; Miller smoked up a storm in both films and while it may have been historically accurate for portraying Edie Sedgwick, I could have done without it in Interview. I had hoped that we, as a society, were done subliminally glamorizing that particular self destruction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what do you know? I have been stalked by an anonymous interviewer in order for me to present my review comments of Steve Buscemi's play-oriented independent film "Interview". The confidentiality agreement does state that the mystery interviewer does want to be called A.I. (Anonymous Interviewer). OK, whatever works! Here it goes:A.I.: So Meeza why do you overexpose puns within your film reviews? Meeza: Interview is over! Get Out! A.I.: Why so hostile Meeza? This interview is not over. I just think that your miniscule readership group is getting too punned out when reading your film reviews. Meeza: Who invited this guy? Take off your mask! A.I.: And why post every film review in the I.M.D.B. (Internet Movie Database) website? It is not called the Internet Meeza Database! Meeza: Why are you still here? A.I.: OK, I will stop! Let's cut to the interview chase. What did you think of Steve Buscemi's film "Interview"? Meeza: "Interview" reminded me much of the last three minutes of this present interview. A hostile reporter, as yourself, interviewing a popular beautiful film star (as myself), while bickering constantly throughout the interview in trying to manipulate each other. Meeza: Why are you laughing? You do not think we were trying to cerebrally manipulate each other? A.I.: (while constantly laughing) No, I just can't get over the "beautiful film star as myself" comment. You are a riot, Meeza! Wow, that fantasy world of yours must be some place to visit. Meeza: Very funny, A.I. OK, this is getting creepy. Let me go back to "Interview". Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller are the sole major stars of the indie flick. Buscemi plays Pierre Peders, a political journalist who is given a non-governmental cumbersome assignment in interviewing a tabloid soap opera star named Katya, played by the ravishing Miller. Buscemi, who also directed the film, incorporates such themes as perceptions, loneliness, deceit, companionship, obsessions, and diversions within Pierre and Katya's verbal &amp; physical exchanges throughout the atypical interview. I do commend the great Buscemi within the film's various directorial techniques within the film's major location that is Katya's loft. But Steve did overextend the welcome a bit to the loft by inserting too many unnecessary Pierre &amp; Katya interactions which were unessential to the film's central moral message. Buscemi and co-scripter Theodor Holman did develop a clever "Interview" screenplay, but it did lack a bit of veracity within its dialogue component. Nonetheless, Buscemi and Miller composed themselves superlatively acting-wise throughout the "Interview". Sienna was deserving of her Best Actress Spirit Award nomination and it bewilders me why Buscemi receives constant "award injustice" by being snubbed time after time in thespian categories. A.I.: Can I get a word in? Man, I think you ramble more than you pun. I knew most of what you said already, Meeza. I wanted some insightful commentary. But I guess I have to interview a real film critic to get that, and not a pun imposter disguising himself as a movie critic. Two Days Later: Famous interviewer A.I.'s body was discovered lifeless in the bottom of the Miami River. He was bitten to death by a bunch of lobsters. City of Miami Police is conducting an investigation. OK, ENOUGH! END OF INTERVIEW! LOL!*** Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. This film is seriously addictive and I am completely surprised that I had not really heard about it. It is fast-paced, witty, sexy, gripping and utterly intense! The script is incredible and spot-on; every single word is the perfect choice for the two characters, Pierre (Buscemi) and Katya (Miller). You really don't want it to end!It is primarily set in one room with just the two characters and there couldn't have been a better way for it to have been done; you are entirely focused on those people and their feelings and how they react to each other. That and the use of the Dutch camera techniques, particularly the three camera technique means that the two actors are always on screen together, makes this movie about four hundred times more intense. In 'Interview' Steve Buscemi shows himself to be a very very skilled director as well as a wonderful actor. He knows exactly how to manipulate the feelings of the viewers so one minute you are crying and the next minute you are shouting obscenities at the screen making this film even more of an exhilarating journey. The sexual tension between Buscemi and Miller is at the perfect level to give this film a great balance between the emotional and physical connection. Every word the actors speak is delivered with a certain precision not often seen nowadays in modern films. They work perfectly together and completely embody their characters.I would recommend this film without hesitation to anyone. You must see it! And having, discovered that it was originally a set of three films I shall certainly be off to find the other two if this one sets any standard for the style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Did What He Could</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This kind of effort is rare in Hollywood. I will not say it is the most intellectual thing I could expect to see, and it was predictable to me in places, but for general audience and intellectual wannabes, it might be more striking or less than it was to me.When you do expect something unorthodox, and you do get it, maybe you say "it was predictable" and maybe you feel kind of dull because you could not stand up and say "Brava! Brava!" thinking the film sort of beat your brainwaves to it, but you also feel glad, thinking someone is kind of thinking about demands of your level and trying to meet the same. From that point of view, I thank Steve Buscemi cordially.Pierre (Buscemi) used to cover the hottest political issues and scandals for a famous TV channel. But for some reason, his editor is sending him to cover "God-awful fluff pieces". Eventually, he has to let go of an important coverage over interviewing Katya (Sienna Miller). She does TV shows and B-movies, but mostly she is famous for the celebrities she sleeps with. Pierre's reactions can be easily imagined.He went to interview Katya thinking girls like her probably have "silicon for brain cells" and what homework should he possibly have done to handle people like that? But through a chain of events that are neither intentional nor unforeseen, they stick together for the night, conducting a one-of-a-kind interview.Some people have criticized this film rather harshly. That's rather unfortunate. If Antonioni made a film like this, most of them would not grab all of it, but would not be able to criticize so boldly because he was an intellectual behemoth. Now that Buscemi gave it a try, those who are happy with "The Departed" and "Chicago" started to say it's such a waste of talent made to look like intellectual crap. Well, it is not. It is an honest film. And may not be the mirror to the height of profundity of human mind, but still quite admirable a work.If Buscemi had more experience, he would perhaps work a little more on the ending. It is a popular trick to run the film slow and give a sudden end twist when audience was just about to "Is that all there is?" This film's end twist is rather subtle and it loses its impact due to a little naive direction.Sienna Miller was a wise choice for this. Those who accidentally bought the tickets without knowing what kind of a film they were about to watch, won't be 100% disappointed because looking at Sienna Miller is always a feast for sore eyes. She pulls off everything exactly like she Buscemi told her to, I am sure. She never came so much in focus before. I will eagerly wait to see more of her in days to come.In the end, bottom line is the same as always. It's your mind, it's your head. Either you will appreciate Buscemi's effort, or you won't. I did. He did what he could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve Buscemi is known for is comical and sadistic performances as an actor. In Interview not only does he act in it, he directs and co-writes it. The movie is about a journalist(Buscemi) who is sent to interview a young and famous actress(Miller), they end up asking intimate questions about each others personal life's in (millers) house. Soon (Miller) confesses her secret in exchange for (Buscemi's). when their both done telling their secrets to one another, (Buscemi) leaves but not (miller) delivers a surprising revelation to (Buscemi).The performances are very good from (Buscemi) and (Miller). Buscemi is an experienced actor and it shows with this performance, he has been a consistent actor over the years and he doesn't let up in this one. Miller is a young actress, she shows talent with this performance, by the end you'll believe that she is the character she plays, in real life. This movie reminds me of "Hard Candy" because of the sexual tension that goes on through the movie, and the one on one conversations.Now for the not so good part. How is it that millers character becomes so compassionate for Buscemi's character and even takes him to her home after she was being mean and self centered before the accident. Also how does Buscemi's character know how to act? Hes a journalist. other than that i think the movies was very good and after seen it again i liked it more because i understood things that i dint the first time through. I felt that the running time was good at eighty something minutes because if it was longer it would of started to get annoying. I enjoyed this movie, and i hope Buscemi keeps directing movies because they are fun to watch.</fullReview>

Steve Buscemi adapted and directed this remake of slain European filmmaker Theodor Holman's absorbing yet constrained character study about a once hotshot political journalist (Buscemi) forced into taking a fluff piece assigned by his editor on a superficial actress best known for her lascivious lifestyle (Miller, in another strong performance, proving she's more than a pretty face) than for her questionable work. While there is a generous amount of tete-a-tete between the two unlikely protagonists, the trappings of a 2-person play hinders the exercise in ego, fame, celebrity and ethics. While Buscemi continues to prove his versatility both as an actor and as a filmmaker ? given the borders of the piece ? it is Miller who shrewdly skewers her own image.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Poignant, Darkly Emotional Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I found intriguing about the evolution of the story in Interview was how it opened on two stereotypes. The two exclusive characters in the film are Sienna Miller's pop culture sex icon known for her roles in Z-grade slasher films and an earthy, intelligent yet down-on-his-luck reporter, played with great flexibility by Steve Buscemi, who's time is above being spent on her sort of movies and culture, with personal problems and a back-stabbing agent. We think we know exactly what these two people are like and who will be the one to drive our sympathy. Miller surprises me with her anxious, cardinal, and drastically emotional depiction of her character. I had only seen her in Layer Cake before seeing her in this, wherein she was a decorative T&amp;A role.The movie perceives a different side of the image society brands on these two types of people and communicates an understanding far deeper than anyone picking up a tabloid with Miller's face on it or reading an interview by Buscemi would ever go. We wave off our celebrities and providers of information with fleeting judgments that we cynically and obstinately cling to, and Interview knows it, which makes it all the more powerful and beautiful and fascinating to see these two people in the privacy of an NYC studio apartment hacking away at each other's brains and hearts in very ambiguous ways that are underhanded and dishonestly motivated at the same time they're yearning to pour their oft-misunderstood hearts out to someone.Any semblance of visual style in Buscemi's directing is quite deadpan, yet it may be intentional to lend focus on the personal nature of the film. It's not so memorable as I make it sound, but it's a good, smart, engaging little film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>buscemi shows his skills as a director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great film that is mainly based on dialogue and on the skillful performance of its actors. Steve Buscemi proves that he is not only an edgy actor but that he is capable of staging a movie in a very limited space. 70% of the film plays in a loft. Although it is limited in location and based on two actors Buscemi manages to keep the tension on a very high level. The film is such an interesting character study that the occasional repetitiveness of the "should I stay or should I go" game is overshadowed by the gripping power game between a "has been" political journalist and a trash-movie actress. And the surprising end rounds up the stimulating cinema experience. Go for more, Steve Buscemi</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Edelstein, CBS Sunday Morning, highly recommended this film this morning, August 12. Although he is in awe of Buscemi, as am I, it was his comments about Sienna Miller that made me want to see this film. I am always interested in a director/writer/star's movie, and have no idea how one person can do it all. However we are talking about Buscemi here. His vision was seen by Miller and the two of them take us for a wonderful journey through a window in their lives. Snapshots of both past, current,and perceived future dramas. Miller is perfectly cast as a very popular soap/B movie actress, and Buscemi is loathed to have to interview her, as he is a Washington correspondent. He has done no prep work for the interview boring Miller who ends up leaving. Circumstance takes them to her apartment where they delve into "it"; each others lives etc. This is where the movie is developed and is great. From start to finish you will not be disappointed in the entire film. My prediction is that Buscemi and Miller will be in the running for Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I will have to justify myself, why did I watch it to the end if it was just an 1 (awful)? Because I expected more from Mr Buschemi. Unlike the rest of the world, I never expected more than wallpaper from Ms Miller and she delivered a person, suitable to her character's TV soap opera range acting abilities (but very sprightly too!). The story as a concept could maybe possibly have worked in a different medium and/or direction and/or universe. But the film was dire. If you start watching it and after less than ten minutes you think you know what is going to happen just walk away. Or plain walk away before it even starts. Go take a stroll. Eat a hot-dog in the park. Stroke a rabid dog. Anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the film, but was very disappointed with the ending.I read the credits and realized that this film was dedicated to Theo Van Gogh who was murdered in 2004. The Original film was made in 2003,before Van Gogh was killed. In the movie there is a scene in the restaurant where she gives an autograph to someone and verbally states "To Theo." I also realized that at the end of the film a woman comes out of a limousine and greets Pierre. I noted that her name was Katja and that she was in the movie in 2003. Credit was given to some of the people who were in the 2003 film.My friends and I were trying to figure out why there wasn't a big to do about the film being dedicated to Theo Van Gogh. I had read on line that his son had received some threats. Maybe they wanted it to be a subtle salute to him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Interview" is Steve Buscemi's remake of a film by Theo van Gogh {great nephew of Vinnie ("One-Ear") van Gogh -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Van_Gogh -- before he was assassinated for profaning someone else's Sacred Cow. (profanities, of every sort, were the younger van Gogh's stock-in-trade.) this film is about a middle-aged journalist whose career is on a downward trajectory, whose personal life is in shambles, and who has been assigned to interview a beautiful young actress whose own personal life seems akin to, say, Lindsay Lohan's.the journalist is bitter that he has been assigned to do a fluff piece about a spoiled celebrity brat, instead of being sent to Washington to cover an unfolding scandal at the White House. the actress is an hour late to the trendy restaurant where they meet, because she couldn't seem to pull her lips from those of her (female) co-star in a "Sex In the City" inspired TV serial. she is annoyed from the outset by the journalist's not having bothered to read the little backgrounder her PR people always provide to interviewers.he starts out by asking her how she got the name "Katya". while she is explaining that though it is a Russian name, her mother is actually from the Netherlands (like the van Goghs), he interjects with helpful remarks like, "oh yeah, prostitution is legal in Amsterdam".she finds him so off-putting that she soon cuts off the interview, and leaves the restaurant, though a couple had already happily given up their table because it was *her* "favorite table". however, because of the kind of coincidence that only happens in movies, minutes later she invites him up to her fabulous downtown Manhattan loft.there they set about to continue the interview, with each trying to maintain the upper hand -- him, as the war-weary international correspondent who hasn't the slightest interest in her sexually; her, with the "oh, are you gay? ..... then i want you to tongue-kiss me right now!" routine.they are constantly interrupted by phone calls from her beau, to whom she fabricates new reasons with every call for her not being able to talk at that moment, and her female co-star, with whom she gabs at great length, while lying on her bed with her legs spread apart and pointed at the ceiling, or dancing about her bedroom after the manner of Isadora Duncan -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isadora_Duncan.when not on the phone with her girlfriend, the actress jokingly says things like, "i'm a crack whore". the journalist's gallant response goes something like: no, no, no -- i've been with whores all over the world, and you're no *crack* whore.after consuming a great deal of booze, and other mood-altering substances, they expose their scars (physical and emotional). for example, while the two of them are dancing romantically, she lets it be known that her famous acting teacher made a pass at her during a private lesson.eventually the journalist hears himself loudly denounced as "sleazy", "sick", "disgusting", "weird", a "son-of-a-bitch" (as in, "i want to *kill* you ... you son-of-a-bitch"), and, of course, "unprofessional". he apologizes for his being "unprofessional".i won't give away the ending, but let's just say that times have changed since "My Fair Lady" first came out.</fullReview>
