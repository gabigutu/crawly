		<shortDescription>Low budget, creepy and unique - legendary for a reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This landmark 1968 horror-shocker is a great example of what can be done with a limited budget, a simple idea, and some dedicated and talented participants. Very nicely shot, mostly well acted, NOTLD grabs your attention from the very beginning to the very end - and what a classic end it is.The story begins with Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother visiting the grave of a friend of their mother, and takes off almost immediately, as they are attacked by a horde of cannibalistic zombies. Narrowly escaping, but losing her emotional balance in the process, Barbara escapes to a house a bit farther down the road where she meets Ben (Duane Jones), the hero of the film. They discover a family with a sick little girl and a young couple in the basement of the house and they all get to work barricading themselves in and preparing weapons and other defenses. The rest of the story concerns the group dynamics between these survivors as the dead close in on their refuge, the story of what is going on in the rest of the USA - revealed through TV reportage and radio broadcasts, and sheer survival. The human side of this film is an interesting and accurate character study concerning what happens to people whose very lives are threatened.The horror of this film is, unlike a lot of its recent descendants, less a matter of blood and gore than a matter of the real active horror of realistically depicted scenes of murder, death and cannibalism. Though the black and white footage involving blood and gore is certainly effective, there may not be quite enough of it for today's average horror fan. The photographic techniques of this film are innovative and powerful - showing just enough of the sheer hideousness of the film's basic concepts to disturb viewers, but not enough to allow them to detach from the film's protagonists.I strongly recommend this film to anybody interested in the art of film making, and to those who enjoy the horror genre, though it is hard to imagine any serious horror fan who hasn't already seen this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romero is sublime. His ability to take a small budget and turn it into a stratosphericly giant film is unparalleled. This is one of the best apocalypse films ever (along with the rest of the trilogy). The zombies represent a slow moving enemy. It is easy to escape them. You have only to fear your own mistakes. On these the zombies will capitalize. One of the best aspects of this film is the lead character. Romero has always presented intelligent non-stereotypical black characters in his films. This film was made in 1968 while civil rights tensions were high, and the most "in control" character in the whole movie is a black man. If you can get past a couple of cheesy supporting performances, this is one of the best horror films ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic bit of low budget horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wave of mass murder sweeps across America as the recently dead return to life to kill and feast on their victims. A group of people board themselves up in an abandoned house to try and hold out against a small army of the undead. This is the classic low-budget horror film that is the model for recent hits such as the Evil Dead and The Blair Witch Project. George Romero stages a national disaster but reduces it to a single house for greater effect. The story focuses on the weaknesses of each of the characters in the house - their cowardice, their greedy, their stupidity etc. This makes the drama inside the house almost as palatable as the danger from outside and makes the characters more believable and important.The undead are not huge works of special effects, nor are they anything other than lumbering beasts. But the threat they pose is well demonstrated - the film makes them feel unstoppable and relentless and makes their lingering presence more menacing and less comical than it could have been. The use of an unknown cast also makes it more realistic as none of them have any baggage. Duane Jones is the standout actor as Ben - who is not without flaws himself.The downbeat, realistic atmosphere to the film gives it a greater sense of tension and continues right through to the very depressing conclusion. An excellent flagship for low budget horrors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that redefined the horror genre overnight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining, The Exorcist and The Omen are all films that owe some of their stylistic approach to this film. This is the film that re-wrote the rules of the horror genre as it went along, whilst acting as both social critique and fond homage to 'The Birds' as well.Romero set in place a steady breakdown of all our assumptions of the horror film, which he then utilised to full effect through the rest of this film and the two superb sequels that followed.This is perhaps one of the greatest low budget cult movies ever made, certainly one of the most influential, and in its brutally harrowing documentary style conclusion a harsh statement on American racial attitudes. A statement which is as relevant today as it was over thirty years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Horror Classic that changed all Horror films that followed it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead is a true classic and without a doubt Romero's best and most influential film.Of course, being simply influential alone would not simply allow this movie to get a full-fledged star rating if it didn't pull through with it some quality at all, which it does in spades. In Night of the Living Dead, there is good pacing, surprisingly good acting from a list of no-name actors, and the most important part that sticks with the film to this day, the sense of dread in the film. In this movie to this day you get that feeling of hopelessness, people get attacked for no reason and nothing can save them. Whether it's family-togetherness, love between a couple, or even the law-enforcers at the end, this was all tapping into the uncertainty level people were having at the time and still today it has meaning. Topping this off with Romero's (at the time) large use of gore adds to the overall uneasiness of the film. Finally at the film's current times, there is a great subtle final nail in the coffin attack with the sad fate of the character Ben. Being the only sole voice of reason is shot, which, at the time of filming brought harsh realities of such other African-American leaders who were brought down unfairly such as Malcolm X or Martin Luther King, even if this wasn't the original idea Romero had.Overall, no matter how cheesy some of this movie make look to modern eyes, Night of the Living Dead is a classic for offering horror without a shred of hope, forever influencing every horror movie in it's wake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not only one of the greatest horror / independent films ever made, but one of the greatest films ever made period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I often wonder if George Romero was knowing that this was going to become one of the most influential films ever made when he sat down to write the screenplay. Few other b-movies have had such great cinematography, direction, dialog, and acting. You can say what you want about "Dawn of the Dead", but this shall always be the foremost zombie horror film in my mind.The plot involves the radiation from a fallen satellite is causing the recently deceased to rise from their graves to feast off the living's flesh. They can only be killed by a blow to the head. A group of people, in need of protection from the hordes, barricade themselves in an abandoned farmhouse. They are pretty much lead by as young black man named Ben, a resourceful person trying to protect himself and the others.Surprising as it may sound, the human drama involved is just as suspenseful as the zombies outside the house. It shows how human beings panic in the time of terror, and will stop at nothing to protect themselves and none others. Definitely one of the top ten horror films ever made. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low Budget Horror That Redefined The Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead, directed by Geoage A. Romero, is a horror masterpiece and the first of three of his "Dead" movies. This low budget horror has changed the way movies are made. This didn't need an "A" grade cast and a huge budget to become one the world's greatest and most influential horror movies.This is the simple story of seven strangers who board themselves up in a farmhouse from the ravenous hoards of flesh eating zombies that are rising. But peace doesn't last for long as the tension rises, chaos and tragedy breaks out.This movie today is still shocking. There isn't a lot of gore but the scenes with gore a shocking and disturbing, even though they are in black and white. This is still regarded as one of the best horror movies in the world. 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Yeah, they're dead, they're all messed up"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think George Romaro ever had in his mind the masterpiece he created when he made Night of the Living Dead, one of the greatest horror movies of all time and gave birth to the zombie genre. The monster that is the zombie has been a little experimented with before with the film "White Zombie" but never like the dark depths that George took it too. To think that this film almost never would have made it to the public since George threw it in the trunk of his car thinking nobody would ever buy it, low and behold not only did the film sell but has one of greatest group of fans to follow it. Such a degrading film for it's time with naked, scarred up, chewed up zombies eating human flesh, there was no film like Night of the Living Dead. The metaphor that we are guaranteed 2 things in life: birth and death, the slow inevitable death that is walking towards you as if you are looking at your future self is just horrific. George was way ahead of his time and that's why Night of the Living Dead still gives me nightmares to this day.Barbra and Johnny drive to rural Pennsylvania to visit their father's grave. When Barbra is afraid Johnny teasingly frightens; whereupon they are attacked by a zombie. Johnny tries to rescue his sister, but is then presumably killed when the man shoves him head first onto a tombstone. Barbra flees, with the killer in pursuit; eventually she ran off to an empty farmhouse where she discovers the half-eaten corpse. Running out of the house, she notices a man named Ben arrives in a pickup truck, drags Barbra back into the house, and barricades the doors and windows. Meanwhile, hiding in the cellar are a married couple, Harry and Helen Cooper, their daughter Karen, and teenage couple Tom and Judy. Harry asks everyone to hide in the cellar, but Ben deems it a "deathtrap" and remains upstairs. As they fight through the night for their lives, they try to escape to a safe house but the zombies outside have pulled up the table with the salt and pepper and are a bit hungry for some human flesh.George casted a black lead, which was so unheard of at the time, I'm sure he never looked at the color but what a groundbreaking moment. He's the smart man who knows how to fight and even hit a white woman, what risks George took with this movie. The film is by no means perfectly made, but you have to understand that this was a low budget film made by a group of friends, however, when you think compared to today's low budget films that have no story with it, it's all about the gore, Night of the Living Dead broke that mold. I have a little tradition every year on Halloween, I have to watch this movie because it is one of the best horror movies of all time. How could you not still get the chills when little Karen turns into a zombie and goes after her mother with a shovel, her mother screaming "Baby!" and falls crying and screaming as her daughter just continues stabbing her to death, God, what a horrific scene! Taking a chance with a depressing ending, not to spoil too much as I feel that I already have but I envy anyone who sees this film for the first time because I like to see their reactions to this movie. A groundbreaking film, a horrifying story and a cast and crew that gave all effort, Night of the Living Dead is a terrific scary movie not to be missed.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important low budget horror masterclass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A car drives up a road, towards a graveyard. Cut to the graveyard, a woman and her brother have brought flowers to their mother's grave. Soon the brother starts taunting his sister, saying: "They're coming to get you, Barbara". Barbara laughs it off and after her brother runs away, she heads to the seemingly innocent man visiting a family member's grave to apologize, and out of nowhere he grabs her. Her brother attempts to fight him off but ends up being killed in the process and Barbara escapes to a farmhouse nearby.That's how this incredible, highly influential masterclass in horror film making begins. What is still so fascinating about this film is that it retains its ability to genuinely, truly scare the crap out of you. It's not just a 'jump moment' film, George A. Romero sets the mood perfectly with a sublime script and truly effective use of music. As far as modern low budget horror films go, this is nearly the best of them, surpassed only by Sam Raimi's masterpiece "The Evil Dead"."Night of the Living Dead" isn't scary because of the zombies (although the flesh eating sequences are still among the greatest and most horrifying horror scenes ever made). The film is still effective because it all has a feeling of impending doom. It seems hopeless, disturbing, terrifying because of the claustrophobic mood it sets. It's not the zombies that scare us, it's the idea of being trapped in a small area with nowhere to go and death itself standing right outside your door. What a brilliant film!8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note: There will be a full review of "Night of the Living Dead" coming soon, but until then, here's this, which will probably be deleted after I write a full-lenghth one.Night of the Living DeadClassic "zombie movie that started them all" about a young lady visiting a graveyard who seeks refuge in a nearby home with an assortment of various other passersby who find strange creatures attacking them from outside the house. Extremely low-budget and occasionally laughable in terms of flaws, George A. Romero's classic movie is riveting, horrifying and, quite simply, a classic of the genre. The primary inspiration for M. Night Shyamalan's hit film "Signs" (2002). An amazing horror film that proves you don't always need huge budgets and special effects to scare an audience.*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror at its absolute best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" is proof that you do not need a multi-million dollar movie budget to make an unbelievable movie. This film still frightens many people (including myself) thirty some years after it was made. It is always amazing to me each time I watch this film how it still manages to appeal to my most basic fear instincts. There have been countless movies since this one that have been made for a hundred times as much money that I have seen and forgotten, but I am sure this one will always stay with me.This film does such a fine job of shocking and frightening that it is easy to forget how George Romero made it remarkable in other ways. It was quite a coup in the late 60's to give a black character the lead in a movie and Romero quite cleverly satirizes race relations throughout the film. I think he is making a point of asking if human beings are really any better than the flesh-eating zombies. This is most potent at the end, when the black character is assumed to be a zombie and is shot and killed. Would they have made that mistake with a white person? Maybe. Maybe not. This is also a point that was severely botched in the 1990 remake, when they actually had Tony Todd's character become a zombie. In a way, that misses the entire point of the original.Regardless, if you are a horror movie aficionado or someone interested in sociology, this movie must be seen. One thing is for sure. Love it or hate it, it will always stay with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed But Still Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was flicking through the TV guide which told me the remake of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was being shown on the Sci-Fi channel so I sat down to watch it. I did like the ground breaking original so eagerly awaited seeing the 1990 version which started with a car driving down a lonely country road just like the original , it was also filmed in black and white just like the original and it was at this point I realised I wasn`t watching the remake- I was watching the original . This wasn`t the first time a certain TV guide got films mixed up because a couple of weeks ago it confused the 1967 war film THE YOUNG WARRIORS with the 1983 vigilante thriller about high school students and their poodle wiping out scumSlightly disappointed I wouldn`t be seeing the colour remake I still sat down to watch the original because as I said I remember liking it from years ago . I wasn`t disappointed with what I saw but the flaws do jump out at you and bite you in the neck . The acting isn`t very good with Judith O Dea over acting with the rest of the cast under acting . This a great pity because if we had the same type of performances seen in something like 12 ANGRY MEN this movie would have been a masterpiece . I also couldn`t help noticing a few editing errors where it`s suddenly pitch black outside then it flicks to broad daylight then it`s pitch black again , and I don`t think I`ve seen many films recently with such an intrusive soundtrack . I can however forgive these flaws because NOTLD is guerilla film making at its very best , it`s got a simple strength and that is it has a very good script where both imagination and drama grabs you and doesn`t let go - A crashed satillite returning from Venus reanimates the dead ? Utter nonsense of course but the scenario is so well written you can`t help being swept along with the terror as the protagonists watch the world disintergrate on TV . Compare this movie to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and tell me what one is more enjoyable ? No contest is it ?I liked this movie many years ago and still like it today . Such a pity the production values didn`t come up to the standards of the script , but that said it`s still more compelling than the stuff coming out of Hollywood today</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny travel by car from Pittsburgh to the countryside to visit the gravestone of their father in the cemetery. Out of the blue, they are attacked by a strange man and Johnny is murdered. Barbra runs and releases the brake of Johnny's car since the keys are in his pocket, and flees to an isolated farmhouse, where she locks herself inside. Barbra is in shock and soon she finds a man, Ben (Duane Jones), who is also escaping from the inhuman creatures and he reinforces the doors, windows and openings in the house. He also finds a shotgun and a radio and they learn that the radiation from a satellite that was returning from Venus has somehow reactivated the brain of the dead.Then they find five humans hidden in the basement: Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman) and their daughter Karen (Kyra Schon) that is sick; and Tom (Keith Wayne) and his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley). Harry has an argument with Ben, since he believes that the basement is the safest place for them and Harry does not agree. Along the night, the tension between the two men grows while the house is under siege by an increasing legion of living dead. "Night of the Living Dead" is my favorite horror movie and I do not know how many times I have watched this movie (the last times had been on 31 March 2001 and 15 January 2002). I was very young the first time I saw it and I was impressed with this movie. Today I have just seen a colorized version and despite my preference for the original black and white classic, I have nothing to say against this latest version."Night of the Living Dead" is the debut of the cult director George A. Romero and it is amazing the movie he made with an extremely low-budget. The story is scary and tension increases along 96 minutes running time. The conclusion is ironic and a sort of justice against the decision of Ben, who refused to stay in the basement and caused the death of the whole group. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "A Noite dos Mortos-Vivos" ("The Night of the Living Dead")Note: On 10 August 2014, I saw this film again.On 13 September 2015, I saw this film again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original and the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie succeeds in many respects, that it is the prototype of modern zombies, and many movie situations. It's also good as to where the emphasis is (story and characters) and that it has substance.The emphasis isn't so much on the zombies but on the characters and how they deal with the zombies; the debate as to the best defence, the escape plan. The characters (aside from Harry Cooper) are sympathetic, Ben is just trying to keep the zombies out and figure an escape, Barbara is shocked and delirious, Tom and Judy want to stay together, Helen trusts the judgement of others and cares for Karen, and Karen is unwell. The movie is not boring either, it doesn't drag out, and long.Not only is it the beginning of the zombie genre as we know it, it's also appears to be the beginning of the concept of being besieged that make up many horrors and sci-fis. While there is a debate in the farmhouse, the zombies know what they want and they all want it. And while they aren't a team they do not fight amongst themselves. In modern movies where the protagonists are besieged, the enemy is intelligent, physically strong, fearless, stealthy (in some cases), unusual, works together, often has superior numbers, and has often never been fought before. A number of these factors are possessed by the zombies in this movie. The besieged protagonists in many movies have to deal with limited resources, frightened members, injured members, and an enemy from within. This concept has been passed on to numerous movies since (such as the other "Dead" movies, Aliens, Ghosts from Mars, and Dog Soldiers as well as many others), but none have really given the entertainment and substance that this has, with Aliens being the only exception. I cannot speak of the succeeding "Dead" movies as I have not yet seen them.This film also has substance (however even though most horror movies are predictable, plot less, and clichéd that is what quite often makes them my escapism; but this one is still superior); there is a plot, the story flows well, has structure, and there are no inconsistencies. It's also backed up with a social commentary, I am not saying a good movie needs to send a message, but it adds to the goodness of this film. It's a social comment on the late Vietnam War era; the establishment don't know what to do and humans are being made into killers (quite literally). And even if you disregard the social-commentary, it still makes good entertainment.The movie achieves everything above, without the use of stunts and over the top special effects.All in all, the result is a good movie, good characters, structure, and substance. One of the best horror movies ever. It has earned itself a 9/10. Romero and Russo do many proud, judging from the votes.</fullReview>

NOLD is the "ONLY" movie to succeed in scaring me still to this day, it has what I consider to be all the elements of true horror. The Antagonists are us only dead, they are all different, some rotting,some all busted up, some limbless, I could go on &amp; on. They "ALL have these things in common, They are dead, You can't reason with them, they can only be put down by destroying the brain so even if you were all armed to the teeth no matter how slow they are, if you made a break for it at night when you can't see more than 10 feet in front of you, you will eventually be caught &amp; be eaten alive by corpses unless you turn your gun on yourself if possible. The worst thing to me would be just waiting for the inevitable along with the tension of the other individuals arguing amongst each other to make matters worse. Give me the fast zombies, at least it would be over quick. With fast zombies you wouldn't have time to get that scared, they'd be on you like that, with the slow ones, the anticipation of them finally trying to break in would be too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not sure how to go about reviewing this movie since it is my favorite of all time. I watch it every Halloween, without fail, as well as several other of this type. We are talking about a 30 year span here and I still love it!As a MAJOR horror movie buff since the age of about 10, this is the ONLY one that ever terrified me. I saw it in an extremely cut version, as a Saturday afternoon TV movie, and it still left a big impression on me. Most of the "gory" scenes were cut but it still scared the heck out of me. Everything about this movie works: from the claustrophobic atmosphere to the black-and-white cinematography ... and everything in between. Director George Romero is, and always will be, the king of the flesh-eating zombie movies.This is the gold star of low budget horror flix. If you have not seen it, and are a horror movie fan, this is a MUST see. Do NOT hesitate, see it now, but remember this movie was made in 1968 and much of the shock value has faded as it has been done in 1000 movies since then. Keep in mind that THIS is the film the pushed the "gore" envelope and was the first modern zombie horror film and you can not help but be impressed. Once you see it you will also be compelled to see Romero's equally good sequels ... "Dawn of the Dead" (1978), "Day of the Dead" (1985) and "Land of the Dead" (2005). The other 2 ("Diary.." and "Survival ..") are not up to par, but still better than most of the other movies of this genre, no matter what the "critics" on IMDb say.In closing, I cannot recommend this film enough for the serious, and open minded, horror movie fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one that started it all....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it is not needed to be said, for any zombie fan, it is anything but obligatory to view this movie because director George A. Romero is the guy who started the whole trend of making zombie films. For the year 1968, this movie had a lot going for it. As for those who may not find that older films have much appeal, this one does. Its story not only carries its own origin but also contains a well thought out written tone and a very addicting plot. Not to mention this film even has gore. Yes, gore.The premise is very basic, a group of random individuals happen to meet up at house to hide from flesh-eating entranced humans, otherwise known as zombies. Bruce Capristo, the head of the makeup department did a great job at making the zombies look like normal people. Yet, the audience and characters alike can tell the difference between themselves and the zombies. Weird as it is, this will be the only movie Capristo would take credit for. After this he did not move on into other movies. It's also surprising to me how after this movie became a hit, that none of the actors really moved forward with their careers either. Because of this, the actors in this movie remain "no-name" actors.Which brings me to my next point: characters. In most cases, when a movie has such a basic premise, character development ends up taking a back seat. Why? Because most audiences are more interested in seeing the plot device in action more than they are in the main characters. But what Romero and his screen writing partner, John A. Russo did was balance the screen time between the scenes of confronting zombies and the lead roles discussing how they're going to escape. This keeps the audience from becoming too bored with too much dialog or too much zombies. This holds true because too much of one thing isn't good in general. There needs to be a balance.What remains the most potent about this picture is just how overwhelming this situation is and how quickly hope can be lost if this were to be a reality. Oddly enough, one would think that because zombies move so slowly, it would be easy to evade them. Better think twice about that claim. Even for these undead beings, they are relentless. To think if you had twenty to fifty of them around you,...sounds like its time to curl up in fetal position and go to that happy place every person has in their head. This is what Romero does with his audience, by creating a hopeless tone. It will seem like any direction taken towards escaping won't work and it's done very effectively.But while this is effective, another great aspect to this tone is by instilling a small glimmer of hope every time an opportunity opens. This is what makes this story so gripping. I would feel right to let go and give up, but it wouldn't because you know there has to be a way to win. Also, the musical composer, William Loose did a fair job at the score. It definitely sounds like music and it does contain a reoccurring theme for the film and for the zombies themselves, so it does work.The last area that surprised me was just how gory this late 1960's black and white film was. I mean, how did audiences back then take this film? People must have flipped out so much that it caused mass hysteria. It's obvious in a lot of scenes that the people parts used in the zombie scenes were animal parts but wow. I'm surprised Romero was let back into the film business after that. I actually wasn't expecting much at all but I'm pretty sure Romero had a lot more to put on the screen. I liked how things went with Romero's first film piece. It was evenly paced and kept me wondering what would happen next. How many films are like that nowadays?Film legend George A. Romero has brought a treasure to generations to come, even if many would call it at the time malignant. When in fact, zombies are exactly that in our culture today. Night of the Living Dead is well constructed and boasts gross imagery even for 1968.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone seems to thinks Ben is the hero of Night of the Living Dead but in reality he's just as short tempered and petty as Harry Cooper and more importantly, he was wrong about the basement being a deathtrap.He rants and raves like a tyrant, "I'm in charge up here! Everything we have up here stays up here!" etcetera.In the scene where he's locked outside and the cowardly Mr. Cooper is too frightened to open the door, he shoots Cooper in a display of petty anger.Ben is no hero. In the end he only seems to be able to save himself in Harry Cooper's basement deathtrap.Everybody is fooled by his presentation. He's good looking, black, and articulate, so what? Don't confuse that with righteousness.Watch the movie again with my comments in mind before you click NO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless nightmare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The grandfather of low budget horror films, George Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead started a whole new genre of horror.Folks become trapped in an isolated country house by an army of walking, flesh-eating corpses.Night of the Living Dead is simply one of the most effectively terrifying and completely captivating horror films ever made! It stands as a great example of imagination over budget and has influenced scores of horror pictures. Romero gives us a very dark atmospheric kind of wonder that spans the entire film from its bleak opening frames to its eerie closing montage. The story is full of claustrophobic suspense and unrelenting chills! Even now, several decades after its making, this film is still as frightening as ever. In fact few horror films ever reach the terribly scary heights of Night of the Living Dead.The films cast is great. Duane Jones is strong as the leading man. Judith O'Dea is touching and sympathetic as a traumatized young woman. Russ Steiner is memorable as O'Dea's joking brother, who delivers the films most haunting line "they're coming to get you Barbara...". The good supporting cast includes Karl Hardman as a hateful refugee, Marilyn Eastman as his wife, and Keith Wayne as a young man seeking escape.Through and through, Night of the Living Dead is one of the greatest genre films ever made! It's solid proof that true horror never loses its effectiveness.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Iconic Zombie Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is "the" film that changed the way zombie films were created - more horrifying than ever before. Almost all zombie films that came after this one were patterned after this movie. "Night of the Living Dead" is the most iconic zombie film ever made.The movie is outstanding for it's genre and film type. I feel the black &amp; white really enhanced this flick - it gave it an eerier effect than a colour film ever could. The B&amp;W gave the zombies an almost ghostly and most definitely a ghastly appearance. I think if this movie would have been in colour then it would not have the strong appeal and overall creepiness to it that the B&amp;W gave.This is a wonderful late at night film that I would highly recommend to fans of the horror genre. If you have not seen this film yet then you should find a copy to rent, buy or borrow because you will not be disappointed.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Dead: The Definitive Zombie Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero is one of the most well-known and profitable directors of the genre, thanks to half of his films being the "Dead" movies. Other movies in his career, such as "Martin" and "The Crazies," are notable, but it's Romero's first film, "Night of the Living Dead," that gets all the attention. The 1968 zombie classic made his career, and influenced many follow-ups.Johnny and Barbara are brother and sister. They travel to a cemetery to visit their mother before her grave is moved. Barbara does not take too kindly to the cemetery, it disturbs her. Johnny playfully jokes with her, saying "They're coming to get you, Barbara." And once a slow-moving man approaches them and attacks, the nightmare begins. Johnny is killed and Barbara flees for her life. She finds shelter in a tiny, deserted farmhouse. Soon, she realizes that she's not the only one hiding out. Five other people have isolated themselves in, and the struggle to survive continues. Boarding up the house is only a temporary delay before more flesh-eating ghouls attack. Should they stay upstairs or hide out in the cellar? In a time when hilariously awful B-grade horror films were being produced, "Night of the Living Dead" was a shocking surprise, and still is. The MPAA rating system had a fit with Romero's film, and when it was released to the public, it scared the living daylights out of everyone, including little kids who thought they were seeing a normal Saturday matinée(Roger Ebert's rave review for the film also examines the reactions of the audience).The film definitely has an advantage in being shot in black and white. It gives off the feeling of an amateur documentary, that this could really happen.Next to the mood and atmosphere, why does "Night of the Living Dead" work so horrifyingly well? Well, in all of Romero's movies, not just the "Dead" films, there is social commentary littered throughout. And you'll definitely find that this film has a message or two. Some saw the film as an insight into racism. It was the first film to have an African-American hero, after all. But Romero chose Duane Jones for Ben simply because he fit the part. Also, many fans examine the film as an example of the Communist movement, that you couldn't trust anyone or anything. The zombies could be anybody. They could be your neighbor, your daughter, your husband or wife. It is truly a scary concept.The film also has undeniable claustrophobia. We are uncomfortably sealed in with the survivors, and once the zombies get in, we're not getting out. Not even the cellar can help our protagonists.In 1968 and today's generation, "Night of the Living Dead" rang and still does ring true to every viewer. Is this what our world will come to be? Will we be unable to trust the ones we know? Will they become emotionless, mindless murderers, and will our society crumble? Romero's film is not just a 60's horror film, and it never ages. Despite the difference in years, the dead are very much alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romero Awakens The Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very rare nowadays in Hollywood that $112,000 will cover anything more than the cost of catering on most movies. And yet that was all it took for George Romero and a number of friends of his in Pittsburgh to make what is without a doubt one of the most significant horror films of all times, the 1968 shocker NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Detested by a lot of critics in its day for several scenes of unsettling gruesomeness (though Herschell Gordon Lewis' gore films earlier in the 1960s beat him to the punch for true stomach-turning horror), the film is now understandably highly prized of its relentless, logical approach, and for being so utterly uncompromising.Not much more needs to be said about the plot: it merely involves seven people who have barricaded themselves inside a rural Pennsylvania home after having been attacked by flesh-eating ghouls who have returned to life from the dead as the result of an exploded Venus probe bringing back a dangerous and unknown form of radiation. What Romero and his co-scenarist John Russo (who took partial inspiration for this film from Richard Matheson's classic 1954 end-of-the-world vampire novel "I Am Legend") show, however, is the strain built up by the way the characters, especially the ones portrayed by Duane Jones and the film's co-producer Karl Hardman, react to the horror that engulfs them...whether to stay on the ground floor, or to hide in the cellar, and how best to escape even as more and more of the undead surround the place. As it turns out, of course, there is no real way out, and there is no actual good end to the whole horrible situation.Romero, who would continue his travail through the world of the undead through several sequels over the ensuing four decades, shot this film in black-and-white largely on location just outside of Pittsburgh over several weekends in the second half of 1967. NIGHT has, in many ways, the feel of a 1950s "invasion" film (think INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS), but its setting of an isolated house under siege clearly has its roots in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 classic THE BIRDS; and the scenes of the ghouls munching on human flesh, though brief in nature, were then, and in many ways still are, shockingly contemporary. The cast of primarily amateur actors does well at being totally naturalistic, and the low budget look of the film gives it a documentary feel that hadn't been seen in horror films before, but which would be revisited in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.Even after four decades of parody, imitation, and sequels, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is still not for those with weak constitutions, and for those who have seen far more graphic shockers, it will likely seem painfully old-fashioned. But for true horror connoisseurs, it is up there with the very best, and is an essential film of its kind and its era.</fullReview>

The script and directing is good, so is the editing. One has to wonder how much Romero really contributed to this film, as all the movies he made after this were crap. Probably John Russo had more to do with it than Romero. Acting is decent enough, typical for the early 60s. The whole movie is great, seeing a zombie apocalypse in the America of the 60s really is fun. Special effects are good. A must-see for any zombie fan!

		<shortDescription>A great old indy horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with "Carnival of Souls", this movie stands out as one of the definitive black-and-white horror movies of a bygone drive-in movie era. This movie scared me horribly when I first saw it back in the sixth grade. I had seen other scary movies before, but I think what makes this film so frightening is that there is a somewhat scientific explanation involved and that the horror is occurring to average people. The terror is not due to some supernatural occurrence that we know to be fantasy such as a vampire or some other relic from a 30's or 40's Universal horror film. Also, the drama is playing out in and around a farm house in rural Ohio, not some mythical haunted mansion. This puts you into the dilemma with the players. The fact that such bad acting is in play here just adds to the realism rather than making the film campy.This movie showed something that could have only occurred pre-Watergate. At one point, the people trapped in the farmhouse discover a television and turn it on in search of news of what is going on. Something almost as remarkable to today's audiences as the dead rising from their graves is seen to occur. In Washington, reporters confront a government official about the situation, the government official tells the reporters the truth, and everyone believes what the government has told them. All of this would be truly remarkable in today's environment of mutual mistrust between citizens, government, and the media. Also, although we don't have actual vampires as the villain here, we have a similar dilemma. As the radiation causes the dead to become animated and seek to eat the flesh of the living, each time a victim is bitten, that victim eventually dies only to rise minutes later seeking the flesh of the living themselves, producing a problem that grows geometrically, just as vampires do.Finally, this film has something important to say about race. Unique to 60's films, the group in the farmhouse accepts Ben (Duane Jones), an African-American man, as a leader since he is smart and a quick thinker. This portrayal of an African-American as protagonist and problem solver is also unique to films of forty years ago. The ending is quite powerful, and you have to ask yourself, did race have something to do with the actions of the rescue posse? I don't know if this question was hung out there intentionally by the film's creators for the audience to ponder, but it is a point that is almost impossible to ignore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Dead (1968)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like everyone else reviewing this film, I'm a horror fan. Hopefully, they're all horror fans too. I think I have good taste and know a good horror movie when I see it. Night of the Living Dead is considered one of the greatest and most important horror films of all time. It's impossible to ignore that and the fact that the film's director, George A. Romero, gets a lot of attention because of it. With the current state of the genre, tastes and styles continuing to change so much and so fast, a lot of the attention on Romero is negative. Many young horror fans are going back to see his earlier films and wondering why they are, and he is, so famous. I consider Romero to be a horror director with a very inconsistent record of hits and misses. He's mostly known for his "Dead" series of zombie films, but it's also worth mentioning that he has a lot of military plots in his films. In Night, you don't really see the military, rather you see an army on TV, comprised of gun-carrying U.S. citizens.The 1960's were a decade where a great deal of Hollywood films went into color. While Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 hit Psycho was in black and white, 1961's Breakfast at Tiffany's was in color. And the trend went back and forth again, until into the 1970's, where almost no films at all were released in black and white (except for David Lynch's Eraserhead). For the purpose of mood, most 60's horror films remained in black and white (The Haunting, Repulsion, Village of the Damned, Black Sunday, Spider Baby, The Innocents, Carnival of Souls). About black and white itself, it's often a very boring way to watch films. But it's also quite gritty. And used by certain filmmakers to achieve a realistic tone to their films' subject matter. Especially in the 60's. Most of Night of the Living Dead certainly feels realistic. For its' time, at least. It seems to be a movie about a group of people trapped inside a fairly enclosed space, with tensions mounting, then things reach a boiling point and their shelter starts to feel like a tomb.Night of the Living Dead features zombies and raises the question of where they come from without doing much to answer it. That's because we follow the characters as they enter the farmhouse and they wait for news or for others to come to their rescue. So, realistically, were we in the same position as any one of the characters, we would know only what the TV and radio were telling us. There were zombie films made before Night- White Zombie and Plague of the Zombies, as well as potentially, any film featuring The Mummy. And Frankenstein, as well, is a re-animated corpse. But while those were relegated to being cult films and failed to break through into the American mainstream, Night did in fact make a big impact on American filmgoers. I believe it may have first cracked the drive-ins. And, if there were grindhouse theaters at that time, this probably played quite a few of those. With a film like this, you really have to consider and know its' history before passing judgment on it. Also, when you do pass judgment, you have to make it personally relevant.Night has - and I know I'm not alone in seeing it this way - not aged well. It remains what it was in the 60's and styles in the genre changed so fast, the film's approach as horror was near completely obsolete by the arrival of Wes Craven's shocking and much less restrained debut, The Last House on the Left, a mere 4 years later. Though 1974's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was something of a return to Night's much less overt and in-your-face violence, Hollywood's approach to horror was also becoming more explicit, as early as 1973's The Exorcist, one of the bloodiest and most graphic horror films of its day. But even in the case of Chainsaw, the message was clear- black and white was being permanently retired by cutting edge, amateur film directors getting their start in the horror genre. Which is both a good thing and a bad thing for Night. The film became an instant classic. But it also, I think, failed to keep its' impact into the mid-1970's and the rapidly changing styles.My personal feeling on the film is that it is mostly boring. As its' focus is more on human-created tensions, I admire Romero and the fact that Night's been mostly successful (as the IMDb's rating can attest to) with film fans. But, this film is too realistic to be scary. I find films scarier when they are more like a nightmare, even surreal, but with elements of reality. Depending on the concept, horror films that concentrate more on characterization often lack a true sense of the chaotic and irrational quality of a person's worst nightmare. In a situation like this, where people are upsetting you and challenging everything you say and do, I feel more apt to be angry than scared. However, the film does have a few standout sequences that are an important signature to any good horror movie. One is a death scene involving a gardening spade. Another is a montage of zombies eating the internal organs of their victims. And the last is a scene of one of the main characters, Barbra, having a dissociative fugue while walking through the empty farmhouse (a moment that feels torn right out of Carnival of Souls, which Romero admits was an influence on Night).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie used to be broadcast on TV every year on Halloween when I used to live in Pittsburgh. One year it was even broadcast in "unliving color". (That was how the colorized version was described.) Colorizing the original black and white movie was a huge mistake as the colors wound up looking fake. The ghouls were given green faces and the Molotov cocktails were colored bright orange.There was also another version I remember seeing on TV one year. Someone had done a parody of the movie by splicing together scenes from the movie and dubbing in their own dialog. In their version, the people in the farmhouse were hosting a party but everyone forgot to bring the groceries! So the problem became how to fight off angry and hungry party guests. In this case, just hand them whatever you can grab (wood, nails, etc). In the scene where Ben flips over the table, the dialog was: "The first thing we got to do is get rid of the table! If they don't see a table, they won't expect to eat!"after he flips over the table: "Hey Chlorine! This table has better legs than you do!" "Oh really? Can it dance?", replies Chlorine.The movie then ends with the zombies dancing and saying, "Let's dance!".As far as I know however, I don't think this version has ever been released on VHS or DVD. But the original is a movie you can have fun with. Just mute the sound and make up your own dialog.</fullReview>

But it is muchhhhh better than any slasher i've ever seen. The farmhouse location was great. The fight scenes looked rather lame, but the fact that guns DID SOMETHING made it still more enjoyable.

		<fullReview>I am a zombie aficionado, no doubt about it. And as such, then of course I enjoy this 1968 movie by George A. Romero, because it is a milestone in the zombie genre. "Night of the Living Dead" is essentially the foundation for the zombie genre, and it paved the way for the genre and shaped it into what we have today. And as such, then Romero really established something unique and cemented his own name to be forever associated with the living dead.I am not going to be a fanboy and look past all the flaws and shortcomings to this movie, because they are there, for sure. But still, this is an entertaining movie, and taking into consideration the year in which it was made and released, was quite a bold venture into the cinema.Without delving too deep into the storyline, as I assume that as a horror fan you will already be more than familiar with "Night of the Living Dead" in one of the many variants it has come in. It is about a group of strangers trapped in a small farm house with hordes of the living dead surrounding them, wanting to eat their flesh.The story has been made immortal by George A. Romero, certainly, and it is an entertaining story that is brought to the screen by a rather visionary directing at the time being. And the cast that they had gotten together for the movie were also doing quite good jobs. There were some rather memorable performances throughout the movie.As for the effects, well, take into consideration that this movie is from 1968, so it would seem rather crude by today's standards. But the effects serve their intent and purpose well enough, and helped to flesh out the movie on the screen, no pun intended."Night of the Living Dead" is a movie that you can't be familiar with if you are a zombie aficionado. And even for newcomers to the zombie genre, then "Night of the Living Dead" is a MUST watch to fully embrace the genre and understand its roots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is, the true seminal zombie movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968 America found it's self-mired in the grip of social, political, and racial upheaval. The Vietnam War was exploding and the body count was broadcast every night into the dubious comforts of our households. Generations were clashing, seeing each other as the enemy. Battle lines were being drawn over the color of a person's skin, or the length of their hair. Heavy stuff huh? And your probably saying, "BT! What does this have to do with the movie?" well, you'll see as you read on. During these times, B movies rain supreme. Turning out of Hollywood faster than Japan can turn out Pokemon cards. One of those B movies in small, black and white venture from John Russo, and George Romero, would go on to become one of the most influential, and important horror films of all time. It would become legendary, as a film that not only started an entire sub-genre, but also accurately and without apology, mirrored all the strife that those times had to offer. That film was Night of the Living Dead.The movies plot is simple enough, a young woman named Barbara played by Judith O'Dea, and her brother, Johnnie played by Bill Moseley, visit their fathers grave at a cemetery in the rural backwoods Pennsylvania. The first hint of socio political commentary this film has to offer takes place in the first few minutes. As Barbara's brother mocks her beautiful prayer, scoffing at the notion of "Church of God". For 1968 this was pretty risqué stuff. Within minutes they are attacked by a zombie, which kills her brother. Soon several zombies, eager to consume her warm tasty flesh, pursue Barbara. She takes shelter in an old farmhouse and soon finds our heroine has company. The films hero Ben, played by Duane Jones, arrives on the scene also seeking refuge in the farmhouse. Ben was unlike anything ever seen in Hollywood at that point. He was African American, and standard convention advised against having an African American as your main hero. To compound things he wasn't a suburban African American. Nope, this brother was from the streets and he let the viewers know it.In their first twenty minutes with each other, Barbara is more scared of Ben then she is of the ghoulish army in camp outside the house. Again, Romero perfectly reflected the racial turmoil of the time. Soon five other refugees from the nightmare, including Harry Cooper, played by Karl Hardman, join them who typifies the average white, middle age, and xenophobic businessman of the era. His daughter Karen, played by Kyra Schon, and his wife Helen, played by Marilyn Eastman, who's beginning for the first time in her life to question her husband's judgments and motives. Again the movie speaks of deeper issues, touching on woman's liberation and the classic of all these problems, old money values.Later in the movie we deal with the issue of patricide. When the Cooper's daughter, Karen, who previously had been bitten by a zombie before they got to the farmhouse, dies. And then comes back as one of the walking dead, and kills, and eats, her mother and father. After barricading themselves in the house, cabin fever soon begins to pick up the groove, inflicting more damage than even the zombies can do, culminating in a desperate struggle against not only the cannibalistic hordes outside, but against each other as well.Perhaps the most memorable moment in Night of the Living Dead is the ending. Romero provides a conclusion, so shocking and so unexpected, that the critics of the era were unsure what to make of it. Audience reaction at the time was one of strong disbelief. Another interesting aspect of Romero's zombie methods is that no explanation of the dead rising and eating the living is ever given. In this film it is speculated that a recent space probe returned from Venus may have caused the change due to background radiation. It's important to remember that at the time, America was in the grip of a nuclear war fever, and the danger of radiation was on every bodies mind.Budgetary restraints and a lack of experience may have added some rough edges to Night but they don't really diminish the film; they actually add to its surreal atmosphere. For instance, the camera work is stationary, never changing position. Each shot is from the same, locked vantage point. Most of the shots are very tightly framed and from low and skewed angles. Sometimes you can see the ceiling. Sometimes the camera is unsteady and shaky. It all helps create the claustrophobia and unsteadiness that's so integral to the film's power and message. The walls are closing in; the wall of zombies outside, and the wall of mistrust and fear inside.The other rough edge I'll mention, if you can even call it that, is the acting. It ranges from quite good to "I'm glad she didn't have more lines." Again, this only makes the proceedings of the film more odd and maybe a little more unsettling. If you can suspend your disbelief for the dead rising chances are some stilted acting won't bother you.Night of the Living Dead truly deserves the praise and acclaim that has been showered upon it in the last few decades. There have been many sequels and remakes of the movie, and most of them are good. However, the 1990 remake, which was done in color, I considered to be an abomination. Sorry Tom Savini. If ever a horror movie were a masterpiece, this one is it. An important milestone in cinematic history, and proof of what independent filmmakers can do. Night of the Living Dead is the seminal zombie movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>its hard to feel afraid of classic horror films because of modern society where everyone is so desensitized, but i could watch a clip of zombies having a tea party and still be uncomfortable. Night of the Living Dead still provides that sense of discomfort, but i was too distracted by how weak Barbra was portrayed. her character annoyed me. i get it, she was in shock and i'd probably be really upset too if i saw a dead guy kill my brother (if i had one), but im under the impression that most people would fight to stay alive and be alert in a situation like this. she couldn't even handle simple instructions or questions. Harry also bothered me... i cant understand how people can be so selfish and cowardly. i would understand if he was thinking of his family, but he was only thinking of himself and his own safety. and really, the risk was minimal because clearly the living were more adept than the zombies. the nature of the characters, even though i disliked them, enhances the movie because throughout the film, there was always something that was less than optimal if one was under attack by zombies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A threatening musical score counterpoints a tranquil country road setting in the opening scene of "Night of the Living Dead"; that road appropriately leading to a cemetery. Very soon, a childhood torment becomes a reality as brother Johnny repeats to his sister - "They're coming to get you Barbra..." The first undead creature they encounter results in tragedy, as Johnny stumbles and cracks his head on a stone. Barbra (correct spelling as listed in the credits) for her part breaks the first rule of zombie escape as she heads for a confined space, a lonely country home in the middle of nowhere.We learn that others have beaten her there, having retreated to safety in the wake of mass revivals of dead corpses, the story gradually revealed via a series of radio and television broadcasts. Apparently, radiation on an earthbound satellite that was part of a Venus probe has triggered some kind of awakening in the brains of the recently deceased. The victims have become a "virtual army of unidentified assassins", having a penchant for the flesh of living human beings.It would be easy to dismiss NOTLD as a trash zombie flick, but if you follow it closely, an intelligent exposition of the story transcends the film's limited budget and it's skimpy production values. In fact it's the dark and grainy aspect of the movie that gives it a character and a step up on the typical "B" grade horror flicks of the preceding era. The classic scene of the nighttime advancing corpses is one that will stay with you long after the movie is over.The movie maintains it's story line consistency as well; when the Cooper's young daughter succumbs to her illness and dies, she comes alive hungry for human flesh and without regard for her closest target, dear old mom. In turn, Helen Cooper comes back none the worse for wear after young Gina hands her a thrashing in spades. As the zombie horde finally breaks into the farm house, protagonist hero Ben barricades himself in the cellar against his own earlier advice, killing the Cooper's a second time, as advised by news reporters covering the countrywide phenomenon - "Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul".It's the little things that writer/director George Romero pays attention to as well that make this a horror classic. Remember brother Johnny - well he shows up later in a quick cameo as a member of the zombie horde, returning for his sister.I recall how "Night of the Living Dead" created a stir upon it's original release in 1968. Now almost forty years later, movie making technology has advanced to the point of leaving virtually nothing to the imagination. But your first glimpse of the bloody skeletal head at the top of the stairs in NOTLD is the kind of image that nightmares are made of, after your imagination takes over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "30th Anniversary" Version Reviewed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see much mention of this version of "NOTLD" so I'm posting this for anyone who might come across it and be interested.In 1998 a "New" version of "NOTLD" was created and released. Of course such releases have become common practice lately, dating back to "Close Encounters" in the early 80's and the complete re-thinking of the most recent "Exorcist" film. But in this case, rather than uncovering new "never before seen footage" as most expanded editions do, this version promised new footage conceived and shot by the original author of the screenplay, John Russo, and a new score in full stereo.I'm not a big fan of revisionist film-making--if the changes are noticeable it affects the experience of the movie, if they're not, then why bother? But I don't have a problem with messing with a movie as an alternative experience, like the "green zombie" colorized version of "NOTLD"--if the original was that good (example: the original Star Wars) there's not much you could do to it that will erase that success. The changes to the original re-released films like "The Abyss" and "Terminator 2" didn't really affect the overall experience much, they were more or less like "extended mixes" of a pop song rather than "re-mixes." Less is more, but if you're a fan more can be a fun alternative.Here, the case is different, a serious "re-thinking" of a revered and classic (albeit low-budget) film. It's obvious that the motivating factor behind such an unusual move (was there really something "missing" from the movie originally?) must be money--yet to read the accompanying materials with the DVD package certainly makes a case that the new concept was done with a lot of love. In other words, it worked well on paper and appeals to the curious film fan, certainly.Then, of course, you watch the damn movie, and understand--within 30 seconds you realize the concept wasn't viable, at least not with the budget and talent gathered for this project.I'm glad I saw it, I'll say that, because I'm a fan of film both good and bad, especially THIS film which was already good and bad, and sometimes seeing something truly terrible teaches more about how a good movie is created than seeing a "revered classic" that is flawless. The 30th Anniversary edition of "NOTLD" points out several things that are wrong with movies today, and movies in general: 1)over-foleying of sound f/x. I know it keeps foley artist's employed, and the technology is there,but we don't really need to hear ants hiccup, the way movies are today. 2)Always use real actors, no matter what your budget. The use of the new soundtrack composer in a pivotal role was a serious error: he looks like the uglier brother of Edward Norton in "American History X" and can't act. 3) A soundtrack shouldn't stand out. Here, the new music sounds like little more than demo patterns on a cheap Casio keyboard someone left running. Simple themes repeat over and over until you want to cry out "Uncle," or turn the power off, and the composer, with due respect, needs to learn that soundtrack music shouldn't be "songs," but atmosphere. The effect here is of watching a silent film with your stereo playing in the background. The bursts of the original score only highlight how miscalculated the new score is. 4)Showing is better than telling. It was scarier when we didn't know the history of the first zombie we see, or even that he was a zombie at all, and it's redundant to show zombies eating flesh so early in the film, while the radio broadcast is informing us that people are being cannibalized. It's no longer scary, it's dull, and this movie was dull enough already--if it was going to be re-thought, care should have been taken to improve the dull "talky" moments in between zombie attacks.In the final analysis, this "new" version (that's several years old now) has a couple of moments of good gore and make-up, but nothing worth checking out. The music is obnoxious, obtrusive and cheap, as well as the new scenes which do not in any way fit in with the old ones. And the new "slant" that the book-end scenes with the preacher give to the film push the "When hell is full the dead will walk the earth" theory over the "radiation created the zombies" theory. It's a whole other movie, and not one I'm interested in. I never cared why the zombies were around in the first place and adding "God's judgment" into the mix ruins the "fun," frankly.This "new" version has probably been forgotten already, and that's a good thing, but for some reason I still give the creators a nod of respect for trying something different, even if they failed miserably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a true original, a labor of both love and craftsmanship for George Romero and his friends. It was made for a pittance in Pittsburgh. And it began a series of imitations and sequels, none of which get bonus points for determination or originality.Judith O'Dea and her brother, Russell Streiner, visit their parents' grave in a remote cemetery. O'Dea prays solemnly while Streiner, evidently a non-believer, playfully mocks her and teases her about a disheveled man approaching them -- "Here he comes. They're coming to get you. Woooo." And suddenly this creepy character who looks like Art Carney DOES grab her and viciously starts wrestling her to the ground. When Streiner intervenes, he's knocked out, allowing O'Dea a few moments to escape. It's a shocking scene. The grey and barren cemetery looks like the setting for a family drama or even a comedy, and it's suddenly horror time.O'Dea winds up being barricaded in an empty farm house along with half a dozen other varied characters. One of them, inevitably, is the stock character who is domineering, dilatory, and stupid. Prima inter pares is a bright, industrious, practical African-American, whose race is never brought up.The trapped humans can't make any phone calls as zombies, by ones and twos, gather around the old house. It quickly becomes apparent that they're afraid of light. At the same time, a light bulb goes on in the head of the experienced viewer, that sooner or later the power will fail and the electric lights go off, leaving the house in darkness except for what light can be provided by improvised torches, burning furniture, and Molotov cocktails.It's a good cheap movie with a couple of revolting scenes, including the horde of zombies chomping on the barbecued bodies of a young couple caught in an exploding pickup truck. Chomping on the beautiful young woman is not so objectionable but there is such a thing as excess. It's a nice touch that Judith O'Dea is shocked by her narrow escape and her brother's death that it takes her some time to recover. Usually, the character gets about thirty seconds.One by one, the living humans are pulled out of the house or otherwise captured by the zombies and eaten by them. Here the direction is sometimes very clumsy. The windows have been hastily boarded over. There are a dozen zombies outside with their hands reaching in through the spaces. You have a rifle and you know you can kill the zombies by shooting them through the head. So -- do you stick the muzzle of your rifle through the spaces between the boards, where the mortified hands can grasp the barrel and pull the rifle away? No. No, you don't.I didn't care for the ending at all. A sheriff's detail has been making its rounds, killing the zombies off until all are now gone. As they approach the farm house, the lone survivor peeks at them from a window. "There's another one!" And, POW, the lone survivor is no more. Everybody -- including those we've come to care for -- winds up mincemeat. "King Lear" was a tragedy too but it tried to tell us something about human nature. But in this instance everyone dies because the writers decided arbitrarily that they should.Still gets bonus points, though, for being the first of its kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty, unwholesome and indefensible: like watching a nightmare while awake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" is dirty, unwholesome and indefensible. We return to it for the same reason we go back to sleep and willingly return to a nightmare. We want to revel in ugliness and horror. The same is true for two other powerful horror movies, "The Exorcist" and "Psycho." All three are nasty pieces of work; this one is merely the crudest.George Romero directed, co-wrote and co-produced this exploitation film on a shoestring budget with bad actors. The script is well-plotted, but the dialogue is bad whenever the characters reveal backstory or talk about their feelings. The direction, photography and editing are amazingly skillful considering the limitations on money; and the creepy stock music is deftly chosen throughout.To review the cast: the leading lady overacts. The black leading man looks uncomfortable whenever he has large chunks of dialogue. The two young lovers are extremely ill at ease. The angry father hits one note and hits it loud. The mother often hesitates slightly after her cues. The TV people, however, come off as natural and often comic, especially the simpleminded sheriff and the real-life Pittsburgh newsman.Many of the scenes are memorable for their combination of the everyday and the extraordinary. Who can visit a graveyard without thinking of the lumbering man who turns out to be a killer zombie? The whole fantastic idea of the dead eating the living can be seen as a metaphor for the familiar conflict between the past and the present.The filmmakers recall Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds" when the zombies invade the boarded-up farmhouse, scenes that have themselves been parodied and imitated endlessly. This familiarity adds to the feeling that we're watching something we once dreamt. The most unpleasant scene, even worse than the zombies chomping on human flesh or fighting over intestines, is the spade murder in the cellar. This is a crude imitation of Hitchcock's infamous shower scene in "Psycho," but Hitchcock's (and Saul Bass's) artistry allow us to coldly admire it even while reveling in its horror and perversity. The spade scene allows us no such distance. It is undiluted nastiness."Night" ranks among the scariest horror movies, partly for raising the bar on gore. Yet raising the bar far higher has made later horror movies far less scary. By the 1980s, horror movies were gore-splattered freak shows with expensive puppets, and now they're freak shows with digital characters that seem to belong in video games. "Night of the Living Dead," by contrast, looks like a documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The siblings Johnny and Barbra, drive to a rural and distant cemetery to place a wreath on their father's grave. When they are there, a very strange pale-faced man lumbers toward Barbra, trying to grab her, but her brother Johnny, in an attempt to save her, falls and smashes his head on a gravestone. Worried but terrorized, Barbra runs away to an abandoned house where she stays hidden from the zombies, and soon is joined by Ben and other humans. They all doesn't understand why suddenly so many strange people, looking dead creatures, are attacking them, until they discover by the radio that those people are infected and their only purpose is to kill humans to have their own meal...Ps:I don't personally find ''Night of the Living Dead '' a scary movie, but I can understand it's importance, since it was the first zombie movie created, as well as how George Romero, the director, is considered to be one of the classical horror directors of all times. I find the character Barbra totally annoying, but I can understand that besides terrified, she is traumatized by her brother's death. The women from that time were also considered to be fragile, so you can see clearly that the women from this movie have few participations in helping the men or killing monsters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror that changed the genre for the better... It still holds up pretty well even today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead starts on an ordinary Sunday afternoon, just like any other. Barabara (Judith O'Dea) &amp; her Brother Johnny (co-producer Russell Streiner, uncredited) are about 200 miles outside Pittsburgh in an isolated graveyard where their dead Father is buried. While laying a reef they are attacked by one of the recently re-animated living dead (S. William Hinzman), Johnny is killed but Barbara manages to escape to a nearby farmhouse. There she meets Ben (Duane Jones) whose truck has run out of gas, together they fight off a few zombies &amp; begin to board the farmhouse windows &amp; doors up. They are not the only people seeking safety &amp; shelter however, in the basement Harry (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen Cooper (Marilyn Eastman) &amp; their ill daughter Karen (Kyra Schon) plus two teenage lovers Tom (Keith Wayne) &amp; Judy (Judith Ridley) are also hiding from the ever growing hordes of the undead outside. They must work together to try &amp; escape the constantly growing in number flesh-eating zombies that surround the farmhouse &amp; seem determined to get in...Co-edited, photographed, co-written &amp; directed by George A. Romero who also has a small cameo Night of the Living Dead was the first film in Romero's fantastic series of zombie films with Dawn of the Dead (1978) following, then came Day of the Dead (1985) &amp; more recently Land of the Dead (2005) &amp; is an absolute classic that every horror fan should see at least once. The script by Romero &amp; John A. Russo works very well, even today. It moves along at a nice pace &amp; never becomes dull or boring. I liked the fact that Night of the Living Dead features real people trying to survive &amp; not concentrating on phony Government bodies &amp; authorities, the character's are both believable &amp; well balanced. I like the idea of them being real people with real fears. The farmhouse makes for a great isolated location &amp; the film builds up well as more &amp; more zombies swarm over the house &amp; we lean as the character's learn through news broadcasts although the exact cause for the dead to rise is somewhat vague &amp; isn't touched upon or explored in great depth which wasn't a problem for me at all, in fact I'd have probably preferred it if no solid explanation was given at all. With a supposed budget of around $114,000 Night of the Living dead is a bit wobbly around the edges but is technically fine, as long as you don't expect the production values of a massive Hollywood blockbuster which unfortunately I imagine most people do these days. The black and white cinematography is acceptable &amp; works in the films favour, continuity isn't too bad, director Romero manages to create some great scenes that will forever live on in horror film history like the opening in the cemetery &amp; the terrific downbeat ending that works perfectly, the music is non-discript &amp; bland but expected considering it's mostly free stock music &amp; the special effects are decent as well with a dead body that has lost it's face, some rotting zombies, some gunshot wounds &amp; we even get some cannibalism &amp; intestine eating. The acting is OK &amp; about as good as one would expect, no-ones going to win any awards but then again no-one embarrasses themselves too much. Night of the Living Dead is a classic, it has stood the test of time very well &amp; makes for an entertaining watch even now. Definitely worth watching, recommended. The remake Night of the Living Dead (1990) is also a very fine film as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie when I first watched it, but I didn't think of it as a masterpiece. I thought it was good but not amazing. I had different expectations back then, I wanted the ghouls to be more monstrous and the characters more heroic. But as time went on this movie grew on me and I now appreciate that it didn't meet my expectations. Having the characters portrayed as humans instead of able heroes made the movie more believable and that makes the movie much more dreadful to watch. The ghouls as they are is frightening enough by the mere thought of the dead refusing to be dead, also that they eat human flesh is even more terrifying. Now to be honest if I had continued to have the same view on movies as I did as a teenager, I would have thought movies like 'World War Z' and the remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' are better movies. But since I have matured and I lean more towards originality I have started to regard 'Night of the Living Dead' as a horror masterpiece. Sure it is low budget, sure it is not as gory as modern movies, sure the ghouls/zombies are not those hyper monsters that defies gravity and make scary pig sounds but only few movies can fill its audience with such dread as 'Night of the Living Dead'.Horror is not only about violence and gore, it is not only about cheap jump scares, it is not only about ghosts, demons and God. No. Horror is much more than that, horror is also a certain mood, or more correctly an atmosphere. As time goes on I am more and more into atmosphere and 'Night of the Living Dead' is full of that dreadful and heavy feeling of eventual doom. The degradation of human civilization, life slowly fading away with no salvation in sight just to walk the earth as a cannibalistic living dead. With the only hope being the fake promise from the Bible. Death is really fascinating and it is used as one of the main themes in this movie. One of the themes the movie also has is corruption. Shortly explained look at how the characters behave. Logic dictates the chances to survive is bigger when there is cooperation, but although the characters want to survive they were still more concerned about themselves instead of coming to an agreement that eventually lead to their doom. Plot is simple: survive. Low budget, expendable to casual viewers but there is no denying this movie was/is a genre defining horror movie. An influential masterpiece that should not be missed. In terms of influence 'Dawn of the Dead' might be the only one to match it, when we speak of zombie movies.Strong movie, still more frightening than modern movies if you ask me and one that haunts the mind, long after the end credits have ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George A.Romero's Night of the living dead is the original zombie movie that has spawned a million sequels, remakes, re-imaginings and copy cats but whether or not it's the best of the bunch divided us. The movie which would have seemed terrifying for it's time with the mere mention of people eating flesh is not so much dated as just tame by today's standards. It's reliance on pace, characters and mood rather then effects is one of the movies strong points which makes it as entertaining and relevant today as the day it was released and the ending has yet to be matched in any of the sequels or remakes. featured on Emerald Reprobates pod-cast episode 61</fullReview>

I like how this begins, with just two siblings visiting a graveyard to pay respects to their father, and then a stranger starts attacking them and they have no clue why. That's why this works so well, cause it places the viewer in a situation that seems normal, and then quickly changes, and by the end of the movie you are left to ask the question, Who is the bigger danger, the Zombies or the "Normal People"? The acting is a little sketchy in some places, but that is to be expected for a low budget movie with no professional actors, but it has held remarkably well over time.

		<fullReview>A group of people hide from bloodthirsty zombies in a farmhouse. Barbra and her brother Johnny travel by car from Pittsburgh to the countryside to visit the gravestone of their father in the cemetery. Out of the blue, they are attacked by a strange man and Johnny is murdered. Barbra runs and releases the brake of Johnny's car since the keys are in his pocket, and flees to an isolated farmhouse, where she locks herself inside. Barbra is in shock and soon she finds a man, Ben, who is also escaping from the inhuman creatures and he reinforces the doors, windows and openings in the house. He also finds a shotgun and a radio and they learn that the radiation from a satellite that was returning from Venus has somehow reactivated the brain of the dead. Then they find five humans hidden in the basement: Harry Cooper, his wife Helen and their daughter Karen that is sick; and Tom and his girlfriend Judy. Harry has an argument with Ben, since he believes that the basement is the safest place for them and Harry does not agree. Along the night, the tension. Roger Ebert wrote "It's hard to remember what sort of effect this movie might have had on you when you were six or seven. But try to remember. At that age, kids take the events on the screen seriously, and they identify fiercely with the hero. When the hero is killed, that's not an unhappy ending but a tragic one: Nobody got out alive. It's just over, that's all." All in all, it is a poignant horror film, not only due to its then-unmatched gore, but because of the criticism of society and human nature in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Culure Arising to Devour the Old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror fans like myself like to say the classic age of horror lasted until 1960, when "Psycho" signaled the start of the modern age. Though its true that "Psycho" might have been the first true modern horror film, it took the rest of the decade for the genre to catch up to Hitchcock's masterpiece. The movie that truly signaled the changing of the guard, that dragged horror kicking and screaming into the modern age, was George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead." The film's biggest contribution to the horror genre, and all of pop culture truthfully, is the modern conception of the zombie. Before this film, the only version of zombies known to the world were the traditional voodoo zombies, undead servants controlled by a master. In "Night of the Living Dead," the zombies are corpses risen to life to feed upon the flesh of the living. The only way to kill one is to destroy the brain through whatever means. These are the rules that have come to define the entire zombie genre. For the record, Romero never intended to completely redefine the zombie. In his original script, he referred to the creatures as "ghouls," a similar but distinct mythological creature. His main inspiration for the movie was Richard Matheson's "I Am Legend," which was a novel about vampires. These specifics ended up not mattering. From the moment it was released, the ghouls in "Night of the Living Dead" were zombies. Henceforth, everything that acted like them were also zombies.Another aspect that has elevated the film into the upper-echelon of great horror movies is George Romero and his actors taking the material one-hundred percent seriously. The director intentionally invited a number of subtextual angles. "Night" is about the end of the sixties. The film is literally about a new culture arising to devour the old one. Society as we know it is overturned. The rules of life and death, as traditionally understood, are completely rewritten. Early on, Johnny makes a dismissive reference to religion. Later on, a news report says there's no time for ceremony when disposing of the dead. Religious certainties are invalid now too.If "Night" isn't the first modern horror film, it is, perhaps, the first post-Vietnam horror film. There's a stark quality to the way the film is shot. It frequently feels like a newsreel. These aren't movie stars in a glossy production. These are normal people involved in horrifying circumstances. In opposition to generations of Gothic horror films, the horror isn't in some exotic forgien land. It's in your backyard. By the same accord, the film brings the horror of Vietnam home. Romero and company have repeatedly denied the casting of Duane Jones, a black man, in the lead role having any significance. Yet his presence undeniably affects how the viewer watches the film. For all the layers in the film, its most universal point is that mankind is incapable of communicating. If Ben and Mr. Cooper worked together against the zombies, they might have survived the night. Instead, they bicker, argue, and compete. Humanity will never be able to get anywhere because we can't stop arguing with each other over petty, pointless bullshit.You can read a lot into "Night of the Living Dead." As sophisticated as the writing is, "Night" is still a low budget horror film made by a first time crew. The seams show repeatedly. The camera positions are frequently awkward, sometimes creating unintentional dutch angles. The editing can be hazardous and sudden at times. The film is scored with stock library music which frequently blares and is as inelegant as possible. The story has a thrown-together quality at times, reminding the viewer how quickly and cheaply it was shot. George had a lot of stuff on his mind but the writing is still, at times, pulpy. Barbara is a defenseless woman who spends half of the movie as a frantic wreck and the other half unconscious on a couch. There are long sequences of characters walking through the house or boarding up windows which come off slightly as padding.If "Night" wasn't remember for birthing the modern zombie genre, it would be remember for its then-shocking amount of gore. The movie was released in a post-"Blood Feast" world so it's not like splatter films were a new concept. However, no movie before "Night" treated gore in such a visceral way. Zombies have bloody holes blown through them, which they easily shrug off. Ben stabs one ghoul in the head with a tire iron. The most infamous moment follows the explosion of the pick-up truck. An undead orgy of feasting follows, the zombies fighting over a trail of intestines and chomping down on organs and body parts. Though crude, the gore is still sickening today strictly because of the matter-of-fact way its handled. The film is going for shocks. A little girl stabs her mother to death with a trowel before gnawing on her dad's arm. Ultimately, the downbeat, bleak tone of "Night of the Living Dead" grants its violence more power. This is a world without happy endings. The government doesn't swoop in at the end to the save the day, like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." Instead, slack-jawed rednecks shoot the hero in the head, mistaking him for a zombie. The ending is sudden and nihilistic but more than makes its point.A strong helps seal the deal. Duane Jones is charismatic and gives a committed performance, even making Romero's sometimes awkward dialogue work. Karl Hardman is also notable as the bristly, hard-edged Harry Cooper. Some of the actors, like Keith Wayne or Judith Ridley, aren't as good though, giving stiff performances. Sometimes the low budget details are distracting, sometimes they are affective. Either way, "Night of the Living Dead" is unforgettable, still scary to this day, and surely one of the most influential horror films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John and his sister Barbara go to visit their father's grave out in rural Pennsylvania. They notice a strange man walking. It turns out to be a zombie who attacks John. Barbara escapes to an abandoned farmhouse. Then a black man named Ben arrives. After several attacks from the zombies, a group hiding in the cellar comes out upon hearing the radio. The father insists on hiding in the cellar. His girl had been bitten by a zombie. There is also a teenage couple.This is a classic not only as horror, but also as indie. It is also important as general cinema. It is that good. It reintroduces zombies into a significant sub-genre in horror. It allows a confident combative black man to be the lead. It rises above its low budget origins. It was a mistake to show this for the little kids which is sometimes the practice of the day. This is definitively an adult movie. It is a serious adult movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badly Aged But Still Retains Its Ability To Shock &amp; Disgust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero's feature film debut is that influential horror flick whose contribution to its genre as well as pop-culture has been so immense that cinema will forever be indebted to it. Night of the Living Dead marks the birth of a new sub-genre of horror &amp; is the first film to employ the storyline of zombie apocalypse.Over the years since its release, this seminal classic has garnered a strong cult following &amp; there's no denying that its influence remains as effective as before but for me, Night of the Living Dead turned out to be a pretty mediocre experience considering that it has aged very badly &amp; what was once scary now comes off as unintentionally hilarious.Set in an unspecified time, the story of Night of the Living Dead takes place in an abandoned farmhouse where a small number of people stack up to hide from the flesh-eating corpses that have been mysteriously reanimated. As the dead people surrounding the house escalate in number, the attempt to survive the night starts looking less promising for the people inside.Shot on a shoestring budget, making fine use of black-n-white photography &amp; presenting an odd set of characters, Night of the Living Dead violates many taboos over the course of its runtime &amp; Romero's direction makes sure that the presentation is as explicit as its content. The performances by its amateur cast has few standouts but it's the characteristics given to the ghouls (now referred as zombies) is what leaves a lasting impression.On an overall scale, Night of the Living Dead adds a whole new chapter to horror filmmaking &amp; has inspired countless number of zombie flicks, some of which even transcended the genre of horror. It may not be as frightening today as it was during its time of release but it still retains an ability to shock &amp; disgust viewers to an extent with its explicit, graphic &amp; uncompromising content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie is the Reasons Why We Love and Fear Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero has secured a permanent spot in the hearts of cine- philes with his series of movies on the "living dead". The monsters he created did not rely size or weapons to induce fear. They were mere human bodies but without life or conscience and a voracious appetite for human flesh and they multiply by turning their victims into one of them. What can be more fearful than being slowly consumed alive or seeing your loved ones turned into one of them.Restricted to a low budget, Romero turns his disadvantage around. Most of the movie takes place in a farmhouse, where a small group of people seek refuge from the onslaught of the living dead. There is a great attention paid to the affect of the terror outside on the people holed- up inside; their fear, confusion, clash of ideas/egos, the consequent altercations and the tragedy of it all are well-depicted. At the same time we are informed of the wider extent of the terror through news bulletins. The actors are little known but deliver some good performances. The black-and-white prevents us from noticing a lot of blood and for the most part the movie plays on the psychological fear of the viewers. But there are some very disturbing scenes and images peppering the movie, and each time we see one of those, we start dreading the one to come next.This is horror at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I told my wife that the movie is 'a searing commentary on the role and status of the black man in 1960s American society' which addresses 'the disturbing psychosexual tensions which persisted between black men and white women during that era' and 'the cosmic struggle between white man and black man for control of a nation that cannot contain them both', illustrated by 'blatant phallic imagery' in the form of a rifle which the 'emasculated' white man tries to steal from the black man, in a vain attempt to 'reclaim his masculinity and reassert his racial dominance.'She gave me a slap and told me to stop talking rubbish. Honestly, some people just can't see the subtext.I rate 'Night of the Living Dead' at 29.97 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a solid 9/10 on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for a low budget film made in the 60's, this is pretty amazing. the acting is surprisingly great, the editing is a lot of fun, the effects are worthy of a normal budget film, the characters are 3 dimensional and the good ones are fun to watch, it's intense and has a very unique sense of claustrophobia that i never get tired of seeing, no other film has been able to present the feeling of claustrophobia in the way this one has, because the characters want to be in a confined space, it makes it almost positive.i like this film for more than zombies, the technical stuff catches my attention in a positive light and isn't distracting, i even enjoy listening to the sound effects. the dialogue isn't cheesy, the script is very well done, in fact, apart from being in black and white, this film's attitude makes it seem more suited to the late seventies, it's mature and Romero clearly put a lot of care into it.these days it probably wouldn't be considered scary but even then it's still a very good film, the female character does scream and yell a lot but it doesn't get annoying because they timed it right and didn't over do it. it's interesting all throughout because the characters are always doing something, boarding the windows, talking about what's going on, watching the TV while that explains what's going on around them and finding new ways to kill the zombies.i love this movie because everything about it is rare, it's old yet doesn't feel it, and everything technical is as awesome as the thrills and story of survival.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this a 6 considering that it was low budget and late 60's. The acting was really not too bad, all things considered. I don't usually go for "B" movies, but I would have to give this a B+. Definitely the beginning of genre. Glad I watched it.Sometimes just the fact that a movie is black and white is enough to keep me from watching it. I know I need to reexamine that policy. As much as I love movies, I need to give more black and white movies a chance.In the beginning, I thought, "Ooh I don't know if I can hang with this." It seemed a little dopey, but as it progressed I got into it and some of the dialog was actually decent. I've seen modern day low budget flicks that couldn't hold a candle to this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality Bites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I was trying to come up with a concept about a new society, revolutionary...in political terms, that's taking over and devouring the old society." ? George A. Romero George Romero's "Night Of The Living Dead" marked the implosion of the white, middle class, American nuclear family and portrayed the collapse of post-war patriarchal authority into a kind of mad hysteria. What followed - the sexual, political and social "revolutions" of the 1960s - were not so much rebellions against tyrannical paternal and political despots, or against the rigid repressions of suburban family life, as they were carnivalesque revelations that the emperor had no clothes. That 1950s suburbia offered nothing but hypocrisy and fake decor. As such, Romero has his nuclear family holed up in a farmhouse - the impotence of the father mirroring the clownishness and impotence of various authority figures on his television screen - until the unit collapses under the weight of its own stupidity and children-turned-zombies avidly consume their own parents. As is always the case with Romero, the zombies are actually the good guys, the new zombie order literally consuming the outmoded old. The zombie horde then become a darkly humorous vision of hippie communalism who are the preferred refuge of the children of the white middle class.But the rebellions of the 1960s went nowhere, hope fading and forgotten. Hippies and campus radicals from middle-class backgrounds grew up to be yuppies, and their influence on the larger culture was mostly a matter of an easily saleable "lifestyle." Once the social upheavals of the 60s had passed, consumerism turned out to be the real winner, so it's entirely appropriate that Romero's second zombie movie, "Dawn of the Dead", takes place in a shopping mall. Here our heroes live a fantasy of commodity abundance and unhinged consumption, whilst the zombies draw inexorably closer, the mall reminding them of their happiest pre-death moments. In this world there is no satisfaction, only lack, the zombie's unquenchable lust for flesh mocking the consumer's unquenchable desires.Then came "Day of the Dead", arguably the best film in the series. Here, 60s radicalism and 70s consumerism are shunted aside in favour for an assault on Reaganism and the military/scientific complex, where pathologically macho soldiers try to keep the zombies at bay whilst scientists try with futility to either "destroy the zombie plague" or "tame the zombies". The film is relentless in its deconstruction of military authoritarianism and scientific claims to supreme authority, but mostly it's the film's treatment of Freud's reality/pleasure principle and its thick fatalism which makes it so unique. Here, the zombies embody a kind of sympathetic, undeveloped and (pre-language, pre-entry-into-the-Symbolic) ego-less desire (they do not know why they want/desire), which contrasts with the libidinal economy and the twisted viciousness of the human characters (who bury the true motivations of their desires and hypocritically stand for social order).Each of Romero's zombie movies were intended to be a snapshot of the decade in which they was released; "Night" the 60s, "Dawn" the 70s and "Day" the 80s. "Land of the Dead", for financial reasons, was released in the 21st century, but it is actually a broad critique of 90s American society. Here, social class and warfare comes to the foreground, the film imagining America as a paranoid bastion of humanity and freedom, standing tall against the "foreign horde". In "Land of the Dead", the ruling class live lives of elegance and supreme wealth in the exclusive and gated high-rises of "Fiddler's Green", while the masses outside do their dirty bidding and scrape by on low incomes, distracting themselves from their worries with sex, drugs, gambling and violence. The leader of this late-capitalist America, a George Bush styled madman out to make the rich richer and who "refuses to negotiate with terrorists", subsists by sending into zombie territory teams of mercenaries who steal zombie loot (he achieves this by distracting the zombies with fireworks- a kind of metaphor for media spectacle and social brainwashing). The zombies themselves are, once again, the good guys, often linked with the rebelling humans who wish to rise up against their overlords. When the zombies break into the city - led by a black zombie of course - it's symbolic of the proletariat finally rising against their masters and demanding restitution and justice, though Romero knows this is but a futile, 1960s pipe dream. He ends the film with the zombies defeated, the humans infected, and the rebels disillusioned, the masses going their separate ways at the end of the film, wandering off into the horizon like so many disillusioned cinematic anti-heroes of cinema's golden age, specifically the existential road movies of the early 1970s.8.5/10 ? "Day of the Dead"8/10 ? "Land of the Dead", "Dawn of the Dead"7.5/10 ? "Night of the Living Dead" Despite their tiny budgets and at times poor acting, these films still operate fairly well as popcorn movies. What elevates them, though, is the allegorical qualities of Romero's trashy plots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's one of the best picture ever for me, overall, not only horror movies...What could I say more, that the other users have already told?I can't find enough words to describe this authentic gem that every movie buff - and not only - have already watched. I saw it a hundred times...A simple story, but so powerful, so efficient, and with no professional actors. No "hollywoodian" actors I mean. The very first scene, where we see an American flag put at the cemetery entry, which can be interpreted as the Vietnam mess - the film was shot in 1968 - is very meaningful for the rest of the film. And typical of this very period. The counter culture one. What I particularly like in this masterpiece is that there is not useless love interest between the characters, for instance Ben and Barbara's ones, as we could have expected. And I appreciate this. Yes, this movies describes the human behavior very well. After all, are the real human creatures better than the dead ones? That's the real question of the movie, that's my opinion. The characters fighting for their lives in the small house are shown in such an intense way...Films made now, in 20... are not so powerful. Sorry. And the final moral, where we finally find that the coward, nasty character - Cooper's one - was damn right, concerning the safety of the basement. All long the film, well almost, he told everyone that the basement was the safest way to stay. Ben, the lead, did not agree, so did the audience who loves this fighting character. And, at the end, that's this very basement that saved Ben.The bad guy was right at the end. That's very unusual. Yes I won't never be tired to watch this movie again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a bad feeling when picking up the Trilogy of the Dead boxset...can't quite explain it but it was there. Maybe it was because the DVD version of Dawn of the Dead was the same as my director's cut version (which is cut), or maybe, more realistically, it was due to the fact that the version of NOTLD (which is how overweight virgin internet reviewers like to call it) was some f*cking b*stardized 1999 version with new footage added.A name cropped up in this new version. Bill Hinzmann. Now, 99% of the population have better things to do than know what this guy is all about. Us 1% that do care know that he was the original zombie in NOTLD (which is how etc)...who also made an eighties movie called Zombie Nosh about his character from NOTLD (which zzzzzz). Now the moron, along with original writer John Russo made a version of NOTLD (whi) that has new footage and takes 15 mins of footage out of the original. Because there's no copyright on NOTLD (w) and therefore any spazzy out there can do what the f*ck they like to NOTLD. So do you know why I did? That's right. I wiped my *rse on this particular version of NOTFLD and went out and bought the proper version for 2 quid.Which leads me to this review. Maybe one day I can watch the 30th anniversary edition withoutexpelling my lower intestinal tract out my ringpiece in a wide purple tubed arc in my living room, but not just now. Let's stick with the original.Barbara and Johnny head for a graveyard to pay tribute to their wasted dad who lives in a grave three hours' drive from their house, but once they get there BILL HINZMANN who is a zombie attacks them and you know the drill. Johnny gets wasted and Barabaararararara head for the farmhouse where, upon finding a stronger character called Ben, she just zones out and lets him do all the work.It's great this movie. Even though it's ancient, and in a geeky way doesn't adhere to the rules of zombieness, it's still great. You can never go wrong with loads of menace and shouting (see Al Pacino's career). There's not that much gore in here, but in my opinion the fact that the cast sit down to watch telly half way through the film just about sums the future up.....Anyways if you haven't seen it. See it. It only cost me two pounds. Any problems, I'll give you Bill Hinzmann's address and you can kick his head in.It's in black and white too, which isn't a problem to me but seems to fry certain brain circuits of people posting reviews on the IMDb.'i love notld its great but black n white but a kid kills its mom see it now'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Landmark Zombie Film of All Time!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freshman director George Romeo reinvented the zombie movie with his low-budget, black &amp; white chiller "Night of the Living Dead." Previously, virtually all zombie movies revived the undead through the use of voodoo, as in the Bela Lugosi classic "White Zombie" and the RKO feature "I Walked with a Zombie." Primarily, these zombies were manipulated like puppets by a human master, but "Night of the Living Dead" changed the modus operandi of zombies. Romeo's reanimated dead were controlled by nobody but their ravenous cannibalistic appetite for human flesh. Although he produced this nail-biter on a reportedly minuscule budget of $114-thousand, Romeo exploited his dearth of financing and an unknown cast fully to his advantage because we in the audience weren't sure either who would die or when they will bite the dust. Romeo made three sequels "Dawn of the Dead," "Day of the Dead," and later "Land of the Dead." In the first two sequels, the heroes change, but Romeo adhered to his humans-holed-up-against-the-zombies scenario. In "Dawn of the Dead," the human survivors barricade themselves in a shopping mall, while in "Day of the Dead," they fortify themselves in a missile silo. The other thing that set this threadbare thriller apart from other chillers was its explicit content. You actually see mutilated dead people as well as zombie munching on human body parts."Night of the Living Dead" opens innocuously enough with quarreling siblings Barbra (Judith O'Dea of "November Son") and Johnny (Russell Streiner of "The Majorettes") visiting a cemetery to see their father's grave. The obnoxious Johnny does his best to scare his sister Barbra because she abhors cemeteries. Little does poor Johnny know that a cadaverous-looking man limping through the cemetery is a zombie. Moreover, this man (Bill Hinzman of "Satan Claws") attacks Barbra. Johnny intervenes, but the zombie kills poor Johnny when he smashes Johnny's head against a tombstone. Barbra locks herself in their Pontiac and searches for the key. Too late she realizes that Johnny has the key. Meanwhile, the desperate zombie picks up a brick and smashes a window with it. Mind you, this doesn't seem like the act of a mindless monster. As the zombie struggles to get to her, Barbra improvises and releases the hand brake so that the car coasts downhill. She manages to escape and finds the farmhouse. The zombie staggers after her and things look bleak. An intelligent African-American male, Ben (Duane Jones of "Vampires"), shows up and wards off the zombies with a tire-iron and a torch. Eventually, Ben supervises the motley collection of survivors as they contend with the mounting numbers of zombies. While Ben struggles to board up the house, Romeo relies on a radio newscaster to provide exposition about their predicament and present a bigger picture of disaster. The Zenith radio plays as integral a part in the action as any of the human participants. As he ransacks a closet, Ben discovers a repeating rifle and ammunition. Not long afterward, Ben and Barbra learn that a family has hidden themselves in the basement. The premise of "Night of the Living Dead" is that the dead get a new lease on life thanks to radiation from a crashed rocket. The radiation revitalizes them so they can walk the earth and feast on the flesh and blood of defenseless mankind. It seems that a space probe returning from Venus exploded in the atmosphere. The only way to kill these shuffle-footed corpses is to shoot them in the head. Meantime, if firearms are available, people can rely on flaming torches to hold these corpses at bay. Seven total strangers take refuge in a secluded Pennsylvania farmhouse where a legion of corpses besieges them. The zombies comes in all sizes, shapes, sexes. In fact, one of the zombies is played by a naked woman! Essentially, "Night of the Living Dead" is like a cavalry versus the Indians with the Indians having surrounded and cut-off the cavalry."Night of the Living Dead" has a terrific ending that is laced with irony.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Romero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' (1968) is undeniably a classic. To say that this film was made on a tight budget would be an understatement, it was literally made on a shoe string. Many people would argue that a low budget doesn't always mean a great film, and they would be right. I have seen countless examples of low budget films that were absolutely awful, 'Lesbian Vampire Killers' of last year is a great example. However, what a tight budget does is force the film maker to use all of their initiative and resourcefulness to try and make the film a success; if the film maker is good then the movie can be great without relying on a budget. Fortunately in George A. Romero we have the absolute master of the horror genre and a brilliant director, therefore the resulting film is one of the greatest horrors of all time and is still terrifying to this day.There are many important aspects to this film, none more important than the use of Duane Jones, an African American man in the role of the hero or leading man. It was made towards the end of the Civil Rights Movement and was one of the first horror films to have a black leading man. This is excellent as it challenged the audience of the time to not only except this man as their equal but as their hero.Another fantastic thing about 'Night of the Living Dead' is found in its simplicity. This is grass roots horror that pretty much rewrote the rulebook. Horror today in the main relies on special effects and before that relied on make up; an amazing example is Rick Baker's Oscar winning work on 'An American Werewolf in London'; however when watching 'Night of the Living Dead' you will notice that the 'zombies' do not generally have heavy make up on, and yet they still manage to remain scary. This is all to do with Romero's impeccable direction. Simple shots of hands grabbing people through boarded up windows have you screaming at the screen and guessing who is going to be ripped apart next.Overall, it is rare to say a film is a perfect example of how good a genre can be but Romero's classic certainly does show how good a horror film can be. Many would still consider it to be the greatest horror of all time, I am not of this opinion, but it will still always remain on a pedestal in my mind due to its influence upon character archetypes, horror settings and future low budget productions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A turning point in horror history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of people hide from bloodthirsty zombies in a farmhouse...George A. Romero has readily admitted that Herk Harvey's Carnival of Souls influenced in his making of Night Of The Living Dead (NOTLD). For me, they're both low budget, both filmed in black and white and both are chilling creepy in places.Both went onto be get 'lost' but unlike Carnival of Souls, NOLD was haled by critics abroad, who saw it not just as another horror movie, but a film that reflects society. Romero has gone on to define a genre, a feat that very few have accomplished. Many films have been influenced and have imitated George's creation but few successfully.NOLD is seeped in history and has become as intriguing as the chiller its self. There's really not too much to comment on that hasn't already been said before. The dead are played mindlessly well. Duane Jones is a fantastic lead actor and stands out, an actor ahead of his time but the others are less convincing. The stock music is bold, and the sound is an adequate mix but all these things with their faults add to the charm of this little horror classic.It's dark, gloomy and entertaining but more importantly it was a turning point in horror history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Really Well Done Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the opening, this movie captures the viewer's attention, as Johnny and Barbra arrive at an isolated cemetery to place a wreath on what I assume was their father's grave. We know that something strange is going on, because just as Johnny exits the car, the radio comes back on, and we discover that something had knocked it off the air. In the cemetery, Barbra is then attacked by a strange man but manages to escape, finding refuge in a local farmhouse where she, along with a few others who found the same refuge, struggle to survive repeated attacks from what turn out to be recently deceased people brought back to life by a strange radiation.The horror element is very well done. There are some very graphic moments of the "ghouls" eating flesh, but it isn't gratuitous - the purpose of those shots seems to be to introduce the viewer to the same horror being seen by the characters. Inside the farmhouse, as this small group tries to survive, the focus is on the dynamics between them, shifting back to the ghouls only when an escape plan is worked out. Radio and TV are used very effectively to allow the characters (and the viewers) to gain knowledge of what's going on not just at this farmhouse but all over. Interestingly for 1968, the movie portrays a black man (played by Ben Hanser) as taking charge of the situation in the farmhouse. That the radiation came from outer space plays upon a fear that did exist in the early years of space flight - what if something terrible came back from outer space with an astronaut? (Remember the lengthy quarantines the early Apollo astronauts were subjected to after their flights.) The low budget feel of the movie isn't a problem, and in fact in some ways adds to the creepy feel. I might take issue with the title. It gives away what might have been the highlight - struggling with the authorities to figure out just what these "murderers" actually are</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" is not standard horror. In fact, there are several minutes where this classic zombie film is just plain boring. There is brilliance, however, in the film's static nature, like how one of the main characters, Barbra (Judith O'Dea), is in speechless shock for most of the film. And despite the horror fan's craving for gore, suspense and active characters, "Living Dead" tantalizes its audience and then stuns it with unexpected turns of events instead of using the typical rise-and-fall horror structure."Living Dead" could be described as the king of the B horror movie. Its title, flesh-eating half-humans and cheesy violence keep the movie walking that fine line between horror and comedy. The difference is that the plot contains events that break horror conventions. Look past the use of Bosco chocolate syrup and black and white film in 1968 and you'll notice the film is more about humans vs. humans than it is humans vs. zombies.The story opens with a girl and her brother visiting their father's grave when they're attacked by a zombie. The brother gets knocked out while the girl runs and takes shelter in a nearby vacated home where she's later discovered by Ben (Duane Jones), the take-charge type of horror movie character. They board up the house and light fires to keep the zombies away and soon they discover five other people were hiding in the cellar. Together, all seven of them argue about survival tactics and things get heated between Ben and Mr. Cooper (Karl Hardman)."Living Dead" ends up being one of those films exposing how human nature rears its ugly head in these kinds of life-or-death situations. Padded by some probably unintentional racial tension between Ben and Cooper, as the arguing continues you are forced to wonder who the real savages are: the ones outside the house or the ones inside it. Culminating in an excellent and largely unpredictable ending sequence as the zombie threat becomes imminent in the house, "Living Dead" ends up becoming a surprise to everyone.With sub-par acting, unnecessarily long scenes of the news playing out over the television and nothing that's actually scary, it's amazing how "Living Dead" manages to win over its viewers. There are literally just scenes where Ben is boarding up the windows listening to the radio and you wonder if the zombies are just chilling outside playing cards or something. But there's great effectiveness when Ben keeps telling Barbra to stay calm and not be scared and she just won't say anything, much to our dismay. "Living Dead" is more psychological than you'd ever expect from something with all these B-movie characteristics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed watching Night Of The Living Dead. The radiation from a fallen satellite has caused the recently deceased to rise from the grave and seek the living to use as food. Several people barricade themselves inside a rural house in an attempt to survive the night. Outside are loads of zombies who can only be killed by a blow to the head. Anyone who dies during the crisis of causes unrelated to brain trauma will return as a flesh-eating zombie, including anyone who has been bitten by a zombie. The only way to destroy the zombies is to destroy the brain. A young woman visiting her father's grave takes refuge in the nearby farmhouse, where she is met by a man who protects her and barricades them inside. I thought that this was a great film despite being low budget and was filmed around forty years ago, I think that the black and white film made if feel more creepier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If or when you watch this, try to make certain that it is the regular version, and not the 30th Anniversary Edition, which substitutes about fifteen minutes of film with other footage... what they take out was great the way it was, and what they replace it with actually takes away from this as a whole. It should be noted that Romero was not involved in making that cut. Turning our attention back to the original... this is a marvelous argument, when making a case for fans and young enthusiasts directing. When they are talented and/or have something to say, it can turn out this excellent. This was immensely shocking when it came out, and to this day it's powerful. The script is well-written and treats the audience with respect. No one here acts stupid simply because it was convenient for the author; if or when they do, it's believable, such as the person being (understandably) emotional, and you're at no point pulled out of the experience of the viewing. And in fact, the well-developed, credible and diverse characters do a lot of smart things, and you find yourself cheering for them and hoping they make it, rather than with the newer flicks, where, frankly, it's not uncommon to have the reaction that goes something like this: "...well, if you're that daft, maybe they should kill you". The pacing is spot-on, you never feel completely safe for the hour and a half, but it doesn't overwhelm you to the point of over-stimulation, either. This masterfully builds and maintains an atmosphere of terror and impending death, in a bleak and unpleasant world. George understood that horror does not have to involve a force that moves swiftly; they don't even have to possess superior physical strength. The fear comes from this grotesque twist on the mundane and usual. People, potentially even someone you used to know. And it is also derived from the determination, the unstoppable nature... and that they do not need to be fast. Time is on their side... and so are numbers. The acting is a tad mixed, though none of it is downright poor, and O'Dea is stunning, playing catatonic. It's worth mentioning, too, that this has a teenage-ish couple who are in love, without them being constantly randy, irritating or dumb. It's honestly rather sweet, and adds to the humanity of those we follow in this. I will not give away very much of the plot, though I can reveal that this starts with two siblings driving to a cemetery. The dialog is well-delivered, and exposition is handled convincingly, and comes across as being natural. This is intense, scary and dark. It helps to try to forget everything you know about the zombie-sub-genre from later releases. The music is a well-composed score, and always fits. FX are well-done for the time and the budget, and definitely inventive. They don't distract, and they work. There is a moderate amount of gruesome and fairly graphic, bloody violence, disturbing content and gore in this, as well as brief nudity, and mild and infrequent language. The Trilogy of the Dead disc set includes a photo gallery of 8 stills, 5 pages of liner notes, and a trailer. I recommend this to any fan of these movies. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead is about as cheaply made as movies get, and as revolutionary. The fact that it is a cleaver metaphor for 1960's America, has been heavily emphasized as part of the brilliance of George Romero's film debut, but the real reason to love this movie, is the revolution it started in the genre. Many horror film's have since followed in Romero's footsteps, but none have ever, and will ever match the uniqueness of Night of The Living Dead.The plot is simple and practical. A handful of people who escape death take refuge in an abandoned house, where they make a stand against a army of zombies, corpses brought back to life because of a recent radiation catastrophe in the country. One of the many brilliant traits of the the film is the way it is shown, in grainy black and white for a more haunting and almost ancient cinematic effect, like the classic horror films with Lugosi and Karloff.Night of the Living Dead is a sensation. Unfortunaly due to all the action and gore laden zombie films which have come out ever since, contemporary viewers might find this one a little boring, but any true fan will love this and should see it regardless of the controversy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This powerful and classic horror film is the Romero's directorial debut with low budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romero's gruesome first film, combining gore, 'bona fide' frights horror and in documentary style with skillful characterization, it's one of the most successful independent films of all time. A mysterious plague caused by a satellite that expands a high level of radiation, it creates the recently dead to rise from their graves and scout the countryside and surrounding a farmhouse for feed on and where find shelter a hapless group. The legions of dead people who stalk the house are looking exasperatingly for live humans .The first time the Zombies appeared was in ¨White Zombie(1932)¨. From then on Zombies remained a firm staple of terror B-genre , bringing the dead back to life was a popular pastime in the 30s and 40s. The early zombies were basically genteel beings and generally likable and agreeable types. Romero created in Pittsburg his own production company Image Ten Productions with his friends, John Russo among them and they each contributed 10.000 dollars and formed the budget for his first movie which made Romero world famous. George A. Romero cast an African-American Duane Jones, unusual by the time.When Romero directed this claustrophobic picture , he gave birth to the modern Zombie genre and the film has had a lasting importance, giving interesting consideration to the violence executed by the zombies. It was initially dismissed as exploitation, but when was re-released , it struck deeply with a disillusioned youth angry with the desperation about Vietnam. It was one of the first successful independent terror productions influencing and inspiring countless imitations, copies and rip-offs. Followed by three equally cellebrated sequels, ¨Dawn of the dead(78)¨where the zombies attack a shopping mall ,¨Day of the dead dead(85)¨ about flesh-eating zombies taking over the world and scientific experimenting on zombies and ¨Land of dead(2005)¨ with high budget played by Simon Baker,Asia Argento and Dennis Hooper. And also an inferior remake in 1990 by Tom Savini with Tone Todd(Duane Jones's role) in which again a bunch of people are pursued by ghouls Zombies .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this old classic movie so much. It is very much fiction but it also has a lot realism to it. One happy, or not so happy, day a brother and sister visit a grave and after a confrontation as a joke running seems to be the only option. Barbara goes into shock when she is in the farm house and I don't blame her. Who wouldn't be freaked out after a zombie eats a loved one or a loved one turns into a zombie to eat you. The cellar seems like a good place to hide but guess who is down there. There is no place to hide from the zombies or the police. I was really cheering for Ben because he was such a smart guy. I thought the ending reminded me of the near end of "Cabin Fever." I would have changed the ending but I did like movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen many modern horror films like Resident Evil and 28 days/weeks later, The Night of the Living Dead doesn't feel that much of a horror film, nevertheless, it's creepy at times and takes many unexpected turns.I watched the color version and I guess the color takes away some of the effect black and white has on films like this one, but still, the color quality was horrible by today's standards which gave the film some extra creepiness in a way.If you've seen one or few of the aforementioned modern horror films, you'll notice several similarities in The Night of the Living Dead, but the absence of special effects makes it all much more real.There are a few obvious mistakes in the filming, but aside from them, this is it's very well made low budget film with a solid plot which inspired the rest of the "dead" series and probably many others.</fullReview>

The 1968 movie is a classic with better performances and shots.The plot of the movie is about how dead people recover life like zombies and go after the human beings to kill and eat them. the movie show us a group of people who try to survive in a house in the country close to a cemetery from the attacks of the zombies, while they listen the news about what is going on in other places about this situation.This is a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero's 1968 cult classic 'Night of the Living Dead' could arguably be one of the most revolutionary horror films of its time. It may not have been the first zombie film ever made but it's the first one that actually made an impact on popular culture. On the surface, 'Night of the Living Dead' seems to be a run of the mill horror movie about a group of people hiding out in a farmhouse from these flesh eating beings that have been reanimated from the dead. What's so interesting about this film is its many satirical comments on American culture during the the late 1960's - criticizing society for its racism, its involvement in the Vietnam war, and a general attitude towards women.George A. Romero chose Duane Jones to play the African- American hero of the film, which up until then was rarely heard of, only to have him gunned down in the very end of the film just as he thinks he is finally saved and everything will return to normal. It's supposed to remind the viewer of all the powerful black males in history that have stood up to their oppressors and revolted against the norms of society only to be assassinated by those who did not agree with their views and beliefs.The zombies in the film are playing the same role the Vietnamese played in the Vietnam war. They seem to be everywhere and stop at nothing to take over everything in their path. The few humans that are left and trying to survive are the soldiers who were over in Vietnam during the war: they're trapped, they have little resources and have nowhere to run because the enemy they are running from are covering the entire area.The women in this film are treated as fragile and useless in the situation they are facing. Barbra, portrayed brilliantly by Judith O'Dea begins the film terrified and running from the zombies, only to continue throughout the film helping out in no way possible. She sits on the couch in shock and rarely responds or has any input to the storyline. The only time she ever gets up and takes action is at the end - at which point she is absolutely no help, getting herself taken away (and presumably eaten). Portraying Barbra as silent and unable to help because of her mental state of shock only pointed out how America at the time (and to an extent still does) treat its women as helpless and powerless.What is so appealing about this film is its ability to have all of these powerful, underlying themes while simultaneously coming off as a meaningless Friday night "Let's go to the drive-in!" B-horror movies of the 1960's. It has the ability to let you just sit down and enjoy it without having to think too heavily about its themes and context. It's a film that can be enjoyed and appreciated by both the brainless teenagers of America and the most analytical of film critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It scared the living daylights out of me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I was about 8 years old when I saw Night of the Living Dead for the first time and it scared me so bad of dead people up until 1998 when my father died. By the way, I am 44 years old. I have seen many horror flicks but this one takes the cake. I refuse, even to this day will not watch this movie. In my mind, I feel that this movie should have won an Oscar, because it was so horrifying. I have yet to see another horror movie since then that scarred me so bad. If you stop and think about it, horror films to this day do not have the impact that Night of the Living Dead did. There have been so many movies trying to follow in the footsteps of Night of the Living Dead, but they did not even come close. This is the scariest movie that I have ever seen. My Mom and Dad always told me that "it's not the dead ones that can hurt you, watch out for the live ones." All I can say is if you don't want to have a nights sleep, don't watch Night of the Living Dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A model for living!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I consider this movie to be one of the most important horror films in the entire history of horror films. It changed the way horror movies were made and while zombies had appeared in movies before, it would re-define the zombie sub-genre of horror forever.You take a group of people who are just regular everyday kind of people, people anybody can identify with and put them together in an abandoned farmhouse during a crisis. You provide them with every tool necessary to survive and then spend 90 minutes watching as adults demonstrate that William Golding was on target in this adult look at the Lord of the Flies.The stark contrasts of black and white only make this film better and you should avoid watching any colorized version of this film. It needs to be seen in black and white. In spite of it's low-budget origins, the movie shows a really talent with lighting effects and demonstrates what can happen when extremely creative people work within the limitations of low-budget film-making.While there might be flesh-eating zombies lurking on their doorstep, the real enemy facing the people trapped in this farmhouse are themselves. Their personal prejudices, cultures and attitudes become their greatest adversaries and instead of coming together to fight a common enemy, they get torn further apart as they struggle for their own power and identity.In Night of the Living Dead George Romero hold up a mirror for us to gaze into the reflection of our own dark souls and it's not a pretty sight.One final note. While I'm a big fan of MST3K, Mike Nelson's riff on the film is just a cheap shot and while funny at times, distracts from the beauty of this classic on the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horror film that started a new generation of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let it be understood, I am no fan of the gory films produced today. That being said, I must say I am a huge fan of this one. I first saw this movie upon its initial release and during a midnight Hallowe'en showing at our local theater. The place was packed full of teens just out of a football game, and in the first couple minutes they were all yelling and making fun of the opening. Then -- Wham! The first killing shocked the entire audience into silence, and kept them screaming in their seats throughout the remainder of the film. George Romero's lack of funds to make this a big budget film only served him well. It plays like a documentary, and that is what makes this film so wonderfully frightening. The dead come to life (never mind the explanation of how, as it doesn't really matter) and become ghouls preying upon the flesh of the living. Only a trauma to the head will stop their desire for human food. Commendable for allowing a black man to be the lead heroic character, and Duane Jones is perfect in his tragic role. A movie about survival, emotional bonding/dis-bonding, and human values. The gore is proper without being overdone. Tame by today's standards, and that's too bad. Look at this film and you'll long for Romero to go back to what made him famous -- terror and gore and human plight in doses justenough to keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

But this was even better than the sequel!I would like to attack one thing: The horror clichés. Well, it's not necessarily a cliché since this was made in 1968 but I couldn't help laugh at them throughout the movie. I wasn't mad but it was a hard time to make myself think these clichés aren't clichés in the past.I was surprised that I was actually in suspense because, yes, it was an old movie. I like the use of the score to make us scared or in tension. I liked the acting by Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea.If you're a horror movie buff, there is no reason not to see this movie.

		<fullReview>George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968) is the first part of his Trilogy of the Dead (nowadays tetralogy because of the releasing of Land of the Dead(2005)) which raised unknown, underground "zombie" genre, into publics knowledge.In Night bizarre radiation from a space satellite turns some dead bodies into living dead (I thinks this is how it is because the true reason of the awakening is never to be known). Soon the zombies claim their first victims and thus the horrific plaque begins to spread.Through some series of events the main characters Ben (Duane Jones) and Barbra (Judith O'Dea) end up into a semi-big wooden house with Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley), where they try to survive from the hands of the zombie hordes.For being a black-and-white, low budget film, Night is surprisingly well filmed and full of horror feeling. Lack of colors has been replaced with awesome use of light and shadows. The use of the camera is as professional as in an average Hollywood film at that time.The music of the film is rather simple yet very effective. Night deserves an eight because of it's preservation through times. It can still give you the thrilling feeling of watching horror films. This old school horror classic should not be missed by any horror fan.Watch this one alone in an empty, dark house.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead was and always will be one of the greatest and most influential horror films of all time. When I first saw this at age 14, I was struck by it. The last half-hour had me on the edge of my chair. The look, acting, and overall atmosphere of the film combine to make one viewing experience you will never forget! From the first glimpse of Johnny and Barbra's car going up the road to the picture of the fire at the end, the viewer will be spellbound. Believe me, this horror film WILL NOT disappoint even the most modernist horror film fan. Every horror fan should own this film and every person interested in old movies should also take a look. I would like to praise George Romero again and again for making one of the finest horror films the world has ever seen. The sequel, Dawn of the Dead, is also excellent. But this is one of the finest films of our time.Absolutely, Positively Wonderful. A++++++++++++++++++++</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead is perhaps Romero's best film. Everything is so carefully planned out, so you feel you're actually witnessing what these people are going through. What makes it great is the internal struggles of the house. Romero made me feel like the zombies outside weren't the only monsters, but also the ongoing power struggle between Ben and Cooper. Romero expresses his distaste of black oppression through this film by making Ben the leader of the house, and showing that Cooper was wrong about Ben just like America was wrong about the African Americans. Night of the Living Dead may look like just a scary movie, but it also has a deep message, which allows us to see the movie in a whole different way.</fullReview>

But I do also think that the film is very scary and very intense.Barbara and her brother, Johnny, are going to a graveyard to mourn the loss of their mother. A few minutes after they get there, they are attacked by what looks like a an escaped mental patient. He kills Johnny and chases after Barbara. She runs away and finds that there seems to be a lot of escaped mental patients all over the place. She gets to an abandoned farmhouse where she soon meets a man who seems to know something about what is happening. When they tell each other what happened and turn on the radio, they are horrified to learn that the escaped mental patients are not mental patients, but are in fact dead bodies that have risen from there graves and have been cannibalizing people who are alive. Things are made worse when it is discovered that it isn't just them two in the farmhouse.I find this film scary because of the grainy realistic feel of the film. It was cheaply made, with no color and no real talent, but it remains scary to this day.Many people have criticized this film for its very graphic and sickening violence, but that gross violence enhances the film rather than become a distraction.Funny thing about this movie is that it was horror Meister George A. Romero's first film. When it was released in 1968, it was not critically acclaimed. In fact it was shunned buy mostly everybody who watched it. Since them it has become a legendary horror film, and one of the most potent and interesting to this day.contains zombie violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Progressive Film-making For 1968</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead is different in every way from any movie of its kind up until its release in 1968. For example, its cinematography is gritty, blunt, and brassy, with brutal closeups, truly lurid imagery, and inspired use of hand-held camera-work that sends you head on to the edge of your seat. Another example is how its characters are in no way horror film stereotypes. Aside from its hero being a mild-mannered, confident, and dignified black man, which was a bit bold of George Romero in the '60s, especially in making a low-budget independent debut, all of its characters are their own beasts. They are down to earth, with very human flaws and realistic emotional responses to everything.I don't consider this film to be very scary, though. Yes, it has a very creepy atmosphere, great suspense, and two jarringly wicked scenes of violence. It has a perfect setting for a movie about being trapped by surrounding zombies, a crumbling old house amidst a long field and a graveyard in the country. However, despite its ranking as one of the most popular movies of the horror genre, it doesn't afford the luxuries of an ideally scary film, such as being kept up at night, your dreams being affected, its weight on your mind for the next couple of days, having a strange feeling of not wanting to be alone at night, your nerves being on end, etc.Romero, however, delivers a great, infinitely inventive movie. At its core, the plot basically consists of debating on a decision between staying upstairs in a house or going down into the cellar. I mean, come on. What formula could that possibly be following? Its back-story is told in a very very clever fashion, as the hero rapidly goes through the house securing the windows and doors and preparing weapons and building fires whilst we hear the radio in the background with an announcer informing us of the epidemic and what places have been overtaken by mysterious stoic killers and how their victims have risen and begun killing as well, and we as the audience put the pieces together. In this review, I've given just a few reasons why I think this film is so well-written and well-directed. Granted, you will never see any of the actors doing much else, and thankfully so on account of their incredibly campy performances, save for Duane Jones, who plays the hero, Marilyn Eastman, who plays the humble but sneering wife of the egotistical family man who constantly fights Jones, and the earthy, laid-back man who leads the posse. It's a low-budget film, though, but it's very original and spawned many lesser clones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as great as Dawn, but still a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who even has a passing familiarity with the horror film genre needs no plot outline of this classic minimalistic horror film, but I'll give you one for completest sake. A group of strangers take shelter in an isolated farmhouse, as the long deceased inexplicably rise from the grave and hunger for human flesh. That's in it a nutshell. Director Romero shows he knows how to use sheer tension and good tight dialog to invoke an overwhelming sense of dread. True this isn't his best film (that would be the amazing Dawn?, but it did pave the way and to simply overlook that would be a great disservice indeed. A classic no matter how you slice it.My Grade: B+ Elite's Millennium Edition DVD Extras: Commentary with George Romero, Karl Hardman, John Russo, &amp; Marilyn Eastman; "Zombie" commentary with Bill Hinzman, Keith Wayne, Russell Streiner, Judith O'Dea, Kyra Schon &amp; Vince Surviski; Original Script / Threatment; Scrapbooks of Marilyn Eastman and Vince Survinski; 8 &amp; a half minute "Night of the Living Bread" parody; Sound interview with Duane Jones; Interview with Judith Ridley; text article on Romero's company; 5 minutes of Romeo's film "There's Always Vanilla"; Poster/lobby cards from "There's Always Vanilla"; Trailer; and TV spot</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is NOT the version to get...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be a little fad these days where people will add "new and improved" footage to old films. Understand - if footage that was originally shot but not included in the theatrical release were added to a "special edition", that would be one thing - but the NOTLD 30th anniversary actually shot NEW footage! The "new" scenes do NOT really match the rest of the movie - they include new characters that no fan of this movie could possibly care about (including the bald priest with a 1990's goatee (even though it's supposed to still be 1968!) and a few people who are burying a corpse (I believe played by an actor who portrayed the first zombie or "ghoul" in the original film). The soundtrack of the "special" cut has been changed - the excuse being that they "couldn't afford the kind of soundtrack they wanted, so they had to settle for a "canned" track.". Top it all off with an idiotic speech made by the "priest" (who sounds more Pentacostal than Roman Catholic) who was apparently the only person to survive a zombie bite and you have, as the comic book store owner on the Simpsons would say, the "Worst Version EVER!". Of course, the original version is also on the disc, but I believe some small parts have been cut from that (for what reason I have no idea), and the image quality is inferior to the Elite version DVD (or the latest Elite Millenium Edition release of this film, which includes even more special features than the original Elite 1998 DVD release.). Avoid this version and get the Elite version!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern horror classic. Essential viewing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero has made himself a place in cinema history with the stone cold classic 'Night Of The Living Dead'. Along with Herk Harvey's equally essential 'Carnival Of Souls', this is imaginative shoestring budget film making at its best. In a time where big budgets and special effects dominate science fiction and horror, this is still a fantastic example of what's REALLY important - original ideas, believable characters and buckets of suspense. Other movies have given us more gore since (Argento, Fulci, Savini, even Romero himself), but few have topped in it sheer chills and thrills.Believe the hype - this IS a masterpiece. One of the most important and influential horror movies ever made. But this is no dry history lesson that should be viewed by newcomers like it is homework. It's still powerful, effective, thought provoking, and most of all, fantastically entertaining. If you haven't seen 'Night Of The Living Dead' before you are in for a hell of an experience! You must see this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply a one of a kind classic and the best horror movie ever made. Filming in black and white, while solely a budget decision, proved to be one of the most powerful attributes of the movie. I don't know if it would have worked as well as it did if it was in color. The 1990 color version was ok, but nothing compared to the original. An all consuming sense of fear, hopelessness and despair prevail throughout the film and as strong as the shock value is and as convincing as the "living dead" were, the atmosphere created by the black and white filming was what stamped this as a classic. I first saw this when I was 10 and to this day, cannot sit still for the opening credits because of the ominous theme music. As soon as you hear it you say to yourself, "oh yeah, somethings not right here". A classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While possibly not in tune with the tastes of the gore-hungry horror fan masses (I remember finding it boring when I was a kid), there is no denying the impact of Night of the Living Dead, or its influence on virtually all the horror films that came after.By all accounts, this should be a silly movie. The budget was microscopic, the zombies mostly friends of George Romero on their lunch breaks, the set a house, actors whose names, if remembered at all, would be remembered by horror film completists for their participation in this film. Yet it all gels, and by the end of the movie, its nihilism is strongly unsettling.There's not much in the way of plot, or action really, but the slow-paced zombies whittle away the survivors one by one by one. #2 all-time on my list of horror films (after the Texas Chain Saw Massacre); Dawn of the Dead did not disappoint (#7), Day of the Dead very much did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most everyone who posts about this film has seen it before, probably on numerous occasions. Maybe it isn't quite as scary now as it was on its release in 1968 when it caught everyone by surprise. The commercials for it at that time looked pretty intense, so anyone who did go see it on its original theatrical release got pretty much what they deserved. At the time there was simply nothing to compare with it. It's relentlessness never let up for even one moment. Even now, watching it and knowing everything that's coming, those first fifteen minutes as Barbra escapes into the farmhouse are some of the most effective horror minutes ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superlative in its direction and the ability it has to work to its premise given the minimal budget; Romero's film is a taut, engaging and groundbreaking slice of cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's safe to say that Night of the Living Dead now has a certain status which sees it stand alongside other such film canon entries which double up as legendary pictures of the genre. It's a status that sees it nicely slot in with the likes of Hitchcock's Psycho; Carpenter's Halloween and the original Nosferatu as additions to a genre which arrived with a bit of a bang and have seemingly been inspiring film-makers as well as fascinating those that study the subject alike, ever since. Towards the end of Romero's 1968 picture, you can quite literally see both the very fabrics and the core conventions of a sub-genre being born; you quite literally observe the very ideas and traits many films since have been inspired by and taken inspiration from, like the three mentioned examples and a range of others in the genre's canon, the mannerisms and aesthetics which were being explored for the first time appear to have gone on to inspire and influence. Contextualised, the film is beyond ranking or rating; the final thirty or so minutes not only stares into the abyss, it ventures beyond the damn thing and into a whole new realm of both genre reinvention and guerrilla movement film-making.To a modern audience, the film's premise sounds old hat but here explored within this particular field for what appears to be for the first time and here done with wonderful invention and execution. The film will open with a car speeding along an isolated country road to some foreboding music, that sense of them trying to escape or get away from something feeling prominent, before the two of them in Barbra (O'Dea) and her brother Johnny arrive at a graveyard to pay tribute to a deceased family member. The editing is slow, deliberate and shows things such as a car driving for extended periods; Johnny even hears something on the radio which cuts out or judders but dismisses it quickly so we too write it off as nothing specific. The film goes to some lengths to detail Johnny as the sort of person he, with his sister defensive in the background as she gets on with what's to be done, whereas the dialogue is non-specific to any kind of plot. We get the feeling the two of them are quite rich, what with their clothing; new car and fact they've driven so far for something according to some as so minor.It's here Romero pulls the first of a few rugs out from beneath us, an attacker in the cemetery killing the character, in Johnny, we came to learn the most about during these early exchanges, while Barbra escapes via the car to some chaotic editing thus completely upsetting the balance from what came before. The terror and immediacy of the situation is emphasised when she arrives at a local farm house, the emphasis on the anonymity of the character when compared to Johnny doubles up with the ambiguity and mystery surrounding precisely why the attacker did what he did and what the creatures outside approaching desire, as well as where she goes from this point. Barbra is saved before effectively being pushed back to a mere supporting role following the arrival of a young coloured gentleman in Ben (Jones), whose presence then reveals a family of three hiding out in the basement with two others whom are a couple. Here begins a somewhat terrifying hour and a half upon which many have fraught to follow; an historical piece doubling up as a fascinating piece of drama during which we will become involved and engrossed.Ben is perhaps the closest thing we have to a lead, a man of most probably quite humble backgrounds appearing as the sharpest; smartest; most heroic and most logical individual within the premises of the farm house. His ability to adapt to the situation in the manner he does, put across via his reaction to the deceased farm house owner in comparison to that of Barbra's as well as his fortifying of the house proper highlights an extension in power of a previously marginalised minority over that of the richer, more upper-class white individual incarnated within the character of Barbra. The holing up is not without interior incident, father and husband Harry (Hardman) believes the basement is the perfect place for waiting out the strange goings-on whereas Ben believes being on ground level with exits and room to move works better. Romero goes to great length to show the boarding up, nailing up and fortifying of the house; the extended sequence of this as well as the arguing between what is the best course of action essentially a listing of various "zombie" sub-genre conventions quite literally being announced and embedded into film form in list fashion.Historically as well as a gripping piece of drama, it is quite stunning. Romero etches out as much tension as is possible, the film dismissive of any kind of formula in one sense because it is composing the formula in front of our very eyes. Its ability to spread focus and attention on each character inside of the house as well as those on the outside trying to react to the situation instills a greater extent of chilling reality come the finale. Romero's film features several sequences of the characters gathered around an in house television during which the fictional anchorman distributes information regarding the creatures therein now effectively serving as the basic pieces of knowledge regarding zombies that audiences have taken to every single film of this ilk ever since. In this regard, as well as many others, the film is amongst one of the best; most terrifying; most immersive and most important ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turning Tables on Race, Horror, and Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead (1968)Breakthrough film, low budget but high styleThis is a great, creaky horror film, with shades of 1920s expressionism and 1960s hip/underground counterculture. It is really nutty and crude and grotesque, but brilliant and scary, too. There's no question that it's rawness makes it seem like our own home movie, and so our own reality. It's not just a Hollywood trick to have zombies breaking down your door.The fact that the main character and most sane person is African-American is no small thing. Not only does this logically pull from the Haitian roots of zombi-ism, but it breaks barriers of basic interpersonal racial hierarchies. That is, the movies, lagging behind much of real life, had rarely played the black male in a lead role with such honest lack of self-consciousness before--maybe ever. I'd have to wrack my brain to see what other films are contenders, and I don't mean to dis the great contribution of Paul Robeson, Sidney Poitier, and others (which includes a number from the 1960s), but Night of the Living Dead is at least a contender in adding to a normalcy for the next generation, a seemingly more liberal and "enlightened" society of young people who are now, thankfully, the norm. Look who's president.What makes the movie important beyond this, in terms of movie-making, is that it fits in with a broader trend to a naturalism in the details, that now-famous shift in the late 1960s to filming with less polish and more everyday believability. I just watched MASH (1970) and was surprised to see it there--you forget how movies from the early/mid 1960s, even great ones about middle class people like The Apartment (1960) and Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961) or even The Odd Couple (1968) are stylized and "perfect" in some controlled (and brilliant) way. I like those kinds of movies, sometimes prefer them very much, but I see the penetration of this other kind of home-movie no-nonsense truth. And so do other people. Night of the Living Dead is the highest grossing film of 1968.You do wonder why our hero doesn't just call for help at the end. He is too smart to just get shot, but once that happens, the film does something conspicuous--it turns to still frames in a newspaper kind of texture, as if we are seeing documentary photojournalism in print. This adds to a kind of realism and finality, but it also reminds us of African-American victims of violence in the 1960s, seen this same way in the news. The fact that the white authorities are typical rural guys of the time, rednecks in some stereotyped way, and that they casually kill this black man, takes on significance.Not that the zombies are real, or that the acting is consistent (it sometimes is stellar). But as a style, you enter the film with different eyes, and different--not lower--expectations. Like watching a silent film, or Star Wars, or any variety of movie, you learn how to watch it right away, and adapt to its rules. The world within this film is bizarre and gripping and fabulous, in every sense of the words. Director Romero puts it together with such intuitive artfulness, you accept all its foibles as necessary to the end. Don't expect The Shining or Frankenstein or any alternative horror flick, and take its odd genius for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine that it's 1968 now. What would be the most horrible and gruesome movie you've ever seen? "Dracula" starring Christopher Lee? With at least one deciliter of blood visible in the entire film? Maybe. Add some guts here and there, an unimaginable amount of claustrophobic suppression and break the taboos of the time (eg. matricide and cannibalism, which were considered unacceptable at the time), and voil?, here we have "Night of the Living Dead".I understand that most critics were not exactly infatuated by the graphic special effects back in the day, but the real horror of the film lies deep between the lines. The surviving people, as in all Romero's movies, have trouble getting along with each other in a critical situation, once again proving that man's worst enemy is man himself.Although the movie was made in black-and-white due to the tight budget, it is actually a benefit, as it adds to the atmosphere even more. The music score is also very thrilling. The top advantages of the movie is the continuous feel of being trapped in a narrowing space and the growing tension between the characters, which sets the film apart from many of its contemporaries.All in all, a very touching horror film, not only due to its then-unmatched gore, but because of the criticism of society and human nature in it. All these visions were brought even further on the follow-up, "Dawn of the Dead", which to me stands as Romero's best and also the ultimate horror film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest movie ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes this movie work so well is that it relies on real scary creatures, eerie direction and great use of black and white film while later versions relied on gory special effect body mutilations. The movie starts right out with a funeral in a grave yard. A man and his sister are visiting their mother's grave and the woman is quite unnerved about being in the graveyard. The man starts to play on her uneasiness saying things like "Barbara, they're coming to get you Barbara." Suddenly up walks a kind of frightening man and her brother than says "here comes one of them now." We the audience still think nothing of it and the brother is still laughing and taunting his sister, when the strange man gets real close and then just starts attacking the brother. We experience real horror as we realize that it is not really a scarry looking man but a kind of zombie. After quickly dispatching her brother, the zombie starts to chase the already shaken Barbara. What follows is a very tense, well directed chase. Barbara somehow gets away from the man/zombie and makes it to a house. In the house she meets a few people that have taken refuge from the apparent army of zombies that are now walking around the area trying to kill anyone they see.We then meet the real star of the movie, a black man who serves as the "sane" leader of the refugees giving them direction on how to fortify the house against the attacking zombies.What follows are many tense moments inside the house as the people argue about what they need to do to survive. Don't watch this movie at home alone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good, atmospheric zombie horror from the late '60s, the first in George Romero's famous "living dead" trilogy. The movie benefits from its simple, straightforward plot and Romero's direction. Good acting for this type of film, well-developed characters, and an eerie feeling throughout. It's very dated, however, and probably wouldn't scare an 8 year old today. "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is scarier than this, so don't expect any nightmares. And gore hounds, this also isn't for you. It may have been controversial and shocking in the '60s, but this movie wouldn't warrant anything more than a PG-13 today, and even that's stretching it. Nevertheless, it's always worth a look. One of the true horror classics that will always endure thanks to it's great plot and great atmosphere. Check it out.</fullReview>

Romero somehow kept the indoor scenes interesting though there isn't really much happening. Just people bickering. Although the ending is kind of a shocker, it was in fact kind of appropriate to indicate the madness. I wasn't too happy about it upon seeing it though. This movie was really influential, but the only zombie movie that could really achieve this level was the follow-up "Dawn Of The Dead". All the rest just has that feel that it would never exist without Romero, and that it has its best visual ideas from this one. I could call it a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This great word of mouth horror flick kick started a career for writer/director George A. Romero. Shot crudely in black and white, with the impression the budget was not much more than a shoe string. Quickly this film reached cult following and is a great movie to watch in a party gathering. One third of the east coast is terrorized by the recently deceased and these slow stumbling zombies crave human flesh. The earliest form of defense is to shoot and then burn. After all; bras, draft cards, flags...almost everything was targets of the torch in the late 60s. A group of people think that they have found safety in a farm house near a cemetery. Hammers, nails, shotguns, kerosene and fruit jar cocktails barely slows down the ghoulish carnage.Playing in this underestimated classic are: Duane Jones, Keith Wayne, Judith Ridley, Marilyn Eastman and Judith O'Dea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen "Night of the Living Dead" a couple of times by now and I believe that this movie, historically important as it - undoubtedly - is, doesn't hold up very well. Two major reasons:1) It's technically dated. While the b/w cinematography is excellent and the zombies look quite convincing, the "nervous" editing style often looks clumsy and inept.2) There are some huge lulls. All those radio and TV bulletins, which are supposed to be "enlightening" and explain what's going on, actually interrupt the action boringly. Watching the heroes watching TV for about 10 minutes isn't that interesting.There are some chilling moments in this film, and the pessimistic finale is ironic and brilliant, but the film as a whole just isn't as effective as it (probably) was during its first release. Another person here mentioned that it's also kind of a homage to "The Birds". I agree, but even with a higher budget, this film would still be far inferior to that amazing Hitchcock classic.</fullReview>

It's a low budget shocker dealing with the dead coming back to life to roam the countryside as cannibalistic zombies. When it was released it was considered the most shocking horror movie ever made, the cutting edge of bad taste and gore. It may be tame by today's horror movie standards, but it's still fun and paved the way for a host of sequels, zombie films, remakes and pale imitations. The grainy black and white photography gives a documentary feel to the film. Romero made three sequels: Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, and recently Land of the Dead. None of them are as good as this first film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE movie which invented the modern gut-munching zombie genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those all-time classic horror movies, enjoyed by generation after generation and extremely notorious for being graphic and frightening, just like THE EXORCIST and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's also one of the films responsible for ushering in a whole new wave of horror in the 197's (for good or bad), where the emphasis was on gore and realism instead of the Gothic fantasy tales produced in the '60s by Corman and Hammer.It's amazing, really, that a film made on an extremely low budget (with locals as extras) and basically set in just one location can have such an excellent reputation. The reason this film works is that everything is perfect: the scares, the acting, the camera-work, the makeup. The black and white photography is a virtue in this case; instead of dating the film (keep your distance from any suspicious colourised versions you see floating around) it emphasises the fear of the unknown, the fact that in the shadows something horrible could be waiting to pounce.The opening of the film sets the scene admirably and is the creepiest part. After a bit of dialogue between a brother and sister in a cemetery (including the infamous line "I'm coming to get you, Barbara!"), we see a man stumbling across the graves in the distance, quiet, slowly closing in. This is our first sighting of a zombie and remains one of the most subtle and chilling moments in the history of the genre.Of course, with a film of this status, there have got to be flaws, one being the character of Barbara, who is quite simply an idiot. She doesn't help, she looks stupid, and she acts badly with it. Frankly I could have done without her character completely, she adds nothing to the film, does nothing apart from sit around and be simple. Thankfully this atrocity is countered by Duane Jones, who plays the hero of the piece; he's believable and one of those characters you really feel you can turn to and rely on in moments of need. Karl Hardman makes a good and slimy antagonist, and the rest of the cast all do well, considering the fact that they were amateurs.As well as the gently creepy moments, there are plenty of sudden shocks, hands bursting through windows, a close up of a rotted face. These counter the quieter and more psychological shocks well. The way that the number of zombies outside the farmhouse gradually builds up is a gradual slide into hopelessness, portrayed very well and preparing us for the final horrific moments where the zombies invade the building. I love films with siege situations, everything from DOG DAY AFTERNOON to ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, and this is one of the very best.Although it was made in the '60s, the gore level is high for this film; today I would say it isn't suitable for the squeamish although obviously in the wake of the slasher overdrive it's not quite as shocking as it was on first release. A trowel murder is particularly nasty (and you have to admire the ingenuity of using chocolate sauce as a substitute for blood!), as are some scenes of cannibalism, which have been oft-copied. Action fans should also give this film a go, as there's plenty of shooting and Molatov cocktails being thrown around, although this film is more dialogue-concentrated than, say, DAWN OF THE DEAD. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of those rare beasts, a horror film which actually does deserve its own reputation and shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

Also it's Public Domain, so you can literally get it anywhere, I watched the colored version myself because the grainy quality of the black and white version hurt my eyes. And the quality's grainy because this had an insanely small budget, compared to other black and while movies I've seen like "Psycho" and "A Streetcar Named Desire". But it used it's small budget to it's advantage. I hope to get to the other two movies in Romero's "Dead" trilogy soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An impressive, but nonetheless flawed classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, my hat is of to George A. Romero for pulling this movie off in the first place. It is an impressive feat of filmmaking and very inspiring to indie-filmmakers everywhere. This film is also notable for basically creating what we today know as the zombie- sub genre. There are some genuine scares in this film and the make-up is top notch in most cases. I also found myself caring a lot for most of the characters (not Barbara).That being said, this movie is far from perfect. I'm very much willing to forgive and look past almost all the technical flaws in the film considering both the shoe-string budget as well as the conditions and time during which it was made. My biggest gripe with this film doesn't have anything to do with any of that though. This films biggest issue, in my opinion, is the dialogue. It's clunky and repetitive, and the film suffers greatly because of it. Some of the acting and line-delivery is pretty bad also.Over all, this film is still a must watch for any horror fan, and don't worry about it feeling dated, because it holds up surprisingly well. One last thing I have to praise in this film is the ending. It is completely unexpected and hit me pretty hard. Props for that.Night of the Living Dead is a classic that holds up surprisingly well but suffers from bad dialogue and less than stellar acting by a few of the actors. Nevertheless, I recommend this film to any and all horror fans as well as someone just looking for a good film.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking in the Zombie sub-genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been big on the zombie craze. I don't watch the Walking Dead, and as of this writing I haven't seen any of George A Romero's other zombie flicks. But Night of the Living Dead very much impressed me. A simple premise somehow able to terrify us. Barbara Blair (Judith O'Dea), and her brother Johnny Blair (Russell Streiner) are visiting their father's grave when they are attacked by a strange man (S William Heinzman). Johnny is killed but Barbara makes her way to an abandoned farm house. There she meets Ben (Duane Jones) and later the two of them meet Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen Cooper (Marilyn Eastman), and a young couple Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). As the people are revealed to be zombies and the terror continues, it puts the people in the house in a worse and worse state. In particular Ben and Cooper have been put on opposite sides of leadership. The film is scary not only for the creepy zombie effects, but for the realistic animosity inside the house, perfectly showing one of humanity's greatest flaws. The way that we see the rivalry between Ben and Cooper play out throughout the film, is very reminiscent of William Golding's Lord of the Flies. Even though it's cheap looking, they don't show it as a monster movie, they show it as a real disaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Dead Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This time I'll take on an independent classic as well as a public domain classic. Night of the Living dead is pretty good even to this day. Some of it's exploits like how people react to crises and survival is borrowed for the Walking Dead. The movie also has an interesting take on human behavior where it's basically every man for themselves.There's also some undertones about race as well with the black protagonist. It's also amazing how it was all done in black and white even though there was a option for color.The ending is also pretty chilling even for this day and age. The director was asked to have a love interest in the movie but he declined. Thought it was to Hollywood and I like how the director George Romero did his own thing with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero's cold and frightening Night of the Living Dead is one of the scariest movies that i have seen in a long time com pared to Psycho (1960), The silence of the Lambs (1991), Jaws (1975), and Alien (1979). The movie tells the story of a group of people who try their best to hide from a bunch of bloodthirsty zombies in an adandoned farmhouse. I really do like how Romero directs this movie but the casting is decent with a few over the top performances but otherwise it is still a well done horror movie. At the time this movie was released the zombies looked so realistic not only because of the makeup, it was also because the movie was shot in black and white instead of color. The movie should have gotten Oscar for the makeup for the zombies, and as well as the terrifying music score. When i saw the zombies feed on human flesh in the film thank god I didn't feel like puking because all that stuff was fake but inside we feel disgusted. Another problem that I had with the movie was the ending, but in the end it is a cult classic in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most effective, and important, horror films of the 1960's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Halloween Horror Reviews #4)This film is one of the most influential films in American cinema history, both for its massive contribution to all horror films, but its role in shaping American independent cinema also. It's honestly shocking to think of all the amazing films that wouldn't exist without this initial spark, and what a bright spark it is.More than just an important milestone, 'NotLD' remains a stellar horror film to this day. With excellent writing, a perfect atmosphere and beautiful black and white cinematography. Even now, despite the over-saturation of zombie films we have, nothing has been made which is quite like the progenitor (aside the 1990's remake). Its hopeless and desperate situation, its brief timespan (as the title suggests, only one night), and its shocking ending all remain mostly unique to this single film 46 years after its release. The film does show its age, and low budget at times. However this is only 2-3% of the time, the other 97-98% you are stuck wondering how so much timeless brilliance can be squeezed into a single (relatively short) horror film. The tight location is used to its full and that simple cabin in the woods has become the parent to all others in the many decades to follow.Overall, it's 'NotLD'. What more can you expect other than glowing praise?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"They're coming to get you, Barbra!" If you've never heard that line, there's no better time than the present! Romero has made several successful zombie films, but this black and white (although a color version exists) classic, Night of the Living Dead, was his first zombie film.Barbra and John are heading out to a cemetery to put flowers on a grave when an undead man stumbles around and attacks John. Barbra narrowly escapes to a nearby farmhouse, and finds herself in a heap of trouble. I won't give away the rest of the plot, but this nostalgic low-budget zombie thriller is DEFINITELY a movie no horror fan can afford to miss! The soundtrack is eerie and creepy, the acting amazing and the entire idea absolutely creepy. It might be a rather outdated movie compared to today's booming major-motion pictures, but there would be no zombie movies like there are today without Romero starting the line with this one.The 1997 TV movie Goosebumps: Welcome to Dead House, was heavily inspired by Night of the Living Dead.Night of the Living Dead was followed by Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been zombies movies prior to Night of the Living Dead but none of them jump started the zombie genre like George A. Romero's first zombie mega-classic. The movie starts out very somber and dark which sets the mood for the entire film. One of horror's most quoted and iconic lines "They're coming to get you Barbara" still is chilling knowing the details that soon follow. I admire Romero's balls by casting a black male, Duane Jones, as the hero and voice of reason. The arguing and bickering between the characters really illustrates the lack of hope people may face in life threatening situations. There is so many great scenes in the movie but the one that still gives me chills to this day is the mothers scream during the stabbing mania by her own daughter. As an old movie it definitely holds up today and for me has replay value since I watch it here and there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Won't Stay Dead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the first independent films ever-made. As soon as they finished cutting it in Pittsburgh, they chucked the movie in the back of a truck and drove up to New York to sell it. Also recently released in 2013 was a documentary about it I've been meaning to watch. There's such a wonderful history behind this movie. It was the first to feature "intense scenes of gore", inspirations arose from Director George A. Romero's love of the industry's "thirst of bizarre" at the time, as well as Richard Matheson's classic novel "I AM LEGEND". The house contained no running water so people would clean off in the lake nearby, and what started as a horror comedy the small film crew matured ideas as they went along. Soon wrapping up production, and alas the rest is history and the beginning of a cult phenomena.One of the first movies to break many society taboos, by casting a coloured man as a main character and hero no less. Five people are stuck in a house, where surrounding corpses have suddenly risen from the dead and began eating the living. Whilst little news can be heard from the outside world, the bodies are edging ever closer to the inside of the house and some of those still alive are not as mentally strong as others. Can these people set aside each others shortcomings, or will weakness be the downfall for all of them? It's a fantastic character study for the era, and in the final stages it just proves everyone is holding out for themselves. Everyone is diverse enough to challenge your perception of who was right, and ultimately who was wrong.From the opening credits with its eerie music and sirens already piercing your heart, the visual scenario is a normal day like any other. Obviously now thanks to the likes of Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" (1980), and Michael Haneke's "Funny Games" (1997) etc. Your average car driving down the open road scene could not be anymore sinister. To top it off in 10 minutes this idyllic countryside scenario descends into a hell so unique for its time, it has been debated whether or not the MPAA film rating system loomed large in the public eye soon after because of it. It redefined the word "Zombie", and no wonder it continues to remain an icon of pop culture. George shoots with no restrictions, and the foreboding atmosphere and stringed instrumentals build high tension that echo that of the classic universal monster features. All of which culminates in an ending still shocking and highly controversial.Final Verdict: An absolute classic that will continue to age extraordinarily. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Seminal Zombie Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's black and white, and the special effects are primitive, but this is THE seminal zombie film. Like all good horror flicks of its era, it stays compelling through suspenseful storytelling and making its viewers think they saw more gore than they actually did?although some of the cannibalism scenes were more gory than I would have expected for a film of its time.This movie, Romero's feature debut, was made in the true spirit of an independent film. The line between cast, crew, and producers was virtually non-existent, with actors serving as screenwriters, producers, stuntmen, makeup artists, electronic sound engineers, and still photographers. Romero manned the camera himself for some scenes, as well. According to IMDb, Romero borrowed the house in which most of the movie was filmed from an owner who was going to have it demolished anyway. However, the house did not have a true basement, so the basement scenes were filmed in the editing studio's cellar. Romero also borrowed the car featured in the film. To simulate blood, he used?Bosco chocolate syrup.Romero was a Carnegie-Mellon Institute graduate, and, also according to IMDb, this was the first movie filmed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pittburgh police even provided personnel and equipment. The day that the final editing and voice-over dubbing was completed in Pittsburgh, Romero and Russo put the reels into the cans, threw them into the trunk of the car, and drove straight to New York City that night in hopes of having it screen at any willing theater. However, the film's world premiere ended up taking place at the Fulton Theatre in Pittsburgh on October 1, 1968 (At 8PM, admission by invitation only). The movie was met with a standing ovation.Per IMDb, this film became one of the most successful independent films ever made, one of the last big hits of the drive-in era, and one of the first movies added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. Nonetheless, Romero saw very little profit from the film since, thanks to his lack of knowledge regarding distribution deals, the distributors walked away with practically all of the profits. Since the film makers forgot to include a then-required copyright notice in the movie, it slipped into the public domain.This flick is also a great example for discussions concerning African Americans in film. Film historian Donald Bogle believes that most black people in 20th-century American films can be classified into one of five categories: Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies, and Bucks. However, according to IMDb, the character of Ben was originally supposed to be a crude-but-resourceful truck driver, with no specification to race. After Jones, in real-life a self-serious, erudite academic, auditioned for the part, Romero re-wrote the part to fit his performance.Furthermore, the character of Ben was originally written as an angry person, and, upon receiving the role, Jones expressed concern that the character be rewritten to remove some of the anger ? such as the scene where Ben hits Barbara ? afraid of how it would be widely perceived in the United States at the time to see a black man acting in this way. The nation was plagued with high racial tensions during the late sixties, and the film was released to theaters shortly after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonetheless, Romero and most of the rest of the predominantly white crew decided against it, thinking they were being "hip" by not changing it. Years later, Romero lamented that he had not taken Jones' concerns more into consideration, and thought that he was probably correct. Romero expressed that he wishes he could speak with the late Jones again, asking him how he felt about the film's legendary status, and believes Jones would just say "Who knew?" and laugh.For my part, it was pretty cool to see a black man in a 1960s film play such a confident leadership role amongst a white cast. It seemed to me that the part of Ben could have been played by an actor of any race, as long as he was good, and Jones performed very well.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. I've heard about this movie before, but I've never seen it until I got it on a collection of zombie movies I got from Walmart. When I first started watching it, I noticed it was in black and white. I thought it was going to be a silent film, but fortunately it wasn't. In the beginning, a brother and sister a driving a car. Then, a zombie shows up. The sister is separated from her brother and is safe inside a house with a man she never met before. He uses some wood and nails to block the door and windows. In the meantime, a bunch of zombies are very slowing walking towards the house. Later, the guy figures out that the zombies are scared of fire. He sets a sofa/couch on fire to slow them down. Well anyway, I think it was a pretty good movie. It has an interesting story and good acting. If you have any free time, you should check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Start of the Modern Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of people hide from bloodthirsty ghouls in a farmhouse.As everyone in the horror community knows, this is the grand daddy of them all -- the start of the modern horror film, the first in a long line of zombie films (even if they are never called zombies here). And the introduction of George Romero, one of the all-time greatest masters of horror.I am not clear how the popularity of the film grew. Actress Kyra Schon says she was not asked to attend a horror convention until 1988 -- twenty years after the film's release -- and was even teased by her classmates. And the social commentary of having a black man as a leader was never intentional, though contributed to its significance later on.I have wondered if perhaps its falling into public domain was its greatest asset. While it may have not helped the bank accounts of those involved, it did allow the widespread use of the film, and it has been referenced in other films countless times. Has this further pushed the film into public consciousness?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly no one can call this the First Zombie Movie. They have been around at least since White Zombie (1932), I Walk with a Zombie (1943), and Plague of the Zombies (1966). But no other Walking Dead Movie made an Impact like Director George Romero's Ultra-Low-Budget Gore-A-Thon. It Refused to be Ignored and Limited to its Very Limited Release. No Distributor of Note would touch it and the Movie Barely made it to Screens. But there is the Rub. It did make it to just Enough Movie Houses to cause more than a Stir, it caused an Explosion of Raves and Outrage.The Film was Seen by enough People at Drive-Ins and Grind-Houses that it could not Possibly be Overlooked. The Movie is so Visceral, with its Documentary Feel that the Viewing Experience was Unsettling to say the Least. Anyone who saw it was Affected in some way or another. It was just Real Enough Looking to be Scary and just Amateurish Enough to let the Audience in on all the Demented Fun. Maybe.This was 1968, the Year Before the Moon Landing and if you were paying Attention, in the Background they were Blaming a Returning Space Rocket's Radiation for the Dead coming back to Life and Devouring the Living. Apollo Grandstanding be Damned. It was this sort of Subtle Underpinnings along with Grotesque Gorging, combined with Claustrophobic Conditions that made this one Helluva of a Spook Show in 1968. Beware of many Public-Domain Prints that are Really Bad Quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally Got to Watch This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say, I was expecting to be disappointed. I am by no means a fan of Zombie movies, Plus as much as this movie was hyped, how could it live up to expectations? Surprisingly, it has held up over time. The Ghouls as they are called (According to a recent interview Romero doesn't consider, Zombie to be an applicable term) are surprisingly creepy.The general plot is that for unknown reasons, The dead are walking and behaving like animals. While the movie puts forth the theory that the epidemic is being caused by an alien radiation, The actual cause of this horrific invasion are never determined. In the end, The dead are walking, Who cares why? What's most poignant about this movie is how the Ghouls compare to today's overly saturated zombie market. These Ghouls demonstrate basic problem solving skills, no emotion whatsoever, and, unprecedented for a Zombie movie, a sense of self preservation.This coupled with the notion that any and all dead will rise and attack the living, makes the Ghoulish hoard a credible threat for an unprepared populace.The weakest part is probably the human characters. While this movie is noteworthy for having a black man as the lead actor, The characters do little more than bicker over where to hide. It's the sort of problem that even for stressed people, should have been easy to fix as both points were valid. But hey, it gives us our controversy, however trivial.The ending is the part I really took issue with. And while I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it, It's one of those pointless and easily avoidable bad endings that not only does nothing for the drama, but trivializes the whole movie.Still, it's worth checking out this classic, and discovering what made the Zombie Genre what it is today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Dead is a true classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead! This movie is what could be considered the bridge between the classic horror movies and the more blood soaked modern movies; for the reasons that it's in black and white and still keeps the classic tone but at the same time adds more violence, a focus on the humans and of course the horror craze that is: The Zombie. Yes that's right for those of you that don't know, Night of the Living Dead is considered to have created the modern zombie. This movie completely shocked audiences at the time, its was unlike anything they've ever seen! Now for the review, the movie starts in a graveyard, one of the main staples of horror films, your given very little set up and then BAM! Zombies attack. Its great because it catches you off guard much like the characters in the film. Then really quickly your projected into a lone house on the plains, this is were the movie turns from good to downright masterpiece. This is when more and more characters start to be revealed, the writing of these characters is just great, sounds very much like real people talking/arguing. The movie is also a good character study showing how people's true selves are shown in a time of complete chaos. My favorite of the characters being Ben mainly because he's the only person who looks at reason. The zombies (although never called zombies) are the monsters of this movie, now compared to today's zombie they're very very different, this also goes back to the movies violence at the time it was just unrelentingly gory, now though it's very tame. Many of the scenes in this movie are iconic, from zombies just moping around to "They're coming to get you Barbra". Two more things I'm going to talk about, first being the ending. Night of the Living Dead's ending is one of the greatest movie shockers of all time, I'm not going to spoil it but it's a brilliant twist. And the final thing I'll talk about is : the movie's impact. The movie was incredibly influential again with the violence but also that it dealt with a big issue at the time, Civil Rights. The main character of this movie was a black man back in 1968 that was unheard of, but George A. Romero went ahead and made it happen. In the end Night of the Living Dead is as of now the best movie I have reviewed for The Movie Guy's Halloween Horror Movie Spectacular 2013 with it being a excellent movie with great witting, good horror and shocks, Night of the Living Dead gets a 9.6 out of 10. Pretty good for a cheap little public domain movie, and actually because its public domain you can watch it right now for free legally.

		<shortDescription>a legend with only so little</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie casted in 1968 was a movie like no other. Zombies just wandering around and attack. The budget was less than $200,000 to produce a movie. He did it and it became one of my favorite horror movies. With such a low budget this could've been a laughable cheesy comedy. The movie begins with Barbara and tom they are brother and sister. They came up to visit the graves and got there late because tom didn't wake up early enough. He messes with her saying they're coming to get you and points at a clumsy confused wanderer approaching them slowly. Barbara walks up to the man to apologize for toms immature behavior. He grabs her and cries for toms help. He fights the wanderer but tom is knocked out by hitting his head on a gravestone on the ground. Barbara runs away as fast as she can. She takes the car but couldn't find the keys and then realizes that they're in toms coat pocket. The wanderer pursues her nd Barbara hits the car into neutral rolling down a hill while steering. She crashes into a tree and runs to a house locking everything up still in fright of zombie and her brother. She meets Ben a black fellow who is very resourceful and boards up the house. He makes plans and discovers two couples and a child in the basement. One man wants to stay in the cellar with hid injured daughter and wife while the other couple choose to stay upstairs. Ben and the bald man have made many disputes about plans and stuff. The news tell people to stay indoors and the zombies will die from a gunshot to a head or fire. The zombies come from a radiated spacecraft that crashed into earth releasing radiation to bring the dead to life to feed of human flesh. The other man who looks like Matt Leblanc goes outside with Ben with his wife chasing along to fuel the car outside and get help for the others. The gas leaked onto the car and Ben's torch to avoid the zombies lights up the car with the man and wife in. They try to escape but the car explodes before they killing them. Ben retreats indoors wear the bald headed man locked behind him. The bald man stands at the cellar door staring at the door as Ben is begging to come in. Ben smashes open the door staring at the bald man in the eye and beats him up. The number of zombies increase by the hundreds. The lights go out and the zombies start to break down the barriers and Barbara and the bald mans wife to block the door while the bald man and Ben take the windows. The bald man takes the gun but aims at Ben because he feels Ben is dooming them all. The barricade at the door broke and the first zombie Barbara sees is tom and cries and stands still and dies. Ben sees the gun pointed and fights of the man and shoots him. He stumbles downstairs to his daughter and dies. The wife runs downstairs in fright to see her daughter eating her father's corpse. She cries and lets her daughter stab her to death. Ben is the only one left. The girl goes upstairs and Ben tosses her aside and travels to the cellar. He blocks the doors and is afraid. Just before the door js knocked down, daybreak hit and the zombies left. The mother zombie and father zombie were killed by Ben immediately. Ben wakes up and looks out the window and gets shot in the head mistakenly took for a zombie. The govern,ent assigned men on the streets with guns to go out and kill all the zombies they could find that was setup through the night. The end. The writing was superb and was very intense and I loved it. Watch it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A decent horror film overall, but I have to say it was a very uneven experience for me. While there are a few aspects I certainly enjoyed here, such as the effective scares, gruesome imagery and the shocking twist at the end, I thought the acting was stale at times and was pretty annoyed by the character of Helen. The film got too didactic and a bit tedious when they began to follow the announcements on TV. The explanation of the origins of the undead was very far-fetched for me and didn't really need to be here. Also, the zombies seemed to be inconsistent as some of them decide to chase people or kill them with objects when they have fresh meat to eat right beside them. Finally, I found many statements given by the characters to be quite obvious or even a bit ridiculous so that also took me out of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is where the long walk began...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...toward the contemporary zombie mythos of "The Walking Dead" and every cannibalistic living dead film in between. I first enjoyed "NotLD" on the big screen way back in the antediluvian days of college, pre- videotape/DVD/BluRay collections, pre-Internet, pre-Androids etal., when Romero's unassuming film was burning up the midnight film circuit and burrowing deep into the collective unconsciousness of horror fans and cinemaphiles everywhere. Little did I know at the time just how influential this little homegrown nightmare would prove to be, but there was no denying its raw power to shock and unsettle unsuspecting audiences, and all on a budget just somewhat above rock bottom.Imagine, if you will, several hundred Boomer college kids packed into a darkened auditorium, most of them likely intoxicated on one thing or another, all eager to see this scary movie that so far they'd only read about. They knew that Roger Ebert hated it, which only made it more alluring. They knew it pushed the boundaries of graphic depictions of murder, and that, too, made it all the more the forbidden fruit. And, perhaps most of all, they knew it wasn't a "Hollywood" movie, and that made its rising star all the brighter. Imagine now that very first viewing of that rough gem in all its lo-fi glory...Almost a half-century later, even the most forgiving retrospectives will admit to the film's flaws; only the most churlish could deny them. The acting is at times unpolished, and the make-up is simply crude by today's standards (one can only wonder how it might have looked had Tom Savini not been dragooned off to Vietnam). The camera-wrangling is well-informed, though, by Romero's prior commercial experience, eminently bolstered by darkly evocative lighting and editing; the choice to shoot in black-and-white was, of course, a financial one, but turned out to be the serendipitous one as well. I can't even conceive of this film being in color, and have steadfastly refused to ever watch the colorized version. "NotLD" remains a classic example of inspired (and inspiring) make-do indie film-making and quite rightfully deserves its many accolades and awards of honor. It's far from perfect--even the script is a let-down at times with its occasionally clunky dialog--but it hits all the right dramatic notes, tapping into a nervous zeitgeist in a way that still works in a post-9/11 world--perhaps even more so than ever.If George A. Romero &amp; Co. hadn't made "Night of the Living Dead," I have no doubt that someone else would have eventually come up with something similar. But he did, and the face of horror and indie cinema in general is all the better for it. Long live the living dead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ugly, but beautiful work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombies have become icons in the world of horror films thanks to this classic. 'Night of the Living Dead' is a classic not simply because it created new benchmarks for horror films at the time, which it did, but also because it manages to stimulate the viewer and it still does today.While it's more satirical sequel feels more grandiose in its approach, Night of the Dead feels more bare bones and simple in its approach, but with still some political undercurrents. It feels more claustrophopic and doomier and it really gives a strong sense of death near every corner. While the setting in Dawn of the Dead gave a little bit more of a sense of security for the characters, in every waking moment in Night of the Dead, there is a feeling of danger and anxiety. The great thing about this movie is that every character is in danger right from the start of the film and it builds up throughout the movie until it finally crescendoes into chaos. What really amplifies this feeling of inevitable danger is the atmosphere in the whole movie. Some hard to please movie goers may complain about its low budget feel, but having the movie in black and white is all you really need to give the film an ugly feeling of 'death in the air.' Lifeless just like the undead looking for its next meal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you survive the night?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead was released in 1968 and is George A Romero's first feature film and kind of the first 'proper' zombie film in a way. It certainly was the first to establish the tried and tested 'zombie rules' (shoot them in the head/ destroy the brain to kill them, zombies eat human flesh, if you're bitten by a zombie you become one, etc, etc). Looking at the film today with our modern eye balls, it may not seem that impressive or scary and I can imagine teenagers today shunning it out of the room with their I-pads (or whatever) because it's black and white and it's not that gory. The fact is though that this film oozes atmosphere (and other stuff) and is one of the truly great horror films of all time! As in all three of Romero's original (good) 'of-the-dead' trilogy, the characters are believable and the acting and dialogue is of a very high standard. Characters act heroically, freak out and even (in the case of Mr. Cooper) try to screw each other over during the course of the film. The story is brilliantly simple; the dead are returning to life and attacking the living. Nobody is quite sure why and it's never flat out explained what is causing this to happen (although it is hinted at in on-screen ongoing news reports). The film starts off with Barbara and her Brother Johnny driving to a grave yard in Pennsylvania to visit their father's grave to pay their respects. They spot a man staggering about and Johnny starts teasing his sister as she grows more afraid of the suspicious character. After taunting her continuously ("They're coming to get you Barbara!") the staggering stranger staggers over and attacks them killing Johnny in the struggle?which is staggering! Barbara runs, drives and runs again from the particularly persistent perished person until she reaches the relative safety of an abandoned farmhouse. By this point she's basically 'lost it' and can't really look after herself. Luckily, Ben (the 'hero' of the film) drives up to the house in a pick up truck and saves her from some straggling zombie menace! They come across a few extra survivors already, um?surviving in the house and they eventually decide to work together (after much shouting) and start to board up the windows and barricade the doors. Things seem to be going well when, of course, the inevitable happens and everything goes to hell! Ben and Tom (one of the other survivors) try to refuel the pick up truck, spill some petrol and the whole thing blows up, killing Tom! Cooper's infected daughter goes all 'zombie' and kills him and his wife stabbing them with a garden trowel (which is a little un-zombie like). Barbara -who has completely lost it by now- sees her now zombified brother in the attacking undead crowd and is distracted and confused enough to be swept away in the zombie tide and presumably munched to little black and white bits. Ben manages to flee down into the cellar, finish off the zombie Cooper family and lock himself safely inside. He emerges in the morning and (not wanting to spoil the famously bleak ending ? but doing so anyway) is mistaken for a zombie by some redneck hunters and shot in the head! To sum up then?this is a classic, important horror/ zombie movie which bravely broke certain horror traditions, like having an ending that was a bit of a downer, what with all of the main characters being killed and all. Another important aspect of this film is that the main protagonist is a black man. This might not seem like such a big deal these days, but at the time it was a positive, important step in racial equality?well?racial equality in films anyway, and I think it is to be genuinely applauded. Basically, I think everyone knows of or has seen this film (several times probably) but if for some reason you haven't?or?haven't?you definitely, um should???.so there!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Nasty After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "Night of the Living Dead" upon its release in the 60's at a packed art house near the university campus. I bumped into a female friend in the lobby. We exchanged a few words and went our separate ways into the auditorium. The next day I spoke with a mutual friend who informed me that my female friend had fled the theatre before the movie ended and had wound up at his place shaking badly and needing a drink. I just watched "Night of the Living Dead" again today and I can tell you that nothing has changed. It hasn't lost any of its impact. It's still a nasty piece of business."Night of the Living Dead" is B-movie schlock on a low budget, nothing less, nothing more, and it pulls out the standard radiation-from-space explanation for the goings-on; however, it takes a giant leap beyond its genre limitations. It sets us up with a generic story and stock characters then pulls the rug out from underneath us. The hero is not only African-American but is clearly the smartest and most capable character in the picture. Remember, this is 1968 and there are few African-American role models in mainstream American films other than Sidney Poitier. There's a social sub-text in the movie leading to an ending that should not be revealed. Horror movie endings are a touchy subject. I don't need a happy ending, but I don't want a gratuitous, gimmicky twist at the end, either. I prefer an ending that's a logical extension of the story. It can be the ultimate horror, maybe the result of a fatal warp in the protagonist's character or some overwhelming desire that blinds that person, or the ironic twist of fate that the protagonist never saw coming."Night of the Living Dead" opens in a graveyard. There's a spat between siblings, a graveside visit, some bitching about the wreath, a tasteless joke, a gaunt old man lurching toward them - and wham! The movie's got you by the throat. Ten or so minutes into the movie and either you can't leave or you want to leave really badly - the option my friend chose. This time around I understood one crucial thing. This movie means business. It's lean, mean, grim and macabre. It's not particularly gory by today's standards, but many of the images are genuinely shocking, and the panic of the opening minutes never quite subsides. George Romero made this film with a great deal of care and skill, and the results are there on the screen. The musical score, in particular, gets under your skin. The actors are very convincing, particularly the actress who plays the woman in shock. I wonder if my friend ever watched this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Much a Classic as "Casablanca" or "Gone with the Wind"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) go to their father's grave in rural Pennsylvania to pay their respects, Barbra is attacked by a zombie. In the ensuing struggle, Johnny is killed (his head bashed against the corner of a tombstone) and Barbra is chased to a nearby farm house. There she takes refuge amongst other survivors: Ben (Duane Jones), Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife Hellen (Marilyn Eastman), their injured daughter Karen (Kyra Schon), Tom (Keith Wayne) and his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley). Deeply divided over the best course for survival, they must survive both the undead onslaught and their increasingly violent natures until a rescue party arrives."Night of the Living Dead" is a classic much in the same vein as "Casablanca" (1942): so often quoted and parodied that the film may at first seem like the cliché that its mimickers created. Romero completely revolutionized the horror genre with his radical re-imagining of the zombie. No longer the soulless victim-slave of a witch doctor (as in 1932's "White Zombie" or 1943's "I Walked with a Zombie"), they are undead ghouls who without proper cause (later films will challenge the theory that radiation from Venus is the cause of the phenomenon) begin killing and consuming the living. Any recently dead person will become reanimated with murderous intent toward the living, regardless of the fact that they were once a family member or friend. Their slow, unrelenting gate gives them a sense of inevitability: you might kill or outrun one or two of them, but their swelling numbers will outlast and eventually overwhelm you.The film portrays the bleak realities of race relations in the late 1960's. Ben's plans are met by Harry's violent resistance, implicitly because he's black. Later, when Ben, as the sole survivor, finds the notably all-white rescue party, they kill him and burn him with the rest of the slain undead. It may have been an innocent mistake, but the image of an armed posse of white men killing an unarmed black man is nonetheless seared into the memory of the viewer, reminiscent of the South's violent resistance to the Civil Rights Movement's peaceful protests.Likewise, "Night of the Living Dead" also portrays the strained gender relations of the time. I won't say that the film is sexist (because I don't believe that to be the case); it does, however, portray a staunchly patriarchal world-view. Barbra, after viewing the death of her brother, essentially becomes a zombie herself. Clearly suffering from intense shock, she becomes practically comatose, incapable of assisting anybody in the slightest (and, more often than not, getting in the way). Harry presents himself as the tyrannical head of his family. He keeps his wife in the dark concerning the latest life-altering events (literally, she's kept in the basement while the best course of action is debated by the men upstairs) and even attempts to stretch his influence to the other women. Notably, he treats Barbra like a child that needs looking after and Judy like she's Tom's to order around.Like "Nosferatu" (1922), "Night of the Living Dead" is more unsettling and chilling than it is frightening (at least to the contemporary viewer). There are no "jump out at you" shocks or outright scares, but a slowly intensifying suspense that very much resembles the undead themselves. The scene in which the zombies get a hold of the incinerated Tom and Judy, savoring the chunks of their ripped-apart flesh, is easily the most unnerving of the film (and, perhaps, of the genre). Like Jacques Tourneur, Romero wields his films' dark atmosphere as a weapon, one infinitely more effective than simple shock-and-awe scare tactics.The only detriment to this film is the character of Barbra. I can understand wanting to show a "shell-shocked" victim in what is a clear parallel to the Vietnam War (essentially bringing the horrors of the war home to the American public), the end result is an absolute mess. Her every line infuriatingly fails at anything even closely resembling a realistic character. While the 1990 remake committed just as bad a mistake with their gross over-correction of her character (turning her into a caricature of Sarah Connor), Barbra is still sad excuse for a traumatized woman.This film is a must see for any of horror, especially fans of the zombie sub-genre. Likewise, those interested in the changing racial and family dynamics of the 1960's will find this an intensely symbolic film rich with coded power dynamics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like horror movies, this is where it all started</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a genius film. It can be analyzed on so many levels. It is a comment on the failure of the prevailing socio-political order at the height of the tumult of the '60s, in 1968. It is a comment on race in that the black hero of the film (Duane Jones as Ben) fends off death, only to ultimately succumb to an ignorant mob of white men in a truly pointless death. Via the character of traditional Harry (Karl Hardman), we see the passive approach toward change-hide in the cellar and hope that one survives. This might be analogized to many in the United States at the time who resisted change and tried to ignore it and hoped that they might weather the storm as they were. This is in bold contrast to the character of Duane whose resourcefulness and hard work engages the zombies, come what may. This might be analogized as the youth, as minorities, as folks who wanted to see a new way of doing things and would push to secure it.The film itself is quite spare in its style, which to me makes it quite ripe for metaphor and interpretation. One can see, in the vivid, sharply-drawn characters, the outlines of prevailing schools of thought driving the coruscating changes of the '60s.The story of the film is that a group of people find themselves trapped in a home with zombies zeroing in on them. They are stuck in the house and are trying to survive the attack of the relentless flesh-eaters. The group is composed of a family- which lives there and whose daughter Karen (Kyra Schon) has already been bitten by the zombies. They, including the old-fashioned Harry and his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman), with whom he is feuding, are in the cellar. A young man named Tom and his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley) who are a bit more forward-looking have also taken refuge in the house although they are a bit more willing to join Duane upstairs in taking on the zombies directly. The decisions they make about where they will take their stand will determine whether they will defeat the zombies or not.The film was heavily criticized when it was released for some of the imagery which was quite gruesome. In watching it now, it retains the ability to shock, and the matter-of-fact way in which the zombies continue to attack, not in a graphic way, but simply unrelentingly, gives the film the continued ability to scare. As noted, I found the film quite acidic in its commentary on Vietnam, on race riots, on changes in demographics and on a country in flux, but if you just want to watch it simply for a good scare, it would work that way also. Director George Romero has conjured up a compelling story onto which one can attach all sort of meaning and the cast, most especially lead actor Duane give great performances. There are some very scary moments in the film and its importance, as a pioneering horror film was recognized several years ago when the Library of Congress accorded it protection as a work of enduring value. It's not hard to see why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Film Ever Made!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 60s was a prime time for innovations in horror/thrillers. Right at the beginning, Hitchcock released PSYCHO. A few years later, he'd do it again with THE BIRDS. In 1966/67, CARNIVAL OF SOULS was released and proved that a low-budget horror film could be successful. In 68, Roman Polanski released ROSEMARY'S BABY. In between, there were countless others that pushed the envelope and shaped what would become the modern horror/thriller. But NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is the definitive one. Eschewing the need for stars, big-budget special effects, and color footage (not by choice, but due to budget constraints), Romero and his team set out to tell the most terrifying tale ever imagined. By now everyone knows the story, so here's the overview: Seven survivors wind up trapped inside a farmhouse as ravenous, undead hordes gather outside and attack them. In terms of on-screen violence, this movie was quite shocking for its time. We get blood dripping down walls, zombies eating body parts, half-rotting corpses, and excellent zombie make-up. The acting is good from all cast members. It's easy to identify and sympathize, but the filmmakers never make any one character out as a true villain or hero. Also, the terror doesn't always come from the zombies. In fact, Romero seems to take delight in showing us man's inhumanity to man, as one-by-one the survivors struggle against, argue with, and ultimately doom themselves. On the television and radio reports, they get assurance that help is on the way, but help might arrive too late. And ultimately, the supposed heroes/vigilantes are no better than the zombies. Taken from a socially relevant standpoint, the movie works at showing the fear, biases, and turmoils that plagued many Americans during the 60s. Vietnam was in full horrific swing, various movements and revolutions were occurring, crazed gunmen killed people from towers, and at times America was divided against itself. NOTLD works at showing all of that ugliness. Fear saturates every second of this film, and it works because true horror occurs where the tragic and terrifying meet. While nowhere near as graphic as films that would follow (including Romero's own sequels) none has quite the impact as this low-budget black &amp; white film. Which is why, in my opinion, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is the best horror film ever made!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not about zombies. It's about us.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 1960s, a 28-year old filmmaker with a small budget released a film that would alter the course of horror cinema. His name was George A. Romero, and his film was Night of the Living Dead. Perhaps the first zombie picture to enter mainstream consciousness, Romero's feature debut would become one of the most important horror films, influencing filmmakers worldwide from Lucio Falci (Zombie, 1979) to Danny Boyle (28 Days Later, 2002) to Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza (Rec, 2007). Such was its importance that the National Film Preservation Board (USA) decided to enter it into its registry.Night of the Living Dead has a simple premise ? a group of people struggle to hide from bloodthirsty zombies in an isolated farmhouse. Except that these people are a group of misfits, strangers to each other. There is a resourceful and rational black man, a white woman in shock, a simple-minded man with his overly concerned lover, and a selfish family man (Mr. Cooper) with a wife and a wounded daughter. Conflicts occur mainly as a result of Mr. Cooper's comic stubbornness and refusal to listen to the black man, giving the film not only an additional "villain", but also a source of light-hearted relief in a dark film.For a horror film, Night of the Living Dead is substantially creepy, with the level of tension escalating as time passes. Romero's zombies are slow-walkers, afraid of fire, but never stop until they get what they want ? to attack, kill, and devour live human beings. For a black-and-white film shot more than four decades ago, Night's portrayal of gore is surprisingly realistic; scenes of zombies eating an assortment of human remains e.g. limbs and organs, still retain their ability to shock in this day and age when extreme violence seems like the norm.Presented like a documentary of sorts, Romero's film is a startling and powerful commentary of the psychology of the American conscience in the 1960s. Themes include the fear of the mob, the white man's fear of the black man, the (emotional) weakness of women, and the fear of Armageddon are expressed through the characters whose actions and words are heavy with meaning. Romero also portrays the authorities (on television, no less) as distant folks who are unclear of the situation on the ground, and who think that relaying the magic phrase "we are doing our best as fast as possible" would allay the fears of a concerned citizenry.While the world has made great strides in dealing with racism, organized crime, gender inequality, and at the same time promoting diplomacy, Night of the Living Dead is still strangely relevant today as when it was first released. Perhaps our fears transcend time, rooted in memory and experience. In addition, Romero's film is also a strong rallying call for us to unite together to solve issues regardless of differences, petty or not. If there is such a thing as an "educational" horror film, that thing would be called Night of the Living Dead. It's not about zombies. It's about us.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

But the actors are not just regular people acting, they are regular people who can't act at all. But that is the charm of this movie, you never really take is serious, and movies that are serious but don't take themselves too series are the best, you can watch them again and again. So, if the acting was a little bit better I would give it higher than a 7.Now I will watch the remake and see if the acting is better in that one.

I have loved many recent zombie movies that have come out, but I have never gotten around to watching this until recently. The fact that the movie takes place in a rural area in a farmhouse makes it all the more scary, and zombies... they just add the the movie. Most zombie movies are great in and of themselves, but this might be the best one that I have ever seen. I was scared for Barbra and Johnny, but also I loved seeing the zombies chasing them. The makeup on the zombies was just great, and the movie really felt like it was low budget and campy, which just made it awesome. I would watch this again in a second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely suspenseful and creepy horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not too much story to the 1968 horror film Night of the Living Dead, just a basic idea of having a few characters trying to survive being trapped in a house threatened by flesh-eating zombies. Yet today Night of the Living Dead is considered to be the quintessential zombie movie; it even went into the National Film Registry. Whether it deserves classic status is something I'll ask in this, one of my reviews on horror and Halloween-themed movies and TV episodes this October.While the plot is fairly simple, Night of the Living Dead is good for a genuine old fashioned scare, without relying on overly graphic violence (though there is a lot of violence). It creates an atmosphere of suspense. Radio and TV reports seen in this movie establish a sense of crisis in a large part of the United States. The news that the zombies attacking the living are eating their victims is grotesque; seeing the zombies actually doing this is scary. When the zombies are swarming the house, the suspense is thick. How will Ben survive? Nevertheless, I found myself questioning some things. I've always wondered why zombies attack people- if these were good people before they died, what is it about death and coming back that suddenly makes them evil? Maybe the zombies aren't the people they were in life, they're just mindless living things that by nature need to eat. The movie suggests radiation caused the reanimation of the bodies but doesn't give any conclusive answers as to what the zombies are- basically, leaving its audience to decide for themselves.Feminists have criticized this movie, according to Wikipedia. Indeed, I did notice the character Barbra is helpless, speechless, then hysterical. But the other women are able to debate what to do; one woman guards a young child who has been bitten by the zombies. The women aren't perfect, but neither are the men. Even the hero Ben, in deep trouble, flees to the cellar which he had argued earlier was a death trap- I guess he decided he was wrong. All of these characters die- but why? What was the point to that? Maybe, Wikipedia suggests, it was a reflection of the violence of the Vietnam War, which was still being fought when this movie was made. It's something to ponder anyway.Happy Halloween.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yeah they're dead. They're all messed up?Night of the Living Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The seminal zombie flick, Night of the Living Dead, can now be crossed off my list of films I need to see. Here is a tale of the undead that is still copied and paid respect to today, some forty years later. Even writer/director George Romero continues to add installments to the saga with his most recent entries gracing theatres in the past few years. It is interesting to note that this film, the most notorious zombie flick, never uses the "Z" word. This might be because the word just wasn't part of our lexicon. Instead we are treated with the slow moving "ghouls" leaving "partially devoured" victims in their wake. It really is just low-budget terror entertainment more than anything else. I had always heard about its great social commentary, and I guess you can make parallels to the red scare and communism, but in the end it's all really just a film to instill fear in the young and laughs for the unaffected.I jest a little about the laughs as this is not as poorly acted as one might think. Sure there are moments of cringe-worthy deliveries and over-acted moments, but for the most part everyone is restrained enough to allow the themes of survival, heroism, and humanity's penchant for destruction to resonate. From the get-go I will admit to being worried, especially with Judith O'Dea's shrill screams for her brother to stop scaring her?"Johnny!!" I think the amateurish acting helps lend some character to the film, though, being such a cheaply made one, (I mean that cost-wise not production-wise as the film is very well made), especially since Romero shoots most of it in close-up. It's as though he wants us to see firsthand and up close the mostly unsuccessful attempts at naturalism.The sheer simplicity of it all is what really stands tall when the credits finally role. At the center of the tale is this inexplicable outbreak of the recently dead being brought back to life with a hunger for human flesh, thus turning their victims into ghouls too. Scientists believe the destruction is a direct result from a satellite beacon returning from Venus that was shot down as it entered our atmosphere with extremely high levels of radiation ? possibly the most obvious comment on the Cold War. Horrors have always been the strongest comment on politics and societal distress because of the inherent fear they bring. Films give us an embodiment of the evils and monsters out there waiting for an opportunity to strike. With Night of the Living Dead, we are being overtaken by radioactively triggered automatons, stumbling into our homes looking for blood. Could this be the mechanical and emotionless face of Communism seamlessly integrating their way into our world? A wave of fear that people who look just like us could in fact be the enemy? Maybe. The ghouls consist of our brothers and sisters and friends, and once they have been turned, they show no remorse or kinship, only a lust to turn you too. Huh, maybe I've changed my mind during the course of writing this review; I guess there is more social commentary than I initially thought.To get back to the surface, though, the story of these three small groups, trying to survive against the onslaught, I enjoyed what Romero did. He gives us the semi-locals?Tom and Judy?both young and unsure of their place, doing what they can to help, but letting emotions get in the way; the older stubborn Harry Cooper, entrenched in his views that his need for self-worth shields him from the right and smart moves; his wife and ill daughter caught in the middle as they must stick with Cooper no matter if he is wrong; and our outsiders, Barbra and Ben, caught up in the mix and truly the wild cards. Barbra is catatonic for most of the film, but her eccentricities cause immense unease and some of the best tension offered. As for Ben, Duane Jones is the epitome of the manly man hero. His take charge attitude is perfect as he will never back down to Karl Hardman's overly brash Cooper, nor allow the wild Barbra get to him, willing to smack her if needed. Ben is the one with a head on his shoulders, looking for survival no matter the cost, trying to help as many as he can, but unafraid to leave them behind if they don't want to jump onboard.So, when all is said and done, Romero has crafted something here that I'm sure was odd and unique back in 1968. This is the backbone to every zombie story you can think of, it started a trend that doesn't seem to have an end in sight. Utilizing the media as a main character even in his first film, the newscaster becomes a voice of reason. Our implicit trust in the man on TV/radio, the person accessible to everyone and therefore must be the authority on the subject is the real scary aspect of the story. Our heroes do what they are told, not because it's the right thing, but because it is the popular choice. I will say that the ending is superb and in tone with what had been going on. America as a land of cowboys, shoot first and ask questions later ? ah, McCarthyism at its finest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Influence; Atmospehre; Romero. Three things required to make an amazing film. Night of the Living Dead is without a doubt the first stereotypical zombie film which would influence so many films to come after it. Night of the Living Dead was an extremely controversial film that was put down by critics, but looked at very fondly as a cult classic, and a fantastic piece of violent social commentary. The social commentary in this film is very present, and can be looked at differently by different people.Night Of The Living Dead is actually a basic 50s science fiction movie in the style of The Last Man On Earth (1963) Starring Vincent Price. Many look past the fact that Night of the Living Dead is based on the same novel as The Last Man On Earth; "I Am Legend", which was recently adapted again into another movie of the same name. Night of the Living Dead balanced the 50s sci-fi theme along with modern (for the time) violence. The violence may look cheesy or tame compared to movies to come out half a decade later, but is still disturbing looking at the way this film is shot. Night of the Living Dead uses the Black and White format better than any other film I have ever seen. The black and white format adds a dark, grainy look to the film which adds a good, unsettling feeling. In my view, Night of the Living Dead may not be the goriest zombie film ever made, but is still the scariest. The dark atmosphere done by director George A. Romero is excellent, and beats anything else done in the genre. The cast is also outstanding. The movie provides some very good performances all around. The character chemistry is outstanding. A large part of the movie is simply character arguments, yet that is the fun of this film. The fun in this film comes from the great directing, which makes the viewer feel like they are in the arguments themselves. The realism of this film is almost frightening in itself. I seen this movie before having any knowledge that it was a classic, and boy was I impressed.Night of the Living Dead has done many things. It lit the match and set the fire for the zombie genre, it set plenty of interesting ground rules, established Romero as a great director, and started off one of the great trilogys of all time. Night of the Living Dead will impress any horror fan looking for a fright fest, rather than a gorefest. Night of the Living Dead may be violently tame compared to the sequels, but contains some very dark and disturbing atmospehre. The down beat ending is also unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive, masterly--much,much better than its reputation might suggest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say from the beginning that I was quite impressed with Romero's film?much more than the things read about it have prepared me to admire. I did not find anything smacking of social critics ,of social protest or leftist propaganda. Its huge success and reputation were fully merited. It has a remarkable touch of originality and freedom. It's one of the very few horrors seen in a while by me that is actually scary. It's not leftist propaganda, but a straightforward horror drama with a Sci?Fi premise. The documentary look is very felicitous. This is a GOOD film, beyond the genre's complicity.In LIVING DEAD at least, Romero was a director who really had something to say?in terms of movies, I mean, not as leftist manifestos. Here's a B movie of the highest rank, with merits at the face?value. Very good, very impressing, powerfully conceived, scary and uncanny. This impressionistic take it adopts enhances greatly the force of the events described. Romero was a director of conception?of cinematographic conception.Romero's feature is one of those movies that are in fact much better than you were ever told (others,to name a few, are?ROPE,THE MAN FROM LARAMIE,Maté's thrillers,etc.). I repeat, if necessary, that it's not a leftist parable, but a horror that succeeds in being a good movie. It does not need the academic rubbish about being a concealed parable, a '60s protest, etc.. Those who say such things need to get a life and start enjoying films for what they are, not for hidden agendas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seminal 60's shocker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This little 60's movie is one of the most important in the horror genre. Not only was it the first of George Romero's zombie films but also one of the first films to take a traditionally supernatural horror idea, give it scientific plausibility and deliver it with both a gritty realism and shocking violence. This was a horror film that was part of the new breed of movies that had started to be made in the late 60's. Its shocking ending recalled the nihilistic final scenes of the likes of Bonnie and Clyde and Easy Rider. Its violence echoed the horrors of the Vietnam War that was raging at the time. It went against type by casting a black man in the lead role. Night of the Living Dead was truly a bona fide counter-culture horror movie.Shot on an incredibly low budget, the grainy black and white image gives the film a somewhat unique feel. How many other films that have depicted gory violence have not been in colour? Admittedly this was a budgetary decision but it does give NOTLD an almost documentary feel at times, which gives it quite an unusual impact. Perhaps the one low-budget limitation that does let the film down is the library music used. This unremarkable soundtrack really feels like it belongs in another movie and doesn't do too much to add to the claustrophobic terror on the screen. But, in every other respect, this is low-budget film-making at it's best. Not only is it a thrill-ride but it is intelligent. Every character is flawed in some way, i.e. can we honestly say that the hero Ben ultimately made the right choice in defending the house?Night of the Living dead is not the best in Romero's zombie series but it is a hugely influential work. It not only laid down a template for all zombie movies that followed but also, along with Hitchcock's Psycho, was one of the American horror films from the 60's that presented it's terrors in a contemporary world and, as a result, helped usher terror films into the modern age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Everything appears to be under control..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the lines uttered, spoken, and screamed over the course of "Night of the Living Dead," this one (by way of Pittsburgh TV anchorman Bill "Chilly Billy" Cardille) may be the most chilling and ironic. In 1968, there was no way of knowing that a "little" film would open the floodgates for a new era in cinematic fear, oft-refined by the original ringmaster himself, George Romero. But it did, and for fans of the genre, it is a contribution we should all be thankful for.For those who know Romero and his contributions to horror (while ignoring misfired sidesteps like "Bruiser" and "Monkey Shines"), Chilly Billy's line is a contradiction of the anarchic chaos at work in his filmography. The director has often stated that his debut is about "revolution" (and it certainly came at the end of a decade known for at least declaring it), but as I age, I find myself wondering just whose revolution is taking place amid all the warring elements (unless, of course, Romero is commenting on a revolutionary mentality, in which many factions adhering to many different ideologies and persuasions knock heads and only worsen preexisting problems). It has become more apparent with each successive film that Romero hedges his bets with both human and zombie, while pledging a moderate loyalty to neither.The ambiguity and cynicism of "Night" still leaves a seriously unsettling mark. If anything, Romero set his film apart from the classical style of Universal, the period pieces of Hammer, and the Gothic offerings of Italy's Mario Bava by transgressing mere hints of moralistic commentary and twist-of-fate ironies and transposing them into an instantly recognizable, rural American setting (the countryside of scenic Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)?populated by people not unlike our friends and neighbors?therefore blurring the line between cinema as mere gaudy escapism and pushing it closer toward something resembling pure, visceral experience. The perfectly integrated use of stock music only adds to the unfolding documentary reality.The film begins in a deserted world, save for brother-and-sister duo Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Russell Streiner), who have traveled to an isolated graveyard to place a wreath on their father's grave. There is an altercation with a mysterious man, and a terrified Barbra flees to an isolated farmhouse. Soon after, night falls and a faceless horde of zombies descend upon the building, as a small group of survivors take an increasingly desperate stand against the walking undead. Romero (and co-writer John Russo) uses this seemingly simple scenario to catapult fireballs of scientific and sociopolitical subtext through the general survival plot. And the survivors are an interesting bunch, shrewdly undercutting the director's point that a half-dozen humans in an escalating situation will find ways to pick apart, antagonize, and even kill one another, equating themselves (if not more so) with the bloodthirsty carnivores outside the door.My first experience with "Night" came late in my childhood, with next to no foreknowledge of what I was in store for. Responding in a manner similar to how I'd later (at 12) react to Romero's "Dawn of the Dead," I found myself shocked, impressed, and generally in awe of what I had just witnessed?granted, I found the dialog scenes of the middle act to be stretched and tedious (and if the film retains a glaring flaw, that's it), but the film overall broke a lot of my perceptions of what was "acceptable" to show in a black-and-white film. Accustomed to the goreless, vulgarity-free "propriety" of movies-sans-color, I expected a relatively coy experience (which couldn't be farther from what I got), and nothing remotely resembling up-close gore, glimpses of nudity, or a half-dozen curse words. In addition to its commentary and well-crafted suspense, another reason "Night" holds up so well is because it truly is a turning point in the streamlining of carnage in mainstream cinema. As much as Romero enjoys pushing our moral and political buttons, his films endure for just giving us a blood-caked good time. With zombies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time has been very kind to this creepy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of the dead rising to eat the flesh of their living counterparts is an old one. There have been countless films made and books written on the subject, yet the idea still fascinates. There are quite a few notable films about zombies. 'The Return of the Living Dead,' 'Zombie,' and 'Shaun of the Dead,' are just a few examples of some really great entries in the genre. But way before these came one particularly influential film that is still talked about and loved after four decades now. That's quite impressive for a film with a shoestring budget made by filmmakers and actors just starting out.Pros: A dated, but still very effective score. Excellent black and white photography. Strong performances from the cast. The zombies are frightening, even compared to their more aggressive modern incarnations. George Romero does a fine job of keeping things suspenseful and unpredictable. Moves at a good steady pace. Some good commentary on the current time/events. Though it's not much, there's a surprisingly healthy amount of gore in the last 15 minutes. An unexpected ending you'll either love or hate.Cons: Not much in the way of character development. At least one more zombie attack, say in the film's midsection, would have been nice.Final thoughts: This film definitely belongs among other genre greats. It's got just about everything one could ask for in a really good horror film and despite it's age it's really held up very well. Plus none of the sequels or imitations have diminished it the way other classics have been.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic in every sense of the word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" is a somewhat overrated film but is still a classic of the genre.**SPOILERS**Traveling to a cemetery, Barbara, (Judith O'Dea) is savagely attacked, and seeking an escape, she comes across an abandoned farmhouse in the middle of nowhere. After a while, Ben, (Duane Jones) comes to her aid, and together they decide to stay in the house for protection. Later that day, from the basement emerges Harry Cooper, (Karl Hardman) his wife Helen, (Marilyn Eastman) and local kids Tom, (Keith Wayne) and his girlfriend Judy, (Judith Riley) and they decide to formulate battle plans against the threat outside. When it's finally decided that zombies are the ones outside, having arisen from the ground due to a radiation leakage from a returning space rocket, the house is boarded up but they still come after them on numerous occasions. After trying many different ways of getting out, they resort to increasingly dangerous ideas and attempts to get out alive.The Good News: While overrated, this is still one of the better entries in the genre that has a lot going for it. One of the main things is that there's one of the greatest mounting dread style of film ever done. This one here has a fantastic time building up the tension and gradually making it so that the villains here are built up into a credible menacing force. By doing it with one of the simplest of tactics, gradually getting more and more numbers for each attack, since there's nothing more unnerving than being attacked by a greater-growing enemy, and here this exploits that masterfully. In the beginning it's obvious there's only a couple outside amongst the group, but by nightfall there's a whole horde out there and it's done by introducing a couple new ones during each attack, making it obvious that their numbers are growing and it affects them accordingly. Of course, it would all be moot if the attacks weren't good, and here they are really glorious. It's hard to pick a stand-out one, since there's a lot of great ones that should be rewarded, but this one doesn't have a stand-out as they all are. The initial clearing of the house is fun, the journey to the gas pump is thrilling and ends in glorious irony, and the sequence where they break through the barrier into the house and must both repel the attack and replenish the defenses is one of the classic battles in the film among the many, since it manages to both keep the film entertaining and interesting by having a lot of action on-screen all the time as well as keeping the film suspenseful since it shows that there's stronger attacks each time and are trying to keep the intruders out with less-successful measures each time. That is a fantastic ability, and by incorporating it in here, this one keeps the film running along and interesting all the time. The final half of the film is where it's best parts are at, since it features all the defenses breaking down, general pandemonium as everything happens at once and there's a general feeling of excitement and intrigue as to what's going to happen, especially once the zombies finally get into the house. It's also helped along by one of the greatest endings in the entire genre, being both logically, cruelly ironic and just flat-out surprising all rolled into one gigantic barrel, and it's all the better for it. The last big punch here is the outright-classic pacing. The film wastes no time in getting things going and rarely pauses, not wasting time on numerous story threads or subplots. The action is always centered on the group of people trapped in the farmhouse, with only brief glimpses at the outside world achieved through their television set and radio. This is a masterful touch, as it really puts the audience in the house with the characters. The viewer knows nothing more than they do, will only learn what they learn when they learn it and no more. This really heightens the sense of claustrophobia that comes with being trapped. These here are the film's best points.The Bad News: This here had some problems with it that lower it's rating slightly. The biggest flaw here is that the middle portion of the film is that there's nothing in here all that impressive about the film. After the attacks subside and they're safely inside the house, it begins a long series of scenes that are simply everyone yelling at one another for the duration of the time, and it's hard to stay interested in a film when that's all that's happening. The yelling is over the most moronic things as well, which makes it harder to make it through these scenes since we get nothing else in here other than those sorts of scenes, and it gets grating after a while. There's also some qualms about the idiotic decisions made, especially about the daughter. It's known by all the characters that a bite or scratch turns the victim into a creature, yet this one decides that the best place for rehabilitation is inside the house, with no medical treatment for the condition in reach of everyone around them. There's also smaller problems, mostly based around the zombies. A long way has come in the design of the creatures, and these primitive-looking ones could be seen as a down-grade by some. The last one is the black-and-white photography, but its nothing major. These here are the film's few problems.The Final Verdict: Somewhat overrated due to certain areas of the film, but still good enough to be one of the better films out there in the genre. Still quintessential viewing for all horror film or zombie genre fans, while it's hard to think of who won't enjoy this one.Rated R: Violence and Language</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this is the one that gets the critical plaudits, but I suspect that I'm not alone in preferring its more gory and action-packed sequel, Dawn of the Dead. Perhaps it's the black and white snobbery that favours NOTLD, but the admittedly garish Dawn never seems to receive the respect it merits. It's safe for connoisseurs to admire this one, because it can be passed off as 'art', while its sequel is relegated to the splatter category, rubbing shoulders (or stumps of shoulders) with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and such like.Night of the Living Dead is a great movie, but IMHO Dawn beats it hands down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recall seeing Night of the Living Dead on Halloween Night, 1983 when MTV celebrated its fifteen year anniversary. For the first time, I was exposed to this cheesy, yet dark and bleak horror movie. Most people know the story. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) is visiting her mother's grave with her brother, Johnny. While there, they are attacked by a zombie. She escapes to a small farm house where she meets Ben (Duane Jones). Barabara has lost her faculties so it is up to Ben to board up the windows and doors as the flesh eating zombies multiply. They finally meet some other residents who have been holding up in the basement. This includes Tom (Keith Wayne) and his wife, and the nefarious Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman). At this point, Ben and Harry fight amongst themselves as well as the living dead. Yes, the dialog is cheesy, the acting is bearable (if that), and some of the scenes shot were high-school level. What made this work (I think) is the bleak and dark outlook. The black and white cinematography adds a frightening despair. This is especially evident in the last third of the film when all hell literally breaks loose. This is not really scary - as in zombies popping up around the corner or out of the shadows. Director George A. Romero rather goes for the claustrophobia and despair. His photography of zombies moving in and out of light and darkness renders humans as monsters. It literally shakes the audience on a thinking level that will carry on for a day, week or month. This makes the movie more frightening. I am glad Romero learned from his novice experience. His vision and work only got better from here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>· The recently dead are returning to life and eating their victims alive· Besides Hitchcock's Psycho, this film acts as a gateway for the transformation of Hollywood Horror seen in the 1970s· A small group of strangers on the run from zombies coincidentally meet up with each other in an abandoned rural farmhouse in their efforts to seek safe refuge· The strangers, divided along racial lines, must learn to work together in their efforts to ward off the zombies, as they board up the farm house in a desperate battle to stay alive· The outdated special effects should be appreciated for their shocking ingenuity considering the time period in which they were made· A true shocker in its time that should be respected by all in the film industry · Exploring Genre Conventions:· Night was the first film to truly break away from the established Hollywood Horror formula. Hitchcock of course broke many rules in the 1968 Psycho, but one more push was really needed; Romero obliged with Night of the Living Dead· Romero changed everything with his over-the-top hand-held filming style, many years before the fools that made Blair Witch· Romero chose to make the film in black and white at a time when audiences were clamoring for the fresh new look of Technicolor· Romero cast an African American, Duane Jones, for the lead. That was a definite Hollywood no-no even in 1968· Other no-no's included partial nudity and graphic violence that included grotesque zombies devouring intestines. The actors were paid extra if they agreed to eat the real animal entrails on screen· Without spoiling the ending, Romero again broke all the rules and left audiences shocked with the conclusion· The rule breaking that occurred in 70's horror, most certainly can and should be traced back to Hitchcock and Romero</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original "zombie apocalypse" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I know there are zombie movies that were created before Night of the Living Dead. But none of them defined the genre until this one. This remains the epitome of low budget, B movie horror flicks. The reason became obvious to me as I watched through it. Newer updates or clones may have better special effects, a stronger plot, or even better acting; but they lack the complex messages and themes that flow through the 1968 version of Night of the Living Dead.Things start when a typical woman, Barbra, visits a cemetery with her brother. An unstable, groaning man walks up and attacks them. Barbra flees and takes refuge in a nearby house, which soon becomes a gathering place for other frightened humans. Unfortunately, they become surrounded by a mob of zombies. From that point, practically the whole story takes place inside or close to the building. There are also a few television news segments that describe the mysterious circumstances on a national scale, which is very effective for building up suspense.Technically, the film is a B movie, and it shows. The plot has its share of inconsistencies and holes, but these are overshadowed by the interesting situations. The acting is not particularly good, although this might stem from the fact that none of the characters are likable (with the slight exception of Tom, who unfortunately plays a small role). I felt that, to a degree, it was necessary for the characters to be flawed. They are supposed to reflect the average population that we could compare to; as much as we would like to imagine all movie characters to be heroes, it just would not work. It is important for building the film's message about society.I have heard complaints that Night of the Living Dead is too dated to be effective anymore, but I did not find that to be the case. The atmosphere it created was chilling and disturbing. I do not recall laughing a single time after the first five minutes, which is rare for these older low budget films.I recommend Night of the Living Dead for anyone with even a minute interest in horror films. It seems like a movie that can satisfy both the general audience and the people searching for a more complex message. It has its share of unavoidable problems; but in the end, you are left remembering the good things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead is an uncompromising, indelible masterpiece that pulls no punches despite its forty-year vintage. The film wins in all aspects of film-making, including writing, pacing, and cinematography -- not to mention assembling a terrifyingly ferocious cast of the undead.The film's biggest strength is its bleak, desperate atmosphere, which is heightened by stark black and white photography, high-contrast lighting, and mono sound. It suspends many moments of unmitigated terror within the same feeling of morbid isolation one can find in Tobe Hooper's original Texas Chain Saw Massacre (but, of course, earns extra kudos for doing it first).Romero approaches the story with a steady hand and gives taut direction. The proceedings are supported by an engaging cast, especially leads Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea. Jones -- the first African-American lead in a horror film -- is wonderful as the handsome, assured, and no-nonsense hero, while O'Dea gives a pensive and uniquely off-kilter performance. Captivating from its riveting beginning to its downbeat conclusion, Night of the Living Dead stands as a pivotal entry in the zombie subgenre.</fullReview>

But up until recently, I had thought that George Romero and John Russo were the originators of what some here have described as a Classic influential movie, but is it really? I think not! Prior to Night Of The Living Dead, William Leicester and Richard Matheson wrote The Last Man on Earth that in 1964 was turned into a movie, and directed by Ubaldo Ragona. This was the classic that influenced Night Of The Living Dead. It stars Vincent Price who is subjected to the very same terror as Duane Jones suffers as Ben in Night Of The Living Dead. The script for The Last Man On Earth was far superior and there is much more substance to that movie. I still rate Night Of The living Dead a Ten, but a classic it is not other than the dead come up from out of the ground and coffins, but Dracula had also done that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With this film, George A. Romero basically invented the zombie genre as a sub-genre of horror. And it still is the straightedge in this genre, not even reached by himself. Why is it so special? The time it was made was during the US-engagement in Vietnam, the public opinion was on the edge of a turnaround. This was a good feed for young artists trying to convey their dark vision via motion pictures. The black and white and the locations appear cheap (for a movie). The effect of that is that the people and places also seem familiar, the audience doesn't get the chance to push it away on "them". And then suddenly this unexplainable horror breaks out. How do people react? Some found militant militia armies. Some can't bear the situation and take refuge in insanity. Others show boundless egoism, instead of helping others. Amazing analysis of society. Who are the ones that keep a level head? A black man (Ben) and a woman (Helen). Revolutionary.</fullReview>

But all of these things and more make a good horror film and if this is the pioneer, then this has to be one of the greatest horror films ever made.This film also has some of my favorite things to see in film as well as gore and simplicity. Humor. Yes, humor. The scene at the end of the film with Ben thinking that he had just survived a zombie apocalypse wakes up and finds himself shot in the head. i cracked up. other scenes include when Ben beats up Barbara for being afraid, and also the classic "they're coming to get you Barbara" scene and when it actually turns out to be a zombie. an all time classic.only classics can be parodied rightfully so, and Night.... has many parodies, most of them funny.One of my highest recommendations. Ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>30th Anniversary terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "Night of the living dead" is an unquestionable classic, the 30th anniversary commits the ultimate act of cannibalism ever- namely adding useless and nepotistic footage of the creators own family members as zombies added 30 years after; an extra scene attached to the very beginning in a feeble and pointless attempt to explain the origin of the cemetery zombie only adds to the feeling extra scenes were created for a selling point. Take my advice, simply see the original restored version which looks great...this movie doesn't need the extra stuff. The REAL threat in this movie plot comes not from zombies but from the constant conflict and inability to decide and compromise between the main individuals; being right and in charge becomes more important than escape, the supposed threat- zombies or vampires or earthquakes or whatever- is actually secondary. the true horror comes from the realization that humans do, in fact, behave selfishly when they should be working together. But shame on the creators for the extra and useless footage; it doesn't really detract from the film, but it's annoying to think they did it. And remember....."They're coming to get you, Barbra..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie That Started It All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you look at the difference between older horror films like this and the horror films of today it is really quite amazing. A lot of people don't understand the sophistication of older horror films. It's not all about the blood and gore stuff. It is more likely the fact of the of the suspense and the question "What would you do if you were the victim in that situation?" Most importantly it's about thanking old movies like The Night Of The Living Dead and their creators George Ramaria for bringing a new form of horror to life. The story of it is nothing special but it doesn't need to be. It had plenty of action and scary zombies to keep the person glued to watching it. A lot of the stuff in the movie was never seen before back in the 60's in the form it was given, and making a movie that people aren't familiar with is brilliant. This movie will always be up there in the top with all the other classic horror movies. It will be a movie always remembered as the movie that started a whole new form of horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This video has been sitting in my collection for quite sometime and I recently decided to give it a try. This film definitely defines the beginning of present day horror. A couple scenes actually made me jump a little. Just the utter feeling of hopelessness with no sign of safety in sight really gets me on the edge of my seat. For such a low budget film the photography was incredible. The scenes inside the house we're lit well and I wasn't stuck trying to make out the image in front of me, as with most black and whites. The costuming was exceptional as well. The dead wasn't over make-upped. The dead didn't look like a bunch of really rough looking strong men running around in torn clothes. I suggest any dawn/day/land of the dead fan to watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This landmark 1968 horror-shocker is a great example of what can be done with a limited budget, a simple idea, and some dedicated and talented participants. Very nicely shot, mostly well acted, NOTLD grabs your attention from the very beginning to the very end - and what a classic end it is.The story begins with Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother visiting the grave of a friend of their mother, and takes off almost immediately, as they are attacked by a horde of cannibalistic zombies. Narrowly escaping, but losing her emotional balance in the process, Barbara escapes to a house a bit farther down the road where she meets Ben (Duane Jones), the hero of the film. They discover a family with a sick little girl and a young couple in the basement of the house and they all get to work barricading themselves in and preparing weapons and other defenses. The rest of the story concerns the group dynamics between these survivors as the dead close in on their refuge, the story of what is going on in the rest of the USA - revealed through TV reportage and radio broadcasts, and sheer survival. The human side of this film is an interesting and accurate character study concerning what happens to people whose very lives are threatened.The horror of this film is, unlike a lot of its recent descendants, less a matter of blood and gore than a matter of the real active horror of realistically depicted scenes of murder, death and cannibalism. Though the black and white footage involving blood and gore is certainly effective, there may not be quite enough of it for today's average horror fan. The photographic techniques of this film are innovative and powerful - showing just enough of the sheer hideousness of the film's basic concepts to disturb viewers, but not enough to allow them to detach from the film's protagonists.I strongly recommend this film to anybody interested in the art of film making, and to those who enjoy the horror genre, though it is hard to imagine any serious horror fan who hasn't already seen this.Rated PG for Violence and Partial Nudity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Zombie Movie to End All Zombie Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the premier example of how low-budget restrictions can work to the advantage of a film.George Romero's 1968 grindhouse shocker is the granddaddy of every zombie flick made since, and it remains by far the best. A scrappy group of survivors hole up in a deserted farmhouse to take a stand against a horde of rampaging zombies. The usual social dynamics present in movies like this are turned on their ear by the fact that the most capable of the group is black, and Romero makes no attempt to hide the thread of racial tension that this creates. The terrible film stock and remedial editing hide the otherwise likely laughable makeup and special effects, so that the zombies are truly scary, and the gore truly nauseating. This is a visceral, gut-churning and terribly scary, scary movie.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" to me is considered the greatest horror film of all time.Horror in the dictionary say this: an overwhelming and painful feeling caused by something frightfully shocking, terrifying, or revolting.I feel that this low-budget film is everything that horror is. Picture this... You are closed off in a house with the "undead" surrounding the place. That is the basis for the film "Night of the Living Dead" The acting is great too. These are not huge actors at all. Its like Romero just grabbed random people of the street to make them act in the film. It makes it very realistic.The black and white gives the film a chilling look and adds to the horror. I recommend this film to everyone over the age of 13. It is not as violent as your typical horror film. It looks like a classic 30's film! The subject matter is the only thing that makes this movie questionable to younger viewers.I Hope this movie continues to stand the test of time. It is as tragic as it is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary, clever, innovative, strong acting, gore, great camera-work, moody atmosphere, crisp black and white photography and perhaps the most overlooked aspect of this film is the Incredible soundtrack. Many things are overlooked in this film because it has so much to offer. It was groundbreaking in many ways one of which it allowed a black man to be viewed as the hero and play the lead role. This was very cuting edge and rare back in the 60s. But there's a irony in the role he plays, at first glance he seems to be the hero but in reality , it is because of him that everyone dies in the house because he convinced everyone else that it was safer to stay out of the basement. Some of the camera-work and lighting in this film is nothing short of genius and it proves that often when a producer has a low budget, their originality and though process of filming a movie goes into overdrive. Night of the Living Dead and Curse of Frankenstein will always be my top 2 horror films of all time because they are : scary, intelligent, thought provoking and have meaningful dialog, conflict and characters that the viewer will either despise or love. I have found with both of the fore-mentioned films, they only get better with repeated viewings and the viewer learns more and more with those viewings as long as they play close attention and look for other aspects of the film which may be hidden on the 1st viewing.</fullReview>

Films that cause you the need to check the back seats before getting in the car. Films that frighten you to the point of leaving the bedroom light on when you go to bed and then you sweat underneath your covers because you're afraid to make an air hole out of the covers. Night of the Living Dead is such a film.I've read a lot of reviews commenting on the fact that this film was low budget. Yes, it was low budget, and that just exemplifies its genius even more.

		<shortDescription>Excellent Low-Budget Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero's "Night Of The Living Dead" is (in my opinion) among the very best of low-budget horror classics, right up there with Tobe Hooper's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". This film opens with Barbara and her brother Harry, who drive six hours out into the countryside to visit their mother's grave and an isolated cemetery. While paying their respects, Harry reminds Barbara of a childhood memory, and while trying to scare her, they are approached by a man who is walking very strangely along. The man grabs Barbara, and Harry begins to fight with him, until his head is thrown against a tombstone. Barbara tries to escape in the car, crashes, and begins running through the woods. She finds an old farmhouse in a field and hides out there, and notices an entire clan of these walking-dead. After time other people arrive at the farmhouse, also hiding from the living dead. While hiding in the house, listening to a radio for updates on the mysterious phenomena, the zombies begin to break in - and they have to fight back. It's up to them to save themselves from these flesh eating zombies .The most influential and probably the most bootlegged movie of all time (due to the movie never receiving an official copyright), "Night Of The Living Dead" is a classic on every level, and that's saying a lot because I don't really care for zombie movies to begin with. I'll openly admit that too, I'm not really a fan of zombie films - I think they're alright, but they're just not really my thing. But "Night Of The Living Dead" is the exception. The film is black and white, and I really enjoy old films like this so I thought it was really neat because it gives it a vintage feel. The acting - eh, it's okay. Not bad, not great - just average really. But it doesn't really matter. The story is the strongest and most unique element of the movie, and the special effects used were phenomenal for the time, especially considering this movie's beyond-low budget. The zombies looked great and the gore effects looked fine, but you have to consider that this film was made in 1968. There are some great scenes in the movie, and the opening scene where Barbara is chased through the desolate forest by the mysterious man was terrifying.All in all, "Night Of The Living Dead" is a horror classic. I don't typically like zombie movies, but I loved this. It's packed with a great story, some good gory scenes and chases, and some fairly realistic-looking (and scary) zombies! What more could you ask for? Definitely watch this one, it's one of the great horror classics of all time. I think most of us can confidently say that this is the king of all zombie films. I'd also recommend the eerie 1962 low-budget horror, "Carnival of Souls", if you enjoyed this film, because it's just as good, if not a tad bit better. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968) **** Seminal zombie film from maverick indie great George A. Romero that changed the face of American horror films with his bare-bones documentary influenced stagings, ghoulish cinematography and genuine sense of reality based terror set in his home state of Pennsylvania setting the stage for an unknown phenomena causing the dead to rise and vanquish their never-ending hunger (!) Scary to the marrow and its cast of unknowns add a singular presence of 'hey this actually could happen'- sensibility. The fact a black man (Duane Jones) is the film's hero is no accident in the underpinings of the era's racial climate in America nor is its societal ills unblemished in all its ugliness; the true horror if you will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romero's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films can claim to be as influential and genre-defining as George A. Romero's 1968 horror classic Night Of The Living Dead. This is a superb film in every respect - it's beautifully filmed, expertly constructed and well acted. However, the film's most impressive achievement is that it still packs one hell of a punch almost 40 years later. Night Of The Living Dead remains essential viewing for any student of the horror genre.Romero's premise could not be simpler. Barbra is attacked by a man who appears to be in some kind of catatonic state and flees to an abandoned house. She soon finds herself surrounded by a group of similarly affected people and starts to question her sanity until help arrives in the form of Ben, surely one of cinema's first black action heroes. Ben boards up the house, only to discover that two couples and a child have been hiding in the cellar. The group learn that a murder epidemic has spread across the country and try to hatch an escape plan that will enable them to reach one of the camps that have been set up to protect survivors. The reason why Night Of The Living Dead endures as a "scary" movie, while many of its contemporaries have become quaint or camp with the passing of time, is its remarkable ability to tap into commonly held fears and phobias.For a film that was initially renowned for its blood and gore, Night Of The Living Dead's legacy is its psychological impact. Night Of The Living Dead was not the first film to use zombie-like creatures by any stretch of the imagination. However, it was the first film to present zombies in the form and with the mythology that modern audiences have come to associate with the term. The power of the "zombie" concept derives from the relentlessness and inevitably of attack that they represent. Coupling this idea with prospect of being pursued by mutilated, former friends and loved ones, is particularly cruel - and psychologically, very effective. The idea of betrayal permeates the entire film, from the "zombie" concept, to the actions of Harry and the fate awaiting Ben. There is also an aspect of paranoia, unintentional (as Romero has stated) or otherwise, which expertly reflects the social climate of the late 1960s and, indeed, of today. Romero expertly manipulates the viewer through a landscape of fear and uncertainty, constantly feeding the tension until the blood begins to flow.George A. Romero and John A. Russo's script is truly a thing of beauty. It is taunt, tight and terrifying. Unlike most horror films of the day, Night Of The Living Dead is grounded in reality. There is no supernatural aspect to the events, indeed, the in-fighting among the group repeatedly emphasises human weakness and moral decay. A ploy which, at the time, must have seemed ground breaking. Their decision not to explain the zombie epidemic is a great one. In fact, my only real complaint about the script is the minor subplot about the Venus probe. It is the only example of the film losing its grounding and falling foul of its bulletproof mythology. Romero and Russo keep their biggest shock for the conclusion and closing credits, which remain an unparalleled reality check for the viewer. Night Of The Living Dead broke the mold and then re-constructed it. The film's sense of realism is further heightened by the wonderful gore effects, Romero's no non-sense approach to direction, the eerie black and white photography and the riveting acting performances.The film's gore and make-up effects still hold up well. Back in the day they must have been absolutely breathtaking. Romero places great emphasis on realism and the scenes of zombies chewing on entrails and flesh are expertly handled. The black and white photography helps to mask the most dated effects and contributes to the film's documentary feel. Romero's direction is incredibly self-assured for a debut. His camera is like a fly on the wall, observing the action. The stillness of the scenes inside the house expertly balances the manic action that takes place outside it. Romero is aided by a fine cast, particularly Duane Jones, Judith O'Dea and Karl Hardman. Judith O'Dea's Barbara is somewhat useless as far as modern heroines are concerned but the sense of shock and hysteria conveyed is convincing, while Karl Hardman's Harry is superbly slimy. The acting standout is Duane Jones as Ben. Duane is simply exemplary. Today, this performance would have shot the actor into superstar territory.Night Of The Living Dead is one of the earliest examples of the modern horror film. It is a link between the more theatrical approach of early horror and the intensity of modern genre films. Night Of The Living Dead's influence can not be overstated - it has been used a blueprint for countless movies. However, very few of them come close to matching this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like zombie movies, you should start with the good old original.. This is the movie that started it all. I highly recommend it. Unfortunately, as you might expect, the special effects and such are pretty bad, as the movie is so old. Nonetheless, I still say it is a must-see. Special effects aren't all there is to a good movie, after all. There are many great things about this movie, and many of the underlying concepts are great, and the movie came at an interesting point in history for these to be given to the public, in my opinion. Even if you don't like horror films, zombies, or any of the other things you'd expect to see in a movie like this, you should see it just for its more or less classic elements, such as the aforementioned underlying concepts.I can't wait to see the 90's remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to appreciate the classic nature of this film. Black and white horror movie, zombies, drama, suspense. This movie has it all. I don't know of a better film out there which conveys all of these aspects, plus a kick-a$$ hero and some of the best quotes in cinema history. "They're coming to get you, Barbara. Look, there's one now!" Still chills my spine. When I was a kid, this movie scared the ever-living crap out of me. Watching it now only reinforces those feelings. Some of the stuff in this movie would still snatch an NC-17 rating today. Or at least they should. While I enjoy movies such as Hostel and The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Night Of The Living Dead was ground-breaking and outstanding. Had this movie been read originally as a radio show, as War Of The Worlds was back in its time, it certainly would have scared the bejesus out of everyone who heard it. Imagine if people really thought that their loved ones were coming back from the dead, only to eat them. Sure, there are the cheesy special-effects and too-unbelievable-for-reality coincidences, but they all make their point, and this is a point well made. And the best part, SPOILER WARNING, the hero dies in the end. Not because he was black, not because he did something stupid, but because he was in a situation where, in the end, people aren't going to ask questions or ask for ID, they will shoot you in the face just because you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Zombies are abounding and out pops you. Boom. The end. A tragic ending, yes, but a realistic one, no doubt in my mind. Say what you will about some kind of pseudo-racist, neo-nazi, hidden agenda garbage, but this is horror as it is. Gritty, kick-a$$, and well worth the 10 bucks or less that Best Buy sells this classic for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the only Horror movie that makes me think "this movie was way ahead of it's time!" or "how brilliant is this script and how it has influenced GENERATIONS of Horror film makers". This movie is worth the hype. There isn't anything wrong with "Night Of The Living Dead". This is Romero's masterpiece for many factors. The whole zombie situation idea is revolutionary. Romero took the basics from the zombie movies from the 30's and 40's and takes the sub-genre into a macabre new dimension. Also, the direction is simply excellent. Romero knew how to shock a still naive audience in the late 60's. He created a creepy movie based on it's dark, scary atmosphere. I'd say that this is the best example (along with The Texas Chainsaw Massacr) of an unsettling movie. Forget about "Dawn Of The Dead", "Day Of The Dead", "28 Days Later", etc. This is the king of the Zombie sub-genre. The sequels were highly influenced by the splatter and gore wave that the Horror experience in the 70's and 80's but it wasn't space enough for scariness or atmosphere. The sequels are all about fashion film making and new techniques of gore and visuals. "Night Of The Living Dead" is scary enough in all aspects. Visuals, music, plot... Duane Jones is also somewhat a hero in the genre. He delivers one of the most complete performances in Horror cinema history. His performance is solid and believable even that the situations are extremely fictitious. He's surely on the top 5 performances ever in the genre. I cannot praise this movie enough as it's truly a breakthrough movie in the history of cinema. Even that I'm not a fan of the sub-genre, I give the respect that this movie deserves. The ending is truly great, it's chilling, well directed, and leaves a lot for the imagination. No time for happy situations this time. I wonder if this movie shocked audiences big time as "The Exorcist".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a horror fan, I'm often asked my opinion on what the scariest movie of all time is. I always give the same answer ? Night of the Living Dead. There is no movie that fills me with more of a sense of unease, literally has the hair on the back of my neck standing on end, and causes me to actually look in the dark corners of a room like George Romero's masterpiece. Fear is so subjective that I am fully aware that what frightens me might not automatically frighten you. But in the case of Night of the Living Dead, I have trouble understanding how anyone isn't affected the same way I am. It's that powerful to me.I'm not the biggest Romero fan in the world, but I am of Night of the Living Dead. What he was able to accomplish with an obviously limited budget is nothing short of amazing. Romero created more atmosphere in the opening ten minutes of Night of the Living Dead than most directors with unlimited budgets ever could. Some of the acting may not be the best you'll run across, but for me that only adds to the film's authentic feel. They seem like real people trapped in that house. The special effects may not be as realistic as those in other zombie movies, but I've never seen what someone eating a kidney really looks like. It works very well with me. Finally, the ending is as bleak and powerful as any horror movie I've seen. Most directors would have been tempted (or forced) to give it a happy ending. Thankfully, Romero isn't most directors.In short, Night of the Living Dead is the stuff of real nightmares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rather than add my heap of praise on this film, let me take a different tack and analyze one reason I think the low budget helps the movie. The very smallness of the budget,crew and location makes it seem like a personal experience. When an unexpected disaster happens, we are pretty much on our own. Help may come later, but right now we are thrown back on our own courage, skill, resourcefulness, and judgment. The bigger the emergency, the longer we will remain on our own. Even on the TV broadcasts from the large city of Pittsburgh the newscasters seem nervous, stressed and unsure (for once!) They give the impression that even the city and state are overwhelmed and that everyone is "making do" as well. We can expect little help but information and advice from that quarter. On subsequent viewings I remember thinking "I wonder how much of the budget the helicopter took?" When they put a big dent in Johnny's Pontiac Lemans, I wonder if it's a rental and they let the insurance pay. I also got out my atlas and checked on all the towns that had relief stations (Including Latrobe, where they make Rolling Rock Beer) just so that I could sorta tell "where I was." (BTW "Willard" is NOT a real town.) Nothing profound here, just some ruminations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" is the greatest horror film of all time, and probably the most important one of the last 50 years. Much of the time, groundbreaking films are not particularly remarkable artistically-- they simply get by on doing something that had never been done before. NotLD is a particularly glaring exception because it is so effortlessly and organically transgressive. A film like "Last House on the Left" seems to exist exclusively for the purpose of pushing the audience to the edge, but NotLD never announces that it is a new, darker sort of horror film. One gets the impression that Romero and Russo and all the others didn't even specifically intend to make a more graphic horror film when they started out. It appears almost normal, initially, but moves inexorably towards the horrific conclusion, at all points defying the expectations as to who ought to survive, or whether or not bravery or cowardice ought to be rewarded. It never feels self-conscious or scripted, and that's why it holds up so well even after it is no longer a particularly morbid or gruesome film. Despite the supernatural elements, NotLD is disturbingly authentic.Horror films tend not to be to big on plot, and "Night of the Living Dead" is no exception. It is your standard zombie apocalypse plot, though, of course, no such thing existed at the time. Most modern zombie films take the action-horror route along with an urban setting, but NotLD is pure horror, and takes place inside a desolate farmhouse out in the Pennsylvania countryside. As the film opens we are introduced to Barbara and Johnny, brother and sister. These are characters we've seen before: Barbara is snippety and uptight, and seems to be well on her way to becoming an old spinster. Johnny feels like the hero, and he'd probably feel at home in a 50's Sci-Fi or Horror flick, as he's whiny and jokey and teases his sister. Still, he seems to have a good, courageous heart, however, as he immediately comes to his sisters aid after she's assailed by a strange man in the graveyard. But Oops! Johnny gets his brains bashed in only a few minutes into the film. And though she's technically alive Barbara is more or less out for the count for the rest of the film, and mostly lounges about in a nearly catatonic stupor.Barbara flees to an apparently abandoned farm house, and we are shortly introduced to the films real hero, Ben, played by Duane Jones. The acting in the film isn't exactly terrific, but Jones is good as Ben, and helps create one of the most appealing protagonists in all film. He's smart and capable but certainly not a saint-- Notice how he decks the hysterical Barbara after she slaps him during her vain attempt to get them to search for the now very dead Johnny. Much has been made out of the fact that he's black. Romero will tell you that this means nothing, or nothing more than that Jones was the best actor they could find for the part, regardless of race. Again, the roots of NotLD's greatness are exposed-- They were neither conforming to nor defying tradition. They simply made it their way.The core of the film is not especially eventful: Ben works to barricade the house, and eventually argues with the unexpected tenants in the basement, two couples and one child. These scenes show that Romero really knew what he was doing from the very beginning, and that his experience in industrial films and commercials wasn't wasted. The film somehow maintains a slightly hypnotic intensity in the section as Ben seals of the house while the all to calm radio announcer drones on and on in a hopeless attempt to get a grip on the whole extraordinary situation. Romero keeps the camera moving and the editing sharp so that even after over 10 viewing my mind never wanders in this seemingly uneventful section of the film. (This is a good description of the visual style of the film in general, as it is far from flashy and very realistic, but still energetic enough that it never really feels flat.) And then there is, of course, Ben's dramatic monologue about his first encounter with the "things". This scene has been surpassed a few times in later films, like "Jaws" or "28 Days Later", but it still holds up very well.Eventually, the majority of the farmhouse's residents determine that it's best not to simply wait around for help, and plan a fairly reasonable escape. Suffice to say, things do not go well. I don't want to go into too many specific as it'll hurt the film, but this part is really quite brilliant. Their plan seems really quite reasonable on the face of it, but it proves disastrous. Fate and human error intervene, and we a treated to one of the earliest gore scenes you'll ever see outside of an H.G. Lewis film, as the ghouls feed on charred remains while ominous, amelodic electronic music drones on in the background. Again, this isn't remarkably gruesome by modern day standards, but it's probably the creepiest zombie-feast scene ever filmed.Shortly after this things spiral out of control between the survivors, and all hell break's loose, leading up to one of the greatest endings in all film. Again, I won't go into specifics, but it's just such a classic, senselessly tragic endings. It's been knocked off many times, but the ending here still has the sorta authenticity that you find in all the rest of the film. This isn't a morose, violent ending that a supposedly edgy director stuffed on to prove how far he'd push boundaries This is just they way it happened to turn out. Just a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George A. Romero's Living Dead - Part I</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They're coming to get you, Barbara!"With this line Co-Writer/Director George A. Romero revolutionized the way that we look at movies. Night of the Living Dead, plain and simple, is a movie that is worth seeing. Even though the effects, sound and picture quality and dialogue is outdated (by today's standards); this movie is still one of the best ever made. I first saw Night of the Living Dead at a local theater, around Halloween. I actually live in Butler, which is mentioned multiple times throughout the movie. That viewing was my introduction horror films and I've been a big fan ever since. Recently I purchased a colorized version of the film from Legend Studios/Off Color Films and 20th Century FOX. Seeing it in color is a different experience, but makes it just as creepy."You gonna let them get her too, huh?"The storyline of Night of the Living Dead is pretty simple: A woman and her brother are attacked by a zombie (even though they are never called zombies in the movie) the zombie attacks her brother and she runs to a nearby farmhouse for protection, leaving her brother behind to fight Mr. Zombie. (Oh, don't worry she'll see her brother again!). At the farmhouse the woman meets a group of people who are also seeking protection there as well. The rest of the movie tells the story of their attempt to keep their lives from being taken by their cannibalistic attackers. "Are they slow-moving, chief?" "Yeah, they're dead. They're all messed up."Since its initial release in 1968, Night of the Living Dead has been referenced and spoofed in countless films and has become a landmark in film making history. It has spawned the creation of three sequels (so far) and its own remake in 3-D. The special effects aren't exactly top notch, but even by today's standards would probably be a close call between PG-13 and an R rating. Compared to the other movies in Romero's "Living Dead" series, it is the perfect microcosm of evolution (especially in violence)in the movie industry. Night of the Living Dead was a low-budget movie with a rookie director, surprisingly almost forty years later it can still hold its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror that is not made any more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has one of the greatest twists I've ever seen at the end, and also what makes it so great to watch with people who've not seen it before, particularly if they haven't been exposed to Romero's other zombie films. The story itself is fairly light, but remains the creepiest of the lot. Given, it's actors are mostly horrible, Ben being the noticeable exception, and one of the reasons the movie is so watchable... Also, due to it having such an ambiguous premise, many still wonder how and why the dead came to rise and feast upon the living - it poses many questions... Answers few.Indeed, every time I watch it, I come to a different conclusion as to what caused it...This movie ages very well, and holds its own to today's low budget horror movies. Sure, as the budgets have increased, and the technology has, it's been easier to create better movies... BUT, more than thirty years on, and this movie is still standing head and shoulders above most. I put it down to Johnny ("They're coming to get you Barbara!") and the zombie from the cemetery - that guy is particularly creepy.I'm showing this to my kids on their fifth birthday. It's a good movie to use to keep them in line until they're ready to be kicked out of home - just threaten them with it - if they decide to wander the streets at night or disobey you, zombies might eat them or turn their car over and chase them for miles...10 out of 10. A classic. Get it, watch it, love it. If you don't, too bad. *** NOTE *** Don't watch the 25th anniversary edition, however, as it ruins the musical score and adds unnecessary and stupid scenes, and a dumb ending that ruins the movie. If it were watched with that version, I'd change the score to about 2/10. It really cheapens it, tries plot development and fails, and should be avoided like the plague. CHEERS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bloody Beginning of Romero's Zombie Saga.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There had been other movies about the dead walking, and there have been legions since, but there has always been something special about Night of the Living Dead. The black and white photography help the makeup effects and the sparse sound effects and music, restrained by the non-existent budget, add to a general sense of emptiness and dread while the lack of star power gives the movie an odd documentary feel. Also, The little moments work: Barbara seeing the dead woman at the top of the stairs with her face eaten off, the sight of zombies surrounding the house, the stories of how everyone got there, the little girl killing and eating her mother, and the final shot of a white hunter killing the sole survivor, a black man. All chilling sequences that add to the whole, but what makes this horror movie great is the social dynamics that are explored. The destruction of the group from within, the boundaries the can't be escaped even in the most dire of situations. The flaw, if any, is that Duane Jones' character is the central character. It is his story that we should have been following from the beginning. But squabbling aside, this is still an excellent horror movie that is the best film in Romero's saga and still packs a powerful punch after nearly four decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The whole thing is black and eerie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In grad school, I had a roommate who lived in western Pennsylvania. He pointed out to me that after the making of this film, they rented the house to people who wanted to have overnight parties there. We almost did this, but schedules got in the way. I had heard so much about this movie, when I finally saw it, I was expecting too much. Like silent films or art films, the second and third viewing convinces one that these are trend setters. Because I had seen other movies like this, I thought it was clichéd, but then realized that those movies were the clichés and this set them up. The zombies are frightening, the feasting on human flesh is disgusting, those poor people, trapped in that house, not just fighting the enemies outside, but their own, inside, make for quite a film. It's easy to laugh at this because of inexperienced actors, cheap sets, and, basically, pretty bad special effects. Nevertheless, there is a throbbing threat that begins with the car in the graveyard and goes all the way to the unfortunate ending. It's a very frightening movie and set the standard for a raft of others to come. I don't like slasher movies and I'm not fond of gore in film, but it is a part of cinema today, and a lot of imagination went into this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grandaddy of all zombie movies!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without exception, Night of the Living Dead is the single best zombie flick ever made! Good acting and direction, well written, and the documentary feel and low budget just adds to the suspense. 1978's Dawn of the Dead was, as Roger Ebert put it "an apocalyptic masterpiece," whereas 1985's Day of the Dead was tolerable, and the Savini remake and the recent Land of the Dead were just unnecessary, neither being as compelling as the original material they were based on. If you never bother with another zombie movie, see this one. It ranks with the original Frankenstein as one of the major thrillers of its time, paving the way for inspirational directors like John Carpenter, Wes Craven, David Croninberg and Stuart Gordon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't underestimate the ability of this film to scare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scenes aren't particularly frightening; in fact they're quite amusing and can fool the viewer into thinking this is going to be a fun 90 minutes. Gradually as the characters are introduced within the farmhouse, the film becomes more of a tense thriller, as the zombies are seen less and referred to more. The theme is now the struggle experienced by a group of strangers against an unseen foe. Romero further builds his world by inserting scenes from television broadcasts amidst the character dialog. We know only as much as the television allows us to see, which is all the people in the house are permitted to see.By this point in the film it is feeling more like a stage-play with gripping performances from all the cast, with the drive-in, sci-fi movie feel no longer there. After an hour, the film has convinced us enough what is happening is real and this is when the living dead return into the equation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Licing Dead- Remaking Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Armed with about $100,000 and a cheap camera, George A. Romero set out to make a movie that would redefine the horror genre. The plot is rather simple; due to a satellite crash from Venus spreading radiation, the dead rise and feast of the flesh of the living. A group of survivors hold up in a farmhouse and try to survive the night. As the movie goes on, people learn the rules: 1. Anyone who dies (with a brain still intact) will rise again. 2. If a zombie bites someone, they will die from the infection and then rise again. 3. A zombie can only be destroyed by brain damage, be it a gun shot or a tire iron. The acting and dialogue leave much to be desired, but hey, it's Romero's first and low budget. What's important about this movie is the effect it had on movies after it. Instead of the cheesy predictability of earlier horror movies, Night of the Living Dead brought in new ideas, broke all the old "rules" of horror. Instead of an easy to spot antagonist, this movie has everyone as the monster. Each and every person, regardless of merit, has a chance to become a zombie. Even those still alive pose some threat. Instead of the monster being destroyed at the end, they become stronger. The hero's story ends with a shock (no, it's not racist). Everything that has been established before this movie is shot down. Alright, I admit it, some parts do get boring. Many of the dialogue scenes inside the farmhouse and long and drawn-out, but this I attribute to the budget and actors. Every other part of the movie is relentless in pace, however. You can watch it for the importance or you can watch it for the entertainment, both ways work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie marked the start of the more modern horror movie. It was made on a meager budget and still shone better than the 100+ million dollar movies made today. The entire movie has a very foreboding, melancholy feeling to it. Immediately, at the start of the movie, there's a mood and feeling to the movie that makes you think that something is just not right. Duane Jones in the lead at Ben is brilliant, brave, and still human (in a literal as well as metaphorical way). This movie, often called a "cult classic", deserves a title of Best Zombie Movie Ever! George Romero, the writer and director, is a genius, and the movie is sure to send shivers up your zombie-fearing spine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Influential, a Classic in every sense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To speak of George Romero's debut is to speak of one of the most influential movies in the horror genre. This small low budget flick is the direct heir of the 50s sci-fi horror and of Hitchcock's thrillers, and it sets the tone for what the 70s would bring to the cinema.It is indeed, a product of its time, as it was made in a time of changes and revolutions. This landmark of independent film-making is a true jewel that should be the text book for every aspiring filmmaker, as well as a movie that every horror fan must have in their collection.The plot is amazing in simplicity, a couple of siblings visit the grave of their father when suddenly, a man attacks them and kills the older brother. Barbara (played by Judith O'Dea), his sister, runs away looking for help, only to find herself locked in a house as she notices that the killer was just one of the many living dead who are rising from the grave to eat people.It does seem like a simple story, but that is just because the zombies are only the plot device to gather inside the house a diverse group of people, and Romero goes on exploring the human relationships and the nature of good and evil. The movie is like the direct heir of Hitchcock's "The Birds", where a similar device is used to gather the characters and explore them.Besides the similitude with "The Birds", Romero goes boldly to new levels, trading the Hitchcocknian suspense for visceral horror, giving us the basis for gore in horror movies. The movie is very violent for its time, and sets the tone for the 70s explosion of horror movies.The acting is surprisingly good, considering that the actors had few or none acting experience. Duane Jones as Ben, gives a larger than life performance, and it is amazing the job he does with the role.The ending is still powerful and its social cometary (something that Romero always tries to put in his movies, with mixed results), is still valid today.Overall a classic, Romero would create his masterpiece a few years later with "Dawn of the Dead", my only complain is that it seems that he'll never top those achievements again. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nihilistic horror film that both looks back to the horror films of the fifties with their anxieties about radiation (which here have resurrected the dead) but even more strongly anticipates the extreme gore of those of the seventies. The horrors of "Night of the Living Dead" may have lost some of their punch owing to nearly forty years worth of even more gruesome films, but they're still deeply unsettling?for me, one of the creepiest scenes is the one in which the female zombie walks into a tree and starts gnawing on the bark as mechanically and relentlessly as a relentless great white shark chomping on whatever chance refuse comes in its path.The film also anticipates the essential pessimism of many of the more memorable seventies horror films such as "Last House on the Left" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." In the fifties pictures, whatever havoc might have been caused by the mutant horrors there was always a clear return to normalcy, usually courtesy of a earnest, strong jawed hero. Heroics prove as futile as cowardice in "The Night of the Living Dead"?Ben's attempts to barricade the house are admirable, but in the end, before the onset of hundreds of ghouls prove just as ineffective as the obnoxious Harry said they would. Perhaps the bleakest and most cynical feature of this film is the suggestion at the end that only the actions of a brutal, trigger-happy militia may possibly end the zombie threat.(As for the slow versus fast moving ghoul debate: I prefer the slow ones?as the sheriff says, they're dead and messed up after all!)</fullReview>

Even though the film is in black and white and was created in 1968 it still has the atmosphere needed to scare the living daylights out of todays generation.The film begins with a brother and sister taking a trip to visit their fathers grave in a cemetery in the Pittsburgh countryside. The couple are attacked by what seems to be a drunk human being, untold to the couple the being that attacked them was a walking corpse. The sister runs from the beast leaving the brother for death, but the figure follows her. She stumbles upon a deserted barn house. After looking around the house she discovers a young black man named Ben who is also taking cover in the house. Ben boards up the house hoping its secure enough to last the night. Ben checks out the upstairs and finds a decapitated body lying on the landing. After disposing of it he hears a noise from downstairs. It turns out there are another 5 people who have been hiding in the basement. After much collaboration they join forces. After listening to the radio, they realised that the ghouls walking outside are in fact the dead which have returned and are seeking human flesh and that they have risen due to radiation from a satellite. In the cellar lies a young girl who has fallen ill due to an attack by one of the ghouls. There only hope of survival is to get to the gas pump outside and fill up the truck, and escort the girl to the nearest hospice.After there attempt to get the gas fails, the house is left open for the zombies to feast. Ben locks himself in the cellar as the only one left. As dawn comes so does rescue and zombie shooting seems to be a sport! Ben unlocks the cellar door only to be shot by the rescue party who mistake him for one of the dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Night of The Living Dead" was the first horror film that I had seen. I remember it well: I was an 8 year old and my mother took me and my siblings to the drive in. I don't remember what the second film was, but I remember seeing this movie. I also remember getting so scared that I didn't sleep well for almost a month.Years later, I still creep out when watching this film (Although I had seen worse over the years). The first scare is always the best, they say.A fallen satellite that leaked radiation causes the dead to come to live and wreck havoc on everyone. However, the core of the film centers on an isolated farmhouse in which a group of people (included a young girl that was bitten by a creature)are trying desperately to survive the attack. Barbara (Judith O'Dea)is practically catatonic, having watched one of the creatures kill her brother;Ben (Duane Jones)seems to be the one in charge and with a level head, despite the constant antagonism against Harry (Karl Hardman), who is insistent on staying in the cellar rather than staying upstairs; Tom and Judy (Keith Wayne and Judith Ridley)are the typical young couple in love and Helen (Marilyn Eastman), Harry's wife, is more concerned about her daughter Karen (Kyra Schon), than her jerk of a husband.Never mind about this little character drama. Let's talk about the zombies.There's nothing creepier than watching zombies. Their only goal is to EAT. They're not picky (You see one eating a bug). And they are insistent. They want the occupants of the house for a midnight snack, and nothing will stop them (Except fire and a blow to the brain).George Romero's cult classic film still hold up to this day (Forget about the remake of this film). The ending will bum you out (To this day, I just can't watch the ending). However, if you're a newbie and have avoided this film, then you gotta watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling early horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' proves that zombies can become rather a handful, even when safely (or so you believe) holed up in an abandoned farmhouse. One of the beauties of his story is that the living dead do not march into film in some awesome display of unlocked evil; no, it is far more subtle. This understated tone towards the rising monsters creates an uncertain reality for the viewer, perhaps (one begins to wonder) this isn't as far-fetched as it appears. The undead linger constantly either in foreground or background of this film, even when they do not appear on screen we know they are silently waiting, watching from the outside. The viewer can't help but picture themselves in such a situation, trapped and abandoned with only limited tools to hand. After all...what could you do? As there actions play out Romero plays upon this selection of possible scenarios, would you lock yourself away in the easy-to-defend cellar? But what about escape? Could you take some chance of flight but sacrifice the chance to easily defend yourself? It is difficult not to admire the way we are pulled into this interesting play between characters, in a situation that when we step back is obviously absurd. But will this stop you going and planning your own 'zombie escape plan' for your own home? I doubt it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always believed that atmosphere is far more effective than visual shock value in presenting a truly scary movie. In this respect NOTLD is the scariest, creepiest movie ever made. Even if the scenes of ghouls feasting on human flesh (shocking by 1968 movie standards but tame by todays)had been eliminated and simply implied, this would still be a frightening little gem. Like I said, this movie is fueled by 100% atmosphere. Everything Romero does in this movies direction adds to its sense of dread, be it the black and white filming , the gloomy rural Pennsylvania location or the stock music, all ad to the movies power. From start to finish the tension never lets up and there is nothing in the movie that allow for release. There is no romantic interlude no comic relief. NOTHING. The viewer is left feeling as hopeless as the doomed, trapped occupants of the farmhouse. Had Romero been a Hollywood director, working for a big studio, this film would have never seen the light of day in its current form. It just didn't fit the accepted formula for horror films at that time. This all the more makes the low budget and independent nature of the film so important. Had this been a Hollywood release, it would probably have been just another lame horror movie with a nice formulaic and comfortable ending. One of the few weak points in the script that should have been left out is the explanation for the undead phenomena. In fact Romero never tread that ground again in any of his follow up "dead" movies. The whole Venus probe thing just seemed too simplistic and easy an explanation. No explanation would be scarier. In all this is probably the greatest horror movie of all time. A timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Y think this is the BEST terror movie of all times! A film which has since become a modern classic and which can be argued to have influenced every horror film since. I like very much all the zombies films and this is really the mother of all. All the zombies we see in the films of today are based on the zombies that George Romero introduces here (rigor mortis movement, flesh eaters and the other things). Besides all the things the somber and horrifying environment is very well achieved. If we keep in mind the negligible budget of this movie, the truth is that itself could be consider a masterpiece. Was not a coincidence that "Night of the Living Dead" has been added to the United States National Film Registry in 1999. There is a remake of this movie (1990) and it is also good but i will always prefer the original version. At last i want to say that this film gives you a very good message at the end and it leaves you thinking a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might very well be the greatest horror movie ever made! Geaorge A. Romero has brewed together a rather effective suspense by combining the classical horror elements(flashing lightnings, screaming GIRLS - not men!!!) and the never-before-seen element of sheer massacre. The movie is simply put together of an almost perfect mix of calm sit-back-and-relax-for-a-while scenes and grotesque slaughtering of people. It might be that the plot seems a bit thin, compared to other horror movies, but this is after all a gore movie and not a thriller, and the context of the story fits well into the universe of George A. Romero's Living Dead Trilogy. This is a great capture of how people will react to an uncommon situation; a frustrating situation never before experienced: People screaming, not knowing what to do and therefore hiding in desert areas. And of course we have to complement IL' George for his constantly depressing the viewers, simply using the panic that erupts from the lack of experience. We must say that George A. Romero is the movie world's Master of the Macabre!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No slick tricks to remind us that we've having the wool pulled over our eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Effective low budget shocker because it's so heavily grounded in reality. Big budget horror is rarely disturbing; it's too slick, too studied to convey any authentic menace. Even the film's opening library music carries more atmosphere and dread than a dozen horror flicks with studio backing.NIGHT's black and white photography gives it a newsreel enamel and doesn't remind us that we're watching wool being pulled over our eyes. The actors, all solid, are unknowns, so, once again, the horror seems more real, less manufactured.Confining most of the action to an isolated farmhouse outside Pittsburgh adequately sells the wider menace and creates a sense of claustrophobia. The editing is tight and Romero works hard to keep the pace constant.The tragic climax still resonates close to four decades after this little gem was produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary as Hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently bought this movie off eBay, and was shocked at how good it was. Expecting a moderately good low budget horror, I was knocked on my butt by Romero's no-nonsense approach to the flesh eaters. This movie has fantastic acting, a great plot and great gore effects (what else could the viewers expect from Romero?) The movie starts with a woman and her brother in a cemetery, visiting their dead mother, when they are attacked by a zombie right off the bat. No (explicit)ing around with useless plot points, just BOOM, zombies! So she runs off and is attacked by more zombies. She hides in a farmhouse, and kills a zombie, then a guy comes, and drives a crowbar through the skull of a zombie. This goes on for just about the whole movie, just more people coming, arguing what to do, trying to make the best of the situation, all while brutally slaughtering flesh eating zombies. The sub-plots are what make the movie a masterpiece, while the action is what keeps it going.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original is the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "Night of the living dead" on TV as a kid and it scared me. Since then I have viewed it many times and own it on DVD. It's a staple around Halloween time. It was a groundbreaking horror movie and was often imitated but never duplicated. Constant copycat movies may make it seem tame by today's standards, but it is still creepy. The humor, intentional or not, is priceless. This movie set the bar for what was to follow. It's low budget ambiance and black and white film set it apart from any other film. It's also maybe the first film to contain a black hero. Watching this movie late at night with the lights off would be recommended. Watch it to be scared, watch it as a goof, but if you're a horror film fan, definitely watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie that bred the zombie genre is as good as you think. Its lost some of its power to shock, but has still stood the test of time perfectly.We start out with Johnny and his sister Barbara at a cemetery to place a wreath on their father's grave. This is just where the story starts but is one of the best scenes in film history. What follows is an adventure that's more than just a popcorn horror fare. It speaks to the audience, people, about our reactions to crisis scenarios. Its scary to this day, I myself prefer the slow moving zombies who lurch forward at an inch per hour.Of course the film centers around 7 people in the farmhouse, wading off the zombies hoping simply to get out and survive. They all have the same goals, but we can see the chaotic ways they set out to accomplish them. It was a perfect movie for the time it was released, even speaking on some levels about the racism in everyday situations in America. The effects may look cheesy but they are just a subplot, as are the zombies themselves. The zombies still are effective in how they are shown and portrayed, and the end is both disturbing and realistic, a harrowing touch of 60's reality to an otherwise 'fantasy' element type film.In summary its the perfect zombie film to start off a generation of zombie films. It speaks on a grand scale to audiences and still is just as good today as it always has been. See it at all costs even if you're not a fan of this type of stuff. One final word of advice, never see the ridiculous 30th Anniversary Edition. Just hope you can find an original copy of the original film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to define this movie if not one of the best of all time? From the creepy placidity of the opening credits to the eerie freeze-frame ending in which the hero is burned next to (did I see right?) the first victim, Johnny, and the first 'Living Dead' we see, this movie has it all. Everybody and their sexual fetish know that in horror, it's better to suggest than to show, and NOTLD builds and builds and builds on this, with moments that take the action to another different place, I am talking about the scenes in which the survivors are watching the news; it creeps you out even more, because, as said in one of the two other movies of the trilogy, 'It's everywhere.' The characters may seem stereotypical, but at a closer look, they develop, particularly Barbara in her last minutes, where she dives into danger to save Helen, if only for a few seconds, and then meeting an untimely, sad and shocking end (off-screen) at the hands of her own brother.Anyway, to anyone who boos this movie, I say, watch it once, and tell me if you don't feel like you ARE in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first viewed Night of the Living Dead I saw two things, first I was screwed out of the black and white version but I saw it later and I saw a masterpiece. It seemed like it could happen and I related to the people. I like the political views because I thought Romero was brave for having a black man in the film and as the star but somethings were wrong for me which is why I didn't give it a ten. First there was the small mistakes in the film like how it was light and five seconds later it was magically night. Romero should have done the Barbra and Johnny scenes at sunset so it made sense. Also I saw Dawn of the Dead before so maybe I was expecting more even though I had seen the film many years ago. The ending was a masterpiece and made me feel like yes this could happen because in life it's never a happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968)starring: Duane Jones, Judith O'Dea, Karl Hardman, Marilyn Eastman, Keith Wayne, Judith Ridley.plot: The strong-willed Ben (Duane Jones) and the delirious Barbara (Judith O'Dea) find themselves trapped in a farmhouse with five other people while the outside world is overrun by flesh-eating zombies.the good: Although this is a low-budget, 37-year-old horror film, it is still an amazing look at what the world would be like if the recently dead were to rise and hunt down humans for food.Even though Judith O'Dea's character mostly just sits around and cries and screams (which is understandable considering what she's been through), the rest of the cast does just fine, my favorite being Duane Jones as Ben. I love how there were many racist people in the 60's but Eartha Kitt still played Catwoman on the BATMAN show, and Duane Jones plays a great character here. He felt very natural and was a guy I'd like to have a beer with! He was no stereotype and I loved that.George A. Romero's direction should also be mentioned, he created a dark, eerie atmosphere, and even if he stole some from CARNIVAL OF SOULS, he still did great, as he did with the rest of the series.One more thing I'll mention is the ending, it was very honest and realistic. It is still depressing but it is something that could have happened in that situation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Real Zombie Film from George Andrew Romero.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During one late Sunday afternoon, a brother by the name of Johnny (Russell Streiner) and his sister-Barbara (Judith O'Dea) visit their mother's grave. When Barbara is attack by a strange man. Her brother tries to save her but ended up getting killed. Barbara ends up running for her life and take shelter in a old farmhouse. She finds herself with a sensitive but tough African American man (Daune Jones) and a few people (Karl Hardman, Marilyn Eastman, Keith Wayne, Judith Ridley and Kyra Schon) in the house. Then later, they finds themselves trapped in the farmhouse and these strange people are trying to get in the house. The people trapped in the house find out that these strange people are actually the dead coming back to life from a freak accident by a space probe, which is return sent by NASA. This space probe is highly radioactive that wage a relentless attack, killing (and eating) everyone in their path.The premise of this film does sound Hokey but it works, thanks to Co-Writer/Director:George A. Romero (The Crazies, Martin). This is Romero's first film. Romero borrows inspirations from the film-Carnival of Souls (1962) and Richard Matheson's novel-I Am Legend (Which it was previously filmed as The Last Man on Earth and The Omega Man). Romero wrote the script with John A. Russo (The Return of the Living Dead). This is a smart screenplay. The only real fault is the Cast, which it is a mix of professional and amateurish performances. But in someways, that what makes the film realistic. Romero and Russo never let their characters have the easy way out. Night of the Living Dead went on to be a Cult Favorite and went to be a Worldwide Hit.The Best DVD to view "Night of the Living Dead" is from Elite Entertainment. Which the DVD contains two audio commentary tracks by the Cast &amp; Filmmakers. DVD is presented in the Original 16mm aspect ratio. DVD has been remastered in THX with Superior Picture and Sound Quality with the original Mono soundtrack with the first time in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also contains the original script, trailer, film parody titled "Night of the Living Bread" and more. Night of the Living Dead ended up remade in 1990 with the original creators:George A. Romero and Producers:Russell Streiner and John A. Russo. The remake is not as affected as the original. But the original 1968 film proves that the Original is always better than the remake. DVD from 20th Century Fox is been colorized and the film looks odd and even foolish in color. DVD has an fine Pan &amp; Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an good digitally remastered:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in DTS 5.1 Surround Sound). This DVD is also included in the original Black &amp; White (Which the Elite DVD has an sharper transfer in the Black and White Print). Too Bad, the Black &amp; White Print only has the Dolby 2.0 Mono Sound. Since the Colorized version has the Dolby/DTS Tracks! DVD's oddest feature is the running commentary by the Mystery Science Theater 3000 Fame:Mike Nelson!. Which Nelson comments has some amusing moments and hilarious jokes about the cast in the film. Despite the DVD from Fox, the Elite DVD is worth getting. Only die-hard of the original 1968 film will get the colorized version on DVD. The new DVD from Dimension Extreme has an new stronger Full Screen transfer although the sound reminds Mono for the 40th anniversary edition. It has some of the same special features from the Elite Disc like commentary tracks for example. But the best thing about the new DVD is the 83 minute documentary from the cast &amp; crew talking about... how was like to make this instant real cult classic and an 15 minute featurette with Romero. There's plenty of DVD's of Romero's movie out-there, because it doesn't have no copyright. Romero and the producers would have been richer in their wildest dreams if they put that copyright. "Night of the Living Dead" is still talked about for over 40 years and it still remains of One of Romero's Best. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Night of the Living Dead, I was about 17 or 18, and 5 years on, and about 30-40 odd horror flicks later, if you ask me what the best horror movie I ever saw was, Night of the Living Dead is still right there, the only answer in my mind. Yes, Psycho is more artistically shot, yes, the Shining is more epic, but nothing matches the sheer raw atmosphere or impact of this giant among movies.As is often the case, it's much harder to write coherently what makes a movie great than explain a movie's minor flaws, but I'll try my best to explain why I think this is such a wonderful film. For a start, the movie's rough, untouched look was a stark contrast with the glossy look of films that were coming out of Hollywood at the time. Look across at The Italian Job, made around the same time, and the movies are like different worlds. Shot in grainy undoctored black and white, NotLD has a brutal, almost documentary feel that's rarely been improved upon, and makes the horror immediate and tangible.The way the movie looks counts for a part of its impact, but the movie's taut, knife-edge atmosphere, jarring shocks and brutal violence count for the rest. Simply put, Night of the Living Dead eats movies like the Ring whole and spits out their bones, even all these years on. From the first zombie attack right through to the chilling, unexpected climax, it has you by the throat and refuses to let go. Even by today's standards, this is a violent, chilling ride that you won't soon forget. Parts of this movie are still absolutely horrifying, and scenes like the zombie child turning on her mother are so intense and visceral that no studio nowadays would dream of allowing them. Basically, this movie is horrific, resonant and just downright nasty, and you won't be able to shake any of it from your mind, which is just how a horror movie should be.Personally, I can't think of a movie more worthy of the title of 'ultimate horror movie' and I know people will dispute that, and you're welcome to do so as this is just one man's opinion, but Night of the Living Dead will always be my choice. I don't think indie horror, or indeed film itself would have been the same without it, and I'm damned if it isn't still one of the scariest films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

In order to rate this one I'm not going to compare it to anything made today that just wouldn't be fair now would it? The movie kicks off with two people visiting their father's grave and soon they are attacked by a man walking strangely. Soon the sister finds herself trapped in a house surrounded by zombies with one other man who still has the will to survive, fight, and beat the zombies. As the movie goes on they board up the house and make it their fortress while planning a way to get to the fuel pump to refill the truck's gas. More people are discovered in the house who were hiding out downstairs and the hysteria only twists from there. After the movie ended I was satisfied. Good ending.

		<shortDescription>The granddaddy of all zombie movies, as classic &amp; influential now, as it was then!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was a groundbreaking success that made GEORGE A. ROMERO a horror fan sensation almost over night! Every cliché, every thing you see in zombie films today started here! Romero's film wrote the guide book rules that practically every genre film- makers has followed, when putting together their own zombie flick. Romero not only made history with this film, but the horror genre (certainly the zombie genre) would literally never be the same again. Romero took the least scariest horror movie villain - the zombie &amp; turned it into a very scary &amp; effective nightmarish creature. Gone were the days when the zombie was a bug eyed, emotionless, non rotting, non flesh eating slave, that did the bidding of it's master (usually played by horror legends like BELA LUGOSI) &amp; usually had it's story set on the islands of Hati, with the creature usually brought into this state, through various voodoo methods. Romero's zombie couldn't be controlled, had no memory of who, or what it was before death &amp; ate human flesh &amp; could pass it's disease &amp; flesh eating tendencies onto anyone it bit, was rotting away &amp; could only be killed with a shot to the brain &amp; it's also the first film to make a black man the hero of the story, as well as dealing with subjects like patricide &amp; cannibalism. Indeed no one ever seen a horror film, much less a zombie film, like it. The film is very haunting &amp; very thought provoking. The acting for the most part minus a few, is quiet poor &amp; the films minuscule budget forbid the film- makers from doing some spectacular zombie make-ups, most of the stiffs here are just covered with some fake blood &amp; mortician's wax. GEORGE A. ROMERO proves to have some directing skills &amp; manages to really ratchet up the tension &amp; suspense, particularly with the opener, which is one of the scariest openers to ever grace a horror flick! Romero also infuses the film with some pitch black humour, such as Johnny (the lead heroine's brother) telling Barbara that the dead are coming to get her, only for him to be the one they first go after!. The down beat ending which sees the black hero BEN shot &amp; killed by a posse, was quiet controversial at the time with many saying that the film was pointing at the racial tensions &amp; bigotry going on at the time. Depsite Romero denying this, it's hard not to think the film isn't carrying some type of message, especially on the subject of communism. Much like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956) the zombies here are seen as cold, emotionless people, that have one day taken over the world. The character of Harry is presented here as a character that can be seen as a barely concealed swipe at racial bigotry, especially in his visible hatred for Ben, who is a black man trying to keep everyone safe in the farmhouse. The lead hero's death caused quite a controversy when Romero tried to sell the film, since studios were worried about how such an ending would be received by the public, in the wake of the assassination of many famous world leaders &amp; speakers. With student riots, Vietnam protests &amp; all the other things mentioned going on at the time, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD arrived right in the midst of a time, when the world looked like it was falling apart rapidly. Sadly the Vietnam war also stopped make-up effects wizard TOM SAVINI from doing much better zombie make-up effects work here, since he was drafted before filming commenced. Ironically enough, the term "zombie" is never used here, since Romero &amp; company choose instead to call them "ghouls" Romero's film is clearly a rip-off of I AM LEGEND, LAST MAN ON EARTH &amp; OMEGA MAN, since the plots are so similar, with zombies replacing vampires as the main villains. Romero's cash strapped budget also caused him to fall back on library music, but in my eyes that was a blessing in disguise, since it's hard to imagine any other score gracing the film, much less making it effective as it was &amp; still is (the score is so creepy!). BILL "CHILLY WILLY" CARDILLE plays one of the zombies, in fact his daughter would go on to play the lead heroine in DAY OF THE DEAD (Lori Cardille). A must see for horror fans.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD unfortunately was not copyrighted &amp; as a result, anyone can do their own version of it. To date their have been seven remakes! NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1990) NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 3D (&amp; it's sequel) NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD ORIGINS 3D, NIGHT OF THE LIVING 3D DEAD, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (2004 unreleased Canadian version) NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: RESURRECTION, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: RE- ANIMATED (An animated feature) &amp; spoofed in MIMESIS: NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD &amp; ANOTHER NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Beware the 30th anniversary edition of this movie that arrived in 1998! it has new footage added, that at the time had been recently shot by this films co-writer JOHN RUSSO, that saw the late BILL HINZMAN'S zombie character, going off on his own rampage. Not only is it terrible &amp; adds nothing to the film, but scenes were cut out to make sure it fit &amp; a lot of the music was replaced, with a new score done by a group called Vlad &amp; The Dark Theater. Later colourized. Several sequels &amp; prequels followed, DAWN OF THE DEAD (&amp; it's remake), DAY OF THE DEAD (&amp; it's remake &amp; unofficial sequel), LAND OF THE DEAD, DIARY OF THE DEAD, SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD &amp; countless spin-off's such as CHILDREN OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD (&amp; it's four sequels) &amp; FLESH EATER. Followed (timeline wise) by DIARY OF THE DEAD**** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, it's true, a new version of the 1968 Romero classic. And yes, it does do the original justice. It's called "Night of the Living Dead SURVIVOR'S CUT."Before you jump to conclusions...I realize that some folks just don't like sequels or remakes no matter how well done, and after a number of horrible re-releases thru the years (like the "anniversary" editions) I too wondered just how good this new version could be.The story has been rearranged a little with some new footage, and some very cool color and special-effects. You'll see new scenes like "flashbacks" and cool gory skulls. Those of you with a keen eye may like to take special notice in order to see the use of new camera angles and movement that creates perspective and a new dynamic throughout the film. This film moves much faster than the original, it runs about 72 minutes. So I give a very positive review, and I hope to get my hands on a high-resolution DVD some day.In the meantime, take my advice: open your mind, and check it out FREE.

		<fullReview>Classic, no other way around it this is one of the most influential horror films ever. The dead have risen to feast on the living! They get up and kill the people they kill get up and kill! George Romero has managed to create the most horrific vision of the end of the world. And it all starts here, in a small house in the countryside, where seven people try to survive the night. One of the greatest things Romero has done is not only document the people inside the house, but also show radio and television broadcasts covering the phenomenon. The use of the media is a shocking testament to the true magnitude of these events. If you've ever enjoyed a single zombie film be it Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, or even Shaun of the Dead, you owe it to yourself to see this film and find out where it all began.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look at the budget, not a bad film. Not a bad film for the budget. Night of the living dead is done on a shoe string budget, and I mean cheap. The producers could help with the US budget! Chilling but the acting is sort of Death Race 2000ish, awkward, but believable enough. Speaking of Death Race 2000, I bought Night of the Living Dead and Death Race 2000 for 2.98 at Zellars for a cheap movie night last weekend. The DVD's were cheaper than renting at Rogers or Block Busters. Enough off topic review, the directing and story save the movie's short comings. The survival concept keeps the viewer interested. I noticed a few events I would have done different. Why would they turn all the house lights on, would that not attract more Zombies? The windows get boarded up, but the kitchen window is left unboarded. The ending is effective, how the protagonist thought he survived. Well, you'll see if you watch this movie. A 6 out of 10. Hey a lot of the new computer generated movies create inferior films. Not bad for cheap 2 for 1 dvds in the clearance bin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ultra black and white. Nail-biting suspense. Ahead of its time(1968). Acceptable acting bymain characters in an unknown cast. Good music. Low budget effects. Right off the bat, the first character should havelistened to the radio... A radio announcer reports, "...there is anepidemic of mass murder being committed by a virtual army ofunidentified assassins. The murders are taking place in villages, cities, rural homes, and suburbs with no apparent pattern or reason for the slaying. It seems to be a sudden general explosion of mass homicide..."The main character,Ben, an African American male, shows Romero's genius in film-making for the avant-garde approach. The army of zombies keeps advancing on the boundaries of the house that the "innocent" living have boarded up. The weapons are basic, with Ben brandishing a 30/30 rifle. Ben does however stirike a woman. Other survivors enter the house. The men vie for the pursuit of the alpha-male position. Zombies are creepy crawling outside the house while the living characters bicker and plan their fate. While the characters are watching television the possible reason for why zombies exist is given. Neat molotov cocktail scene. Fire and shooting the zombies in the head is their kryptonite. Some eating of human flesh. "Psycho" stabbing. Scenes of nature are disturbed by a ubiquitous helicopter that is in all three George A. Romero movies, "Dawn of The Dead"(1978) and "Day of The Dead"(1985). Still photographs depict a Hitchcockian twist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Movie is one of the most Spoofed Movies of all time. The Opening Scene in the Cementary brilliantly done. This Movie was the blue print for every ZOMBIE Movie made after it. The filming of it in B&amp;W due to George A. Romero's lack of Funding of the movie actually makes in more effective to look at. Of Course, it isn't as gory as Dawn Of The Dead or Day Of The Dead(The sequels to this) but it looks A lot more in the CLASSIC style of B&amp;W Vampire movies of the 1930's, 40's and 50's, IMO. George A. Romero is a GENIUS. This ranks as(IMO)one of the best movies ever made. Plain and Simple.The 2 sequels to this are AWESOME movies as well. All 3 of these movies are worth seeing.5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>romero's first of his living dead series. this one released in 1968 was cutting edge for its time. this horror film about the dead coming to life is amazing. simple as that. although there were B-movie sequels this one romeros night of the living dead is the best one. also there is a sweet 1967 GTO in the beginning. this film is a gem that all true film fans should not only see but own. romero definitely was w\one of the directors that helped to shape the genre. if you have ever thought about seeing this film i definitely recommend that you go out and see it. it gave me chills the first time that i saw it. it is great. this is one of the films that never gets old no matter how many times you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first masterpiece in a trilogy of masterpieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What else can be said on the first example of modern horror movie (with PSYCHO)? The idea is simple but powerful: a group of people find themselves trapped in a farmhouse as prey for living dead that rise from the grave with no apparent reason. They should cooperate, but they don't and this will be their condemn. I don't know why I haven't read yet a review or an article on this movie where somebody talk about the three units of the tragedy by Aristotele, since they are well respected. The same, actually, can be said about THE EVIL DEAD and some others, since every low- budget genre movie revolves about the same place and time. I think this is a consideration that they can do only with totally respected auteur as Kubrick: no matter if SHINING is also a horror movie or that NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is a work of art (yes: art). Romero's first movie, in some people's opinion, is still a dirty drive-in low budget flick which has become a classic only for dumbs. Instead is a great horror movie and even contains a germ (since Romero was young at that time) of social commentary and satire, which is not bad for a so - called drive-in flick. I don't actually need a social metaphor or similar to enjoy and love a movie, but if this element is present, I must mention it among the virtues of the flick. I could go on for ages, but it would be useless: the movie doesn't need to be defended. It can do everything on its own. You just have to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Romero really hit it out of the park with this one. Like Carnival of Souls, this movie's low-end production values really work for it by giving it an almost documentary feel.Of course the reason for the dead coming back to life is pure 50's sci-fi (unknown radiation brought back via Venusian probe), but who cares? In a few decades everyone will be able to tell a 2000's zombie movie by the fact that all zombies arise from biohazards. This movie, along with the original Dawn of the Dead, really did set the standard for all subsequent zombie flicks.Despite the lack of pointless nudity, this movie earns a solid five out of five stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the film stock was black and white, the characters and story wereanything but. The actors were above par for the day, hitting their marks with laser likeaccuracy. It was a horror film that failed to explain its monster, unlike cheesy aliens or products of toxic waste, they simply existed and had to be dealt with.Night of the living Dead succeeded because it never showed off with expensive sets or masks, the make up was made to look as realistic as ex Vietnam veteran Tom Savini could render. It played like a documentary based upon zombie survival than a contrived story, which adds to its bizare reality. There are no heroes or survivors in this tale, truly a tragic horror that so many tried yet failed to emulate. They don't make them like they used to, but with D4 on its way, it's good to know Romero is still trying, god bless him!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first of director Romero's undead trilogy is his best. This is a film that brilliantly exudes fear, dread, and shock all at the same time. From the great performances, to the nightmarish premise, this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made.In 1968 when it was released, it was light years ahead of its time,and the casting of a black leading man, combined with flesh eating ghouls certainly added shock value to the film. And don't let anyone fool you...it's best viewed in its original black and white to get the full effect. Almost every shocking/gory horror movie made since owes its existence to Night Of The Living Dead.My rating....Classic 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but not bad either...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the original and the 30th Anniversary editions. The latter adds nothing to the film and its cheesiness detracts from the original.The film is a B/C grade horror about the "newly dead" coming back to life and eating the living and...making their victims zombies too. As the audio commentary in the 30th anniversary edition points out, subsequent 'exploitation' zombie movies forget about only the newly dead turning into zombies. I can't say whether this film set the rules for zombie movies, though, amusingly, the audio commentary has the makers poking fun of one of their own for claiming to have 'invented' the zombie movie genre, as well as inventing doilies!There is some half-baked hint at what caused the creation of zombies-something about a NASA mission gone bad-can't work out what all that was about-something about a satellite in outer space affecting the dead here? Or what? ...ANYWAY...The black dude is impressive in the lead, and the guy in the cellar is suitably annoying as the guy with a different view to the black guy on how to respond to the zombie thingo.The film does have a scene of cannibalism, which, personally, I didn't find too odious.Lastly, I found the ending of the original film interesting-snap-shots of police officers with corpses. Made me wonder if there was a connection to the old Southern practice of going out and killing blacks, KKK style, and taking 'happy snaps' of their 'trophies'-not unlike that which also happened recently at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Any inside info from Americans on this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" was like a shotgun blast to the face of those who thought that this was going to be another pointless "B"-flick where the hero gets the girl and slaughters hordes of flesh-hungry zombies with a vengeance. Not so, as many found out and like any classic horror film, "Night of the Living Dead" has rightfully earned a place in cinema history as a landmark.Released in 1968, post-Kennedy's shattered vision of Camelot, an ambitious filmmaker named George A. Romero grabbed up a camera and started rolling, capturing the actions and horror of a group of people who hold up inside a farmhouse as hordes of the living dead storm the countryside and proceed to lay siege to the terrified occupants inside.There are no heroes in "Night of the Living Dead," only people who make quick decisions and end up either dead or alive to reap the consequences of those decisions. Most characters are either strong and determined (like Duane Jones' character) or are blatantly stupid and reckless (Karl Hardman's character)."Night of the Living Dead" did of course, virtually define a new genre - the zombie flick. Romero would follow up "Night" with two sequels: the adrenalin-laced action epic "Dawn of the Dead" in 1978 and the claustrophobic, tension-filled closer "Day of the Dead" in 1985. And there were also plenty of knock-offs over the years too.What helped to make "Night" so popular was that it was filmed in no particular style, thus giving it a unique and genuine feel; it was almost as if what you were seeing on screen was actually happening. Looking at "Night" during the day is surely your best bet, since I certainly wouldn't recommend doing so.Even in 2004, "Night of the Living Dead" still shocks its viewers, with the gore, tension, and genuine frights.

		<fullReview>Just as Psycho opened the door to the slasher/mystery generation this film opened the door to true horror. And is still truly scary. If you don't like black and white, get the colorized DVD. You'd be surprised how well the colorization is done. The film is better than recent zombie films like Resident Evil. Why you ask, well because it builds tension and it is actual horror. The remake isn't very good, it changed things trying to make the story better but falls flat and makes it too stereotypical. If you like this film you should check out its sequel Dawn of the dead, but be warned Dawn of the deads remake is BETTER and works as a better sequel to this film than the original dawn. So for all you horror buffs, or zombie fans this ones for you. 8/10I also recommend: The Amityville Horror 6/10 (remake in progress)Texas Chainsaw Massacre 6/10 (remake 8/10)Resident Evil 5/10 (sequal 6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1968...Black and white...Pittsburgh, PA...George Romero embarks on a movie that changed the face of horror movies and gave a kick to cinema itself. Low budget, big guts = Night of the Living Dead. The movie of monumental zombies that started a legacy and a Romero fanbase around the world. The zombie are slow, cruel, and trying to eat everything in sight. Very classic and enjoyable even the 50th time you've seen it. Though it appears as a zombie movie it definitely is a metaphor for inner turmoil and the society of the 1960's. The movie has inspired many directors, rip offs, and a trilogy. Without this movie, horror would not be the same. So take a walk through the graveyard and run to the farmhouse, board up the doors and windows and put this flick on. It definitely won't disappoint!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seminal grand-daddy of zombie horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It goes without saying by those who know me that I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil series. This franchise is based on the concept of a virus infecting lab workers attempting to cultivate it for biological weaponry. Once infection begins in this small area, it spreads and seems never-ending.Well, it is pretty well known that this series is based on the very concepts which originated in Romero's superb Night of the Living Dead.This 1968 zombie horror introduced the idea of something causing the dead to live again, but with only one objective - kill and eat people.The story begins with Barbra and Jonny, 2 siblings visiting the grave of their father. However, when they are attacked by a man who seems to be in some kind of trance, and Jonny is knocked unconscious, Barbra flees for the sanctuary of a nearby house. However, the man who attacked her has been joined by similarly tranced buddies, and they remain camped outside the house waiting for her. She is soon joined by Ben who is also escaping the onslaught, and he proceeds to to attempt to protect the 2 of them. Some more people emerge from the house cellar, and together the group of them try to to formulate a plan to escape this nightmare with their lives.Night of the Living Dead was the baby of debutant director and sreen-writer George Romero, who's now gained a place in the hearts of horror fans with his nightmare vision of the house under siege from flesh-eating zombies.There is no question the scenes of the zombies feasting on human remains are hard-hitting, and even now they still smart, probably more effectively because the movie is in black and white. This gave it a truly creepy charm which led us to use our imagination a little.The performances are hardly important, but as cheesy as they are, they serve a purpose and the actors do a decent job of acting scared.One particularly nice touch is the use of the medias, such as radio and TV. They genuinely make the story seem altogether more real despite the subject matter, with the characters frequently tuning into broadcasts which are reporting the latest developments along with their very own 'on-location' reporters. There is, also, an extremely effective air of hopelessness portrayed throughout. You never for a moment think it's going to be an entirely happy ending, so it is by no means spoiling anything to say the despair throughout has a reason.Furthermore, the entire story essentially takes place in the house they're trapped in, so it has a great claustrophobic feel to it, and yet the lack of variety never causes boredom for a second.There are even signs of the inspiration the Resident Evil series took from this, with actual moments in the movie later incorporated into the games.Overall this is a remarkable movie which still remains in the upper echelon of movie-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>night of the living dead is still as amazing as it was when it opened in 1968, which spawned two George Romero sequels. The story is about a girl whose brother is killed by a zombie. She then flees to an abandoned house with others who fight flesh-eating zombies from coming inside, while the world is being plagued by them. It turns out that a probe brought back from Venus contained an alien virus that re-animates the dead. If a zombie attacks a human, that human will also become one of the cannibalistic creatures.

		<shortDescription>Don Rickles meets Julia Roberts in the Romero Zone !(spoilers possible)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those are the two celebrities that Harry and Helen Cooper remind me of.Specifically, an older, middle-aged, declining Julia Roberts, as she will perhaps be in ten to twenty years, as she's already described herself in the 1999 film "Notting Hill". I am being subjective in this review, because I think my subjective reactions to, and memories of, this film, are the most unique thing I have to offer about it.I remember being scared by ads for this film on the radio in November 1968. I think WMCA 570 Khz AM in NYC (home of "The Good Guys") played these ads. They contained horrible, jagged, five note (or chord) piano music, between the spoken words "Night" and "of the Living Dead". The radio ad also contained screams, and the tag line, "The living ... whose bodies are the only food for these ungodly creatures !"I remember looking at a TV Guide cover while hearing these ads. The cover showed Robert Morse and E.J. Peaker, stars and co-hosts of the ABC variety show, "That's Life" ! The fear I felt from the radio ad made E.J. Peaker's smiling, big-toothed face, surmounted by a blond bangs and pony-tailed hairdo, look horrible and menacing, like that of a vampire. Date that TV Guide cover, and you've dated those radio ads.I didn't see the film in a theater. Still haven't, to this day. I remember a Reader's Digest article about in, I think, their May 1969 issue. It summarized the film, described how children had been scared by it, urged more caution on the part of parents, and suggested that the then-new G M R X rating system may have been of some help, except that the Walter Reade Organization, the film's distributor, refused to subscribe to this system.I first saw the film on ABC TV on a Friday night in mid-March 1973. I found it moderately scary, mostly because I saw it at night. I remember listening to the radio after the film was over, and thinking that the discordant vocalizing in War's single "The Cisco Kid", reminded me of the moans of the attacking ghouls in the film. A caller to a radio talk show said he'd just seen the film on TV, and had been sexually aroused by it, urging his fellow listeners to get off in one great orgasm of disgust. The talk show host told him he was sick. A week later, when I attended college orientation, I saw that the newspaper of my college-to-be, had a brief humorous article about the film, with a photo of the face of the half-eaten "lady upstairs".To quote Stephen King, in the film, Romero plays many taboos like a virtuoso, to the hilt. Not only of course cannibalism, being burned alive, necrophilia, matricide, patricide, fratricide, and sister-cide, but : a white woman at first apparently alone in a house at night with a black man, and a blond white woman, at that. When Ben puts the unconscious Barbara on a couch, then unbuttons and unbelts her overcoat to help her breathe more easily, does the racist in us ask : is he going to fondle, molest, rape her ? No, he's a man of honor, and too focused on barricading himself into the house to protect himself and Barbara against the marauding ghouls.The film has a great economy of effect. Romero scares us, not only with the ghouls, but by making the "good guys" look grotesque also. There's Barbara's bulging forehead, high hairline, and weak chin. The black smudge on Harry Cooper's bald pate, that suggests a bullet hole. The sudden successive view of animal heads mounted on a den wall is reminiscent of a later scene, in a museum, in the "Escape Route" segment of the "Night Gallery" pilot TV movie.In her review of "The Exorcist" for The New Yorker, Pauline Kael commented on the novel it was based on, remarking that, what Blatty did not have his characters do, he had them talk about, thereby providing flip-page torture, cannibalism, sadism, and lycanthropy. Romero does something similar in NOTLD, with the voices of the radio and, later, TV, announcers, speaking of victims showing signs of having been partially devoured (thereby confirming our worst fears concerning the half-eaten face of the lady upstairs, with its exposed eyeball, teeth, and gums, reminiscent of Bert I. Gordon's "The Cyclops") and of the corpse in the morgue from which the limbs had been amputated, which, nonetheless, opened its eyes, and tried to move its trunk.There is also Ben's story of what happened to him at Beekman's Diner, all the more horrific, because we know its sole audience is the in-shock, and, at best, half-comprehending, Barbara. It also foreshadows Tom and Judy's fate in the ill-fated truck later on.Speaking of "The Exorcist", junior ghoul Karen Cooper's trowel attack on her mother both prefigures and surpasses Regan MacNeil's attack on her mother in "The Exorcist", albeit without self-mutilation with a crucifix, followed by an invitation to cunnilingus and mother-daughter oral incest. One can't have everything, but, as a bonus and an aside, note the taboos that Blatty played like a virtuoso in HIS novel and film. Humor ? Sure. Mostly the sheriff, and his numbnuts posse : "Get a club or a torch, beat 'em or burn 'em." "Kill the brain, and you kill the ghoul !" "These ghouls are slow-moving ?" "Yeah, they're dead, they're ... all messed up !"Unanswered questions : who was the half-eaten lady upstairs, and how did she get there ? Where did all the ghouls that laid siege to the farmhouse come from, and why was there an ever-increasing number of them ? Did they come from the cemetery where Barbara's father was buried ? Did they unearth themselves ? They would have had a long walk ... er, lurch ... from the nearest hospital, morgue, or funeral home, to the abandoned farm house, and would have sought closer victims in adjacent towns and cities first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, its low budget. Yes, it is in black and white. Yes, it has a cast largely made up of amateurs. So why is it simply the greatest horror film ever made?The fact that it is all the above things is what makes it work....there are no A-list stars who carry 'baggage' with them; the atmosphere created purely through lack of budget (and professional actors) is one that is totally believable; the documentary feel of black and white film adds to the horror and credibility of the narrative.One of the essential aspects of horror is the 'who do you trust?' ethic. That is displayed here in spades to the point where there is nowhere to turn to - either for the characters or the audience - no one is heroically going to save the day. This horror in its purest cinematic and personal sense.(slight spoiler) It also has the most downbeat ending this side of Fincher's 'Seven'...what more could a horror fan - or a fan of film in general - ask for?Forget the apparent 'negatives' associated with low budget, black and white film...this is the film by which all successive horror films - and independent films - have to be judged by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Thing About 'Night...' Is Its Public Domain!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off; this refers to the original 1968 theatrical version and not the bastardized (so-called) 30th anniversary edition. (On that edition, 15 minutes are cut; and 15 minutes of pointless 'newly filmed' material is added that is insulting to the whole 'DEAD' storyline that undermines the entire worldwide apocalyptic horror). For one of the few times in horror movie history; the phrase "there's no where to run" means...well; there's really no place to run. They're Everywhere!!!Second! The transfer! I was absolutely floored by the high quality THX transfer from Elite Entertainment's Millennium Edition. If you haven't seen this film on this particular DVD transfer, then (unfortunately) any comment on the poor black and white film quality is in error. The blacks and grays are rich, the lights have a sharp contrast; in short: it is the best quality version of this film I've ever seen. I don't recall the film looking this good even at the theater back when I sat quaking to it in the early 70's (70 or 71). And all this time I was suspicious that this was shot in 16mm. Thank You Public Domain for all the greedy distributors making the fast (unearned) buck and depriving the rest of the world who were ripped off from seeing this movie the way it was meant to be seen.Third! The Movie! It's still scary after all these years (aided by this DVD transfer) and arguably the scariest of the three ('Dawn' and 'Day of'). Its low budget is its asset (rare in a horror flick) and its approach to the mounting terror via radio and TV broadcasts that reveals the catastrophe on a global level is achieved with stark realism. A few shocks; then a slow buildup to its ripping climax; let's face it: today's directors don't have the guts (or intelligence) to tackle such an approach without feeling an obligation to standardize their story with "blood and guts every 16 minutes". This story feels real; the characters react realistically (even with spotty acting) and the audience is carried away to horror heaven.In hindsight and ironically; our hero Ben's well intentioned but short sighted plan is another tragedy. If only everyone believed and listened to poor misunderstood Harry, who had a true sense of what the 'house of seven' were up against. It is a symbol of the collapse, caused by human arrogance that is another staple that brings about the characters' downfall: a downfall that will continue to escalate in "Dawn of the Dead" and reach rock bottom in "Day of the Dead".The One That Started It All! Justifiably; and for good reason! And for once...I'm not sure I can recommend popcorn to munch on while watching. There'll be enough "munching" taking place on screen that could curdle anyone's butter coating.Bring on Romero's "Land of the Dead"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Zombie Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night Of The Living Dead is "the" classic zombie movie. It's not the very first zombie movie of course, but it probably is the first "modern" zombie movie. It's kind of the grand-daddy of the modern flesh eating zombie types. Some of the zombie movies that came after this one became a bit corny or comedic. This movie takes things very seriously. There are some obvious things that make this movie work so well for me. It's well acted, excellently paced, and scary. However it's the less obvious things that make this movie classic material. First, Night Of The Living Dead is about rampaging zombies but, it is also about human nature, human interaction, and ultimately human failing. The troubles that the main human characters get into is as much the result of there own failings as people as it is the fault of the zombies. The movie is disturbing to me because I have a almost constant feeling of hopelessness and dread. It's not a happy movie but, it's a great movie and very effective!! If anyone has not seen this film, please give it a watch. It really does deserve the title of Classic!! 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romero's "Night" created a new cinematic dawn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've viewed this film many times over the years and I must say that it IS a horror masterpiece that deserves and has earned it's right to be regarded as such. George A. Romero and John Russo penned a script that was, in 1968, startlingly original and shocking. Then utilizing the efforts of a cast and crew drawn from the Pittsburgh area commercial television industry, translated the script on a shoestring budget into a film experience which created an entirely new and unique genre. Shot in stark black and white due to a limited budget at a time when most films were already being shot in color, the Image Ten Film Group splashed theatre screens with nightmarish imagery that no one at that time was prepared for. The black and white presentation of the film actually enhances the eerie and dark atmosphere of the storyline and many people over the years speculated that avoiding the use of color stock was by choice instead of necessity. This film created several new standards within the horror genre, the zombie flesh eating theme and it's graphic depiction thereof being the most obvious. Another standard set by "Night" was the redefinition of the horror film heroine with the character of Barbara, wonderfully played by Judith O'Dea. For years female characters within the horror genre were simply Fay Wray type screamers, awaiting the rescue of the male lead. Barbara provided us with the first depiction of the "scream queens" as we know them still today. She was terrified indeed, but she was self reliant and assertive as well. The character of Barbara took charge of her own self-preservation. The casting of the late Duane Jones in 1968 as the male lead with no references to his ethnicity in the script's dialogue should be applauded. These weren't people divided by color within that farmhouse(as sadly parts of the country really were back in 1968), these were simply ordinary people attempting to achieve survival within an extraordinary situation. The murder of Marilyn Eastman's character by the "zombie daughter" in a scene that attacks the viewer's senses on numerous levels is to this day one of the most unsettling ever depicted on film. All of these elements and more contributed to this film's continued theatrical runs throughout the next decade. These same elements have earned the film it's cult status following and it still packs it's punch on video. Sadly, there are several edited, re-cut, or poor quality versions on the market due to the fact that the film became part of the public domain and anyone with a print could then release it. Seek out the original uncut version, digitally remastered on DVD and the experience the film provides will be well worth the purchase price if you're a fan of horror. After viewing, think of the films that pre-dated this classic and those that followed. Then realize that all of the graphic chills, scream queen's battlings of antagonists, and so many other elements of horror cinema today are the result of the impact this low budget shocker had on an entire genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie in black-and-white</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb mark: 7In my opinion, 'Night of the Living Dead', directed by George A. Romero, only has to compete with F.W. Murnau's 'Nosferatu: eine symphonie des grauens' for the title of the best, or maybe just the scariest, black-and-white horror film ever. Of course, this one wins by a landslide. It even puts to shame many colour horror movies. Admittedly, this film does look a little outdated now, but imagine its impact in 1968, when all the public was seeing were those nice, feel-good monster flicks, like 'The Fly' and 'Return of the Fly'.-Gore: The thing here is that gore doesn't look as good in only two colours. But still, some scenes truly are awesome, like when one zombie is eating the hand of a victim; and quite a few more. Also, if you don't consider it a desecration of a classic, you can hunt for the colorized version made in 1987; I'm not sure how good the quality of the colour is in that version, though. 17/30-Suspense: The first time you see it, this movie will keep you in suspense until the end. And prepare to be shocked. When you see 'Night of the Living Dead' again, however, it's just not as frightening, because you won't be able to forget the scenes that easily. 13/15-Ending: Wow, the ending is unbelievable! It's extraordinary! But don't watch the ending with Scott Vladimir Licina in it, that's pure crap. The last 15 minutes of the true original version are of such an intensity, that can rarely be encountered in other movies. "Okay, that's another one for the fire!" 15/15-Death Scenes: Absolutely no complaints here. Check out Helen's death! It's the best black-and-white death scene I've ever watched and it kind of makes Hitchcock's scenes look like 'G'-rated stuff. 11/11-Atmosphere: While this film is incredibly creepy at times, it can become boring every once in a while. Those news bulletins the characters watch and hear aren't always helping the mood of the film, and the 30th Anniversary Edition is even worse, especially with the altered beginning ad ending, tossing God into the mix. 7/10-Nudity: One of the zombies is seen first nude from the back, then topless from the side. But this is removed from the 30th Anniversary Edition and some other versions. 1/10-Cast: They have all become famous for being in this movie: Duane Jones, Judith O'Dea, Bill Hinzman, and perhaps a few others, too. I haven't seen any of them in anything else yet, though. 1/5-Genre: This is a horror film. 4/4--&gt;Overall: 69/100'Night of the Flesh Eaters' is famous for not being copyrighted. So, therefore, it is probably the film with the most different versions available. Even colorized versions have been created. But beware, because only few of all those various editions are truly worth the money. From Swordlord, 2 swords up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Low Budget and Too Outdated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind BuyGeorge A. Romero is a name synonomous with zombie-horror. He created the immensely popular "Dead Trilogy" and after hearing how great his films are I finally got around to seeing the original "Night of the Living Dead." The film paints the picture of a world facing an epidemic of cannibalistic zombies. It focuses on a group of people who are holed up in a farmhouse trying to fight off the zombies over the course of a night. The characters, as they fight for their lives, deal with their own conflicting ideas of how to survive. I was disappointed in this film. While it is a classic of the horror genre and the pioneer of the zombie subgenre, I was not impressed. It's outdatedness and virtual lack of a budget proved to be too great of a distraction for me. I will never write off an entire movie because it lacked an adequate monetary resource in it's production. I know that great things can be done in film with little money and I understand that many people see greatness in "Night of the Living Dead," however I did not see it.The slow moving zombies of the film were meant to creat a creepy atmosphere but I almost found the zombies comedic. After having seen so many horror movie cliches recently it was interesting to see them back when they were not cliches yet. Situations where the victim falls while being pursued or can't get a car started are now only used for comedic effect and in "Night of the Living Dead" it was hard to see them as "terror-inducing."The acting talent was overall mediocre. I thought Judith O'Dea's performance was just annoying and a little too much. While she was terrified at the beginning of the film she almost seemed to be holding her breath to create the feeling. She tried too hard and came up as unbelievable. The rest of the cast was fine, with special mention towards to Karl Hardman as the hot headed know-it-all. The film's saving grace was Duane Jones. From the minute he appears onscreen he takes charge, becoming the leader of the group. His performance was the only thing that held my interest. The ending of the film would have been incredible had I not seen a certain movie recently that stole it's own ending from "Night of the Living Dead." Unfortunately for Romero, I hated the movie that took his ending. Overall I would rate this movie at **. I am happy I saw it because it is such a classic and so respected but I will not buy it because it comes off as too cheesy for my tastes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A relentless horror fest that never fails to frighten!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** out of ****, George Romero's dark horror masterpiece starring Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea is one of the most influential and frightening films of all time. It was the film that launched a whole new subgenre for horror. Seven strangers board themselves up in an isolated farmhouse to protect themselves from mindless, flesh-eating zombies which are roaming the countryside. A simple, yet promising plot! The most chilling scene (SLIGHT SPOILER) is the cellar sequence with Karen stabbing her mother, Helen to death. Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea turn in priceless performances, as does the rest of the cast. Very inspirational to me as an amateur filmmaker.Rated R for violence, gore and mild profanity. 1968</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supoib! Romero invents the slash-and-burn horror flick, and the results are exciting! Subtext included.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granddaddy of the slash-and-burn style horror flick, it gave birth to Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream and other landmark films in the genre, not to mention zombie flicks like Evil Dead and 28 Days Later. Romero began the no nonsense approach to horror: he uses shadows and shaky camerawork to build psychological suspense, along with the emotional breakdown of the main female character and the isolated, closed-in setting; but unlike suspense thrillers, or in the recent Kill Bill, the suspense is not followed by a cop out, like a sword fight that is over in one blow. There are living dead in this film. At some point, in fact, at many points - they will attack. Their hands will claw through boards at the humans. And they will eat the flesh of their victims. There will be no cop-outs here!A scene towards the end of this involving a child is surely one of the most frightening scenes ever filmed, in my opinion. There also appears to be a sub-text involving white america's fear of black people. The main character is black - but we don't meet him from the beginning. We meet a typical happy-go-lucky white American brother and sister. Romero leads us to believe these two will be the main characters, the main good guys who have to save the world from the living dead. But he throws this on its head after ten minutes, when the man is killed, and the woman spends the rest of the film in shock, incapable of protecting herself or others from the advancing dead. She flees the scene where a strange creature killed her brother, and comes across a farm, where she meets a black man. She suspects, and we are supposed to suspect, that he is one of the dead - ie, an enemy - but he is not, significantly. He becomes the hero of the film, taking charge, making plans and getting everyone else in order, when they can't really cope themselves. The chilling ending of the film is where the main comment from the subtext comes, but i can't say any more about it, because i don't want to spoil it for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romero's Influential Debut Still Retains Its Effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably one of the most influential horror films ever made, George A. Romero's Night Of The Living Dead still has the power to scare the living daylights out of people. Perhaps more than any other horror film, Night Of The Living Dead capitalizes on the current events of its time, and uses them to good effect. Taking advantage of the anti-war sentiment, civil rights struggle, and cold war paranoia present at the time, Romero paints a portrait of an America as its own worst enemy. Seven people are holed-up in a farm house, trying to fend off a group of cannibalistic zombies. From the opening cemetery scene until the bitterly ironic ending, the film never releases its grip on the audience. One truly hair-raising sequence takes place in the cellar near the end. Filmed in the Pittsburgh area on an extremely low budget, Romero uses primarily amateur actors and acquaintances to film the movie. As a result, the acting is mostly poor and at times feels like a stage rehearsal, especially the house scenes with Judith O'Dea and Duane Jones. Jones is the only actor that comes close to resembling a performance; he's also notable as one of the first black actors, if not the first, to play a lead role in a horror film. The order in which the actors meet their fates also defies convention. Filmed in an era when there was a lot of experimentation with color film, the film is a grainy black &amp; white, adding to its claustrophobic and pseudo-documentary feel. Although we've become desensitized to horror shocks these days, the film is still often thought of as one of the most stomach-churning horror films ever made, bar none. The film was re-edited slightly with a new opening scene for its 30th anniversary, but avoid it at all costs. It significantly lessens the opening scene's suspense from the original with extremely laughable acting. Three stars for entertainment and a 1/2 star for its significant influences. ***1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic beginning...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is the first chapter of George Romero's "classic" trilogy. Though I didn't like its two successors, this film sure was good.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is about several people locked into an abandoned house near a cemetery, hiding away from the zombies that are now rising from their graves to feast on human flesh. With the zombies massing outside, the hideaways think they are doomed. There are a couple of ways they could escape the monsters, but every plan they come up with seems to come crashing down in flames. How will they survive?Ignoring what a classic it is and everything, NotLD is still a great film. I think the use of black-and-white film adds a lot to the movie, and seems to add to the creepy atmosphere the film perpetuates as it moves along. Perhaps that's what the next two films were missing. I also like the fact that all of the violence is implied. You never really see blood spilling out or any of the monsters taking a bite out of any of the living humans, though you do see them feasting in one brilliant shot. I think the creepiest part of the movie was when we're introduced to the little zombie girl (the one shown on the movie's box cover)--I believe she adds a lot of atmospheric elements to the movie.Most of the characters and character development is great, with one exception. Judith O'Dea, in her role as Barbra, seemed rather useless and annoying in that right. I suppose someone has to play the traumatized victim, but it still annoyed me. On the other hand, the script is pretty good, the direction is excellent, and the ending is absolutely brilliant--pessimistic, sad, and extremely clever, all at the same time.I have to say, this is the only chapter of the Dead trilogy that I really liked... but I think it was also the most worthy. Certainly a classic, as I'm sure it will remain for another forty years. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok. I've seen a lot of horror movies like The Exorcist, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Alien, Aliens, Scream, the possibilities are endless...The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Scream were the scariest ones, even though I love all these movies listed. It's actually very rare that a horror movie creeps me out...until I saw Night of the Living Dead. Sure it's a low budget film that was made in 1968, but I think that it stands the test of time. The idea of a group of strangers forced to take shelter in a deserted farmhouse to protect themselves from flesh-eating zombies is pretty scary. SPOILERS AHEAD: The scariest part was when the woman's daughter, who had been really sick, turned into a zombie and killed her mother. That was scary! The film ends with the only survivor shot by a group of hunters, because they think he is a zombie...it picks up again in Dawn of the Dead, which was another great movie, but not as good as the original masterpiece: Night of the Living Dead!!!</fullReview>

If you thought this was great, then you'll think Carnival of Souls is even better and if you loved this movie and thought it lacked a little bit, Carnival of Souls has what this movie lacks and was made 6 years before. This was a really good movie but I have seen better. This movie failed to really disturb me like a horror film should. Watch Horror Hotel and Carnival of Souls and you will turn off the movie disturbed long after you are done viewing it and again both of them were made 6 and 10 years before this one.

There are explorations of the human inability to get along and come together in light of a horrible threat, some possibleracism messages thrown in to boot.Remade poorly in 1990 starring Tony Todd in the Duane Jones role.

		<fullReview>George A. Romero will probably be one of the greatest horrorcineasts ever and the debut of him is stunning and groundbreaking and a real example to show that you can scare your audience with a real low budget. The movie is a sort of mother from all other zombiemovies to come as this type of movie would be repeated over and over (also by Romero himself). Filmed in black and white (quite unusual for a movie shot in 1968) we follow a brother and sister who must seek some forgotten grave. What starts as a joke soon turns out in a nightmare as the dead are awake and yes they kill... Purists will have tons of pleasure to rate this as a masterpiece of B-movie as this is indeed a so called wrong movie but what a suspense and how brilliant it has been acted in. A real classic that is often repeated but rarely made as good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh man this movie is a landmark of the zombie genre where everything is kicked off. This movie makes it all possible. Nearly every zombie movie you have ever seen or will ever see is thanks to this. Night Of The Living Dead is not my favourite zombie movie, it's in black &amp; white, it's not gory, the zombies don't look too much like zombies thanks to the black &amp; white, the woman Barbra is annoying, the music is really bad and too loud in places BUT i like it. It has a story, it has a little suspense, it is a teeny weeny bit scary, good acting especially by Duane Jones who's character Ben is fantastic who is the exact opposite of the really irritating Barbra and makes the viewer feel safe watching this as he really is the kind of guy you would want to be around in such a crisis as this because this man knows how to take charge and keep his head in a very bad situation. I do actually prefer the 1990 remake and would love to hop over to the Night Of The Living Dead (1990) board and do a review there but i haven't seen that one in years and i want to do a really great review (which it deserves) while it's still fresh in my mind. I shall leave you with the legendary words from the bad boy with glasses and a pen and pencil in his shirt pocket, Johnny...."They're coming to get you barbra, they're coming for you, look there comes one of them now, i'm getting out of here". 8/10</fullReview>

There are only one or two startling moments, quite a few gory moments, and the end creeped me out really bad (!!!!!!HUGE HUGE HUGE HUGE SPOILERS!!!!!!!) when they mistook Ben for a zombie and shot him and then burned him in that field. Also, the goriest and also really creepy part (MORE BIG SPOILERS!!!!!!!) is when the girl gets zombified and eats her mom and dad.But overall the movie was good. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is it. The original, the classic, the indisputable King of the Zombie movies. The year was 1968. Not many people knew what film gore was, nor had they ever seen an African American man play a hero in a horror film. Night of the Living Dead was so far ahead of its time that it continues to blow people away to this day.The moody black-and-white film begins with a creepy score and a brother and sister, driving to an out-of-the-way cemetery to place flowers on a grave. Barbra, the sister, is not at all comfortable about being in a cemetery, and her dorky brother Johnny knows this. When he sees a tall, vacant looking man stumbling through the headstones, he teases his sister that the man is "coming to get her" in what is now a piece of classic film dialogue. What Johnny does NOT know is that the man is indeed coming to get her...but he gets Johnny first. From the moment Johnny's head is bashed in, all innocence in the world ends. Barbra must now run for her life, stumbling barefoot through a once-pastoral and now sinister countryside. The ghoul follows her to an abandoned farmhouse, where the rest of the cast soon assembles.Ben, our hero, quickly takes the lead. He is level-headed and calm, despite the horror that awaits outside. Whilst Barbra sinks into a near catatonic state on the living room couch, Ben boards up the windows and gathers the weapons, never giving in to the panic that we know he must feel on some level. Ben is a true hero, a humanitarian and a gentleman. He is also the only black character in an all white cast. This must have been unthinkable in 1968, as Ben takes charge of the small group of survivors and is quick to punch a white loudmouth jerk right in the face when the man becomes unreasonable. The rest of the cast includes the loudmouth's pretty wife, their daughter who has been bitten by a zombie and is slowly dying, and a young couple who are clearly very much in love. Oh yeah, and the hundred or so zombies milling around outside the house, eating bugs and attempting to break into the house and get their hands on the living within. This film has aged very well and its gore scenes remain quite shocking, considering the time it was made. The camera never flinches; we are shown stark, clinical footage of zombies eating human flesh and ripping at intestines as though it were a game of tug-o-war. In the films most harrowing scene, we even get to see a little zombie girl commit matricide with a garden trowel. Through it all, the camera simply stares at the atrocities with a detached eye. It is truly chilling.The final scene of this film is utterly devastating. I was literally in shock the first time I saw it, my mouth hanging open at the horrible injustice of it all. There is, needless to say, no happy ending. But this film is so innovative, forever changing the genre, that it has to be seen if only once. George Romero's film is absolutely flawless, simply because it is so rough, so low budget, and yet so grittily realistic and shockingly different. This film is pure horror. You won't soon get it out of your head. It has the power to disturb for a very long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brian1000's Review *May Contain Spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was quite a good movie and fairly original I believe at it's time. It is about this young lady who gets attacked in a cemetary and leaves her dead brother Johnny after he is attacked by a seemingly mental Man. She runs up to a farmhouse and is befriended by a Black Man playing a non "black" leading role which was rare in that time period too I believe. Then they are joined by various others who were in the house all along. They eventually or rather She does and the rest except the Black man who I believe is Duane Jones that they are the Living Dead. The living dead are your typical *now* run of the mill zombies, they move slow, moan, crave flesh etc. Back then zombies were generally used as mindless slaves. So basically the thing of it is the Zombies really want some food so they keep trying to break into the house, although why the Humans did not just run is beyond me. They could have easily out ran an army of zombies and had time to tie their shoes, however they decided instead of running from them and getting away they should bar themselves in the house and wait for legions of them to come. So using their awesome logic they did just that and failed miserably. The zombies eventually got in and over ran the place, every one was slaughtered I believe afterwards. The black man lived after some rednecks came and shot the zombies/destroyed them whatever and burned them. One extremely bright redneck saw the black man who was walking around come out of the basement and shot him, the plot wants you to think it was because he thought he was a zombie although we know the Redneck shot him because he was Black. Romero movies try to have some deep meaning to them I suppose. A generally cool part of the movie is when the ladies daughter comes back as a zombies but instead of being a zombie flesh eater she just murders the wife with a gardening tool, using Romero's logic why did the zombies out side not just use a hammer and break in. They were on a farm it would not have been hard to find no? All that aside in the end the ladies brother comes back as a zombie and drags her out the window rather than trying to bite her, we have to assume she's dead. The movie went on to be followed by 2 or 3 sequels if you count the crappy children of the living dead an actual sequel. Sequels were pretty good and gory but nothing tops the original. I suggest watching this home alone around midnight you may get some creeps for it or you may laugh at the affects either way it pretty much confirms my thoughts that zombies love to wear underwhere as most of them are just in their Underwhere. 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is for the 1968 B&amp;W version, not the 1993 colorized version, nor the 1999 bastardized remake!!This is about the best horror film ever made. In spite of the obvious low budget and the inexperienced actors, this movie pulls through. It is a genuinely scary movie in spite of the grainy quality of the film, the obviously dated quality of the movie, and the many slow spots. It never fails to entertain you; compel you to watch it through to the ending. It has a documentary-like feeling to it which lends an eerie realism to the entire production. This is a strange movie; it looks strange, and feels strange, as we learn through the news casts that radiation was the cause of the dead returning to life. All things are explained, yet there is a sheer totality to this movie which is really very disturbing.I was entertained and completely chilled, which says a great deal. I am a rare horror fan who is not into zombie movies. But this was absolutely one of the very best of the genre of horror, and THE best of the zombie sub-genre. If you liked this movie, you may also enjoy Serpent and the Rainbow. It has the added element of having been based on actual events. It rates a 9.1/10 on the movie scale.It rates a 9.9/10 on the Romero scale.It rates a 6.5/10 on the splatter scale from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small contentious group of people find themselves besieged inside an isolated farmhouse by a growing army of flesh-eating zombies in this low-budget classic. This film, directed by George A. Romero, is one of the true masterpieces of the horror genre and has inspired numerous sequels and countless rip-offs. The opening, from the moment bickering the brother and sister confront the first zombie until the time Duane Jones arrives at the farmhouse and fends off the first attack, has an honest intensity which is both frightening and riveting. The dark climax is equally powerful. Although the film is marred by some uneven performances and weak dialogue in places, it generally remains taut and effective. The gritty black and white photography and the shoe-string budget only work to enhance its semi-documentary feel. The perfect film to watch on a dark, lonely night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" still packs a punch over 35 years after its release. Some "modern" film buffs might complain about a lack of gore, but for 1968 this is like 20 Friday the 13ths packed into one! Any horror movie that depicts realistic people acting realistically in an UNrealistic situation gets my attention right away. This movie pioneered so many modern-day horror situations you can't help but respect it on that basis alone. Very eerie, very creepy. (Spoiler) Still feel bad about Barbra.

		<fullReview>The controversy of this movie has certainly subsided in the last 35 years. By today's standards the film is not only anemic, its asleep.I look at the films a director makes in three terms: there is the film they make to get noticed (this, Alien, and Halloween), there is the film they make for money (Cape Fear, Batman, and Mission: Impossible), and then there is the film they make to reflect their soul. Often times the first and last are meshed together, but sometimes there is distinct differences in construction (Schindler's List for example).Wow, who'd have thought you could mention Schindler's List in a review for Night of the Living Dead? Nonetheless, 'Night's experimentation phase has passed in the wake of such work as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, and Halloween.While it is grittier than its successors, George Romero is too concerned with making a horror movie that he skips on many possible avenues of difference. The revolutionary effect this had on Hollywood is short-sighted. Romero got stuck in the whole 'Dead' trilogy that is now in the process of being remade one movie at a time and he is forgotten. Perhaps Stephen King should give him a lift again.So, by comparison to such work as Carrie, Romero failed in his plans, but he should be complemented for creating an inverted movie. This movie, like Die Hard and Jaws, shaped the way we viewed a genre. While inherently negative in the result (how many bad zombie movies have been made since this?), I can't help complementing Romero for having a brief, momentary vision that he subsequently lost in the subsequent films.Overall, by now this is for devotees only on the same rating scale as Planet of the Apes. '68 started changing our world, no doubt. 2.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, overrated, but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Romero and I like his Dead films; I respect them for exploiting the zombie sub-genre, and the concepts the would inspire in future horror films. I like Night of the Living Dead, but I don't think it's a great film. I do greatly admire Romero's ability to overcome his microscopic budget, his resourcefulness and ingenuity, and I really wish blockbuster directors now would look back and take notes. Films are seldom worth their price tags anymore, especially now in light of over-inflated budgets and public boasting of how much money a production can waste (sorry, `spend') in so short a time.I like Romero's cold cruelty in his films - the bleak and hopelessness of their subject matter, and how he pulls no punches for the sake of appeasing fans that drool for universal Hollywood formulas. These methods are the few that genuinely take you by surprise because anything can happen.Alas, his visual style does nothing more than recite the story in a dry monotone from beginning to end. Films combine three different arts ? narrative, sound and visuals, and while Romero does have some intriguing concepts, scenarios, and commentaries, he lacks that same amazing flair in the other two aspects of film. This is especially evident in Night of the Living Dead. His material conveys the idea and it does work, so by no means is Night (or Romero) a failure . . . but to call it a masterpiece and him a master is a far cry from the truth. Art does more than `just convey' an idea. Given Night's budget and it being Romero's first film, I can forgive those shortcomings. Night is a very strong film to come onto the scene with. However, Romero had plenty of room to grow and improve his skills; alas, he's not come very far. So I like Romero and Night, but I don't love either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night Of The Living Dead is the story of, well, basically life on Earth as we know it coming to an end; the title says it all. The dead are "living", or at least roaming about devouring any human (that isn't dead) that they come in to contact with. We see this story through a group of random people gathered together in an empty farm house fighting for their lives.The opening scene of this movie is CLASSIC. One of my favorite scene in the history of film. You have a brother and sister visiting their fathers (I think) grave site. The brother continually teases his sister who is obviously disturbed by this. "They're coming to get you Babara. Look There is one now." He says this pointing to an elderly man walking in their direction. Some of the last words he will ever speak. The elderly man approaching them (of course they don't know he is a zombie) attacks the Barbara. Her brother tries to fight him off, but is killed in the struggle. And so begins one of the greatest horror films ever made.The tension is gradually raised through out the film as peoples personalities, and ideas on how to combat the gathering mob of living dead outside of their temporary hideaway, begin to conflict with one another. The acting is not top notch I will admit. There are so many other pluses that this matters little if at all, in fact it may add something for some viewers. The story is original in it's telling, and one of the earliest movies of this type before ten low budget copies came out every year.This is not a gore fest, if you want that check out Dawn Of The Dead, instead more of a psychological thriller. This is one of the smartest horror films I have ever seen, and reccomend that you see it as well. This, along with films like Psycho, Rose Mary's Baby, and The Omen, changed the way horror movies are made, and viewed. Though horror films are generally looked down upon, films like these allow us to not feel guilty for admiring the genre</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish all fans of horror could run an "erase" program and go see this film in a theater with no knowledge of any film that had come after this cinematic icon. I wish they could ...After this movie debuted, Reader's Digest ran an article that described a contributor's trauma at attending a showing. He (I believe it was a he, might have been a she) went to see what was expected to be another "horror" film in the family fare vein. All was going well until the ressurected dead began, on camera, to chomp on the living. He noted the whoops and shrieks of the audience in the scenes leading up to the flesh noshing; fun whoops, party shrieks. But when the meat eating began, the audience, he noted, went dead silent.Silent.And that was the moment. One of those moments when everything changes. One of those moments when all that has come before reluctantly retreats from what is to come. There is no going back. The bar has been raised. If this is fun, we have to redefine fun. If this entertainment we have to redefine it as well. If this is horror, it's off in a new and uncomfortable direction.The movie dates poorly and as much as I love it, I know it doesn't compete well in a modern list of horror films. But I wish I could share with new devotees that moment in the theater when the nervous laughter and the party like expectations gave way to "Oh muh Gawd" silence as Romero took us by the hand and led us into a darker dark.I remember it and it was awesome and haunted my dreams and unexpected moments alone in the dark for a long time.Some of you can probably get there from here.Enjoy.For those who can't; I hope something comes up for you that will have the same, elevator shaft dropping away, thing that NOTLD was in its day.Nothing like it.</fullReview>

It's all perfect and there's nothing to complain about.Please note that while there are complaints about this movie in IMDb's comments section, many of them consider the "30th Anniversary Edition". That version is a sham and an abomination, and the perpetrators behind it would all be tortured to death if there was any justice in this world.I do wish there still were separate entries for the different versions. It did help a lot when I was able to vote "10" for the 1968 original, and "1" for the 1999 rape.All other complaints about "Night of the Living Dead" are simply misguided.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're coming to get you Barbara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror movies are sworn to three principles: 1.) Our character(s) are constantly surrounded by imminent threat. 2.) Almost all characters (if not everyone) must die 3.) Explicit death sequences. This is what separates Horror from Suspense/Thriller/Mystery movies. In 1968, George Romero, through the endangered yet provocative element of black and white film making, managed to combine these three attributes brilliantly setting the standard for any future horror movie to follow. I still get chills every time I watch the opening sequence, in the cemetery, when the director himself repeats the lines, "They're coming to get you Barbara!" "Look! Here comes one of them now!" followed by S. William Hinzman's bone chilling performance revealing the capacity of the living dead. From there the movie rarely stops for breath as the day transcends to night. Our heroine finds her only salvation in a lone country house where she soon befriends a select congregation of survivors. Surrounded by these merciless savages they must find a way out together, if they don't kill each other first.This movie crosses many lines in a year where crossing lines was the 'IN' thing to do. The exceptional amount of violence and defamation of the dead still to this day would not receive less than an 'R' rating. Another bold move was casting an African-American for the lead role, for which Duane Jones delivers a powerful leader persona. This is the other truly virtuous quality of NOTLD, the acting. This quintisential ingredient is often diminished if not forgotten in today's horror flicks. The true terror arises in the audience when they begin to identify and place themselves in the characters' shoes. The acting in this movie is far above par considering its low budget. Within the struggle for safety from what lies outside a new threat arises from within the house allowing no safe territory. (Obvious inspirations for the situations in '28 Days Later'). The movie sub-plots a social commentary on survival and what measures man will take to maintain such.Bottom Line: One of the top three horror movies of all times. Eerie scenes of ill-determined zombies, well acted plots of desperation, and of course gore. You may never want to walk through a cemetery again.</fullReview>

Also the mood in the house between the characters is extremely interesting, cause let's face it none of us know how we would act if we were in the same situation. I do have to add one more thing, I think what makes this movie stand up above the rest is the fact that all the characters trapped in the house do not survive, which is not known in the world of horror movies.

They wander about killing the living. Only seven people remain as they barricade themselves in a farmhouse, trying to shake off the walking corpses. The only way to stop them is to shoot them in the head or burn them.Romero's horror film, shot on a shoe-string budget (and in black and white), is both disturbing and scary, unlike the other zombie flicks that went for explicit gore and campy humor. And yes, the 1990 remake sucks. First horror film to have an African American (Duane Jones) in a lead role. My evaluation: ***? out of ****</fullReview>

So I never saw the film, even as I got older and worked my way through many horror classics. However, in the last few years I've become more jaded and inured to gore. A few months ago I was fortunate enough to see Peter Jackson's hilarious "Braindead", and nothing could be gorier than THAT! So I finally saw "Night of the Living Dead." And it scared me half to death. Yes, I know it was made for a $1.95, the editing is choppy, at times they shoot night scenes during the day--but that doesn't MATTER. It is obviously the touchstone for many modern (and far less frightening) films. The scenes where the zombies were eating the burnt bodies of the couple in the truck was truly disgusting and scary. And how great to have an intelligent African-American leading man, even with the downbeat ending. A great, great film, and I'm just sorry I paid attention to "Reader's Digest." But what the hell, it was in my grandmother's bathroom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The king of all zombie movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that George A. Romero's original black and white classic is the king of all zombie movies. It is far better than the sequels, DAWN OF THE DEAD and DAY OF THE DEAD. You will be very surprised at the gruesome makeup effects (they are quite good for this time period). The acting could've been better, but that's what you get when you're on a tight budget.The news broadcasts are quite good and authentic looking. George A. Romero created a cult masterpiece with such a simple idea. Just have the dead walk and go around eating people. People are stuck in farmhouse, zombies try to kill them. One of the easiest plots to think up and Romero created a phenomenon that still lives to this day.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very very scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw 'Night of the Living Dead' about half a year ago at the age of 14. My mother had been reluctant to let me see it but it had been one of my father's favorite movies when he was a teenager so I was allowed to rent. And I was in luck! My local video rental store had a brand spanking new copy of the 30th anniversary edition DVD. I rented it out, rushed home, sent my younger sibling packing and popped the DVD into the player. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. After more than thirty years, two sequels, and so many other zombie films this remains the scariest. The only rival it has in my opinion is Peter Jackson's great low budget splatter comedy 'Braindead'. This film scared me witless. It may be in B&amp;W but sitting there in pristine DVD quality with a remastered soundtrack it blows everything else out of the water. George Romero's wonderful handling of his talented actors as well as his masterful ability to create tension make this one of the scariest horror films ever. I had to rent it out twice just to get through it. Time hasn't dulled the edge on this beauty one bit. If you are a fan of horror films I highly recommend you rent this now. But not the remake. Or the one with flourescent green zombies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a honest wonderful masterpiece.The central character is a strong and secure blackman in a house with mostly inoperative people(except the young man).It's interesting because the tension between the white character and the blackman is not forced,maybe the stress got more to do with it than a racial issue. This blackman(Ben) knows about the threats not only of the zombies but of a society full of racial crimes, prejudices and the white majority. Does this man sees this living dead as the ugly racists of that time? The final scene is so shocking as it's critical with resemblances of KKK rituals of fire(yeah the zombies are afraid of the fire too) This film also shows the influence of the media(radio or tv) in a time of crisis. Who really are the living dead? Parasites politicians who want your money and soul ,avengel angels or Escape Goats? 10/10</fullReview>

You need to watch it to believe it. Excelent direction by Romero, good acting, a haunting score, and scary zombies are all in here. Maybe it's not the best zombie movie ever released, but for it's time it stated the rules for this kind of movies. The last 20 minutes are filled with suspense, and this feeling of anxiety that comes when the main characters are about to be savagely devoured. The ending will be remained as one of the most shocking in horror history.**SPOILER** I wanted the mention the scene where the zombie girl stabs a woman to death. It's like, you expect the zombie to eat her or something and suddenly she comes slowly to stab her for several times. That was quite scary!. *END OF SPOILER* Give it a try, and convince yourself that true horror does not mean lots of gore and a mysterious killer that is revealed until the end. Way much better than it's remake, or sequels just watch this film and avoid the follow - ups. Truly a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Horror Film Of All-Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero in this, created a horror masterpiece. This film couldn't possibly be topped in the category of influence. Also this is a message to all the directors out there today. How could you not respect this man, and revere him as one of the best? He did everything in this film! He wrote it, directed it, did the cinematography, and edited it. You'd think with all of that work on your hands you'd have a piece that lacked quality, well think again. Barbra travels to the countryside with her brother to visit her mothers grave and pay their respects. Within a few minutes Barbra is fleeing into an abandoned farmhouse, being chased by zombies that killed her brother, and now want her! Barbra once in the farmhouse realizes that the house had already been cleaned out by the dead. Ben comes in to make the save, and with no vehicle, and a multitude of zombies approaching the house. They have no choice but to settle in and try to survive and hope to escape out of this predicament with their lives. As the movie advances we are introduced to more survivors that need shelter in the house, which sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Romero's ability to capture this feeling of utter and total despair and a loss of hope is breath taking. His cinematography captures eeriness, and throughout the entire film will creep you out. The complete anguish of dark, and even by the time the movie is over, will make you terrified of the light! All this with the guinness book of world records title of smallest budget for a film! Never in a film will you feel the total loss of hope that this film portrays as it progresses. Almost to a point where you feel like if this film were longer, you might fall into a depression! The ability this film has, to make the viewer(s) feel, what the film directs you to feel is outstanding, and is what all directors in the horror/suspense categories now try to duplicate. This film to me, is what every person that creates a film tries to duplicate, the ability to capture everyones emotion and MAKE them feel the film. Romero is a legend. Do yourself a favor if you're a fan of horror films or are inspiring to be a director. Watch this film, and learn from a legend! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective and atmospheric</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*possible spoiler?*After more than thirty years, "Night of the Living Dead" stands as one of the most influential horror films ever made. Despite its low budget, it still holds up reasonably well. In fact, a more polished film might not have been as effective. The grainy, gritty black-and-white cinematography evokes the feeling of a documentary instead of a fictional construct. As events progress, there is an urgency and immediacy that no amount of money can buy. There is a feeling of mounting dread, as we feel trapped in a nightmare with the characters. The more we see, the less confident we are that anyone will make it out alive. The ending, which I would not dream of revealing, is a genuine shocker. It shows what true horror can do when not touched by corporate interests. For his entire career, Romero would make every effort to make quality films on the fringes. He has not always been successful, but rarely has he been accused of selling out.Duane Jones has been noticed as one of the first black leads in a horror film. This may or may not have been a deliberate attempt to make a social statement (availability surely played a role as well), but he turns in a credible performance as Ben. At first I was concerned about the effect Judith O'Dea would have on my enjoyment of the film. Her "girl in distress" character was shrill, but thankfully she goes comatose and allows the remainder of the movie to focus on more worthy supporting characters. Karl Hardman gives strong support as a fellow survivor who cannot get along with Ben, even putting his life in jeopardy. The film makes creative use of radio and television media to transcend its budget limitations, as we are barraged with reports of zombies taking over the entire east coast--and beyond. This is not an isolated incident. This is a major problem that is sure to have profound repercussions far and wide. The highest levels of government are in a panic over what to do about the problem. These portions make up some of the most compelling material in the NOTLD, and give a more epic scope to what might have otherwise been a more claustrophobic (and less compelling) film. The effect is chilling. Its sequel, "Dawn of the Dead," would take the concept even further, becoming one of the few follow-ups to stand above the original.*** (out of ****)Released by the Walter Reade Organization</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true horror movie. Worth repeat viewings, and full of memorable images.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1968's "Night Of The Living Dead" was harshly bashed by several film critics when it was released, but has over the years gained cult and classic status. The film was somewhat radical in its era of release with its gore, nudity (a naked female ghoul), and adult language. It was released in an era in which gore wasn't common in too many movies, nudity was mainly in nudie cutie films, and adult language was just starting to be spoken in mainstream films. This true horror movie has the recently dead becoming animate, and seeking the flesh of the living to feed on. Six people fight for their lives and fight among each other in an isolated farmhouse, which became their refuge from the flesh-eating ghouls. The characters must decide the best ways to prevent and survive attacks by the ghouls, and possible plans of escaping the farmhouse. The living dead become more aggressive as the night goes on, and an attack on the farmhouse seems imminent. "Night Of The Living Dead" has many grim and creepy moments from the beginning to the end of the film. The film is in black and white, which greatly helps create a dark and creepy mood. The black and white also greatly enhances the isolated mood of the countryside, cemetery, etc. The film does an excellent job creating an atmosphere of isolation, and many viewers have felt the film has a claustrophobic feel to it. The selected library music excellently helps with creating moods. The lighting helps cast shadows, and the sound effects of crickets make the film seem more realistic. "Night Of The Living Dead" contains many great sound effects, and the ghouls themselves make creepy vocal noises at times. The emergency broadcasts on radio and television give another realistic touch to the film. The photography contains interesting close-ups and angles, and the photograph ending is quite effective and unusual; especially when it switches from the photographs to a short scene of a bonfire. The acting is mostly realistic with Judith O'Dea, Duane Jones, and Marilyn Eastman turning in very good performances. Karl Hardman's character seems to have been written a bit off, and it is rare to see a non-villain this disagreeable in life or in a film. However, Karl plays his character well. Most of the dialogue seems to fit the film well. "Night Of The Living Dead" was released a bit before the MPAA's ratings went into effect, and would most likely receive the R rating for violence and gore. There are mild scenes of a nude female ghoul walking around the farmhouse with the other ghouls, and the adult language is also mild. It is a film that seems to have a balance of drama, terror, and exploitation. "Night Of The Living Dead" is not a perfect film, but I have found it to be a film worth repeat viewings. The film has effected me more with each viewing, and is full of memorable and haunting images.</fullReview>

A black lead and tons of blood made of this film a taboo for a long time,now a day it´s a great film that shows how people with a vision and low budget can make great achievements.

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead is, like it or not, the grandfather of the modern horror film. Pulses of its long-lasting influence can be felt through virtually every 'major' horror outing that followed, in particular the controversial early works of Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper, but equally so in lesser movies such as NIGHT OF THE DEMON (1980), Peter Jackson's BAD TASTE and Tony Maylam's THE BURNING. Without George Romero's extraordinary, trailblazing work as the template, we would have been deprived of a great many outstanding movies.Rather than retread the plot or incidents contained in this film, which many of the previous reviewers have done brilliantly, I'll run through some of the reasons why it worked for me.Firstly, the film was made in 1968, yet the dull character costumes (Johnny is perhaps the ultimate 'square', Harry the epitome of the mean, crabby 'grown-up') and sparse sets make it look much older. Sometimes you'd swear you were watching a movie from the late fifties, or maybe even the forties. I believe this was an intentional trick made by Romero to make the infamous attack scenes and sudden onslaughts of still-disturbing gore all the more unsettling.Secondly, Ben is the kind of strong, resourceful and decisive character a lot of modern-day film-makers seem to shy away from. Ben is in control of the situation from the second he arrives on-screen, and he quickly sets about making the isolated house as zombie-proof as possible. Plenty of directors would rather make their characters unforgivably stupid (sadly, both Craven and Hooper have been guilty of this), making them easy fodder for the marauding monsters and making it all but impossible for us to give two hoots about them. Did I mention that Ben is black? Over thirty years later, it still seems unusual to watch a movie in which the lead character is played by a black actor and ISN'T a thug / drug lord / wiseass. That's Hollywood for you.Thirdly, the obviously low budget works very much to the film's advantage. With its copious use of shaky, hand-held cameras and grainy black and white photography, the film perfects a look that is part set-bound TV drama (again, this makes the more obvious horror scenes - in particular the multiple stabbing - uniquely upsetting, because they are SO unexpected), part documentary, and part public information film. Romero's not-too-distant past as a commercials director is evident at every turn, as he makes every second count. And, like all the best horror directors, he's never afraid to push your face right into the grime whenever he deems it necessary.Finally, this is an entirely humourless movie. It's almost unbearably serious! Everything is played out with the straightest of faces. You may smirk occasionally at the cheap make-up effects, but then Romero will pull the rug from under your feet by upping the tension and increasing the threat. Kids raised on the lame, self-referencing, wisecracking likes of Freddy Krueger and the SCREAM series are likely to find this film rather turgid for that very reason. There is NO safety valve, no pressure release, no comic relief. The finale is, perhaps predictably, incredibly depressing.In short, this is every inch the masterpiece. It belongs in any serious film buff's collection. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Some trivial notes to sign out on - screenwriter and novelist John Russo plays the zombie that Ben drags out of the house and sets on fire (when interviewed on British TV, he said it was because he was dumb enough to let them do it!), and Russell Streiner (Johnny) claims that people still approach him on the street, begging him to say "They're coming to get you, Barbara!". If he'd charged 'em a dollar a time, he'd probably be a millionaire by now...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, Night of the Living Dead was a benchmark for later zombie films. Whenever I chat with film fans about zombie movies they always compare it to this great film.George A. Romero did an excellent job with this movie. He knew how to build the tension slowly and to create an atmosphere of hopelessness and pessimism.Basically, a group of people are locked up in a house in the middle of nowhere with hordes of zombies coming for them. It is a creepy film. Throughout the film, the characters debate whether it is safer to go outside or stay indoors. This was a good aspect of the movie. Should the characters brave the outdoors and try and get past the zombies or would they die quickly? Alternatively, should they stay indoors and risk zombies breaking in and cornering them?The ending of the film is quite scary as well. Watch what happens to one of the main survivors at the end.All in all, this is a great zombie movie that has rarely been bettered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why have all contributions to George Romero's brilliant Night of the Living Dead trilogy sucked on toast? (excluding admittedly, its Savini-helmed remake of the first installment and Fulci's first attempt)And why, with so much potential to make such an exceptional homage to the original by simply remastering it and perhaps spending some money on a real orchestra to augment the already stellar performances and tension, are we left with Cable Access Channel actors and keyboard demo music? Perhaps a small snip and tuck here and there would be livable but instead we're stuck with this hideous 30th edition which repulses far more than any of the zombie dinner scenes in the sequels.I confess, the director did an adequate job of integrating the new footage into the old footage but that's where it ends. These new pieces add nothing and in many places, take away from the brilliant and original. A bookend bit of crap with a priest in the cemetery of the film alters the entire ending of the film (one year later!?) and makes the sequels (Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead, not those insipid Return flicks) impossible. If anything, it makes the Return films seem like the logical conclusion. In fact, it feels like an extension of the Return films creeping into the original.Zombies surround a car crash in an extended and obvious fake of the original's radio broadcast which drones on overtop. These zombies menace some bloody dummies sitting in the car. All of this is sandwiched into the scene where Ben searches the house for supplies. It adds nothing to the film (other than some shoddy gore effects and a lady with her arm obviously tucked into the back of her shirt to make way for the dripping fake stump) but it's there all the same.Even worse: whenever Zombies appear on screen, cheesy moans and groans are heard. They don't even try and fit in with the sound of the original, giving you the impression they were recorded some 30 years later in a sound studio and added in via editing (hmmmm...).My advice: avoid this one and all other rip-offs.John Russo...you should be ashamed of yourself. Why can't those zombies eat you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While less shocking today then it was in it's time, Night Of The Living Dead is still a gold standard for the Horror genre. It grabs you by the neck and slaps you around, preying upon your worst fears and most sacred values (family, respect for the dead, the afterlife, body as temple, politics). It is also a brilliant sociological study commenting upon human communication (or lack there of). While most horror films have periods of complete safety when characters can rationalize and find a solution to their predicament, no such thing exists here. There is always an underlying feeling of dread and doom, and nothing is ever explained. To understand something makes it manageable, and Romero recognizes here that chaos, indecision, and uncertainty are the most terrifying things of all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Says a lot about American Culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero's "Night of The Living Dead" tells a very basic story, but in a truly intense and surreal way, much like David Lynch's epic about fatherhood..."Eraserhead." We see every kind of personality type imaginable in this film, and George is a very stylish director. You see the world through the eyes of the victims and those of the lifeless killers at the exact same time. You sit back and watch as sanity unfolds into insanity, as seemingly normal people are faced with the reality of a horrible nightmare come to life. Each death is very graphic yet classy. The black and white visual very much adds to the over all bleakness of the film. And it is quite obvious that George threw in quite a bit about the dreadful situation in which African Americans were treated during that time in the South, as one of the main performers of the film is African American. We also witness a certain brand of humanity in the lifeless zombies, almost as if they are attempting to teach the living a moral lesson. The film also goes into great detail as to how people can be truly numb and uncaring to those around them, especially when thrown into extreme situations, as are carefully shown in this brilliant and surreal Horror epic.</fullReview>

Don't let its lack of color fool you, this film still has the power to send a chill down your spine. As with most of Romero's works, he casts a group of unknowns so you don't know who will survive and who won't. For as low as the budget was, the makeup effects (by Tom Savini in his debut) are astoundingly good also. Even the ending has a message. All in all, this film is a must see for even nonfans of the horror genre.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The makings of a great, classic horror film has absolutely nothing to do with the monsters, the zombies, the magic, the special effects or the creativity of killings.What makes a great horror movie scary is it's own characters. The characters are the ones who kill themselves, by stupidity, by jealousy, by trying to prove who has the bigger p**is.The scariest characters in the movie are the ones hiding inside the house.Very well made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOTLD (to those in the know)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First saw this one as it should be seen--at a midnight movie--when I was 18 years old, way back in the 20th century. For the first time since I was a little kid, I was scared to walk down the darkened hallway to my bedroom when I got home. There were several other doors between me and my bedroom door, and I just knew that as I walked past 'em there were gonna be... HANDS... reaching... grabbing...This is seat-of-your-pants filmmaking from the get-go. It works. It has retained its power over the years; it was among the first movies in my library when I got my first VCR almost 20 years ago. In this day of plastic-looking CGI effects, NOTLD is still effective, though it's so low-budget it uses Bosco chocolate syrup for blood. The scene in which the little girl grabs a mortar trowel and... gee, is it possible to commit a spoiler for a movie this old?... anyway, that scene is the stuff of which nightmares are made.I haven't read the few negative comments posted here; I'm not interested in the point of view of anyone so shallow as to be dismissive of this (YES) classic. But a few words for you lightweights. Whatever humor you perceive in NOTLD is intentional: it's called black comedy. If you don't like black-and-white movies, then you're denying yourself some of the greatest movies ever made (the same goes, cretins, for silents and for subtitled imports). If you're bored by this movie, you're borING. Take your tiny mind and your brief attention span to the multiplex for the latest Van Damme opus. I have spoken. Let no mouth open to gainsay me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not "Night of the Living Dead" * *</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider "Night of the Living Dead" one of the best horror films ever made.Even though I was never frightened by the film,it stood on that certain scale of fear when you put your shoes in the character's situation.Me and a friend rented this film which was rereleased on video a couple of years back on video for it's 30th anniversary.What was odd was that this film was rereleased in 1999 which made the film 31 years old.We returned the film within 15 to 20 minutes of the film.This was not "Night of the Living Dead' that we were watching.This was cinematic butchery.Here,a great horror film,which for many years still holds up 'til this very day,is now ruined through video tampering and extra footage which although seems pretty good to look at doesn't seem to fit in.The 30th anniversary edition of this film gets a slap in the face from me.I usually do not review films that I haven't seen in its entirety but since I have seen the original "Night of the living Dead' in its entirety,then I felt that watching this version wouldn't be necessary.First of all the new footage doesn't match with the film itself.The new footage was shot in the mid 1990s and the fact that they inserted it in the original film is deceiving.we are lied to.Maybe if new footage were filmed a couple of years later it would have seemed OK because the film quality would match and the original stars of the film wouldn't have changed much."Halloween" went through the same thing back in 1981 but at the reasons for filming additional scenes were appropriate and the timing was right.The timing wasn't right for this one.The filmmakers who filmed the 30th anniversary edition did seem to have the right idea and I did enjoy the extra footage a little.But they had no place in the original film.What annoyed me was the fact that the title cards and the music were changed."Night of the Living Dead" was altered before when it was colorized.That didn't seem to bother me.If I was younger I would have loved this version.i don't know why."Night of the living Dead" deserved a better rerelease on video than this.I would recommend the original "Night of the living Dead".The black and white version.but if I were to recommend a revised version then I recommend two versions.the colorized version and the remake.At least in the remake the filmmakers didn't grab footage from the original and spliced it with footage in the remake.It was all new."Night of the Living Dead",which is one of the best horror films ever made,deserved better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was about ten years old the first time I saw "Night." It was Halloween, appropriately, but I never got to finish the movie (stupid trick-or-treating:). I never saw the ending, and it haunted me for four straight years. Finally, I got a chance to get it off the Internet at Throttlebox. After an interminable wait, I witnessed the intense conclusion to the movie. This made me a lifelong fan of the "Dead" trilogy. Don't listen to the people who regard it as "boring" and "old" - this movie is a lot less boring than "Psycho," for instance (though I like Hitchcock movies in general)."Night" is made in the same vein as other claustrophobic thrillers like "Lifeboat" and the "Twilight Zone" episode "Five Characters in Search of an Exit." It is less a conventional horror movie than a psychological treatment of conflict. I have seen this movie at least a dozen times, but it never fails to impress me.***SPOILERS!***Top 5 Parts:1. After Ben knocks the fourth zombie out the door, a truly horrifying reveal shot shows half a dozen more zombies coming ominously into the background.2. The ghastly stabbing sequence features what may be the most disturbing scream EVER.3. Zombies eating Tom and Judy's remains - definitely stomach-churning.4. Ben shooting the zombie again and again, and the creepy music that accompanies it.5. The incredibly cool still-photo credits sequence - an antidote for all those horror movies that end with a heavy metal song and/or the possibility of a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Title refers not to the living dead, but the dead living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSNight of the Living Dead is a terrifying, landmark horror film. It is about seven people who take refuge in an abandoned house in the countryside from the zombies roaming outside. It seems the newly deceased are being revived and turned into flesh-eating monsters. Unfortunately, those aren't the only monsters they have to contend with, there's each other too.George A. Romero directs in gritty black &amp; white (by choice not necessity). This is very effective as it adds to the claustrophobic mood of the film. It almost looks like a documentary, bringing to mind the look and feel of the Vietnam era during which the film was made (look at the final scenes in particular).It took me a while to realize it, but the title of this film does NOT refer to the zombies. It refers to the living people who are in a dead state of mind.Example: Harry and Ben waste no time in taking an intense dislike of each other. They proceed to fight over who should have the gun, whether to go for help, and most of all, whether to stay upstairs or barricade themselves in the cellar. Guess who's right? Then there's the bickering between Harry and Helen. Harry tries to bully her, while Helen whines away, driving him crazy. Harry and Helen's daughter Karen is fast slipping away from being bitten by one of the zombies. Barbara, already in shock from her first encounter with the ghouls, wisely decides to withdraw from the proceedings by becoming catatonic. All the characters are already "dead" in their own way.It's ironic that while battling monsters, the characters should all turn into them. I guess there's nothing quite like an outbreak of flesh eating zombies to bring out your selfish, cowardly instincts to the surface.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Made Shockers from the 60's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First saw this movie when I was 12 years old at a horror movie festival. One of the most powerful,shocking,disturbing,well made,&amp; black humored tales of the turbulent 60's,compared this to such tame,wimpy,mainstream garbage like Scream to see what I mean.Romero pulls no punches &amp; really delivers the goods.The beginning has to be the best part,Romero has us set up to believe Johnny will be the hero of the piece,only to have the tables turn on him,and considering what happens to Johnny,his return towards the end is shocking &amp; surprising,an image of terror that is surely one of horror cinema's best.Plus what happens to Barbara is even more surprising,we except her to get over her brother's death in a matter of minutes &amp; do everthing she can to kill the ghouls &amp; get out of the house(a mistake that was unwisely made in the worthless remake)She however does not,instead she withdraws into a catonic state,believing Johnny is alive even though she witnessed his demise,and at one point,even attempting to run out of the safety of the farmhouse!!!You have to give credit to Romero for making the brave &amp; wise decision of having the lead hero being black,which was unheard of back then,unfortunately since then,it seems every time we see a black person in a horror movie,they are always the first to get killed off. The ending still packs a punch,turning the tables on all those cliche endings of the 50's &amp; 60's.Your best bet is to seek out the out of print Elite DVD,it was made from the original negative &amp; is THX approved.Also available in two different colorized versions,one from the now defunct Hal Roach Studios,the other a more recent release from CST.If you must watch the color version,go with CST/Best. Also released in a cut &amp; butchered "Anniversary" edition,avoid it like the plague,otherwise you've been warned............</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a shocker - an intelligent horror!! (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead has been referenced, copied and spoofed so often that watching it for the first time was a little disorientating. As was the case when hearing the Great Escape theme in the actual movie, or seeing Psycho's shower scene in the context of the story, it was hard to escape the feeling that this was something big. Unfortunately, as was also the case with those examples, it was over-familiar before the opening credits had rolled. But it must be remembered that what is cliché now was original then, and it deserves better than to be marked down for the predictability hindsight has given it. Despite years of imitation and repetition, this is a king among a genre of plebs.The strengths of the film's story come in its simplicity: a handful of strangers are gathered in a house in rural Pennsylvania that's gradually being surrounded by a mounting army of flesh-eating zombies. With the simplest of set-ups and the tiniest of budgets, George Romero and his co-writers relied on imagination and invention rather than flash and gore, and for the most part they succeed.The opening scenes are gentle, as a bickering but charming brother and sister visit their dad's grave, but the tone is darkened as Romero pulls a Psycho on us by killing one of them off. Immediately, as was the case with Hitchcock's masterpiece, we know that no-one is safe. This is really the most important rule of horror; there's nothing less interesting than seeing people killed in the order you'd predicted, while the three most prominent characters survive unscathed.From this promising beginning, the movie never loses its nerve or its black heart, and is all the better for it. We are given a sense of the wider picture through news footage of the country-wide phenomenon, but we stay with just our small group to experience it on an intimate, emotional level. The acting is often so wooden that the cast could have boarded up the house with themselves, but the actual characters are surprisingly well developed. It's pleasing to have an African-American as the most positive character in a movie from this era, and his cohabitants mostly manage to avoid becoming the stereotypes they could easily have been. As is rarely the case with horror, we at least care about whether or not these people make it through the night. This investment in the characters pays off in the cruel, ironic and perfect finale.The film's realism - undoubtedly one of its strengths - extends beyond its documentary-style filming into the story, so the questions the audience asks to itself are answered, or at least discussed, onscreen. Arguments over whether to hide in the basement or in the boarded-up ground floor, whether to stay in the house or flee to a rescue station, to fight the zombies or wait for rescue, are all ones we would ask if we were in the situation ourselves, and their inclusion in the script brings an intelligence that elevates the film further from its B-movie origins.Night of the Living Dead, while flawed and undoubtedly over-rated, is a good movie that rates as one of the best in a generally poor genre. Claustrophobic, tense, involving, inventive, realistic and true to its characters and mythology, it slaughters the easy, infantile, glossy shocks found in the likes of the Scream franchise, which thinks having someone jump out from behind a tree is enough to call itself horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redefined the fright film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** It's midnight, and the theater is fairly crowded. People are whispering; shifting uneasily in their seats; waiting. The house lights dim, and the curtains part. Ominous music begins as we open on a black and white shot of a deserted back road. A car appears in the distance, moving along the winding road toward us; passes; turns up a hill and cruises slowly through a cemetery. The car comes to a stop and a bickering brother and sister, who have come to put a wreath on their father's grave, get out. The brother pauses before getting out when he hears the car radio come back on. Ominous music. They go to the grave and place the wreath on it. The brother teases the sister, trying to scare her- and then notices a man, dressed in a black suit, moving toward them. The brother runs off, leaving the sister to fend for herself when the man in the suit suddenly attacks her. At this point, the carefully measured camerawork of the preceding shots gives way to canted low-angle chaos. And so begins director George Romero's creepy classic, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.Eschewing the staid cliches of the past, Romero and company give us zombies with "bite"; ghouls fresh from the grave who crave human flesh. Unlike many of its predecessors, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD delivers- in a big way. Crossing lines few fright films of worth have ever dared cross, Romero gives us numbing horror as well as well-drawn characters in tense life-or-death situations. Although "inspired" by Richard Matheson's brilliant vampire novel I AM LEGEND (as well as the first feature film based on the book, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, with mis-cast Vincent Price in the lead), NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD quickly branches off into its own dark terrain, which Romero explores unflinchingly with his stark, documentary style of filmmaking. It was a powerful film when it was first released, and it's a powerful film today. Romero redefined the zombie in fright films, and thereby helped redefine contemporary film (along with Alfred Hitchcock). Not bad for a regional "fringe" filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes people should leave things alone. A classic movie should not be remade or tampered with. Of course, there are always exceptions, but this is not one of them. The new footage is atrocious and does not blend in with the old footage. The acting is beyond bad. I'll admit that NOTLD does not contain Oscar-caliber performances, but they are heads and shoulders above the dreck in the new footage.Further, the stock soundtrack is replaced with new music which frankly isn't very good. It takes away from the creepiness of the film. When the new music is playing, all the other sounds in the movie sound like they are coming out of a cardboard box. The original soundtrack was far far superior. There just seems to be a problem with the clarity of sounds in this version, and one of the characters looks like his voice doesn't exactly match his mouth (bad dubbing). I'll admit that I never noticed whether this occurred in the original, but this version fouled up so many things I can only imagine that it is a new problem.The other thing that hacks me off is that some of the original movie was edited out. Now I have seen the original film countless times, and I couldn't help notice little gaps in the action. I am not sure why they felt it necessary to edit little pieces of the film out, but some characters seem to jump towards actions with little or no explanation. Plus, some of the original zombie footage is edited out for the sake of the new and improved footage which rots.Bottom line, the new footage is poorly-acted, poorly written and merely interrupts the flow of the original plot. Probably the only positive thing I can say is that the remastered footage looks great. I can finally make out some of the detail that was difficult to see in the original version. I would love to see a remastered version without all of this additional tampering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I notice that most of the comments for this film praise it as a classic. I must agree completely. Since the movie was filmed in PA, that knowledge gives it, for me anyway, an even greater sense of creepiness, because in PA it's possible to go from urban sprawl to rural isolation-like the farm house in the movie-in a matter of minutes and on many occasions I've seen farm houses similar to the one in the movie. My only problem with the film is minor:The female corpse upstairs. It seems to me it should have returned from the dead with the rest of the recently deceased. Granted she was badly multilated, but if you listen carefully during scenes with the newscaster, you'll hear of torsos and other body parts coming back to life. But that is my only real problem with the film. Other than that, this is a masterpiece. See it without delay.</fullReview>

Yes, the acting leaves something to be desired, but the overall effect and impact of the film is excellent. I was grossed out, shocked, analytical and impressed all about. I could not wait to discover what would happen next, in an almost Hitchcockian fashion, and engrossed once the action got going.I usually expect influential films to be somewhat passe, with the themes, shots and ambience stolen by other directors. I had thought this would be such a film, that I might look at and say "Okay, this was used by so-and-so and that was done by this guy way better in '87". Not so. I can't think of a more interesting gore film ever done. Better horror, perhaps, but gore? No way. This is definitive.</fullReview>

Despite the lack of scares, the film is a social commentary for that particular era. The race issue was a fantastic idea for this film, I found the premise original.The acting is pretty good as is the direction. The photography is stunning, the blacks and whites are very strong.The film reaches an excellent, but thoughtful finale, I recommend this one, but I wish it was more intense in parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What i think of this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot for this film has been re-worked many times obviously staying within the boundrys of the genre of horror, but this film will always be the best. That is just my view, but i think that many thousands of people around the world would agree with me. Most horror fans have this film in their collection, and as a person who likes these type of 'zombie' films i must admit that i also own the re-make by savini the original SFX makeup guy), this film will always be a classic cult horror film, romero was a GENIUS!!!!!!!/.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm preparing to give you a frank and honest opinion of this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so one day in 1968, George Romero makes what can only be described as the best horror film ever made. 30 years later, the crew who succeeded in getting nowhere try to remake a few tit bits in the vain hope that they can pull in a bit more cash off Romero's back. In the process they manage to totally betray and ruin Romero's apocalyptic vision, and totally take away the dry satire of a world gone mad. NOTLD was never about zombies to me, it was always about the ineptitude of the human race and their inability to deal with a common enemy, instead using each other as scapgoats. Well this version is about zombies. The tacked on scenes stick out like "well i don't know what" (to quote one of the less moronic statements from the new characters) and the acting is simply atrocious. The directing of the new scenes not only gets undermimed by the original film, but totally shown up by it. You would have thought that 30 years down the line they would have learnt how to string a few infantile shots together and at the same time be able to deliver a line without sounding like they are improvising. But no! While Romero himself went off to create the most amazingly intelligent films, these people, obviously stuck in the past, run back to their old franchise just to be embarrassed by Romero's footage in spectacular fashion. The new music has, to me, turned the film into a 90's slasher flick, not making it eerie, but rather cheesy and sad. The seemingly silent cinema story telling of the original has been insulted with a bizarre arse-fest of cheap keyboard effects. Even more insulting, was the supposed "long awaited sequel" that Russo financed off the back of this film, completely ignoring Romero's Dead trilogy and trying to claim it as his own! If I was Romero, I'd slap him down like the girl he is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like a lot of other people posting here, I think Night of the Living Dead is a classic, but I also think that the story beneath the story is interesting enough to point out. Just think about it; the story is set in 1968 and who is the hero? Right, the hero is a young black man. Not too many young black heroes in movies back in "68", and this particular black guy just happens to come upon a mostly deserted farm house with a young frightened white woman inside. Might not seem like a big deal now, but back then this was stuff you just didn't see too much of. Also, who are the bad guys/gals? They are the corpses that have come back to life, and they just happen to be mostly rural white folks corpses.Interesting stuff I think, kind of along the lines of what James Cameron usually does in his movies with the hero being female(Alien/Aliens - Sigorney Weaver, Terminator - Linda Hamilton)...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ranks among the top ten best horror films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at the age of ten. I was sick and could not get out of bed. My dear mother decided to go to the store, and left me alone at home with the television on. Unfortunately for me, "Night of the Living Dead was playing, commercial free. since then, I have been a great admirer of this little, low budget, black and white, horror movie. Not that I admired the film the first time i saw it in my incapacitated state, but since then, I knew this movie was not for ten year old children. This film incorporates a documentary style element which adds much to the flavor. It starts to become real enough so that you gain the fears and anxieties of the characters. Few films like this are being made nowadays. Not even "BlairWitch Project" truly captures the element of fear from its characters as does "Living Dead." In my opinion, "Night of the Living Dead" is a masterpiece of film. It ranks among the top ten best horror films, and it should form the basis of inspiration to any one interested in a career in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>timeless masterpiece that epitomizes all a horror movie should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>contrary to popular belief and most of what has been written about by critics, this movie is not juvenilia or a shock-fest of any kind. in fact, the gore in this one is relatively tame and will probably (these days) not make even the average viewer flinch. nor is it a 'B-movie' in the sense of being inadvertently amusing or hokey. anyone who has watched this one steadily and really bit into it (no pun intended) will not see an ounce of humor in it. i think romero is more philosophical than he has been given credit for, and when you watch this classic in particular we can read some serious and relevant messages about society and the nature of man between the lines. even in a horrifying situation the like of which these people are plunged into, petty nonsense like racial bigotry and trivial personal quarrels are not only likely to arise but are inflamed all the more due to the seriousness and possibly deadly danger they are faced with. unable to set aside their differences in a time needy of cooperation and the most intense group effort and loyalty, they fail miserably and allow their bitter emotions to tear them apart and are destroyed as a result. we get the sense from the opening scene with barbara and her brother that danger is lurking just beneath the surface, even in the most deceptively 'normal' of situations, i.e. putting flowers on a loved one's grave. perhaps romero is even making a stinging commentary on the human denial of vulnerability and death? they spend the entire night boarding up windows, screaming at each other and frantically trying to figure out ways to escape, when the reality is that they are almost certainly doomed and their efforts are utterly futile. only the black man survives, but even this small victory doesn't matter; he is killed by the sherrif's posse in a brutal and ironic ending to an equally brutal but terror inspiring and masterfully done movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Midnight Horror Cult Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me awhile to appreciate this film as it was supposed to be appreciated. I hadn't liked this film for a while because I thought it was some overrated midnight garbage that was good for one or two viewings. In other words, I put it in the same category as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. But I was wrong. Still, I had to view it three or four times to REALLY view it. It's such an excellent film that it deserves its place along with other cult classics like DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and that crowd. From start to finish, we're taken on an eerie trip through the Pennsylvanian backwoods and into a horror that could only be imagined. Why are they coming back to life? Is it radiation poisoning? What is it? It's just a haunting trip that, though not nearly as entertaining as its sequel, is still very deserving of its 7.5/10 user rating. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was made on a shoestring budget, and it shows, but who REALLY cares? Distributed by hundreds of video companies because not one company had the license to distribute it, in other words, there was no copyright proprietor. And in 1986, Hal Roach Studios released a colorized version which I own but I'm scared of seeing because it probably looks like cr*p. The 30th Anniversary released by Anchor Bay wasn't as bad as people say and it was also enjoyable. ****out of****Bring this film to your Halloween Party this year, I guarantee you won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one will still scare the devil out of you. Sure, it's techniques are a little rough, the story is dumb, and the acting will not win any Oscars but for sheer "jump out of your seat" appeal, it's got it all. This film has been reviewed so many times that there probably is not a lot more to say about it. I first saw it at a Midnight Movie in 1970 and couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was particularly gory for the time.There are great lines that have become part of the cult vocabulary..........."They're coming to get you Barbara"....."What's happening"............"Where's Johnny". The ending is totally unexpected and the scene where the truck blows up and the ghouls attack to eat what is left will certainly trigger your gag reflex. Highly recommended for horror fans, it's a true cult classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Synopsis: After a NASA accident causes radiation to fall against the eastern seaboard, the dead awaken from their graves with the only thought of devouring humans alive. In the Pennsylvania countryside, seven people all trapped by the same circumstance in a farmhouse, for one reason or another. Forced to work together, they'll have to pull off a very risky escape or find themselves the victims of the burgeoning army of the undead, which are heading directly for the house. Featuring a prophetic subplot about a raving preacher.The Review: The old adage: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Well, if it isn't broken, why do you add scenes that are just a waste of time? Russell Streiner, co-star and producer of the original helped produce these scenes that just don't add up. The score, however, is terrific by adding an even creepier vibe to the film. Unfortunately, the newly added scenes feel contrived and implicate that of a direct to video feel. One particular notice is a ridiculous subplot involving a ranting preacher whom you wish would end up getting devoured by the zombies. The scenes try to add a backstory to the illustrious first zombie that we see in the beginning, but it just doesn't seem to work. If you love the original, then don't see the 30th anniversary, because key scenes are eliminated from the film, and replaced by scenes that should've remained on the cutting room floor.The Original: A The 30th Anniversary Edition: D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for a laugh? Not for thirty bucks!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard they were shooting new scenes for Night Of The Living Dead I got excited, because I'm such a big fan of the movie I thought it would be great to see newly inserted footage. Well then I saw it, and it was undoubtedly the most ridiculous thing I'd ever seen. In fact, when I show friends the original cut, I then ask them if they want to see something funny, and I show them the new footage. It gets a laugh every time. The only good thing I can say about this heaping pile of poo, is that the man Romero had nothing to do w/any of it. Cheers to George! Why is it bad? Let me count the ways: First off, if you listen to the commentary on the DVD by Russo and his accomplices (Hinzman, Streiner, and Michelucci) they go on and on about how seamless the new footage goes w/the old footage. Uh, okay. What movie are they watching in the recording booth? Because in the one I saw, the new footage stuck out like a...well, like new footage from this movie. The idea of putting a mask on Hinzman to make him look they way he did thirty years ago was indeed a good one...in Bizarro World (sorry). He couldn't have looked any less like his younger self if they'd given him a pair of glasses w/a big fake plastic nose attached. You go from 'fat-head' Hinzman, to 'little-head' Hinzman. Is that the same guy? It has to be, they look exactly alike! I think they were trying some type of subliminal hypnotic suggestive thing. Hoping people would watch their commentary, and then walk away saying 'yes-the-new-footage-was-seamless-I-could-not-tell-a-difference'. Second: The preacher. If you've seen this then I don't really need to elaborate. There are so many things about this guy that are lame, but my favorite is the fact he seems to never have actually read the bible. I quote: "Like the floods in Noah's time!" Yeah, that was in Genesis, it's right up front if you'll look. Third: Speaking of the preacher, the guy (whose name I don't feel like looking up) was also the composer of the new score. Listening to someone hit random keys on the piano is fun! What? A whole CD of this is included! Rule! Fourthly (a word?): Is it just me, or does the radio we hear while Ben fortifies the house repeat itself? I'm confused. One more point: It's right at the beginning, and it's one of those things that when you hear it, you know you're in for a rough ride. When the two bone-heads are carrying Hinzman's coffin (that's 'fat-head' Hinzman), and one of these fine actors says: "This thing is as heavy...as well, I don't know what." Man, that is heavy. Russo may have let this guy improvise here, because I'd hate to think some one actually wrote that line on paper and then kept it there. The saddest thing is I paid a lot of money for the collector's edition DVD, and now I'm stuck w/it because it ain't selling for jack on ebay.</fullReview>

A nasty scheme to make money off a movie held very dearly by a lot of people.It doesn't even include the original music as an option!!! What is up with that? It should AT LEAST have included the original, untouched version of the film...then, the new stuff would have just been fun for most people.

		<shortDescription>Absolutely terrific horror movie. Spectacular classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very often the best movies aren't the ones that are made by using an unreasonably big budget. "Night of the living dead" is a choice example of a perfect horror movie although it's just a tiny little flick that turned out to be one of the most notable movies of its kind. When you think about some of the laughable lines, odd reports from the radio, the humorously stiff motions of the zombies and the whole ridiculous and absurd idea behind this film it's interesting to realize that even though this movie should be absolutely full of unintended comedy, it isn't. Most of the viewers takes everything that's happening on the screen dead seriously. You're just watching "Night of the living dead" thinking "Gosh, this is foolish as hell...but surprisingly: it's still working."Thanks goes to George A. Romero who had the vision and the talent to create a pressuring and stirring ambience and the actors who were basically wonderful but just a bit amateurish. It kind of made it feel like they're just ordinary people. Be ware of the 30th anniversary edition of "Night of the living dead". It's one thing to remaster and old movie classic but to make new scenes 30 years after it's original release and then add 'em into original movie...it has to be some kind of a sick joke. It's like taking a painting of Picasso and adding some more colors and figures into it. There's simply no reason to fool around with a masterpiece. The one thing I especially loved about this movie was the startling ending. It's different in the new version and it makes me sick. Stick with the original. It's one of the very best horror films ever made. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead...what can we say about?It paved the way for entire tidal-wave of spawned sequels and other elated films and practically opened up the zombie-movie-era.Although rebutted as horror,low-budget trash, the movie is actually a masterpiece of low-budget cinema... Nowadays acclaimed cult-director George A. Romero directed this masterpiece with only $114.000 available to him and made it into a black &amp; white movie in stead of the upcoming color movies available with the new color TV...The story about a band of people being trapped in a farmhouse fencing off a horde of bloodthirsty zombies is in itself simple enough. Where the movie stands out is in it's dark atmosphere and mood set by the use of black and white footage and eerie music Romero got from an audio library! The element of the small group of people against what it seems the forces of nature (actually a UFO radiation accident!) has the viewer enthusiastically rally on the side of the group. Also, the interaction between the people themselves (from the start dividing them into 2 camps) is in itself a nice portrait of human society.Some of the stars of the movie (including Mr. Cooper) were investors providing Romero with his budget...this also donates to the overall feel of the movie...Night of the Living Dead is a true classic in its genre...watch it with lights out and the sound up....!!!</fullReview>

There's some interesting never seen before clips with Ben, Tom &amp; Jody but the pointless newly shot sequences by John Russo are jarring and completely redundant (not to mention badly acted!), totally unnecessary and distracting from the film. I also missed some of the original music score, replaced in key scenes with a synthetic piece of ridiculous filler that even Albert Pyun would have scrapped on a bad day. But the worst crime of all was changing the beginning and savaging the unforgettable, powerful ending of the original. Stick with the original, even if this one looks razorsharp. Looks can deceive.

		<shortDescription>An amazing film, let down by pointless additions...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I continue, I had better start by saying - this is the first and only version of the film I have ever seen. I bought it on DVD not really realising what it was...Once I'd realised that this was a re-released version of the film with extra scenes recorded nearly 30 years after the original, I thought.... damn! However, the DVD lets you watch the original without the new scenes - though it does force you to have the newly written score, which is actually pretty good. I do think that they may have left in some of the original score as well, and at times the new music sticks out as being too 'recent' sounding. There should have been the option to keep the old soundtrack.Nevertheless, this film really is as good as everyone says. I actually saw Dawn of the Dead first on UK TV, which is arguably the best in the series. I chose to initially watch this film in it's original incarnation (with the new score) and loved it... I won't go into why, because this is pretty well documented by everyone else. Then I chose to watch the newly shot scenes immediately after....(possible spoilers follow!)They really stink. Firstly, they add a new scene at the beginning featuring the first zombie you see in the film (which ruins the surprise later on) - they even got the same guy in to play him and yes, he looks 30 years older. In fact you might not even realise it is meant to be the same zombie. This scene is only made worse by the supremely hammy acting of "Reverend Hicks" and two slack-jawed rednecks. Considering the quality of the acting of the original, this is unforgivable. The next few added scenes are just extra views of zombies wandering about, eating dead humans and moaning. Hardly essential stuff, and they're hardly gory since they're filmed in B&amp;W anyway. Finally there is another scene at the end featuring the Reverend again, having been bitten by a zombie yet apparently unaffected by the 'disease'. He claims that it's the love of god or something, but does so in his extremely overacted, ultra-hammy way. It also ruins the otherwise-excellent end. The justification for these scenes is that Romero had them in his original script - but he cut them for a reason, and I don't believe it was just financial. They are crap!If you're going to get this film, buy another version - there must be a better one. The original is one of the best (and the earliest) horror films ever created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deceiving disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no purist, so when John Russo talked to us about his intentions to re-vamp this film (at a Chiller tradeshow) and how George Romero gave him permission to have some fun with it , I really awaited for his "original" spin on this film . My feelings are that adjustments to a film can be exciting if the intent is to either, add to the meaning of the film, fit in old scenes that were cut because of time concerns or if there were original ideas that couldn't be "fleshed" out at the time, go ahead and play around with it. Russo and his old crew buddies made it sound like the film warranted the update. Listening to their backstage dialog, you'd think that they had created a better version. Despite their commentaries to the contrary, they obviously went at this with a rusty pickax. Sure, it's interesting to try to match film techniques to the original but none of the new scenes added anything important to the original. Since the beginning of the film industry, committees have made the same mistake, over and over. In their attempt to offer their "art" to the public, they have, once again, made the assumption that the audience is too stupid to be there. In this case, we do not need to know the origins of the cemetery ghoul. Okay, it was fun to learn that he was a murdering pedophile. But the original introduction leading us to the cemetery was much creepier. We do not need explanations as to why there are so many ghouls coming to the house (the audience understands that there's a cemetery nearby for god's sake). In fact, offering up that the ghouls came from Beekman's diner reduces the scare. It's much more effective to not know how many ghouls there were out there. It gives the audience the impression that the threat is much more rampant. And as to the "edit" of a scene in the cellar based on Russo's trouble with a shakey jumpcut in the original, they have made a "deadly" mistake. To eliminate the jumpcut, a very important dramatic sequence was eliminated which gave the audience a glimpse at the dissolving marriage of the Coopers. This edited scene also explained why Helen Cooper wanted to run upstairs. And this isn't the only sloppy and unnecessary cut. When blood from the woman upstairs drips onto Barbra's hand, a small scene is obliterated as she screams and runs into the living room. This shot is so badly cut, you can still hear a part of her scream as the camera jumpcuts to the ghouls breaking the headlights. In the original version, there are two shots of a naked female ghoul from behind. One is a close up and the other is long shot. In the new version, for no reason, these two shots are gone. In the 98'"edit which is included with this dvd, the long shot still remains. Why are these tampered with? Is it because the filmaker's daughters are now in the re-cut? In their goofy commentaries on the film, we get to hear how painstakingly they tried to adhere to the original intent. Unfortunately, they achieved exactly what they didn't want to create: a unnecessary slash of the creepier original. It's also better to not even mention the lousy new soundtrack! It makes sense to me that HBO had a hand in this. It looks and feels and, due to an overblown soundtrack, sounds more like a "Tales From The Crypt" episode. The black/white film is way too contrasting. It's scares are reduced considerably and having to watch the older scenes intercut into the new pieces only makes one pine more for the original. I genuinely wanted to see Russo's new ghoulfest but it's obvious to me that Filmakers should stop trying to be editors. This version comes off more like a showcase for the filmaker's daughters instead. I thought that we would, at least, find out why they decided to have dead daughter kill her mother with a weapon and not eat her flesh! Guess not! And if they were so intent on recreating the feel of the first, why couldn't some "body" find a business suit for the reporter that wasn't from 1982! Oddly enough, this dvd features the cleanest copy of the film that I've ever seen. My last word is that this is more of a novelty than a keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the definitive classics of horror....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero's film, made on a meager $14,000 budget, became a milestone in horror films, spawning countless ripoffs that never came on par with this 1968 original. The film starts off with a young woman and her brother paying a visit to her father's grave at a lone cemetary in the Pennsylvania countryside. A virtually deserted area, Barbara and her brother pay respects, only to have her brother teasing her in a moment of immature fashion, particularly of a strange man roaming the graveyard in an odd daze. The woman proceeds to apologize to the man only to find herself attacked by something much more darker than she'd expect, and her brother immediately comes to her defense. He only finds himself at the wrong end of the fight, and the woman scampers off like a bat out of hell as the dazed man makes a walk for her. She takes residence in a large farmhouse, and finds herself one of the six survivors trying to defend themselves against a burgeoning army of the living dead. Romero's film is genuinely creepy because it's a throwback to the films of Doris Day and Jimmy Stewart. It's a no holds barred creepfest that becomes scarier by the moment. Depending on the tension inside the house, or the hordes of undead outside. With it's small budget, Romero sought the help of local actors, friends, and neighbors to play the zombies. George Hinzman, the first zombie in the film, was actually in makeup. This is a film to watch with the lights off and the sound up. It was listed as one of the films in AFI's 100 Thrills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first most noted piece of horror work, held in acclaim by zombie fans world-wide, NotLD held audiences in its grip when it was first released.The dark setting, the abandoned house, the conflict of the humans within, and the threat of the zombies with-out.. Made on a reasonably low budget, with poor special effects, the film had to rely solely on suspense, and it did so with amazing results. Bringing into question a variety of morals, situations and judgements, it brings the audience into the thick of the action, holding them fast, as it slowly works its way towards the surprising, but to great effect, end... A wonderful film, the mark of a whole genre to follow, that would never again achieve the same effect...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of first seeing this movie while living alone, on Halloween night, with a thunderstorm raging outside! Perfect! I love to be scared and no movie, to this day, has such an effect on me as NOTLD. As I read other comments about this movie, I agree that there is a big issue with being in a claustrophobic situation; out in the middle of nowhere practically, near a cemetary, and one of my biggest fears: being chased! The movie is great in that something so black and white, so cheaply made and so simple in it's message, can be so GOOD! George Romero outdid himself. To this day, I will pop the video into my VCR, turn out all the lights, and watch it. I still get scared! The only thing I will disagree with (but I guess it's all in personal taste) is that this movie shouldn't be watched in a large crowd. Too many times what YOU may think of as scary is funny to another (as I witnessed when I saw "The Exorcist" at the movie theatre on it's re-release recently and had to contend with a group of idiots laughing behind me). I think it should be watched by just yourself. I appreciate it more this way. I can (and have) watch it a thousand times over and still see something new in it every time: the look of pure "ghoul glee" on the face of one "ghoul" as he peers through the wood slats barely holding them back towards the end is great. I LOVE when the reporter is talking to Chief McClellan, asking him about what people should do if they are attacked by any zombies and the reporter says at the end of the discussion with the Chief, "are they slow moving, Chief?" And he answers: "Yeah, they're dead, they're....all messed up." Love it! But I have a question: I cannot find out the name of the actor who played Johnny, Barbra's brother! Does anyone know what his name is??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this version (the 1968 original) after seeing the more recent remake and I have to confess that as far as gore movies go I liked the remake better. Not to take anything away from Romero's original. This one paved the way for zombie movies, like Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. The photography is great so the fact that it is in black and white doesn't matter at all. It gets slow in the middle of it, when the movie is showing character traits. I didn't like the whole broadcast thing where the news reporters try to explain the whole thing. It takes the mystery away from the plot. The ending is great and will leave you with mixed emotions. Overall is a great movie if you're into Resident Evil and stuff like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, just a mostly useless update to a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> The 30th anniversary edition of NOTLD was not as bad as I expected it to be. The added scenes are mostly useless. The background behind the cemetary zombie adds some behind sight, but, most of it is extemporaneous. The tacked on new ending, supposedly to be shocking, as the DVD liner notebook says, is bland, and appears to be advertising a possible sequel. (Possibly "Children Of The Living Dead?") Technically, the added footage is not as bad as I expected it to be. It does not blend in flawlessly, obviously. You can quite tell where the new material is, but, from a mechanical standpoint, they did a pretty good job at trying to match the original material. The only problem being the new material is not necessary.  The soundtrack was altered in several places that were also useless. The new music track is the most obvious, as the original musical soundtrack is far better. The radio reports from the original film were rescripted to add some more background information, and, while unnecessary, they were inserted fairly well, using the narrator from the first film. The bright spot about the 30th edition is the digital remastering. Finally, a superb quality print. I'd seen the film for 14 years before this version, and, I never noticed some of the details in the basement scene at the end, like Mr. Cooper missing an arm. A visually perfect transfer, it's just too bad they didn't do this with the original, without added footage and new music. You won't waste your money buying this, but, you won't gain much beyond the digital transfer either. The DVD is more recommended because of the behind the scenes extras and narrative commentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Horror Classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that set the standard for realism in horror movies even if barely anyone follows George Romero's example. It is more a study into human behavior as several strangers are trapped in a farmhouse and have to fend for themselves and depend on each other. Just to throw a wrench into the works, one of the strangers turns out to be a jerk and the local news is only being to inform the public of what they know so these people have to deduce what is happening on their own. There is no real indication as to what is causing all the zombies (living dead) to rise from their graves, nor is the reason needed. The movie has a very good plot, excellant acting and a fantastic atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The triumph of the dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero´s story tells the total overrun of living dead all over the world, subdivided into three parts: at the beginning there is the immortal classic "Night of the living Dead", followed by the sensational "Dawn of the Dead", and finally, the very underrated "Day of the Dead". Every one of these three movies has got the same basic principle: a little group of humans is under siege by an army of zombies. Inside of the farmhouse/the bunker are growing conflicts between the different parties, because they are not able to find an agreement (between the races in "Night...", between military and scientists in "Day...). Instead of finding a solution they always kill themselves at the end. It seems to be a sign of destiny that only those survive who can keep their own individuality. The end in "Night of the living Dead" is pretty bitter: Duane, the only surviver in the farmhouse, gets killed by a group of vigilantes, because they think that he´s one of the zombies. The final photographs show, how Duane gets burned together with all the other executed corpses. Romero shows this in expressionist pictures, a style, that runs through the whole film: there is a subtle play between light and shadow, brightness and darkness that gives this film his inimitable touch (one of the most remarkable scenes is, when the dead girls attacks her own mother). You can find a copy of "Night of the living Dead" nowadays in the museum of modern art in New York, although this film got a lot of bad critics when it came out: perhaps because George A. Romero did a cynical comment on the Vietnam war with this, perhaps the little group inside the house reflected the state of the whole American society from the late 60s... At the beginning of the 90s Tom Savini made a remake, that is may suspense-packed but it has got nothing of the social criticism that Romero wanted to tell. "Night of the living Dead" has influenced many other films of a similar kind like John Carpenter´s "Assault on Precinct 13", but it takes it main importance from the fact that the modern horror film would be an other without it.

The unlikable characters stranded in an old farmhouse in the countryside while ghouls attack is claustrophobic and frightening. The actors aren't the greatest, but that doesn't really matter.

		<fullReview>This is the classic cult ghoul film. Some people have speculated whether the film has some sort of social message about nuclear paranoia, civil rights, or the threat of communism. It may have any or all of those ideas driving it, but the film is also an exercise in horror which displays the range of human psychological reactions toward horrifying events -- from Ben who keeps his cool throughout, to Mr. Cooper who is ready to surrender other people's lives to save his own, to Barbra who is in shock through most of the film.The ending is indeed ironic, and the film is one of the great horror classics because of the ending. Made on a low budget, the film is probably all the better for the lack of funds, especially in contrast to the bloated FX monstrosities we get lately.See it, have fun, and be afraid -- very afraid.

		<shortDescription>Two Versions on DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to point out that the DVD contains two versions: the 30th Anniversary Edition, which truly is as bad as everyone says it is, and the '98 Edition.The '98 Edition is the original movie with the new soundtrack. The new soundtrack was written for this version (not the 30th AE), and it works quite well. No synchronization problems here! Of course, those who prefer the original soundtrack will not be satisfied by this and should avoid this DVD at all costs.Both Editions have (per the booklet) the same soundtrack. This appears to be literally the case, and may be the primary reason why the 30th AE has so much footage missing -- so much that, if you do not know the original, you probably will not be able to follow the story! And you will probably wonder why there are two distinct sets of zombies, which are never shown together even though they are at the same location.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Important Horror Movie of the Modern Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead(1968) is an incredible movie experience that began one of the most successful periods for the horror genre. It was filmed in 1964 but didn't get released on the big screen until four years later. The makers of this succeeded in making a film that had a budget lower than Psycho(1960). The make up effects are ahead of its time for the year of 1968.The feature is about people who come back from the grave to launch an attack on the living including people who are trapped in a farmhouse. The editing of Night of the Living Dead(1968) is brilliant for a low budget cinema piece. This pic would give George A. Romero a great moment to begin his career on. The use of Pittsburgh is to the film's advantages because of its gothic feel.The opening scene in Night of the Living Dead is legendary for its macabre style beginning. What I love about the beginning is how things go from calm and quiet to suddenly hysterical when the first zombie appears. "They're coming to get you Barbra" is a line that earns its place among the annuls of horror pictures. This one scene has plenty of heart beating buildup and fearful dread.NOTLD went on to be one of the most important Independant movie besides Easy Rider to arrive in theatres during the last part of the 1960s. Changed the people looked about how to make a horror feature. Introduced the audiences with violence in a manner that was groundbreaking. After this, more and more horror flicks became more violent.One of the fascinating parts of the film is the division between the people in the farmhouse who are fighting off the zombies. What's revealed is that people who are divided are easily vulnerable to being destroyed during a crisis as oppose to those who work together. Its symbolic of the division among Americans when the protests about Vietnam were happening. The people in the farmhouse are responsible for the fate that falls on them because of the division between them.The photography of NOTLD is one of the pic's major assists. The black and white photography gives a moody and noirish atmosphere. Black and white photography was used because there wasn't enough money to use color. The photography heightens the tension of the film.Before NOTLD, zombies dealt mostly with the supernatural. One of the best examples of this is the motion picture, The Plague of the Zombies(1968). NOTLD created a new zombie mythology that's based on science. The only film since NOTLD was released to deal with voodoo in the traditional sense was Lucio Fulci's Zombie(1979).The ending is very tragic and twisted. Its also ironic because its a person who's not a zombie that is shot in the head. It symbolises the mindset of people in some parts of the countries. The end proved that many people during that time were driven to murder anyone who was of a different color.It was bigger in Europe then in America when the film was first released. One person that the movie impressed was Dario Argento. It would be one of the major things that led him and George Romero to work together on NOTLD's sequel Dawn of the Dawn(1978). Duane Jones is outstanding as the film's main hero, Ben.George Romero did an excellent job in the role of the cinematographer, director, editior, and writer. The director was inspired by the Richard Mathison novel, I Am Legend. One great NOTLD spinoff that came from this was the fab Let Sleeping Corpse Lie(1974). NOTLD is the highest peak of the horror mountain that other horror features since 1968 had aspire to reach.</fullReview>

The low budget, black &amp; white made this movie seem even more real &amp; raw. The twist and turns are great. There are parts in the middle that do seem kind of slow, but that really didn't hurt the movie that much. But what sets this movie apart from other horror flicks. Is the end. It leaves you feeling so cold. So empty. It's perfect. 9 out of 10 (Only a 9 because the reason why the zombies are doing this, is just to dumb for a 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, atmospheric, and frightening, often all at once...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I set out to review the 30th Anniversary Edition of Night Of The Living Dead on DVD, I had no idea of the treat I was in for. My editor advised me to look at the 30th Anniversary edit first, but I went against that and looked at the original 1968 cut first. I am glad that I did, because the 30th Anniversary edit takes all the impact out of the film. Zombies and other such flesh-eating monsters are much more frightening when you cannot completely explain their actions and motives, which makes the writer's attempts to recut the film so that it does further explain them all the more laughable.But I am getting ahead of myself here. It is hard to imagine what the audiences of 1968 were thinking as they sat down to a film that, at a fairly luxurious pace, shows a pair of siblings driving out to a small town cemetery to place a wreath on the grave of a relative. More than three decades later, the brother's haunting line "they're coming to get you, Barbra" is often used to introduce menus on DVDs containing one version or another of this work. Ninety percent of this line is in the delivery. It sounds so creepy that it accounts for most of the atmosphere in the film.The zombies themselves often look indiscernable from their living (in the true sense of the word) companions. Whether this was deliberate, or simply an effect of the low budget, I have no idea. By the time the delivery of the aforementioned line and the stock music sinks in, it becomes a moot point. These zombies convince because of the acting rather than the special effects.In a world where multiplex theatre and cookie-cutter garbage from the RIAA supposedly bring in millions of dollars per year, it is easy to miss the message that I got out of Night Of The Living Dead. Indeed, directors of certain other zombie films seem to have missed it. In essence, the zombie is the ultimate expression of mediocrity. They move slower than a Uwe Boll film, they can be easily beat down, but there is just so many of them that they overwhelm through sheer force of numbers. They don't think (although the same can be said for many who are supposedly alive), but they can help undo the best-laid plans. It is a pity modern directors don't seem to get this, but zombies are the ultimate statement about the society based around endlessly buying junk we don't need that is around us.The most striking thing about the film is that it has a vivid and rich atmosphere that many modern horror films lack. In spite of being shot full-frame, the film's visuals look more striking and vivid than many modern films that were shot anamorphically (this means you, Soul Survivors, et al). The scenes in the graveyard particularly benefit from the narrow, constricted, monochrome photography. There was an unofficial web site for a black metal band that proclaimed monochrome to be the only real thing in the world, and this film does a lot to further that argument. The stark look of the scenery and the characters furthers the horrific element. Like in The Evil Dead some twelve years later, George Romero chose his locations very well, giving the film a still-life look in many places.The film's pace never really gets above a crawl, but that helps it in many ways. The slow, tense atmosphere builds to a culmination in the end credits that, through simple still photography, communicate just how mad the world has gone in the past ninety minutes. Unfortunately, the writer of the film attempted to recut it in 1998. Among his many mistakes were the addition of attempted explanations for the sudden plague of zombies. Another was the addition of an unsubtle religious tone. When one experiences the beauty of Romero's original version, one realises the tale works more when it goes into less detail.I gave the original Night Of The Living Dead a ten out of ten. Don't bother with the 30th Anniversary Edition. It is another classic example of why revisionism in film does not work. The original has retained its influence for more than thirty years, and there is a good reason. See it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original and remake are both very good movies in my opinion (though it's been a while since I've seen the remake, I remember enjoying it), but I can say that after seeing the original for the first time, I was disappointed. Not because it is a bad movie -- it is a great movie -- but because I made the mistake of seeing the remake first.POSSIBLE SPOILERSI knew ahead of time that the two movies had different endings, so I was expecting that, and actually pretty excited about it, too, but the ending isn't why I was disappointed. My disappointment came from the Barbra character. Don't get me wrong, I understand how a person in that situation, going through what Barbra went through, seeing what she saw, would be a little gone. And also, my disappointment had nothing to do with Judith O'Dea. She was terrific as a catatonic Barbra, terrific as a "normal" Barbra, and I thought she was great for the part. But... Since I saw the remake first, I was expecting a much stronger Barbra, and through the entire movie I was just waiting for her to snap out of it and start doing something...anything. And finally she does, and I think to myself "okay now this is when she kicks some zombie ass," and what happens? She dies ten seconds later. But despite how I felt after watching this movie, I realized it was my own fault for watching the remake first, so I learned to accept it, gave it another chance, and found myself enjoying it. Now I can't wait to see Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. But I won't let myself get too excited...just in case.Night of the Living Dead (1968): 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very, very exellent film. When a spaceship spreads radiation in the air, it causes the dead to rize as zombies..Flesh eating zombies who prey on the flesh of the living. Seven characters are brought together in a farm house, but they refuse to put aside their differences and help each other and a brutal contest of wills results which ultimatly ends in everyone's downfall. It's incredible how good this very low budget film is. It was certainly the Blair Witch Project of it's day. The monocromatic B&amp;W photography is used very well, and the performances are very good for ameteurs. This film lurched George Romero to fame. This film is a great test of man's fears. The fear that we will be overpowered by something that can't even move, like a corpse, but will some how mysterously become able to destroy us. This film is certanly the best movie ever to depict zombies and maybe even one of the best horror movies. Zombies in this film are brainless creatures who have no souls and act on pure instinct. Another frightening aspect of this movie is how everyone panics and becomes very selfish and vicous. This film is in public domain, and it's downright amazing the videos you'll find of this. Some of them are marginal while others are downright ghastly! The best of any of the videos is the two tape set from Anchor Bay, which presents a transfer of the film that is ultra clean and looks great! Recently, also from Anchor Bay came The 30th Aniversary edition. It should not have been released. The new footage isn't bad but it's easy to tell what's new and what's old and anyway it just doesn't go well with the film. The film has also been recut and rescored which just doesn't work. Get Anchor Bay's two tape copy of this wonderful classic and you'll be just fine. My rating: ***** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Came From Pittsburgh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tiny industrial film company from Pennsylvania (better known for making training films, TV commercials and promotional featurettes) creates a threadbare budgeted horror film that set Hollywood on it's ear. A full generation before THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, this film stunned audiences around the world with it's unrelenting horror and suspense. It was literally unlike anything made for it's time.The high-grain black and white film stock, the claustrophobic lighting, the half-cliched stock music and near-amateur acting all add to the film's quality. Yes, it was made on a budget better suited for a TV commercial, but it was made against the odds (and the established film system), becoming one of the most successful independent features ever!The plot revolves around a terrified group of people hiding out in a farmhouse in rural Pennsylvania as the countryside is over-run by flesh-eating zombies, re-animated by an exploding atomic-powered space probe. As the time progresses, the atmosphere becomes more and more intense, and the film's starkness of quality becomes it's strongest asset.One of the first regionally produced feature films (all the production funds came from the Pittsburgh area), this has become the cornerstone upon which today's horror film industry has been built. It's the grand-daddy of them all (The Great-grandaddy being NOSFERATU)!WARNING: There has been a version of this film marketed as the "30th Anniversary Edition" that includes added sequences that were filmed MUCH later than this film. Avoid it at all costs!</fullReview>

"Night of the living dead" is an old-fashioned horror-movie from 1968, and it is even today an excellent movie. The movie is quite simple, but yet unique, and the movie inspired the "Resident Evil-series" for the Sony Playstation. The film is full of scary moments, cheesy moments, B-actors, simple effects and great camera-angles. Therefore the movie manages to keep your attention until it is over, and then you`d want to check out "Dawn of the dead", which is even better!Verdict: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty horror makes its debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" may appear dated in the way the characters look and behave, but the film still retains a certain quality that keeps it shocking. It may seem tame compared to some of the horror films that came after it, but the nihilistic tone of the movie remains affecting after all this time.The movie is cheaply made, and like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" that came five years later, this somehow helps "Night of the Living Dead" seem more realistic.Seven strangers find themselves taking refuge in a remote farmhouse to hide out from an ever-growing army of ghouls that have been reanimated with a hunger for human flesh. They soon find that the house has become their prison, and ultimately, their tomb. There is no happy ending here. Some of the characters are unsympathetic and/or unlikeable, but that doesn't matter; all the people, even the heroic characters, are dead by the time the final reel finishes. Not many films were like this before "NOTLD", and the same can be said for the graphic violence in the film. It was customary to leave certain things to the imagination of the viewer, but in this film we could clearly see ghouls devouring "human" limbs and innards. Even worse than the gore is the lack of hope that gradually overtakes the survivors of the zombie onslaught. They are weary, confused, and on edge. The bleakness is augmented by the black &amp; white photography, which usually appeared grainy due to the fact that so many prints of "NOTLD" (which lapsed into the public domain at some point) were battered and worn.Stylistically and thematically, the movie owes a lot to two earlier films: "Carnival Of Souls" to some extent, and "The Last Man On Earth" to an even greater extent. While "The Last Man On Earth" involved the audience after the great plague has already wiped out most of humanity, Romero's film signifies the beginning of society's collapse; his protagonists spend most of the film bickering and fighting amongst themselves, and are unable to pull together long enough to survive. It's a bleak vision, and one that seems particularly plausible, even if the scenario of flesh-eating ghouls is not.Beware any versions of the film that have been tampered with in any way, be it colorization or the god-awful "30th Anniversary Version" that features inept "newly added" footage that detracts from the film in a every conceivable manner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have never seen any of George A. Romero's "Living Dead" trilogy, you had better start now."Night Of The Living Dead" was the first of three great films released by George A. Romero to do with the horrors of the dead coming back to life and destroying civilization.What is great about this film is the fact that it has stood the test of time, and now, more than 30 years later, is still as good as ever, especially as it was a low-budget film of its era.I am extremely impressed with the way the film was portrayed. The characters were excellently casted and I would strongly urge those of you who are interested to go out and purchase this film or even rent it from your local video store.For full satisfaction, turn off lights and indulge in Ben &amp; Jerry's Chocolate Chip &amp; Cookie Dough. Perfection!Look out for "Dawn Of The Living Dead" and "Day Of The Living Dead" which are the sequels to this fantastic film.I will be writing reviews on these too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still scary after all these years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this film on late night TV back in 1978. Even thought I only caught the last 15 minutes, it was enough to creep me out. I was able to watch it in full a few years later on video. I had trouble sleeping, afterwards. This film is a classic of horror. The recent dead are mysteriously resurrecting and attacking the living. They eat their victims. The film's opening sequence is so chilling that it sets the tone for the rest of the picture. The plot involves eight people, who take shelter, in an abandoned farmhouse, from the flesh-eating ghouls. They sit in horror as they listen to the news that most of the nation is under siege from them. The film is relentless in pace throughout, thanks to a well-written narrative, cinema verite' style camera work, and good editing tequnique. The film also has a sense of humor, though not intentional (some of the newscasts will make you chuckle). This comic relief is temporary as the film leads to its tragic and ironic conclusion. George Romero is a truly gifted man. If you've never seen this film, I urge you to do so. I you have...see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classy, top-notch horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead is maybe the first horror movie that graced the silver screens with such violent, shocking scenes that even after more than thirty years, still can bring chills down your spine. Watching it nowadays, it's incredible how this low-budget, simple film survived the test of time and continues to scare a lot of people. Night of the Living Dead isn't just a horror film, it's a story about survival, about what men are capable of doing when they are in knife-edge situations. Romero does a great job with his movie, and he injects such power and relentless suspense to the flick that when you watch it, you fell like you are inside that house with those people, you fell every fright, every danger, every terror that those people on the film are facing.Another great point of the story is that you got believable, real characters, those people react at the situation the same way you or me would react. It's the same thing that John Boorman made with Deliverance, he putted ordinary people in extraordinary situations and simply showed what would happen to us on the same situation. The claustrophobic settings, the terrific performances (all of the main actors are great. They are not interpreting characters, they are bringing them to life!) and Romero's talent in directing a horror film make Night of the Living Dead a classic!if you want to have a good time with friends watching great horror movies, rent Night of the Living Dead, The Hills Have Eyes and Hellbound Hellraiser 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film that deals with just ordinary people and nightmare horrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero's classic, `Night of the Living Dead', has been interpreted in so many ways that the original intent of the film has been lost: what happens when you put people from different walks of life together to fight for a common cause.Sure, Romero was trying to make a social statement.He was also trying to scare the Hell out of us.Romero was a promising film student from Pittsburgh who wanted to make a movie that made both of those statements above. He wasn't trying to change the world. He just wanted to make the best movie he could for the money available. He went out and hired local actors for the film (including Tom Savini, who had to drop out when he was called to service in Vietnam. Boy, would this experience pay off when he came back to the States and create his trademark effects!).The group of people in the farmhouse Romero created was eclectic; a common-sense hero, a hysterical young woman, a no-nonsense middle-aged man and his sympathetic wife along with their daughter, and a young couple experiencing puppy love. The hero, played by Duane Jones, is not portrayed as black or white. He just happens to be a man brought to the house by happenstance. He has no political agenda, no idealistic dreams. Just a man running from a diner that was taken over by ghouls. As he describes what happened at the diner to a comatose Barbara, you imagine the horror those unfortunate people went through as they were being torn apart and eaten alive. The fuel truck being overturned. The driver being dragged out of the cab and being mangled and chewed on by things that look human but are not. It makes you feel that you were actually there witnessing the carnage. This is a very descriptive scene that implies the horror that not only the ordeal others had but the fate that lies ahead for the others.The indoor scenes are dramatic and powerful. Conflicts upon conflicts are piled on as decisions are made and then changed as to protect themselves from the ghouls. Should they try to stand and fight the onslaught? Should they try to flee to the next town deemed safe by TV anchors? Or should they hide and barricade themselves in the cellar. All three options are tried to some extent. For those who haven't seen the film, I will give no details.The stark b &amp; w footage only adds the to atmosphere of film, as when the ghouls are seen walking through the woods at night are scenes from your nightmares. The close-ups of the ghouls eating the flesh of the living is vivid and mindnumbing. There are some amateurish shots also, as when Ben is bent over the body of a ghoul he just killed. You can see Romero's hand waving Jones to move on and out of the scene. This is the only glaring mistake I can see through the film.You can tell that Romero was influenced by old horror comic books like `Tales from the Crypt', which had several stories of the walking dead. The idea of taking this concept and turning the ghouls into flesh eaters was a stroke of genius. He wanted to create a sense of doom and he succeeded.The only complaint I have with the film is the casting of Barbara. Her cantonic and amateurish acting is the only guff I have to an otherwise excellent film. If you are looking for some serious social commentary, watch the higher budgeted but just as entertaining `Dawn of the Dead' and `Day of the Dead', which drags at the beginning but concludes with a slam bang finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romero's Revenge!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that associate John Russo has had his chance to present NOTLD in the form he feels it should be in, we can see who the real creative talent behind the original film all along - George Romero! Russo's insertion of new footage has none of the visual style and editing sense of Romero's, and stands out in a most obvious manner, like scenes from the cheapest direct-to-video production. The re-scoring completely negates the 40s horror film feel the movie has always enjoyed, again making it seem like the recent DTV release that it's become. And the re-editing of both scenes and audio is jarring and sloppy. Plus which, the DVD's sound is occasionally out of sinc! The added plot point concerning the preacher who survives getting bit was an interesting idea, if badly presented. And the new stereo sound effects are effective here and there. However, the notion that this version may one day replace the original in the view of the general public is by far the scariest thing about this release. I doubt it will, but look at what happened to Star Wars.</fullReview>

Simple story of a group of people who are abandoned and isolated in a farmhouse and must fight off a pending group of zombies. The whole script and acting is very believable and well done. The opening of the film is just incredible and sets up the rest of the film wonderfully. But because the cinematography was so poor the movie hasn't dated well, but nonetheless a must see classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Scares Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has already been said about this film and its plot and importance to the horror genre. Most of it is true. But the thing to me which stands head and shoulders above the rest is that this film STILL is scary. Everytime I see it sends the proverbial chills up my spine. The cast is very good for a film of this kind. The script is good, and the claustrophobic setting is as important as any character. The ending is wonderful in its own way too...the epitome of irony. The black and white, grainy cinematography is also essential to the atmosphere of doom, futility, and death which pervades the film. Whether some like to admit it or not, this film is a classic. It has stood the test of time, it has spawned numerous...and I mean numerous imitations, and it is as powerful today as it was thirty two years ago. George Romero does a well-crafted job bringing something to the screeen which had never been on it before...and has never been on it since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror Film Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was interesting to view in 2000 for the first time, the George A. Romero 1968 original black and white, "Night of the Living Dead." While not being a horror film fan per se, I was nonetheless impressed with the wide spectrum of quality footage in the production. It ranged from awkward and mediocre to outstanding and brilliant. These varied bits could appear in a single scene, without warning. Further, the plot's devices could not all be held up to close scrutiny.Responses to this film will no doubt vary as widely, depending on how the proceedings "grab" one. I can see New York Times critic Bosley Crowther's original points, being mostly "turned off" by the often amateurish "ring" to the presentation. Coming at a time when it did, who could have forseen this becoming a "landmark, seminal" production, "re-defining" the horror genre, and becoming a revered "cult classic" lasting into the 21st century?Yet for "Night" to claim these things, it has to really have something going for it, and it does: some creepy effects, genuine jolts, suspenseful moments, and horror shocks. The leading actor, the late Duane Jones, had some talent, good looks, and a fairly natural way with lines. Since he's on-screen most of the time, it's up to him to provide stabiliy to the proceedings. Although he seems to lack a little acting experience (as does the rest of the cast) what he does do is to provide the "glue" to Romero's uneven structure, anchoring it pretty solidly.A genuine plus for the film is an excellent sound track, brilliantly conceived and executed: a superior blend of human, instrumental, and natural sound effects -- wrapped together with a fine score. Much of the editing is likewise on a high level, and the photography, while reportedly grainy in some prints, also has the reputation for high-tech fidelity in remastered versions.The film's conclusion is history-making for the genre in particular and drama in general. Romero seems to be making more of a significant statement than might meet readily the eye. It's a work which can be deciphered many different ways, and its stark black and white photograhy assist in making this portrait a tabula rasa to which one can bring one's own horrific interpretation.Anyone for a stroll in the cemetary?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely NOWHERE NEAR the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is John Russo's problem? Why would you take a great classic, and turn it into a joke. The film didn't need new scenes, the mystery of the characters is what made the original so awesome. This isn't a total waste of time, as some reviews would say, it's at least watchable, and sometimes interesting, but they should have left well enough alone. I prefer my cheap, EP recorded, $3.00 version released by Madacy (and I positively HATE Madacy for what they did to "Metropolis")to this because it's original. Yea, if you're a fan of the film, you should probably check it out just to see what it's like, but the original will ALWAYS be superior. It still has the great zombie scenes, but the original score is gone, and they took out the wonderful original beginning. Why would they do that?! Despite that, I don't totally hate this film as others, and I don't think it should be disliked as much as it is, but they could have done a better job, or even better, left it alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead is a masterpiece.Building on the psychoanalytic aspects of the contemporary (i.e. postmodern) horror genre, it seems the movie has been cued in some places directly from Psycho. Certainly, the notion of the threat against society coming from within a community rather than from outside is something Hitchcock helped pioneer.I think the reason I feel this movie is so good is because it's dated yet still manages to scare you. I figure any movie that has had as much impact as this one, any film that has been so crucial do the development of a genre, yet remains scary and effective after 30 years deserves some credit.When I first saw the 'Dead' trilogy I thought they were just graphic horror movies. Since then, I have delved into film theory and genre criticism and discovered layer upon layer of self-reflexivity and meaning. Often I think films just possess these characteristics due to social influences, but in the case of the 'Dead' trilogy it seems Romero was deliberately playing on the fears and concerns of a nation - the US.</fullReview>

Can we do one or the other guys?And how many times do we need to talk about Beakman's Diner. The two guys burying Bill Hinzman (the cemetery zombie) talk about how they're going to go eat there that night (thus leaving the truck Ben finds) but after a corpse wakes up, do you still keep your dinner plans??? Apparently so.What a waste of time. It's a good thing though the soundtrack of the new footage is not in sync so I can return this piece of trash and buy the original THX version that came out a couple years ago.Debbie Rochon is a whore!</fullReview>

DO NOT PURCHASE if you care anything about preserving an auteurs' vision!Russo and Streiner shoot moronic footage in 1988 and edit it into the 1968 version 'expanding' an already **finished film**! What in God's name did John A. Russo think he was going to improve upon?!! Was Russo playing God? Did he go to the George Lucas school of 'film enhancement'?? Was he taking out every writers' fantasy and overriding the vision of the director with his own??Honestly...Would DaVinci repaint the 'Mona Lisa' once he discovered a better set of oils??! Idiots!! Let this be a lesson to all budding filmmakers out there - if you care one bit about what happens to your film's 'vision' - make sure you secure proper film rights before distribution! I am disgusted and abhorred.To add 'insult to injury' these boobs had the audacity to rescore the soundtrack!!! I sat there dumbfounded at the destruction of not only a great horror classic, but my memory of the film as well!I cannot express my disappointment at the travesty of justice that has been inflicted, time and again, on this film...!

		<fullReview>Since so many people have given such wonderful reviews before me, I won't even try to write a lengthy essay on the importance of "Night of the Living Dead". In short, it saved horror from becoming a joke (it wasn't doing too well around 1967 and 1968) and redefined how zombies were viewed by the general moviegoing public. I can't think of one horror fan who has not seen this film and if you are reading this and STILL haven't seen it, go out NOW and rent it, buy it, anything. You owe it to yourself to see this!While lots of fans find Judith O'Dea's character Barbara very annoying and catatonic, she is only a realistic portrayal of how an already unstable woman would react to the crises she is put through (attacked by a stranger, witnessing her brother's murder). True, Barbara does become an unimportant character about 25 minutes into the film, but she is still a commanding presence by the sympathy she evokes from the audience. Judith O'Dea is my favorite performer out of the whole film, even though Duane Jones, Karl Hardman, and Marilyn Eastman give better than average performances. Unfortunately, out of the entire cast, only Jones moved onto other movie work. The others slipped into obscurity and have turned up at horror film conventions to sell their wares. I have personally met Bill Hinzman (the cemetery zombie), John Russo (co-writer), Karl Hardman, Marilyn Eastman, and Kyra Schon (the zombie girl) and they are all very nice, down-to-earth people overflowing with information and memories about the shoot.George Romero is still working today and is one of only a few great horror masters still making actually effective genre films (along with Wes Craven, Dario Argento, Tom Savini, and a few others). The entire film is a compelling character study, a series of shockingly graphic zombie attacks, and unparalleled terror created by an isolated, claustrophobic, documentary-like filming style that Romero would later use to his advantage in other films like "The Crazies" and "Martin" (see those, too!). Once again, if you hear anyone speaking against this movie, truth is that they weren't in the right state of mind while watching it, are closed-minded, or just expected more gore effects. Instead, an intelligent movie was set before them and they couldn't handle it. I recommend this movie more than ANY other film in the horror genre, you WILL NOT or SHOULD NOT be disappointed!</fullReview>

It's very low-budget, b/w and has no major stars. But it can grab you and hold your attention, nonetheless. Everyone has been to the type of locale used--a remote farm-house, abandoned of course, and when the crazy zombies come a pounding, you'll be rooting for the unlikely. After all, we can relate to this rural setting, even though the idea of zombies is hilarious. Very dated, poorly acted, barely a script and hardly any character development, but brilliant all the same! A classic in it's own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this supposed to be funny?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1987 the Canadian film critic John Kobal conducted a survey amongst 80 other well-regarded critics to find out the critically-accepted `100 greatest movies'. With voting ranging from 22 different countries, only five horror works made the grade. `Das Kabinett Des Dr Caligari', `The Bride of Frankenstein' and `Freaks' all reached positions ahead of this George Romero work, yet it did succeed in pipping `Psycho' to 97th place. Conversely, at date of writing it fails to make the IMDb top 250, a factor which seems to prove that the general public do sometimes know best.Knowing it has such a high critical standing is an intimidating point, making the viewer feel that they must surely be missing something, or that they cannot correctly "read" a film if they don't enjoy this one.Certainly, the direction is above standard, but slanted camera angles with no psychological merit (which notably decrease as the film goes on) do not make it "art". There are some very well-mounted scenes, and I was amazed to discover a scene where a zombie (or "Ghoul" as they're called here) walks impassively forwards while being shotgun-blasted to the form of incidental music that is almost identical to that used in the Terminator movies. Okay, that was a pop culture reference, but many more are there to be found. The influence this film has IS admirable - I estimate that if you saw a hundred movies then ten of them would have shots that unconsciously imitated ones from Night of the Living Dead.Yet while it's influential, it is also INFLUENCED. Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens, the afore-mentioned Psycho and Polanski's Repulsion are all heavily drawn upon to craft this work. And direction is the only field in which this picture can stand up. Characterisation and acting are not strong points. Keith Wayne and Russell Streiner portray the square-jawed, straight-laced "jocks" so memorably lampooned by Barry Bostwick as Brad Majors in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. In fact it was this, along with the amount of clumsy exposition and dated melodrama that convinced me that Romero was joking when he made this movie. All it needs is a laughter track to make it a class-A comedy, except it isn't that funny either.Why doesn't the forest or the house catch fire when they throw petrol bombs everywhere? Why does Duane Jones begin the film as a proactive central figure then end it as a slightly-demeaning black stereotype? How is it possible to crash your car into a tree at five miles an hour? How can you kill something that's already dead? Why do some of the flesh-eating zombies visibly hesitate before devouring the contents of a butcher's shop? These are all questions that require answers but none are forthcoming.The ending is remarkable, and memorable, and the film overall is okay, worthy of a six. But the notion of taking what is an old-fashioned, good-time flesh-eating radiated zombie flick and saying it has socio-political undercurrents just doesn't hold water. Sure, the lead is black and that's commendable in the genre, but he still hits women and shows no remorse over murder. The concept of adding a subtext that really isn't there is what causes the overpraise of many a half-baked movie. One of the hundred greatest films ever made? They were joking, weren't they?</fullReview>

Yes, some of the criticisms are valid, the low budget photography and effects, slow passages during some of the exposition, etc. Overall however, this film has earned its classic status. Particularly powerful, in light of today's Hollywood fixation on the happy ending, NOTLD's ending is extremely powerful in its sense of hopelessness and its black irony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it very interesting how you can take a film that's not only great in plot, acting, and direction, but also has a serious point and meaning and tack on a completely different meaning and confusing point. Why a religious angle? Where did this come from? Sounds to me like the producers felt they needed to address religion specifically and rather than coming up with something original, say another movie, they felt they should just take something easily marketable(I don't think any fan of the series and genre wasn't excited about new scenes) and insert their "point" there. It's hard to totally destroy this film, so I could never say it's awful, but the new ending and angle just cheapen the whole experience. So, next time I suggest just making another movie(which any Romero fan would LOVE to happen) if the producers wish to make a point instead of trying to pass it off on something already established as a great piece of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a horror classic. A little dated by today's standards, and definately not a flawless movie, but still incredibly influencial, and still very scary. I saw this movie when I was younger thinking it would be lame, like Attack of the 50 ft Woman, or movies like that. Man, was I ever dead wrong! It scared the hell out of me! It is a really dark, creepy, atmospheric piece of work. The ending is one of the most shocking ever made. It couldn't believe it when I saw it, I just sat there in shock. It is so amazing and effective, probably one of my favorite endings of all time! Don't expect any amazing special effects, you gotta realize it is extremely low budget. But it's still effective and amazing. The ending will shock you and stick with you for a long time to come. Classic horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most terrifying films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite horror film of all time, and one of my favorite movies, period. I watch it at least once or twice a year, and continue to enjoy it very much, year after year. Horror films so often disappoint me and so often fail to live up to their potential; Night of the Living Dead never does. I suppose what most makes this movie work as well as it does is the nightmarish atmosphere which George Romero and company managed to create. The tension inside the farm house feels so real that we, the viewers, are sucked right in. As the undead attacking the house multiply, and as the humans inside suffer various mishaps and are, ultimately, unable to pull together so as to survive, we come to share in their despair. As many times as I've seen this, the final scenes always manages to bring me down. And yet, the ending is so perfect, in that it brings the film's bleak tone to full circle.I was fortunate enough to have seen this great movie when it first came out, and on a drive-in movie screen, no less. If only more horror movies could accomplish half of NOTLD's effectiveness, they would be so much more worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this in the cinema a week ago having already seen Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. This probably explains why there was very little new to me in George Romero's original. I suppose, when it was released, the whole concept was pretty original and the camera style was radical but now, 30 years on, both the premise and the style have been mimicked in countless films. Just because this was the first of its kind, doesn't mean it is the best. Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead were as bad if not worse in terms of tedium but were more fun because of the gore. A film like The Evil Dead, however, is a far superior film even though it copies or parodies many ideas from Night. Romero's films are too boring - in his middle sections he relies too heavily on the script which is usually not interesting enough to keep the audience's attention.If you've not seen this film before, then it is only of real interest for its many genre-defining scenes although the ending is nice and much better than the end of the two sequels. It has to be seen, but it's not the great classic its built up to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I was truly looking forward to the new footage and musical score added to the 30th anniversary of this movie. Being a huge NOTLD fan, I was very open to liking this new version. Unfortunately John Russo has taken the brilliant original and cheapened it by adding a cheesy, overbearing musical score, and several BADLY acted additional scenes. In the lining notes, John Russo said how the edits were seamless, and that you wouldn't be able to tell which were new scenes, and which were filmed 30 years ago. This is not the case . It is noticeable that Mr. Romero's name isn't associated with the re-release. My advice to anyone wanting to see NOTLD...see the original. Don't waste your time on this version.</fullReview>

I just watched the finished product, and I must say it was shoddy to say the least.For Starters, Bill Hinzman looks nothing like he did thirty years ago, I couldnt believe how the producers on the DVD version were crowing on about how he looks exactly the same and the new footage blends seamlessly in. Mr. Hinzman looks twice the man he was in '68 and his makeup was awful. There were a few good points, the picture was excellent, the music was good, and some of the new zombie sequences were quite well done. I really thought that the new beginning and ending were really poor and did not look very authentic, the Reverend was a dreadful character and added nothing whatsoever to the story or movie. Im all for remastering classics, but cutting scenes out to be replaced with completely new ones is a absolute mistake every time.The one saving grace of this DVD was that the original, remastered version is also on the disc, and it has never looked better.

		<shortDescription>Romero's best, with the power to shock after all these years . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero made his directorial debut with this film, a low-budget B-movie that would go on to become a classic, hailed by all connaisseurs of horror. Although famous for its gore and ruthlessness, this is far more accessible than Romero's later films of the seventies such as Martin and Dawn of the Dead. That said, the rapid editing and early gore effects are combined to give a claustrophobic and unrelenting portrait of seven survivor's attempts to escape the clutches of seemingly endless crowds of the undead. Romero's greatest film (closely followed by the masterpiece Martin) and highly influencial, partlicularly amoungst cult horror, Romero's work was to influence many other horror directors including Italian directors and other cult icons such as John Carpenter. For what is essentially an independant film, the acting is not too bad and the script is superb - both believable and endlessly quotable. Scenes to look out for include a scene where a zombie is set on fire (done without protection of course), and a scene where dozens of zombie hands break through a window and grab out at our heros. Actually, the entire end sequence is utterly terrifying. For the first time, a horror movie was set in reality (relatively speaking). Utterly unrelenting and totally compelling, this cult masterpiece is an absolute must-see for all horror-buffs, even if you don't like the later work of the great Romero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor updates to a great scary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just purchased Russo's 30th anniversary Night on VHS as well as Romero's original (also on VHS). I was very impressed with Anchor Bay's remastering of the video quality on both versions. I liked the way they started showing Romero's version non-remastered, then stopped and re-started with the higher quality video for comparison. It was _well_ worth my 6.99, and I am quite impressed with the difference between it and the crappy EP-recorded tape I got about 5 years ago.Now on to Russo's "updated" pile. Although it was interesting to see that Bill Hinzman looks almost the same now as he did in '68 (he probably needs less make-up now LOL), the new introductory footage was useless, and detracted from the surprise beginning of the original Night. This is one instance where Hitchcock's definition of suspense is outweighed by the initial shock of our first encounter with one of the walking dead. The idea of a priest/minister in 1968 who looks like a 1999 gang-banger is a little too farfetched even for my overactive imagination, and Scott Licina's limited musical skills were at least better than his acting.This segues into the new musical soundtrack. I didn't think Licina's new music was horrible, but I did think that the poor engineering that was used to replace the old music helped to even further ruin what was once a wonderful, scary film. The stock music of Romero's original helped add to the eerie atmosphere, and it was obvious that the original soundtrack was not easy to change, and that the separate dialogue, effects, and music tracks of the original were not available. There are very audible level changes when the original soundtrack levels were reduced to mask the original music. You can also hear the difference in the sound effects at these same points. This is because the new audio editor (Russo himself?) could not separate the old music from the dialogue and effects.I don't think it was a waste of my time to view Mr. Russo's attempt at what he thought was making a great film even better, but I will not recommend that anyone else sit through it, especially not someone who has not seen the original masterpiece.Remember, the opinions are mine, although anyone else can see (and hear) the factual observations I have made.Dave / Splatter</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This new version of an old classic isn't horrible. It's just not that good. We are given some new scenes in the classic horror film which are directed by John Russo, a stellar screenwriter, but an only semi-competent director.The prologue is fun for fans who have already seen the original film. Establishing an origin for the cemetary zombie is really really cool. However, for new viewers of the film, it ruins the first terrifying aspect of the original film. The fact that Johnny says to Barbara "They're coming to get you, Barbara" and then the Hinzman zombie really is one of "them" is lost in this version, which is a shame. That sequence was terrifying in the original NOTLD.The new scenes at Beakman's diner are the best new sequences in the film. They fit with the original and are a fun addition. It is great to trace the path of a bunch of zombies from the diner that Ben encountered them in to the house in the woods.By far the worst and most blasphemous addition to the film is the epilogue. We are treated to a scene that is supposed to be "1 year after" NOTLD. A terrifying aspect of the original version is that the authorities do not have this horrific plague under control, and that this night we have witnessed is the first night of the end of the world. By setting this scene a year later, we feel cheated, and the entire murky resolution of the original film is cheapened and ruined. Are horror fans also to belive that Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead, which should fit in after this movie's chronology, didn't happen? I'm not ready to do that myself.As for the score, it is allright but would fit better if all of the other pieces of music were removed from the film. Having some of the library music remain in the movie is too much of a contrast with the synthesizer heavy new score.On the whole some aspects of the new movie are fun, but Russo and co. could have done better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film when I was ten-years-old and it terrified me. I had nightmares after about the world being overrun with zombies and it is still the best scary film I have seen. The beginning of this film is set out brilliantly to intimidate and startle us. The music is menacing and so stinging and striking, the black and white desolate setting of the graveyard, a sense of loneliness and helplessness as the zombies engulf the trapped people, and the impending doom for them as it becomes apparent the ghouls are extremely numerous and savage. And the bickering and distrust between the trapped people in the farmhouse. The cheap budget of the film adds brilliantly to the effect it has, and just shows how you can make a truly great scary horror film with little financing. A great original horror film that has been imitated but never surpassed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't waste your time with the 30th Anniversary version of this movie. I ordered a copy of the Limited Edition of this movie, and today I got it. It just isn't the same as the old NOTLD we all know and love.Let me list the reasons why you should avoid this like the plague:1. They have filmed about 20-25 minutes of new footage that just doesn't fit in. It adds a _little_ to the story, but mostly it just looks out of place. For instance, one scene near the end has a teenage girl zombie that has a 90's haircut! Also, they _removed_ some scenes to replace them with the new scenes!!2. The part of Reverend Hicks, played by the guy who rescored the music was just totally lame. That added absolutely _nothing_ to the film, and only made me regret buying this DVD. Also, the music this guy scored isn't all that great. It is just basic synthesizer music like you would find in any 80's movie. The original music matched the look and feel of this movie _much_ better than the new score.3. The sound in the new footage is just horrible. The audio track is about a half second off from the video track. Seems to me, that if a couple guys on a small budget in 1968 can match words to lips, then it can also be done in 1998.4. As far as I know, George Romero didn't have anything to do with this project. Maybe they should have left it for him to do.There were some good things about this version, though. Not many, but some. They elaborate on Bill Hinzman's graveyard zombie character a little more. And his real-life daughter, Heidi, is in the movie now too, playing a waitress zombie named Rosie. The DVD version has a behind-the-scenes featurette that shows Bill and his daughter without makeup. She is a cutie. :) Bill Hinzman was also the director of photography. He did a really good job. The new scenes he filmed _look_ good, although someone else screwed up on the scripting of them. Also, there is a new scene showing a car that has hit a tree, turning its occupants into more zombies. A board has gone through the windshield, hitting the driver in the head. The driver is not real, but even shown up close in the BTS featurette, it looks pretty realistic. That was definitely a good job.Final word: Thank God I have the original release of NOTLD on DVD. This 30th Anniversary version murders it. Avoid this at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombies have always have an odd effect on me. Vampires, werewolves, and Frankenstein never scared me, but there is something about zombies that always sends me cringing in fear. Maybe it's the fact that they're everywhere...where ever you turn, there they are, ready to devour you, and after they eat you alive, you get up and become one of them. And maybe it's the fact that they're so slow...vampires you never see coming. Frankenstein (in the original book) was fast and cunning. But zombies are slow, and you watch them gather around you and there's nothing you can do about it. Or maybe it's the fact that they're still decaying, even though they're after you and they look at least a little alive.Regardless, zombies always make me shudder with fear. And this is the film that started it all. This was the film that showed zombies as what they are considered now: flesh-eating and unable to be killed unless shot in the head. In the history of horror films, there were four famous and classic zombie movies: this one, it's two sequels, "Dawn of the Dead" and "Day of the Dead," and 1980's "Zombie." However, of the other two, none of them were as influential as this one. Telling the story of seven diverse people trapped in a farmhouse as the dead gather around them outside, it soon presents what the viewer already knows: they're worst enemies are each other! One is African American, and there's a racist man against him. One has been bitten by a zombie and is slowly transforming. One is a vegetable....having seen her brother attacked by a zombie and freaked out. Then there's the strong-willed mother and the two, star-crossed lovers. All in all, they're a motely group, and each of them stand for something different in this film, whether it be ignorance, innocence, heroism, or immense evil.This film was ahead of its time, both socially and gore-wise. It lauched the popularity of B-movies...never has a low-budget film so successful. A strange, cult-gathering has arisen from this film, but that's hardly surprising. It is a classic, and maybe the greatest horror film of all time. With its nasty zombie makeup, the who-will-survive plot, and an especially twisted ending, it is not to be missed. Without a doubt, it is one of George Romero's finest!There was a remake in 1990 with a little more ideas introduced and a stronger cast (though the cast here is still good), though it wasn't nearly as good, which is odd because of its large budget and gross-out effects. Low budget and cheap just sometimes works better for certain films...giving it an especially creepy atmosphere (just another thing this film proved that later films tried to mimic).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started something big, something REALLY big. Countless movies have been inspired by this film, as well as sequels from the original director. Flesh-eating zombies, hungry for the living. What a concept! In the 1960's, there wasn't much explicit content in films. Leave it to Psycho (suspense), Night of the Living Dead (gore), The Wild Bunch (violence), and Carnival of Souls (terror) to get the "Horror Machine" rolling. Make sure to check out Dawn of the Dead, Romero's alliance with Italian horror maestro Dario Argento, to create a sequel that has become one of the most celebrated zombie/horror movies ever made. A remake of Night of the Living Dead was done in 1990, and it celebrates the original with color and much more gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead is a horror/gore classic. The pacing and storyline have been used and reused in many horror movies since then. Night of the Living Dead paved the way for horror cinema as we know and love it. The gore effects and "jump scares" are amazing considering the movie was shot on a low budget.Not only was Night of the Living Dead a great horror movie, it's also a great drama movie. Characters are thrust into a terrible situation and must deal with it and each other. It's interesting to see what happens to people forced into close contact with each other and into stressful situations involving shotguns.In short, Night of the Living Dead is a classic movie in American History, one of the best. Rent it. Watch it with a bunch of friends. Turn out the lights, and prepare for a great time.</fullReview>

George Romero is a stunning director and in my opinion is one of the greatest scripts ever written.

We're B-movie enthusiasts and Dan said this one would be hilarious to rip apart. It was. People forgot their lines. One "expert" on the zombies actually says, "...take them outside and, and, and burn them." I love it! And how about the domestic violence! Ben is such a bad@$$, it's unbelievable! And why is the lady in the house dead? Does that actually have any significance or was it just in there for the sake of it? And why didn't she come back to life? She couldn't have been dead for very long. I don't see how this movie could be scary even watching it alone. I was more frightened by "The Evil Dead" than this schlock. Hehehe. What a great time, though. Rachel kept trying to find some coherence. She got very frustrated. Oh, and the people who made the movie even had a "Continuity" person. What a lousy job they did! This movie is a classic if only for its sheer inanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't know what was Romero's original idea when he started shooting "Night of the Living Dead", but one thing is for sure: the film came out to be more than a horror classic. The more the story develops the better it gets. Each new ingredient is great: people coming out of the cellar, terrifying TV news and the constant fights between Ben and Cooper. Cannibalism, daughter killing mother, betrayal...those unfortunate souls go deep down in miserable decay. When the film finishes (and what a final sequence!), it's impossible not to think about all the metaphors. Men acting in a more disgusting way than zombies - that is! And the racism thing is such a small detail in the plot that not many will be able to understand it. An absolutely must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without Night of the Living Dead, there wouldn't be any Walking Dead or any of the modern history 'walking contradictions Zombies' movies. Before this movie, zombies were mindless human beings control by voodoo witches or doctors. Surprising there is no zombies is this film, at less not call 'zombies'. They are call 'Ghouls' here. George Romero wasn't really trying to make a zombie movie at all. At first, Romero was making a teenage alien movie comedy. After failing at that idea, the straight angle is that Romero didn't made the zombie movie. He mold it, drawing inspiration from Richard Matheson's I am Legend, a horror/science fiction novel about a vampire-like creature plague that ravages the world and really much rip it off. Night of Anubis and Night of the Flesh Eaters later becomes Night of the Living Dead- the modern day gore full horror. I would rather see a horror movie that could actually scare me to just one with a bunch of gruesome scenes turned into a movie. While this movie has some pretty ugly gore scenes, the story plot is very interesting. Since the movie is in the public domain, there is many versions of the film such as colorization version. The colorization version is alright, but seeing green zombies just reminds me of Frankenstein. I would rather have the grey zombies in the color version. The original copies are the black and white low budget film that tells the story of survivors of the zombie apocalypse whom trapped in a rural farmhouse being attacked by unnamed living dead creatures. Night of the Living Dead takes place in real time (there are no forward jumps or flashbacks), bringing us an hour and a half of a group of people defending themselves from murderous zombies. This temporal continuity is quite unusual in contemporary film. The first survivor is Barbara (Judith O'Dea), a main character whom trauma makes her useless. She is over-acting. Act naturally, Judith. It's interesting how women are portrayed in this film: Quiet, defenseless, reliant. Barbara while visiting somebody's tombstone with her brother Johnny was attack by the very first zombie played by Bill Heinzman. Bill Heinzman plays it off following Boris Karloff's monster in Frankenstein in the way, the creature moves. WIthout Bill Heinzman, we couldn't know how zombies can move. She is the first character to come into view, but the real hero is Ben (Duane Jones), the only survivor who has a bit of common sense and looks like he might be the only one worthy to survive. Without giving it away, the ending to the film is shocking. The movie came out the same year Martin Luther King was assassination. I really don't buy the happy accident casting for it was controversial to cast a black actor at the time. There clearly some social commentary in the film due to the dramatic shift in tone from most other horror movies at the time, the constant emphasis in the radio and TV broadcasts of just how inhuman these 'zombies' are and how people should feel no problem dealing a tremendous blow to the head, and the merry band of rednecks who are chomping at cigars and blowing the hell out of everything they encounter. It didn't help that theme of 'zombie' came from Haitian culture. For me, the creepiest, most unnerving part of the movie isn't the zombies, but rather that theremin-scored photo montage that plays over the credits. A lot of people think the movie was made due to the late 1960s critique of American capitalism with the zombies represent capitalists, and "cannibalism represents the ultimate in possessiveness, hence the logical end of human relations under capitalism". I can see the movie themes being something about the Vietnam conflict to racism in America. I just don't see that. I think of it as just a good zombie flick with no message. Yes, the movie is low budget with bits of bad editing from day to night. The zombies can be a bit silly in the modern term with over-acting. Also having intrusive soundtrack, but the movie does have some reason to be well-known. Check it out, zombies fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Romero's 1968 horror film stars Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea. It begins with a woman, Barbra (O'Dea) and her brother going to a cemetery to visit their father's grave. They become attacked by a zombie and Barbra barely gets away while her brother becomes an unfortunate victim. She seeks shelter in an abandoned farmhouse and is soon joined by a trucker, Ben (Jones) who looks for help and together they protect themselves with some other people against flesh hungry zombies. They listen to radio and TV reports learning that a radiation leak is the cause of the zombies coming to life and the only way to stop them is to destroy their brains. This classic definitely paved the way for future zombie flicks and George is the master. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A staunch reminder of Romero's genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to imagine a pre-zombie world nowadays, given that film, TV and computer games are now littered with the walking dead. The term 'zombie' had been coined many times before, possibly earlier than 1932's White Zombie, but was a label given to creatures and humans under voodoo spells in many different incarnations. In 1968, writers John Russo and George A. Romero took the term and applied it to the walking dead - brainless creatures who existed for nothing other than human flesh; a shuffling army that would stop only if their brain was destroyed, or their head removed from their body. The film was Night of the Living Dead, and although it was ridiculously criticised for its gory content (which was very extreme for its day), changed the face of horror forever, and would influence movies right up to the modern day.The now-familiar story begins with siblings Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Russell Streiner) visiting the grave of their father. With Johnny teasing Barbra about monsters and ghoulies, a man attacks Johnny, causing him to hit his head on a gravestone while Barbra flees to a nearby house. Traumatised by what she has just witnessed, Barbra is joined at the house by Ben (Duane Jones), who quickly starts boarding up the house to halt the encroaching zombies. They watch the news reports on the television about this strange attack, while married couple Harry (Karl Hardman) and Helen (Marilyn Eastman) emerge from the cellar, claiming their daughter has been attacked and is lying unconscious. With the outside fires set by Ben only delaying the zombie onslaught, they must hatch a plan to escape.It was alarming watching this film again after a number of years, after devouring many horror films in the past ten years or so. Living Dead's basic concept and plot devices have been used time and time again throughout the decades, and is a massive testament to the legacy of the film. It plays out like a guidebook on how to make a zombie film - the retreat, the do-good male lead, the annoying guy with a shirt and tie, the make-or-break run for the escape vehicle, the overwhelming final attack - are now so familiar. Yet after seeing this basic plot played out hundreds of times, Night of the Living Dead still seems fresh and ground-breaking, never coming across as clichéd or a tired idea.Of course, most horror films lack the social bite or political commentary of Romero's zombie series. While its 'sequel' Dawn of the Dead (1978) used its shopping mall setting as an attack of America's consumerist obsession, Night uses its informative news reports as a damning indictment of the U.S.A.'s gun-ho attitude and ultra-violent tendencies towards infiltration, possibly a reaction to the country's ridiculous response to the emergence of communism. And although Romero's claims that Duane Jones was cast solely on his audition, rather than the fact that he was black, the now-legendary final scenes prove to be either a massive bit of luck, or a pre-meditated stroke of genius from the writer's as a metaphor for the racial tension that was so prevalent in 1960's America.All that aside, this is simply great horror. Though (in my opinion) Romero's follow-up Dawn of the Dead is a better film, Night of the Living Dead is where it all began. It's grainy, hand-held, black-and- white cinematography not only adds a low-budget dirty quality to the film, but also proves what greatness can be done with an original idea, a lot of heart, and a heap of innovation, regardless of what your budget may be. Obviously, it's not scary anymore, and the gore levels are incredibly tame by today's standards, but the tension and claustrophobic atmosphere is still as effective as I would imagine it was back in 1968. And the final moments of pessimism that the film leaves you with does nothing but ensure the film is engraved into your memory. Romero may have lost in touch with his modern zombie films, but this is a staunch reminder of the horror auteur's genius.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely influential, genre-defining?yet still powerful horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, there were Zombie movies before 'Night of the Living Dead': a few years earlier there had been the Zombie/Vampire apocalypse movie 'The Last Man on Earth' (based on Richard Matheson's short story 'I am Legend' which also served as an influence for Romero), in the fifties there was Cold-War paranoia classic 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', back in the thirties there was the Bela Lugosi classic 'White Zombie'?even going back, arguably, to 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'. All of these movies carry certain elements present in 'Night?' but the all-out assault and apocalyptic cannibal carnage of Romero's debut feature film meant that Zombie movies were NEVER the same afterwards.In the middle of Pennsylvania, Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny, a brother and sister visit a graveyard to visit their father's grave but unbeknownst to them the dead have begun to reawaken and, stripped of the accoutrements of civilised, conscious thought, are reduced to ravenous cannibals. Barbara escapes to a house and meets Ben (Duane Jones) and together with an assorted bunch of others try to withstand both being laid siege by zombies as well as the corrosive internal power dynamics and individual survival instincts rife within the group.One of the things which contributes to the lasting power of 'Night?' is the creation of a believable atmosphere where we can feel the reeling minds of the characters swept up into an unprecedented situation, deprived of crucial information (the cause for the dead's unholy resurrection is speculated at within the film but never categorically confirmed) and thus fumbling in the dark as to the best solution. Another key factor is that, in a similar way to 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', the monsters here are not figures of folklore like the Wolfman, or Dracula?or even the similarly revenant Mummy, but instead are our friends, neighbours, and family members. Indeed, it is this nightmarish vision of a society's anger turned inward which has led some to see it as a critique of the family and the Vietnam war, in addition to the searing attack on racism we see in the shocking final sequence.Certainly these sociological dimensions add a fascinating layer of analysis to the film (something Romero would continue in the next instalment of the '?Dead' series 'Dawn of the Dead') but this should not detract from the visceral quality of the film which (despite the parodies and scores of lesser Zombie movies that followed) remains as bold and fresh today as it was when it was released on the unsuspecting public back in the day.**************************Public domain movie.

		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead was the first real horror movie I ever watched. I was about ten years old, and it scared the living crap out of me! While it doesn't give me nightmares like it used to, it is still an enjoyable and creepy film to me. After being attacked in a cemetery while visiting her father's grave, the "main girl" Barbara makes her way to a seemingly abandoned farmhouse. It is their that she meets up with six others and they battle to survive a world-wide zombie attack. There isn't much else to say about the plot. It is a 'survive the night' type of zombie film. I always wondered what I would do in the situation that they all were in. Would I do what Ben said and stay in the boarded up house, or what Mr. Cooper suggested by going down into the cellar and wait for help? Both options are set up for doom unfortunately. And that's what the entire "Dead" series meant for me. There was no hope or chance of survival. No matter how much the characters fought to stay alive, there was no chance of it.Night of the Living Dead is to this day one of the best horror movies ever made and is the first of it's kind to be made. There is one scene that stuck with me always and gave me nightmares when I was a kid. The scene where the daughter kills her mother with the gardening tool. It was done brilliantly and was probably very shocking back in 1968 when this was released. This is one movie that everyone should see at least once.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw George A. Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' when I was a kid, probably about ten or eleven years old, and I loved it. I thought it was one of the most exciting films I had ever seen, and even today I still get a thrill out of watching it. But as a child, this film had me transfixed, mesmerized, and it now lives somewhere deep in my subconscious mind.While the film might come off as dated to some viewers nowadays, there is no way anyone could not see how unparalleled this work is. Even through some corny dialogue that was most likely improvised, and a few similarly corny supporting actors, mostly everyone in the film is exceptional, and Romero's techniques are admirable in so many different ways. The tension is continuously rising throughout the entire film until the epic climax. I must say that this is probably my favorite of all of Romero's films, and while I enjoyed his 1978 version of 'Dawn Of The Dead' also, I feel that in recent times he has just gone downhill.Honestly, I feel that the black and white aspect just makes the film even better and just helps to further solidify this film as a true classic, and one of the most wholly original horror films ever made. The most perfect Halloween movie, ever.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD -----9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one will believe me when I tell them that this is the first time I saw Night Of The Living Dead. I'm in the genre from the eighties but as you might know, I'm not into 50's and 60's flicks. And this one shows me again why. I agree that it was the first flick that started it all but face it, where's the gore. zombie flicks are know for their gore and here most bites are done off-screen. The zombies itself looks really well for the time being but still it's all a lot of talking. If you look at Dawn or Day then that's something different. the red stuff flows and the gore is there. naturally it wasn't really done to show gore but look at Blood Feast. It did contain the red stuff and the gore and don't get me wrong. A good horror doesn't need blood, look at Halloween or Texas Chainsaw. No drip is included. It is one that you must have in your collection to have all the 'of the dead' titles but for me, too much talking and didn't deliver any frightening moments, maybe the zombiechild in the cellar but still...Of course it's famous as the first zombie flick were zombies really walk and don't wander around, S. William Hinzman did set a new thing towards the zombie flicks. He will always be the name as first walking zombie just for his face alone, a thing George noticed as he was in the crew and not as an actor in this flick. The rest is history. Naturally the part that the black guy survives is also not done in a racist country in the sixties. A classic.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 1/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me preface this review by mentioning that I don't consider myself a fan of the zombie genre, although I most definitely consider myself a horror expert, if you will. That being said, I was extremely impressed with what I consider THE great film about zombies, and how suspenseful and atmospheric(even in black &amp; white)it was, and no overdone blood and gore thankfully. There are quite a few goofs which are obvious(too many to name), but the feeling of dread permeates throughout this terrific horror film, and I still haven't seen another zombie film which captures the spirit of this 1968 classic. I was equally impressed with the performance of Duane Jones as Ben, a surprising black hero in a film where everyone else was white; he has a calming influence and is easily the man in charge, but not in a very arrogant manner, although I didn't like how he kills Harry, who's the father of a sick young child, and husband. Who's to say how we would react if we were in that stressful situation? Harry was also clearly a coward, but was his murder justified? It's somewhat disappointing that the late Jones seems to have downplayed his role in the film, but that doesn't take away from a strong performance. He is probably one of the main reasons that I'll watch this film in the future, and he gives a memorable performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a really big zombie movie fan and I already saw the remake of night of the living dead before I saw this film. I thought that the remake would be better but it wasn't. This film was very well done because the style and design of the film really contributed to how real it felt. Almost the entire film takes place in a farmhouse, but the use of space is magnificent. The radio and the TV were a nice use of intrinsic sounds. Additionally, they contributed to the narrative. I liked the close-ups on the faces of the zombies when they were eating flesh. The end of the movie was pretty dismal but that is what I like to see. No need for Hollywood endings when it comes to flesh eating zombies. Love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the definitive zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I make no qualms about it. Regardless of considerations of budget or effects, this is THE BEST horror movie ever made.I can't say for sure that it is the origin of the idea of a zombie apocalypse (it was released 5 years before I was born), but it is the bible of the genre for a good reason.The horror here is not in the level of gore, which is pretty ample but definitely tamed by being in black and white. Undoubtedly, Romeral was channeling his inner Sarte (i.e. hell is other people). This is as much a psychological horror movie as a zombie film, and it can serve as a basis for serious discussions about a number of social topics of serve as just great entertainment. You can also enjoy this movie on any size screen, it doesn't need to look like a movie theater to work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the three most influential horror films since 1960</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968 George Romero and a group of his friends raised $115,000 dollars and made one of the most influential horror films of it's time. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD changed how horror film were to be made for ever after. For the first time, without the help of a major motion picture studio a group of people made a horror film, and in doing so showed the rest of the world that it could be done.THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and HALLOWEEN certainly could not have been made the same way had NOTLD not been made. Much has been written about the documentary feel of the film as well as the realism of the film in particular the fact that everybody dies at the end of the film. And it is all valid. This is one creepy feeling film. This is not a feel good film. It exposes the dark side of humanity with no holds barred. There are no real heroes in this film. Harry Cooper is always sited as a class A jerk. But Ben is only a little better. The constant arguing between the two is no little contribution to the demise of the whole group. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is must viewing for any serious horror movie fan. In it one can see the influence it had (and still has) horror films to follow. Next to PSYCHO in 1960 and HALLOWEEN in 1978 it is simply the most influential horror film in the last 49 years. Not bad for $115,000.The Elite DVD and Extreme DVD are by far the best to buy. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They're slow moving. They walk like somnambulists, slow and with a hint of uncertainty--as if they are unsure who they are. They can be mistaken for normal people, it's a mistake that Barbara's brother certainly won't forget. They are dead and they are going to eat you.The zombie film, what we today think of as zombies, coalesced in this movie. All of the traits are here. The bleakness, the stark naturalism (in this movie offset by an absurd, illogical, event), the violence. One thing that Night of the Living Dead gets right is it pulls off the horror of a family disintegrating quite well. Actually thats kind of what this movie is about. It's about social disintegration in times of chaos. If the people in the house would have pulled together, then the zombies wouldn't have been as much of a problem. It's the shock of an apparently impossible act, it's the shock of your dead mother getting up to kill you, that wounds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Romero's Night of the Living Dead retains some of its classic stature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having just watched Carnival of Souls for the first time, I rewatched this one especially after finding out George A. Romero was inspired by the previous film when making this. It starts with a grown brother and sister named Johnny (Russel Streiner who also produced) and Barbra (Judith O'Dea) going to the cemetery to place a wreath on their father's grave. It's there that the first ghoul arrives to attack the sister and kill the brother. When Barbra goes to an abandoned house, Ben (Duane Jones) is the only one there since the dead previous tenant is upstairs with her face skin already eaten. It later turns out there are others emerging from the cellar. Among them are Tom (Keith Wayne), his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley who was married to Streiner at the time), Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman, the other producer who also did makeup and engineered the sound effects), and his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman who would eventually become Hardman's real life spouse). The latter couple's daughter Karen (Kyra Schon who's Hardman's actual offspring) is lying in the cellar since she got bitten by a zombie. I'll stop there and just say while this movie was not completely scary, it was effectively atmospheric and provided a great shock at the end, even more so when the stills (also provided by Hardman) were presented during the closing credits. Some of the dialogue provided by Romero and John A. Russo might have been a little too talky but they do provide enough explanation as to why things happen as they did. And you gotta dig the stock music from the TV series "The Fugitive" and an eventual "MST3K" entry called Teenagers from Outer Space. There was later a 30th Anniversary Edition with an added opening and closing scene but I don't recommend that. But I most definitely recommend this, the original Night of the Living Dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the movies that came out in 1968, this one stands out not only for its realness, but the circumstances behind the production. This small film from Pennsylvania is remembered out of bigger budgeted Hollywood fair. Put together by 4 guys who later became ten people, this movie stands as a classic testament of what happens when creative minds really come together with hard work and their limited finances. I showed this not long ago to a friend of mine from Mexico. He was familiar with all the newer zombie films, even the new and original "Dawn of the Dead." About a half-hour into "Night of the Living Dead" he said, "This one is more real than the others." And it is True! Somehow the style, cast of unknown actors, black &amp; white cinema and pieced-together score gives this film a believability that is raw and real. You can watch this and wonder if this happened somewhere. The minimal acting of some of the actors somehow does not hurt this film in the least. It almost seems as though they got the real people who went through this ordeal to play the people in the movie. Really well done considering the factors that usually work against a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1968, student director, George Romero made a film with the budget of going to the grocery store and buying bread. Low budget had a good style back then and Romero worked good with what he had.Night of the Living Dead is about survivors of a zombie epidemic trapped inside a house and fighting for their lives. The film is black and white, which gives it its creepy feel. This is probably the only horror film to ever scare me crap less.I think Romero made up one of the only good horror film sub genres. He created the zombie, being a crime-thriller lover and not a slasher fan (Scream was the only good slasher series), I enjoyed this to much surprise.This is back when horror films are good.

		<shortDescription>Only Time the Living Dead were Actually Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968 George A. Romero took the world by storm with an incredibly violent, low-budget, horror film that introduced what would grow to be the modern day interpretation of the living dead (referred to as zombies by most modern day moviegoers). These creatures are the reanimated corpses of the recently deceased, they shuffle, moan and eat the flesh of the living, and the only ways to kill them being incineration and a fatal blow to the head.How do these pitiful excuses for monsters bring in the scares within this low-budget exploitation film? I'd have to place my bet on the claustrophobic atmosphere Romero creates within the farmhouse, where ninety-five percent of the film takes place. In films such as Dawn, and Day of the Dead the characters had a lot more maneuverability. They could run, they could hide, and easily out maneuver these slow, clumsy creatures. Here, there is no room to move about, and you can feel that there truly is no way out, and no place to hide.The film starts as a brother and sister drive to apply the annual decoration to their father's grave. The two individuals are Barbra and Johnny, and as the two leave they are assaulted by a man. Barbra flees to a nearby farmhouse, and the story begins. Soon after she arrives she encounters a strong willed man by the name of Ben, who quickly establishes that Barbra is hysterical and must be taken care of. Taking responsibility for both their survival Ben soon boards up the doors and windows, preparing to sit the infestation out until help arrives.During the stay they discover some more survivors living in the house's cellar. There's the eager to help young man by the name of Tom, and his loyal girlfriend Judy, and then the paranoid Harry Cooper, his wife Helen, and their ill daughter Karen. Mister Cooper instantly protests against the command of Ben, saying that they all should retreat to the cellar, because there's only one way in and out of the cellar, as opposed to the house with its many doors and windows. Ben denies this, not wanting to be enclosed in a death trap without any means of escape if things were to go badly (which you know they will). In the end it seems only ironic as to how each character meets his or her fate.This film has rightfully earned its reputation as one of the best horror movies to date, and still beats out all of today's zombie films by a mile. Here the zombies really are scary, without resorting to being anything more than slow moving, clumsy beings (unlike the remake of Dawn of the Dead where they felt inclined to super power the creatures). Also, the setting is so normal it further increases the scare factor. How many people haven't been in houses like the one in this film? Imagine being trapped in one of these houses, surrounded by vicious flesh-eaters in the late hours of the night. This is where Night of the Living Dead succeeds where others of the genre have miserably fallen. If it wasn't for the original Night of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead (both of which have been remade with a less positive response from critics and audiences alike) zombies would be some of the worst movie monsters ever conceived. This film innovated and created the concept of the living dead which have been embraced by mainstream audiences, and it is fitting that it is perhaps the ONLY film involving the creatures that has legitimately frightened me. Maybe it was watching it at night with the lights turned off, but I can say that few films have actually scared me when I watched it. With this film I was constantly holding my breath, and looking about the room nervously.The reason I was frightened (and surprised) by this film was due to its incredibly fast pacing, which is very similar to the way films are made today. This film just never has its dull moments (not to say I like all action, I was just surprised how quick it was). The plot is extraordinarily simple, and could have easily been covered in thirty minutes, but Romero was careful to grab the audience in the first attack scene, and keep their attention through means of suspense and violence.Now that brings us to the violence, and there is nothing that the undead are more associated with then excessive amounts of blood and gore. For the 1960s this film is incredibly violent, especially when it shows the undead feeding on the flesh of their victims. Being low-budget the victims are not seen being torn apart like they are in the sequels, but you still are given some disgusting shots of flesh from the bones, or fighting over intestines, which in some perverse way reminded me of people fighting over a chicken wing at a local KFC buffet. The images are just truly grotesque, maybe not to the avid, modern day gore lover, but to the common moviegoer it still holds up as being disturbing.This is the best film of the living dead sub-genre, followed closely by its sequel, Dawn of the Dead, and certainly holds up in all regards to the modern, brainless horror film. The film goes out to scare, and manages to pull it off, even to this day. With their decline as an actual icon of terror, at least we can still return to the gut wrenching human struggle, and terror of George A. Romero's definitive horror picture.5/5 stars; a classic that has endured the test of time with more strength, emotionally, and in the form of pure terror, than many films of the same era which possessed a larger budgets, certainly being on par with some of Hitchcock's greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The gruesome granddaddy of all films living dead, the original "Night of the Living Dead" still devours its successors. With this one, George A. Romero produced the horror equivalent of "Citizen Kane". His black and white photography, and direction, is outstanding. And, Mr. Romero's excesses are in check; every indulgence seen on screen gratifyingly fits the mood of the film. Karl Hardman, John Russo, and Russ Streiner are certainly most valuable players. The "non-acting" approach of heroic Duane Jones (as Ben) and the cast is effective, and refreshing. Influential and inspirational, the film's "anti-Hollywood" and/or "low budget" flaws have been rendered irrelevant. A startling masterpiece of light, shadow, and sheer will.********** Night of the Living Dead (10/1/68) George A. Romero ~ Duane Jones, Judith O'Dea, Karl Hardman, Russell Streiner</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say this was a great film. I was reminded of Texas Chainsaw Massacre when watching this - certainly it's gruesome, dated and a landmark horror film, but no more. The dialogue isn't gripping, the acting is no better than the zombies, and the plot is somewhat predictable, admittedly with the advantage of having seen films that are descendants of this one.But even so, the best part of this film is still the plot - the concept of a group of survivors fighting off an evil menace surrounding them. However that is better done in Aliens, Predator, or The Thing. In terms of zombie films, Dawn of the Dead and Braindead are much better. Maybe it's because they use satire - can you make a serious horror film where the enemy is a group of slow-moving retarded undead people? NB. One comment says there is a sense of 'impending doom' in this film - there is no such thing! Dawn of the Dead is far more bleak, yet funny too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film on T.V. when I was little Sci-Fi Channel I believe it scared me. Zombies films have always scared me since that incident in the hospital. Now I am older I don't get scared anymore I grew out of it the last Horror Film that really scared the hell out of me was Lucio Fulci's "The Gates Of Hell" (1980) A.K.A. City Of The Living Dead. I saw that in 2004 or 2005. Night scared me it was a great film. I still really appreciate it now even though it doesn't scare me anymore. It is one of the genre that broke the gore barrier it is pretty gory even to today's standards. I think it's good that Duane Jones was the best at the part of the character Ben originally someone else was supposed to play Ben a white guy. Can't recall his name. I heard about it on The Audio Commentary of The Millennium Edition the second Audio Commentary with Russ Streiner &amp; the rest. Duane is great in this. I just hate the ending. Why they shoot him it sucks. He should of yelled out to the Sheriff &amp; the rest of the crew &amp; they wouldn't have shot him. The movie is full of thrills &amp; keeps u in suspense from beginning to end Harry Cooper played by Karl Hardman who also had a lot to do with the making of the film. His character was an idiot he got what he deserved when Ben fights him punching him in the face. Also when he eventually shoots him. I am all the way for Ben he was the best Character in the film. Bill Hinzman was the best Zombie too. The first scene in the cemetery was actually shot last &amp; if u notice Bill's hair is long but then near the end when he gets into the house with the other zombies he has a crew cut. Something for fans to notice cool little thing. Anyway Monsterbash 2007 is coming up &amp; Chilly Billy Cardille will be there also Bill Hinzman &amp; Kyra Schon. I will be getting them to autograph my Night Of The Living Dead (1968) Millenniun Edition DVD Insert. 7 out of 10 this is a Classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I was a little boy of about 8 years old and I secretly watched this movie at my grandpa's house on video and it scared the living daylights out of me. I had only seen a couple of movies on TV and when I watched this one it really changed my life. I was in my grandparent's house and basically alone because my grandpa was asleep and my grandmother was sick in the other room and she was confined to a hospital bed.I watched the movie not holding my hands over my eyes or anything just sit there in a daze thinking how I couldn't move. I was afraid these dead people would be outside the walls and perhaps if they didn't hear me they couldn't bother me. It was scary as hell.Now I am a grown man and I am a horror freak with a collection of movies that hit just a tad over the 5500 mark and about 3000 of those are horrors, if not more. I absolutely love horror and I prefer the slashers from the 80's but I like all types I have watched the silents all the way to the universal monsters of the 30s and 40s all the way through to the sci-fi fifties and the hammer 60's and they all hold dear places in my heart but I will have to say that to me George Romero took a bit from the classics and held true to the suspense but he did one thing that all those other movies couldn't ? he straight up scared us.Many of the older films were creepy and scary in there own way, but N.O.T.L.D. was the first one that wanted to flat out show us something scary and scare us and not just leave us to use our imagination, but show us what these monsters will do to us. The creepy soundtrack, the great actors and blood guts and WOW!! Almost 40 years old and still stands alone as being perfect and just as scary today as it was then. It's spawned many sequels, a remake and a zillion copies and still nothing compares to it. I think real horror was born with this movie and I don't know how any one could not love this movie. If you get a chance watch it, watch the sequels, the remake and you will see a bunch of great movies? watch this in its original black and white presentation. The colorized version takes so much away and also the 30th anniversary version with the extra scenes should be avoided if you are watching it for the first time. If you have watched it about 50 times like I have then the extra scenes are cool to see.10 out of 10 stars?</fullReview>

Without him there would be no Resident Evil or any other knockoff. He is the man and this is the proof. The newsreel feel is impactive and makes you feel like your there. Wow, how fun would that be to really be fighting Zombies and killing neighborers that you hate. There's a project for you George Bush. This film is awesome because it has a black lead and is one of the first major films to do so and I feel that is highly over looked that it did so. Most people just want to put this off as some sick sixties movie but what it really is, is the dawn of cinema. This movie pulled us out of the night that was girls in despair and guys who owned castles. This film along with Easy Rider showed us that the every man had a story to tell. Even as morbid as this tell is it is still about social class and how the sixties population saw them selves. Romero showed us that blacks were intelligent and could control a situation and that white was not always right (Mr. Cooper are you listening?) This film did take us out of the night and into the dawn of reform.</fullReview>

From the creepy, dark movements of the "undead" to the chilling newscasts being played over the TV in the background of much of the film, Romero sets scenery that completely sells the audience on what they are watching.For it's time, The Night of the Living Dead" was walking on new ground and many films would claim it to be one of their inspirations.

		<fullReview>In the mid 1960s, a young man by the name of George A. Romero opened up his own small company dedicated to making commercials for local businesses. As the years passed, and Romero continued to make these little commercials, he gained a crew and a small load of filming equipment. In 1967, he and his crew decided to get together a small amount of money to make a low budget film so that they could all get their feet in the door of the movie industry. What they ended up making would forever be the best zombie movie of all time: Night Of The Living Dead.Night Of The Living Dead begins with a young woman named Barbara, and her brother Johnny. The two of them are going to visit their father's tombstone in a town that is fairly far away from the town that the live in. When they get to the graveyard, Johnny is viciously attacked by a flesh-eating zombie. Barbara, scared for her life, runs deep into the woods until she finds a big house, only to discover that there are more of these zombies walking around in the area. Barbara runs into the house, where she discovers Ben, Harry, Helen, Tom, Judy, and a little girl named Karen who has been bitten by a zombie and is on the verge of death. Now, it is a battle between the dead and the living as these poor souls try to figure a way to get out of the house and into a safer town where they can get help for the little girl.This is the movie that revolutionized the zombie sub-genre. Before Night Of The Living Dead, most zombie movies had to do with voo doo magic. After this, zombies were forever known as flesh eaters that had risen from the dead. Because of this one movie, the rules of the living dead were changed forever.It is hard for the new generation to feel a love for Night Of The Living Dead, because it is harder for the younger people to see what really makes this movie great. It is one of the only flesh eater movies that does not depend on extreme blood and gore to make it a better film. Rather then using things like splatter effects and extreme action sequences, Night Of The Living Dead manages to be scary because of the frightening music, dark lighting, and an awesome group of actors that manage to pull off the performances of the frightened people that are living in a world that is being taken over by the living dead.Night Of The Living Dead was so popular all over the world that it sparked three sequels (Dawn Of The Dead, Day Of The Dead, and Land Of The Dead) and a spin off. (Return Of The Living Dead) All of the sequels and spin offs are great, but none of them manage to surpass this film. Night Of The Living Dead is a true classic, and a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One That Started It All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero's original horror hit that became a cult favorite and continues to impress audiences today. Not only does it offer horror, but also some social satire.After an exciting (and scary) first scene, a young woman finds refuge in a farmhouse from walking corpses which eat their victims! The young woman discovers other survivors in the house, which is soon barricaded.Although the zombies aren't too scary, it's just the thought of something like that actually happening that makes it so scary. There are also a few moments which will make you cover your eyes with your hands.This was remade in 1990, with make-up effects artist Tom Savini sitting in the director's chair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the living Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie at the theater when it came out in 1968. After this show, which shook me to my very roots (I was ten years old), we walked home following the railroad tracks. A 4-mile walk, at 1130 PM and passing the classic local grave yard. Good Grief, I had no idea how two ten year boys could possibly survive the battle that was certainly coming at that grave yard. We were holding sticks to battle the dead. Dreadful (ya know, we may have been both killed that night).For the next five to six years, I would check behind doors as I entered rooms - silly, but true. Of course I had never seen a movie like this, and I don't think anybody else in the movie house had either. I enjoyed it, because it scared the hell out me and I think it may have been the best and longest lasting results for 50 cents I ever received. I was not effected by a movie in this manner again, until I saw "The Shining". Brilliant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mother of all zombie movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman named "Barbara" with her brother are visiting their dead mother at a graveyard until they are suddenly attacked by a strange pale looking man leaving her brother dead with her fleeing away from other similar looking strange slow moving flesh eating people. She hides out in a farmhouse with other human survivors such as Ben, Harry Cooper with his wife &amp; daughter, and two other people as they defend themselves and the house from the walking dead including trying to find a way out.This is a groundbreaking work of art that started it big for the zombie genre in horror movies! What started out as a Independently made movie by first time writer and director George A. Romero shot on a low budget it then transformed into a success and a masterpiece of pure annihilating terror that struck a chord with audiences everywhere. The scenes of violence, gore, ghastly images and claustrophobic themes shocked audiences when it originally came out even though it's still disturbing and scary today as it was back then.Most recommended!Followed by "Dawn of the Dead" ( 1978), "Day of the Dead" and "Land of the Dead". Unofficial prequel: "Zombi 2" ( a.k.a. Zombie Flesh Eaters, Zombie). Remade: "Night of the Living Dead ( 1990)".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was so important to the horror genre. It opened the doors in so many ways. Before The Exorcist or The Omen,before Texas chainsaw massacre or Halloween,before Friday the 13th or A nightmare on Elm street there was this film. Night of the living dead is great. The cast is enjoyable. The zombies are creepy and the farm house itself is rather spooky too. It's just all around a very creepy film. My favorite parts of the movie are the beginning with Barbara and her annoying brother then later the daughter in the basement greeting her own mother as one of the walking dead. I think this the first film everyone should see when watching their very first horror film. You'll see many other ones made later in color with lots more blood and gore and special effects but you know what? Most of them won't stick with you like this film does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorized Night of the Living Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm obviously biased, the Legend Films colorized version is by far the best release of "Night Of The Living Dead". The commentary by Mike Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000 is well worth the price of the DVD but the restored black and white version and creatively colorized version (both on the same disk) makes this a must have release. The special Mike Nelson autographed version is available while supplies last but the special version can only be ordered on the Legend Films web site.Rosemary Horvath, Creative Director of Legend Films and Barry Sandrew, President of Legend Films were the color designers of the film. The attempt was to create an uneasy feel to the overall film with moonlight filling most dark rooms and greenish yellow zombies. The fire scenes look photo realistic and add to the film's tension.This film was originally shot in black and white for budgetary reasons and there is little in the way of cinematographic strategy that precludes a colorized version. The viewer has a choice on this Legend Films DVD release to view Night Of The Living Dead in restored black and white or in the new colorized version. The Legend Films colorization process used on this cult classic is the most sophisticated ever produced and has been used on such films as Scorcese's "The Aviator", Mark of Zorro, "Heidi" "Miracle on 34th Street", "Reefer Madness" "House on Haunted Hill", "Carnival of Souls" and many other classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very low budget movie this and a good one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the movie is about the psychology and drama between Cooper and Ben, which can be a bit dragging with its (mostly) stereotypical characters and its not going much anywhere, quite like the living dead which are quite literally just 'hanging there' outside. But hang on in there, it picks up! Interesting to note that this probably is the first American movie where an afroamerican is the 'hero' and takes the position of leader of the pack. He is also the driving force of the movie. Not too sympathetic, but always up and about even if a bit unstructured, he fights stubbornness and prejudice.The music gets too dramatic and typical for its time sometimes, but also it has some fine eerie moments. Also eerie is the opening sequence. There are elements of comedy apart from the at best funny dialogue, pay attention to the living dead! Recommended if you like the comedy of camp and an untypical story. It gets just about as gory as I can handle as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the one that started it all off, launching countless imitations and spawning 3 "sequels", the latest, albeit, coming over 35 years after this, the classic 'Night of the Living Dead'.Seven people, mostly strangers, are trapped in a remote farmhouse when the bodies of the recently deceased return to life with one intent - to eat human flesh. As the number of 'ghouls' grow and more of them appear around the house, the inhabitants decide something must be done to move their number to a safer location in the next town. This, of course, is where the trouble really starts.This low-budget horror/thriller is a fine example of how believable characters and buckets of suspense are much more effective than believable special effects and buckets of gore. A true landmark in horror film-making, many times emulated but rarely equalled, 'Night of the Living Dead' stands the test of time perfectly, remaining scarier and more chilling than most of whats on offer these days. Essential viewing for any movie fan, which handily doubles as a top notch training video for when the zombies do actually arrive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning of all modern horror films, and along with Psycho the most influential horror movie ever. Although it draws on many of the early monster movies of the 30's, with a seemingly unstoppable beast tracking down prey, and enhancing the atmosphere of those films for the new wave audience. However, aside from that NNOTLD is a breed apart from anything else at the time. Tonnes of gore, shocks the cinema goer had never experienced, unexpected twists and turns, downbeat, scary, with unusual protagonists and new ways of story telling, the world didn't know what had hit them.It was the late sixties. Veitnam was proving that America was not all-powerful, and asking questions about who were the good guys, about motivation, about the human race as a whole. Anti-war protesters were being beaten and gassed for what they believed, while America was attempting to destroy another place...for what they believed. Hippies were spreading a message of love, new ideas were flourishing in all areas, from making peace to making war, and technology was becoming more important and influential. The result was that the good guys were often over-looked, good deeds were mostly forgotten, and many lives were thrown away aimlessly and without purpose. Those who survived wondered why, and had no clue why they were here. It seemed outside, bigger forces were at play, and that unseen beings were controlling the public. NOTLD was released.A brother and sister are travelling to their parents' graves in the countryside, a trip that has become an annoyance rather than a mark of respect. Johnny, the man taunts his sister Barbara like he used to as a kid, scaring her, saying the infamous line 'they're coming to get you Barbara'. A man walks towards them and suddenly attacks without warning. Johnny is killed and Barbara flees to a nearby farmhouse. She enters a near comatose state. Another man arrives, Ben and begins to board up the doors and windows, telling Barbara that he too was attacked by a number of people, and witnessed a town coming under siege. The attackers seem to have no regard for their own safety, and feel no pain. Soon people who had been hiding in the basement appear, and together the group try to figure out what to do. The TV says the attackers can be killed by a heavy blow to the head, and seem to be scared of fire. It seems that, inexplicably the dead are coming back to life and eating the flesh of the living, who in turn become zombies. The group argue over the best solution, tensions arise, and all the while, the number of zombies outside grows, waiting.The film has great depth and terrific acting from amateurs. No-one is safe from harm here, and it seems that the group's downfall is because they are human and cannot work as a group because personal interest and opinion always interferes. The zombies do not argue, they will happily wait for their chance and strike with stunning force, as a unit. If you take down one, there are 10 more closing in. The group could have escaped earlier, by running past the few zombies, and it seems the house becomes their coffin. If they had not fought amongst themselves they may have had a chance. But even then, where would they have gone? Ben as the main character is seen as revolutionary because he was black, but this was not in the script. Romero has since become a champion of the disenfranchised- women, children, other races. His performance is strong. Judith o' Dea as Barbara does not have much to do, but is good, and the other stand out is Karl Hardman as Cooper. He has a wife and injured daughter and feels Ben is endangering them with his schemes. Tom and Judy are a local farm couple, innocents who try to think clearly and are punished for it. Indeed it seems that when a good plan comes around, it is stopped in its tracks with devastating results. Though human error is the major mistake in a darkly ironic twist.Although it was filmed in BW, the gore is there. People are eaten and burned, flesh is chewed on the full screen, bullets are driven through chests. The shocks are genuinely shocking, and the film's atmosphere is claustrophobic and we sense the dwindling of hope. The overall tone of the film is stark, and it seems the future only holds violence. The film struggled to find distributors, and was shown in matinées to unsuspecting youngsters-we can only imagine their reactions. Truly a horror classic, and one of the most nightmarish films ever made, with a view of the world as a terrible place filled with pain and stupidity. We cannot overcome creatures which cannot think. Death is shown as a creeping inevitability, and the good guys almost always lose. 10 out 0f 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first version that I saw of this movie was the 1990 remake. I had seen a lot of horror before watching it, but I have always been a fan of the zombie. Slow, stalking, continuous danger, I love them. After I watched the remake, I just knew that I would have to watch this movie. Once again, I think the first time that I saw this movie was on USA Up All Night. I used to love that show. I like this movie just for its simplicity. People are here, they are out there, they have to get there, how do you get there? Simple, classic. The lead actress kind of gets on my nerves and I would have used her for zombie bait to escape. Pretty cool movie if you want to watch a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a true Horror classic, and one of the best Horror films ever made, and the 2nd best in the series right behind Dawn Of The Dead!. It's filled with creepy atmosphere, and all the characters were great,plus, the ending is a huge shocker!. It's extremely low budget, however, most zombie films can't come close to the greatness of this, as this is the one that started it all in my opinion!. The score is great, and this hasn't date done bit in my opinion, as it's still as scary and thrilling as ever!. It's extremely well made, and while i think the ending is a huge shocker, and still adds shock value today,however i really wanted to see Ben Stay alive.The opening is a classic, and is one of the best ever in my opinion, and it has a creepy location, plus it has a lot of scares!. This is a true horror classic, and one of the best horror films ever made, and the 2nd best in the series, right behind Dawn of The Dead!. The Dirextion is amazing!. George A. Romero does an amazing job here, with amazing shots, great use of the low budget, adding constant creepy atmosphere, and keeping the film at a fast pace!. There is some gore. We get limb gnawing, stabbings, and blood. The Acting is excellent!. Duane Jones is AMAZING here, he is extremely likable, amazing in the acting department, had some classic dialog, and i just loved him overall, his amazing performance will be remembered forever!. Judith O'Dea was good for the most part, but didn't have much to do but looked shocked, and she got on my nerves sometimes, still she got the job done. Karl Hardman is fantastic as the asshole i hated him. Marilyn Eastman does what she has to do well. Keith Wayne and Judith Ridley are both likable and did fine with what they had to do. Kyra Schon is very creepy as the daughter. Overall if you have not seen it where the hell have you been, it isn't to be missed at any cost!. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Horror Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romero's "calling card" film, Night of the Living Dead blew audiences away with its originality and suspense. Like many of his films, Romero has left his mark in making members of the audience jump out of their chair in horror. Outside of the genre, Romero has added his touch of culture and humanity in all his films. Night of the Living Dead is a classic horror movie, but on the surface, it is the story of a group of people, all from different backgrounds (race, creed, class) and are put into a situation where they need to work together in order to live. For 1968, having a "Black" lead was beyond popular. Romero re-creates the wheel of the film industry as proves everybody wrong. The opening chase scene, to the shocking ending, Night of the Living Dead leaves you terrorized. There is no courageous endings with the Hero beating the Monster. For an early science fiction / horror movie, Romero makes his story as real as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the classic film that reshaped the horror genre as we know it. Certainly its hard to see that now since it has been ripped off and spoofed so many times. Still despite its age and all the rip offs, it has lost none of its power. I'm sure that if one were to sit and watch this at night with the lights off there is a good chance it will frighten you into screaming more than once. As cliche as the line "They're coming to get you Barbara" is it still sends chills down your spine because you know they are indeed coming.The tales of this little film from nowhere are legendary, parents thinking it was a stupid horror film dropped there kids off for a day at the movie, only to pick them up hours later crying and babbling about the horrors they witnessed.(Who said the fake documentary feel was perfected by Blair Witch?)This is one of the great films of the cinema and should be seen by anyone who loves film, horror or otherwise. And do yourself a favor turn off all the lights and watch it late at night...</fullReview>

A milestone need not be perfect to deserve accolade. This movie certainly isn't perfect. But it is definitely a milestone worth recognition. Handheld cameras. Minimalistic sets.

It attempts to scare, but had no effect on me. However, the plot is engaging at times, the characters are well-developed and the acting is good. It's also good to watch a movie made in 1968 with a black man not only as the star, but also a hero. There weren't any stereotypes about him being black, and he was actually the smartest one of the bunch. "NOLD" is far from a disaster and far from a B-movie schlockfest, but it left no lasting effect on me. My score: 5 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Avoid this version like the Zombies within the story.This "Anniversary Edition" was put together solely as a moneymaking venture from one of the co-creators, John Russo. The creators (Russo &amp; George A. Romero) of the original 1968 version had been ripped off by distributors so often throughout the years that Russo and 2 of the original producers (Russ Streiner &amp; Karl Hardman) decided to add new scenes and a new score to the original film. The new score sounds like it was composed on a child's home synthesizer keyboard, and the new scenes are laughably bad and actually REPLACE some previous scenes from the classic 1968 film. George Romero HIMSELF walked out of the first screening of this reworking and was quoted as saying "I don't really want to comment too much on it because the people that made it are still my friends, but I can say that I definitely didn't like it." STAY AWAY and watch the original 1968 version!</fullReview>

Oh yeah, we'll also have one of these "dark theater" guys create a new score and act in it too. This is one of the worst ideas ever folks. I was not impressed at all with the incorporation of new footage that was shot over 30 years later. It was just silly, the dialogue, the acting, everything. It's just so hammy. On top of this we're supposed to pretend that old Bill Hinzman and young Bill Hinzman look alike. It's thirty freakin' years later! He doesn't look remotely as scary as he did back then. If I didn't know he was Bill Hinzman, I would have no idea. Maybe I could get over the new footage if it wasn't so pointless.

		<fullReview>I've been reading a book about the making of this film recently, and it made me fall in love with it all over. It's the original and on some level it can't be beat for its originality; it's like when the Rolling Stones first hit things off with Jumping Jack Flash and that was it fr rock and roll ? so many after would go for it, make their own greatness, but it's the first and, at its core, most elemental.George Romero and company made a film that takes the vampire myth ? the director freely admits to borrowing from the novel I Am Legend ? and changing them to flesh-eaters, as it would be something much more visceral. It's a horror film about systems breaking down really, perhaps the first of its kind to address it in a group dynamic. And it wasn't afraid to make it real by giving us real people; the actors aren't all professionals, but some had training, and Duane Jones as Ben, though not "written" for a black actor, is really the only one that could've pulled it off with such humility. We know why he's mad at the situation he's in ? we would be too.Race, class, power, and, as Romero put the whole "zombie" concept, revolution, all in a story filled with gruesome deaths, REAL scares (the opening cemetery scene is a knock-out), and it takes its time to build up to the WHAMMY moments that knock you down; by the last ten minutes, you'll hopefully, if you are locked into it, be little slabs of jelly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the best Zombie movie ever made!Romero wisely did this in black and white (he almost filmed it in color). The shadows and the texture the black and white brings sets this aside from other zombie movies. It has a low budget feel but has big budget chills. You can't help but be drawn in by this film. Right from the get go with the maniacal score and timely use of sound effects. Check out the scene where Barbara runs from the house and is blinded by the headlights of the truck. There is a great Synth sound that just hangs and reverberates until Ben slams the door and right on cue it stops and brings us into the next transition with ease. Great film with a now timeless topic and many have tried to capture the spirit of this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dead come alive to eat the flesh of the living. Seven people are trapped in a remote farmhouse trying to figure out how to get away while dealing with each other.This was once considered the goriest horror film ever made. It was (I heard) banned in several countries and had an R rating. We've gone far beyond it--it now plays on commercial TV uncut and has a PG rating. So while it's nowhere near as gory as it was once considered it still stands as a grim strong horror movie.It was made on next to no budget--and it shows in the shaky camera-work and threadbare sets. The script is just terrible. Some choice lines--"Bash them or burn them--they go up pretty easy" "They're dead--they're all screwed up". So there's a lot of unintentional humor. And Judith O'Dea's "acting" is so bad it gets laughs from audiences.The rest of the cast though is pretty good--especially Duane Jones. It was shot in black and white which actually helps--it gives the film a documentary feel. And, despite all the dumb lines, this film maintains a grim tone throughout. Also there's no happy ending or stupid love story in here.This film broke down barriers in terms of how much gore could be shown. Critics liked it and it was a big hit. Without this we never would have had films like "The Exorcist" or "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". It may not scare you but it's never dull and pulls no punches. I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most horrific movie I ever saw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie at the drive in when I was eight years old. Nearly forty years later, I am still horrified at the thought of the zombies eating the intestines. That said, I am taping it now and watching it tonight!!The thing that made it most frightening was the way the movie was shot in black and white with great effect of the shadows cast over the characters and the movement of the zombies. Also the fact that the zombies were so unstoppable led to the suspense. The victims stuck in the farmhouse with no way out and trying to keep the zombies at bay lead to many, many nightmares for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie does not keep well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie again last night with friends who had also seen it before. The plot holes are bad in this film. The social commentary is pretty weak too. And just how many recently unburied dead are there in the cities or anywhere in the US? Since only unburied recently dead were brought back to zombie status, there must have been a killing spree before the Venus probe blew up. Why do characters keep forgetting to aim for the head after hearing the news on how to kill the zombies and after their own experience? Why did it take so long for the parents to come back as zombies after they died when the report said it only takes minutes for the zombie to come back? How come the woman at the top of the stairs never came back? Why if the young couple are burned to death is their flesh and muscles, etc not cooked? Ben is shot well before he comes to window so George could have established better that the Cops knew he may not have been a zombie. Not the movie I remember, sad really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Dead: A B-movie that easily could be as good as it should been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A Romero´s script for "Night of the Living Dead" was not bad at all. But the execution? Not as good. Once again: I don't dislike colorless movies, but color has almost always something to supply. Even here. And the format? Why not widescreen?The worst thing with "Night of the Living Dead" is the terrible music. Instead of having the painful tunes from Scott Vladimir Licina Romero could have done the film without music! At times the music is so awful so you just can't concentrate on the plot."Night of the Living Dead" has most of all a good end and a good plot, but the rest of the movie's aspects isn't much talking about.It should have been a real classic, but it isn't.Rating: 6+ of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Overrated Horror Movie Ever Produced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero's Night of the Living Dead is almost universally revered by horror fans of all stripes. It is generally afforded a high ranking on any respectable list of the best horror films ever made, and some genre critics and fans rate it as the finest picture the field has ever produced.As such, it is in fact the most overrated horror film of all time.Compare Night of the Living Dead to other horror films usually cited as among the best ever - films like Psycho, Jaws, Halloween, the Karloff version of Frankenstein - and the flaws in Romero's film become painfully obvious. The acting is all over the map, production values are weak, and the script is essentially juvenilia. The only area in which the film does excel is cinematography. Romero does make creative use of the camera and the film's atmosphere is effective. But this alone can't make up for the rest of the movie's shortcomings.Nor can all of the film's weaknesses be blamed on a low budget. The story is an early tract of 60s counterculturalism, with its shadows of moral relativism and nascent political correctness. The script tries hard to rebel against stereotypes, but in fact relies heavily upon them. Essentially a morality tale without a moral, Night of the Living Dead is doomed by its soulless core. A pretentious amateur production poorly conceived and badly executed, Night of the Living Dead is anything but the classic it is supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Primitive looking horror film still shocks but is no masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was duly impressed that a film made for $114,000 could gross something like $12 million, but then--as the old saying goes--never underestimate the bad taste of the public. And that about sums up what I think of this film's impact on the horror genre.The dead come back to haunt the living. How they come back is one of those science fiction theories that lacks real plausibility but that didn't stop the screenwriter from concocting this tale of impending doom. There's a film noir quality to the low-key lighting effects as the main characters huddle inside a house that's been boarded up to prevent the carnivorous zombie-like creatures from devouring them.If you get your thrills from seeing flesh-eating zombies, this is for you. Not only is the gore rather explicit, but close-ups of hungry zombies smacking their lips over a meal is what makes this the sort of exploitation film Hitchcock tried to stay away from. He got his effects with a bit more wit and wisdom.For a low-budget thriller, the performances are about what you'd expect. DUANE JONES, as Ben, is the hero of the tale and he does give the best performance in the film, which is not saying too much. It's the script that could have used some refinement with dialog that's enough to give you a few chuckles before the tale reaches an unsatisfying and rather abrupt ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Actor's Studio Rejects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1968. While Kubrick unveiled 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, while Polanski birthed ROSEMARY'S BABY, while Franklin J. Schaffner unleashed PLANET OF THE APES, George A Romero, a director who couldn't direct, got together with a bunch of actors who couldn't act and lumbered out NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. And the world became a stupider place.Romero was the Sex Pistols of movie-making. He didn't really know any chords (self-admittedly a student, piggybacking off the techniques of his heroes), but he worked with the little talent he had to bludgeon his way into the industry.The budget is non-existent, the story is basic - dead people come to life and attack living people - the music is genuinely chilling, the camera angles creatively discomfitting, the gore is graphic, the film-making sparse, the acting non-existent. The effect: priceless.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is arguably the seed that started the moronic zombie movement in film. The zombie concept - the reanimated dead - was not new - on film, it dated back to at least FRANKENSTEIN (1931) and NOSFERATU (1922); in literature, popularized by the world's most famous zombie, Jesus Christ.Romero was the Eddie Van Halen of zombiedom - he didn't invent fingertap, but everyone points to him when they think about it.Called groundbreaking (rightfully) at the time of its release, LIVING DEAD suffers credibility so many years on simply due to one thing - the community theatre performances. A film is only as good as the actors who are trying to suspend our disbelief on the screen. If the actors are not in the moment, neither are we.So don't revile me for comparing this budgetless B-Lister with the A-List movies above. That is the main excuse for bad movies of this ilk - the cry goes up: "You have to take it in context! You have to compare it to films of its time!" Well, I just did and, budgetary considerations aside, in 1968 there was still such a thing as Actors. But NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD had none.And don't read too much into the politics of Duane Jones, an African-American, in the lead role. By Romero's own admission, he was simply the best actor in the group (which says very little, believe me). He relates the anecdote of having the film "in the can" in the trunk of his car and hearing the news of Martin Luther King's assassination. Suddenly, Duane Jones was a symbol of righteous blackness.As Ben, Duane Jones leads a motley group of "indicating" actors boarded up in a farmhouse, to escape zombies on the prowl outside. An allusion to radiation is made as the cause of the zombie epidemic. (Radiation: the universal contaminant! Only one million 1950's sci-fi films use it!) One by one, all Ben's compatriots are killed or eaten by zombies.Final scenes show white doughy guys scouring the countryside indiscriminately killing people who look like they're milling aimlessly. You wouldn't want these guys patrolling your local mall. Neither would you want to look dazed, having just escaped a zombie - doesn't sit with white doughy guy protocol of "shoot first, don't ask any questions." Which happens to be George A. Romero's film-making protocol.--Reivew by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been waiting a bit too much for NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. All the time, I've wondered and thought how it would be, what was going to happen. No real expectations, but I still was a bit over-excited when I started the movie.The opening scene was great! I was just waiting for a zombie to pop up, but it came in one hell of another way! The rest of the movie is, I'm afraid, decent. It's not a horror-masterpiece. Sure, it's an important film to the genre, and it's also very cult concidering Romero's popular sequels DAWN OF THE DEAD and DAY OF THE DEAD. My rating would be a lot higher if it wasn't for the script. The dialogues are toasted. The acting is ok, and almost every character is disturbing. The only thing George counts on as entertainment, is zombies. But since the zombies looks more like ordernal people (and moves like one), it doesn't get much more than a decent film. And the ending is maybe one of the most stupid endings in a movie ever. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie worth seeing, but not the classic it's made out to be. Apart from the first and last ten minutes, it's absolutely boring. To kick things off, you have that brilliant hurry-up-and-start-the-car scene that's appeared in practically every horror movie since. To end things you have the mother/daughter death by (well, I won't say) scene, and the cruel, cruel ending. But for an hour between it's just a lot of people standing in a house arguing about what they're going to do when the zombies come in. Which would be fine if there was any suspense or urgency about it, but the zombies seem to make absolutely no attempt to enter the house anyway. Until they sense that it's nearly the end of the movie or something. The 'space radiation' explanation sucks somewhat too. It's a bad idea to make the explanation more ludicrous than the thing it's meant to explain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It might seem a bit unfair that I already knew what was going to happen in the movie. In movies like this, it shows what would really happen. It picks one group out of the whole. This is a rare thing-a movie truly deserving respect. For some strange reason, I found the movie really, really, weirdly disturbing. The films today, looking to exploit youthful audiences, are far more violent than this film. But for some reason, I found it even scarier than those movies. Maybe it's the black-and-white. Or the indiscriminatingly violent deaths. Or maybe seeing burned corpses picked apart and eaten just really turns my stomach...Yep, I'm pretty sure it's answer C. Though you might not realize it while you're watching, 'Night of the Living Dead' is truly frightening. Though it was made on a low-budget with unknowns, it has some terrific acting and directing. I don't think I'll watch it again. I found it fantastically well-made, but not "enjoyable" in the sense of the word. Though it was made in 1968, it's guaranteed to create nausea in everyone.9 charred corpses out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low budget horror really doesn't get any better than this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how one low-budget flick influenced and redefined an entire genre.Before "Night of the Living Dead", zombie movies were mostly movies that relied on its atmosphere and not necessarily its horror or gore and were mostly set at exotic, far off, locations. Zombies weren't flesh eating monsters, they're were slaves that were controlled by a master, as showed in classic zombie movies such as "White Zombie" and "I Walked with a Zombie". George A. Romero completely threw this existing genre elements overboard and almost completely reinvented the genre. Sometimes I miss the old zombie flicks but George A. Romero introduced us to a totally new and great world of horror movies, that influenced many later movies. Copied a lot, never surpassed.Perhaps the best thing about the movie is that its low-budget but that this mostly doesn't show on screen. With creepy zombies and simple locations, George A. Romero creates a creepy, as well as realistic (and maybe because of that creepy) atmosphere. The movie could had easily gone over-the-top and became a real campy one. Considering the resources they had, they did an extremely good job with this movie. The movie is shot in atmospheric black &amp; white. Perhaps this was done to tone down the graphic moments of the movie? Or just because it was the cheapest thing to do? But whatever the reason is, it works well for the movie and its atmosphere and it reminded me of some old '30/'40's atmospheric horror classics. George A. Romero definitely knew his classics.The story is kept very simple and chooses not to really explain anything. It focuses on just a few characters and mostly chooses not to show anything else that is happening to the world at the moment. It makes you feel close to the characters and their fears. It's one of the reasons why "Night of the Living Dead" works well as a creepy horror movie, although it nowhere ever gets really scary or real tense. The movie is mostly predictable, which is also due to the formulaic, stereotypical horror-characters that we're all accustomed to but in the '60's still were quite renewing and became later genre-defining. Still the movie is a bit too amateur like for my taste at times. The directing and editing is really off at times and the acting is just plain bad. The two main character played by Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea pull off quite alright but everyone else is terribly overacting and clearly has no talent for the movie business. It was like watching an Ed Wood movie at times but luckily the moments and atmosphere of the movie compensated for this.As for the gore and graphic moments, it's was pretty shocking for '60's standards and so was the fitting ending but of course in todays perspective it's all rather toned down, also especially when you compare it to George A. Romero's later movies, such as the direct sequel "Dawn of the Dead".Not as good and entertaining as "Dawn of the Dead" but considering the resources and the enormous influence this movie had on later genre movies, this movie remains a classic horror must-see!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema of George A. Romero: The start of something big! Zombies!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead (1968) was the one that spawned several sequels (some official others not) and hundreds of knock-offs. The movie takes place in the Pittsburgh countryside. Innocently enough a brother and sister are visiting their father's grave site when they encounter a strange individual. He attacks and kills the brother whilst the sister flees the scene. She stumbles into a country farm house that will later become a house of horrors. Meanwhile a young black man seeks safety inside the house and tries to make it into a refugee from the chaos and death that's follows him. Awesome horror flick. This has to be one of my favorite horror films of all time and the best movie franchise. Often imitated but it's never quite exactly duplicated or replicated. George A. Romero and company came across something big and it changed the face of horror forever! Followed by two darker sequels and an excellent remake. Black and white hasn't felt so creepy since Nosferatu!Highly recommended! One of the essentials.Followed by: Dawn of the Dead Day of the Dead Check out Last Man on Earth, it's the original Night of the Living Dead and it's just as good. But I have to give the nod towards N.O.T.L.D. George A. Romero is the man!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Zombie Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As all serious zombie fans know, this film is the ultimate zombie movie. And while it may not have been the "first" zombie movie ever created, it set the rules and the standard for which all other zombie films are judged. Now, that is not to say that there aren't good zombie movies out there. But this is the film that essentially started the modern zombie genre. It's as simple as that. Filmed in 1968 on a budget of only $114,000 it has made over $30 million. It was also selected in 1999 to the National Film Registry. Not bad for such a low-budget movie. And because it was so low-budget, the director (George A. Romero) had to be extremely creative. So he filmed in black and white, enlisted ordinary people dressed in clothes from Goodwill and even used chocolate syrup to simulate blood. And it worked! He also used unknown actors like Duane Jones ("Ben") and Judith O'Dea ("Barbra") to play the lead roles. And they turned in the performances of their careers. Again, there are plenty of good zombie movies which have been made since this one. There are also plenty of very bad zombies movies made since this one too. But if you're looking for one that is extraordinary then you need look no further than this particular film. On that note, because of an error when they initially registered it, you can probably view it for free over the internet as it is in the public domain. Like I said, it's the best zombie movie--and probably one of the best horror films--you will ever see. So if you haven't seen it then it's worth your time to check it out. I really think you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a must-see if you are a horror fan! In my opinion, there was not a single misstep in the entire movie. The story, the acting, the pacing, and the effects are all spot-on.To me, "Night of the Living Dead" feels like an extended version of a Twilight Zone episode. It has the same black and white, long-shot cinematography, and the setting is the same conservative 50-60s America. As in "The Twilight Zone," there is an unexplained phenomenon, a small group of people who react to it, and a twist/shocking ending. I am actually surprised that Rod Serling had nothing to do with it.George Romero did his best work here. Although I am a fan of the whole series, I personally believe that the quality of his films has gradually gone down. Every film of the Dead series is fun in its own way, but each one is a little inferior to the one that preceded it."Night of the Living Dead" is a breakthrough, standard-setting film. It is best watched late at night with the lights turned down low. You will not be disappointed, unless you are one of those CGI-spoiled, every-scene-has-to-be-constant-frenetic-action kind of persons. Don't get me wrong, this film delivers the thrills, but it also has an actual story that makes you think. In other words, Michael Bay didn't direct it.Romero intends for his films not only to entertain, but also to cause us to think more deeply about the world we live in and the human kind that inhabits it.</fullReview>

(it didn't help that my older brother told me it was based on a true story)Outside of that, I think one of the reasons it holds up so well is that the filming approach is almost documentary in its style, so that even though the premise seems ridiculous, you still get the uneasy feeling that for the characters, this night of horror is very, very real. One other observation that probably is not very original is that the conflicts between the characters in the house ratchets up the tension; it's not just the monsters outside that will get them- they might very well end up destroying each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Horror films of all time. A Landmark Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead is one of the greatest horror films of all time that along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho gave birth to the modern Horror film. Made on a shoe string budget(114,000$),NOTLD is one of the most terrifying and scariest horror films ever made and set the standard for other zombie films that followed. It's not only one of my favorite horror films it's one of my favorite films period.Night Of the Living Dead tells the story of sister and brother Barbara(Judith O'Dea)and Johnny(Russell Streineryard) who arrive at a grave yard to visit their father's grave. While there, Barbara is attacked by a man and when Johnny tries to save Barbara Johnny is killed by the attacker.It turns out the attacker isn't a human,but a zombie back from the dead. Scared and frightened, Barbara runs off,but stops and runs into a farmhouse where other people including a man named Ben(Duane Jones) have occupied the house. Now, Ben,Barbara,and the other survivors must find a way to fend off the zombies and survive the Night of the Living Dead.Night of the Living Dead is not only a great horror film,but, a great film that came out at the right place at the right time in 1968. Violence was in the air and NOTLD portrays that well on the screen with a bleak outlook. In 1968 the Vietnam war was happening and was splitting America apart,racial violence and tensions were at an all-time high,and Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were both assassinated. NOTLD while a horror film was also statement about what was going on at the time in America,showing us the viewers that America was at war with no only the rest of the world,but themselves as well. One of the other things I love about NOTLD is the bleakness and hopelessness of the film where you feel that no character in the film is safe no matter what whether your a hero or villain. It doesn't matter who you are or where you are a zombie will come and kill you and eat you and it's a disturbing concept. The shy's away from film clichés and offers no salvation or safety or hope. I also love the fact that the film was shot in black and white and shot almost like a documentary adding to the film's dark and gritty tone. The scary documentary feel of the film gives you the feeling of realism where it feels like your in the film with the characters and going through what they're going through and you can relate to the characters and their bad situation. The characters aren't Horror film stereotypes,but real people that are not one note and when things start to go hell you feel bad for them. This film was at the forefront of cynical 70s Horror cinema or cinema in general that was getting away from film where characters lived happily ever after. This was a very revolutionary at the time and still is. NOTLD paved the way for low budget Horror cinema in the 70s and 80s otherwise without this film there would be no landmark Horror classics such as Halloween,The Evil Dead,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Re-Animator just to name a few and also influenced and inspired filmmakers such as John Carpenter(The Thing,Halloween),Wes Craven(A Nightmare On Elm Street,The Last House On The Left),Sam Raimi(The Evil Dead)and Tobe Hooper(The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,Poltergeist)and will continue to influence and inspire filmmakers for years and generations to come. The violence and gore in the film is disturbing and for it's time was something wasn't seen before The film and pretty along with Psycho reinvented violence in Horror film. George A. Romero would push the gore and violence even further with Dawn Of The Dead and Day Of The Dead. NOTLD is also great because of how it portrays zombies. You will be looking over your shoulder. Before NOTLD zombies in horror films were more associated with mostly voodoo and the supernatural,but in this film the zombies are regular people people that are your family members,friends or neighbors. There's nothing scarier than the people you love becoming zombies and wanting to eat you and kill you. I also loved the fact that George Romero cast an African-American in the role as the hero in the film was a bold move to do and whether the casting was intentional or not. The ending of the NOTLD is amazing and one of the most shocking and powerful endings in film history and it's a finale that adds to the greatness of NOTLD and is an ending that will stay with you after you watch the film. A brilliant conclusion. The acting and cast are great here. Duane Jones is excellent as the hero Ben one of the few African-American hero's in a horror film. Jones brings a dignity and take charge attitude to the role and it's a great performance. Judith O'Dea does a wonderful job as Barbara bringing a believable performance to the role. Karl Hardman is great as the villain Harry Cooper a character that we don't always like,but does have a couple of points about living and being safe. Marylin Eastman does a fine job as Helen Cooper,Harry's wife. Keith Wayne and Judith Ridley do good jobs as Tom and Judy the young couple. George Kosana(Sheriff McClelland),Bill 'Chilly Billy' Cardile(Field Reporter)and S. William Hinzman(Zombie In Graveyard)give good performances as well.George A. Romero's direction is excellent bringing a frightening and stark reality to the film with the tilted camera angles and black and white photography. Romero's direction gives the film an almost documentary feel to it and a gritty realism. Great job by Romero.In final word,If you love Horror films,Cult films,or films in general I highly suggest you see Night Of The Living Dead,a landmark Horror classic that will stand the test of time is a film that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror with a constant sense of dread</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the dead come back to life as zombies, perhaps because of the crash of a radioactive satellite, a group of people hole up in an empty farmhouse and try to survive.This is the basic plot for Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead, which is really the father of all modern living dead zombie movies.This movie has been considered a classic and for good reason. From the opening graveyard scene to the shocking finale, the film has a constant feeling of impending doom and a palpable ominous tone that is much more effective in creating a lasting fear than the jump scares of many modern films. The zombies are the threat, but they are just the vehicle that Romero uses for creating a continuous sense of dread. One gets the feeling that almost any other threat could have been used, because the movie really focuses on the reactions, emotions and interactions of those trapped in the farmhouse.Being a zombie movie, it of course has some gore, but the film does not rely on the gore for its effect. The gore accents the overall mood, but is not used purely for its "gross out" value.The acting in this film is decent, and portrays an apparently realistic presentation of ordinary people in an extraordinary and stressful situation. The roles of the characters are fairly clearly defined, almost archetypal, which assists in the storytelling aspect of this movie.The music is quite unobtrusive in this film, but because there is a significant amount of dialog, and a large part of the impact of the film is related to these conversations, the minimalist score is not really a hindrance.Another notable feature of this movie is the lack of focus on gore and special effects. The appearance of the zombies is somewhat shabby, but, probably because of the relatively low budget, the effects of decomposition and putrefaction are not really presented in detail. There are some scenes of gore, but they are not the movie's focus. This doesn't seem to affect the film adversely, though.The two scenes in the movie that really stand out for me are the opening scene in the cemetery and the final scene of the film. The opening scene is effective because the real action starts so quickly and unexpectedly, and pushes the film forward. The ending is just so shocking and unexpected (at least it was to me) that the viewer is left, thinking, "Wow! Did that just happen?" So Night of the Living Dead is rightly lauded as the first of the modern zombie movies. There is a lot of social commentary in it that has had much discussion elsewhere, but for me, it works because it maintains a constant sense of dread and claustrophobia, while the zombies and and an appropriate use of gore are the vehicle that provide the threat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True, when most people talk about Romero, Dawn of The Dead is generally regarded as the superior work. Some call it the best zombie movie ever made, some call it the best horror movie ever made. There is nothing wrong with that, because Dawn is indeed a great movie. But I am definitely in another club. I beg to differ. In my opinion, Night of The Living Dead is the superior movie.Above all others, of course because of its influence of basically reinventing the whole zombie sub-genre. But it is also the fact that it was made with budget so little, Hollywood producers would probably have laughed at it. But most of all, it's because the movie achieved what so many horror movie actually did: being frightening.The making of great horror does not need millions of dollars or special effects or CGI, no. The quintessence of horror is to scare you with something you cannot see or have never seen before. That was what Romero achieved with this movie. He managed to put something "unknown" to many that terrorize your mind long after you see it or after you have seen it many many times.And since everyone &amp; their mother probably know about the story of this movie, I won't even bother writing it down here. I just want to praise Romero for presenting a REAL feeling of isolation all throughout. This movie is Horror 101, a textbook of making a great horror with the effective scare (not the special effects).And among many of the zombie movies I've ever seen in my life, this one I take a great delight of watching over and over again. Never before I see a zombie movie so good, and I don't think I will ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" looks like a nightmare, feels like a nightmare, as a matter of fact, it IS a nightmare; a harrowing experience we impatiently wait for its conclusion, something that disturbingly raises itself above all the preconceived notion of cinema's horror and give the genre a whole new resonance in 1968. And George Romero, a then gifted 29-year old director, pulls the strings of our emotions with a remarkable craftsmanship, guiding us from disbelief to shock until one of the most haunting endings from any film, all genres considered.I liked "Braindead" and "28 Days Later", but as much as I 'enjoy' zombies' film, I didn't expect much when I watched "Night of the Living Dead". I respected it for it's the one that started it all but I couldn't apprehend that the film would scare me more than "Jaws" or "The Exorcist". But the more I think of it, the more I realize that this is precisely the mindset Romero expected us to have, to better catch us off guard. And in a way, the low budget quality of the film and its B-movie feel, plays a significant role by adding a level of realism in the nightmare, making it much scarier. The black and white, the relative anonymousness of the actors, the shakiness of the camera emphasize the realism of the movie as it looks like the cameramen are also trapped in that nightmare, a more sophisticated direction would have deprived the film from that crucial touch.The film borrows though some tricks from previous masterpieces of horror. Take the ghouls, the way they walk, the sounds they make, their hideous faces are already disturbing but what provokes the sheer sensation of terror is the mass effect. Imagine one ugly cockroach invading your room, you know you can handle it, but if it's an invasion, the only reasonable reaction is to escape. The film, like Hitchcock's "Birds" is driven by the same sense of urgency introduced by the first zombie coming at Barbra, the seemingly heroine of the film, and completed by the discovery of the corpse with a fleshless face in the farmhouse, one of these powerful moments that make you take the film a little more seriously. And like in "Birds", the horror is emphasized by the fact that we don't know why and how these things happen, all we have is the clues given by the national broadcast program on radio and TV, punctuating the films between so many thrilling sequences.Trapped in this claustrophobic setting, we're left with people trying to figure out what to do and where to hide? Not only the decisions must be taken quickly but the debates going over the things to do create an even more heart-pounding subplot. There are obviously two polar forces, the hero Ben and the cowardly Mr. Cooper, and while the acting is sometimes perceived as a minor force in horror film, here, the two characters approach their roles with a remarkable level of authenticity. At one point, Cooper asks with disbelief if he was supposed to get off the cave and help a woman because he heard screams, Duane Jones' reaction is perfect, he quietly replies: "yes, exactly", the film is one of there trapped-into-critical- situations that makes you forget it's about monsters but human beings trying to act for their survival. While we can't help but root for Ben, at many points, we feel like we wouldn't have been as heroic as him.And during that hellish journey, Romero's mastered directing enlighten us about the zombies in the most unsettling ways: when the teenage couple dies in an unexpected explosion, the horror of their death is not enough, we endure a gruesome aftermath where the ghouls take their bodies and start eating their flesh in an orgy of blood and human remains. The part is disgusting because we knew the victims, and taking their death for granted wasn't enough, Romero intelligently avoids the horror's tricks that tend to undermine deaths' shocking value to relief the audience and make the protagonists, witness from these deaths, their potential demise. And while panic reaches the consciences, the death's imminence highlights people's inner personalities, and the antagonism between Cooper and Ben evolves until the house gets too small for the both of them. The directing even allows some subtle moments where Ben sees Cooper hiding behind a door when he was supposed to let him enter the house, then, we understand that rooting for a character is almost pointless, as confirmed by the catatonic state of Barbra, the female lead.In the process, all the protagonists are getting killed and become ghouls themselves, contaminated by the presence of Cooper's daughter who was bitten by zombies and eventually become one, and it only takes the providential help of TV for Ben to understand how to kill the ghouls, by shooting in their heads. The morning after, an armed posse executing zombies one by one and while it could have ended as a classic B-movie, Romero's film ends as a disturbing masterpiece when Ben who survived all the nightmarish mayhem is taken for a zombie and takes a bullet between his eyes. The film ends while the credits show him disposed with the other ghouls in a bonfire ready to be set. I really didn't see that coming, and I was left speechless staring at the TV screen many minutes after the film finished. How could they have killed the hero? With the assassination of Martin Luther King, I guess it's almost impossible to overlook a social commentary aspect, but whether it was intentional or not, the ending is the strike of genius that cements the film's greatness. In a year full of heart-pounding thrillers like "Rosemary's Baby" or "Bullitt", "Night of the Living Dead" is a groundbreaking tour de force that would change the face of horror forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Definitive Film of the Horror Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A+ This film is a legend and masterpiece of cinema, especially to the horror genre. It was the 60s, the production had been dead not even a decade, and films like "Psycho" were just lying the groundwork for a new breed of horror. In 1968, here came George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead", and boy does it please.Firstly, of course, the gore is a real treat. It may be the first of its kind, but it doesn't hold back in the least. The make-up effects are very impressive and the combination of low-key lighting and the use of black-and-white cinematography create an aura of hopelessness for the film. The constant newscasts give it a very real feel to it all, almost equivalent to a documentary of sorts. And the character storyline is really quite awesome, creating splendid amounts of tension when the zombies aren't even on-screen. Duane Jones was a perfect, as well as tragic protagonist, and I really want to thank all the actor and actresses within the film. Most were at the time stage actors, and with genuine talent they helped excel this movie into film legend. One main reason in itself to adore this movie, and why I think it's an unbeatable classic, is that it represents a time when young film makers could gather together and make a suspense filled masterpiece without the limitations of large distributors trying to hinder the process to their liking. The movie builds terror thru dialogue and without sacrificing atmosphere, its greatest feat. One cannot call themselves a true horror fan if you have not witnessed this landmark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Basis for making Zombie Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first zombie movie that I saw in 1968, in a seedy movie theater ,in Manhattan. I happen to see this movie because I had nothing else to do at the time . At first I thought It was going to be boring movie because my reference to Zombie movies stems from Haitian voodoo zombies. So I thought I would just close my eyes and take a nap. Suddenly, this Black man appeared on the screen and I became interested as to what this movie was about. Well as the movie continued to run , I was fully awake when the action started .I was so engrossed in the movie that I had forgotten that it was a black and white film while I concentrated on the gore and mayhem before me. I recommend that anyone who watches Zombie movies should view this one first and then years later, review this film again to see how many Zombie movies use Night Of the Living dead as a source of reference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Classic: Night of the Living Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In June, 1968 I graduated from high school. The 1960's was already proving to be one of the most eventful decades of the century. I read a Readers Digest article warning parents not to let their young children watch "Night of the Living Dead". I agree. The movie ratings system had not been developed yet, and there was no way to warn parents about how intense this movie was. I know adults who will not watch the movie either! By todays standards, NOTLD was filmed on a shoe-string budget, but was way ahead of its time breaking all the taboos and depicting graphic violence (graphic for 1968, but not now).George Romero had a very limited budget, and some of the actors in the film also helped in the production of the movie. Karl Hardman (Harry Cooper) pieced together the music soundtrack. His wife, Marilyn Eastman (Helen Cooper) supervised makeup. She also played a dual role. That's her portraying the zombie in the ragged nightie, eating a bug on a tree, then later reaching into the burned truck where the bodies of Judy and Tom were being devoured. Keith Wayne, who played Tom died at his own hands several years later.In 1960 Alfred Hitchcock broke a few Hollywood taboos with his movie masterpiece, "Psycho". A flushing toilet never appeared on film before, let alone the heroine of the movie being stabbed to death in a shower. (They used Shasta chocolate syrup for the blood, which broke another taboo in its graphic abundance.)"Night of the Living Dead" set new standards in the horror genre. For the first time, the hero of the movie dies at the end, and he is black in an otherwise all Caucasian film. The first scene of the movie takes place in a graveyard, and the chills begin within the first ten minutes into the picture.I can't imagine anybody who enjoys horror films who has not seen this movie. It's approaching it's 50th. anniversary, has been on television for years and you can probably find a copy in the bargain bin wherever CDs and video cassettes are sold.The movie still packs a whallop, which proves you do not need gratuitous blood and guts and gore to make a movie scary. Sometimes, the most terrifying aspect of a horror film is what is implied and left to the imagination. "Night of the Living Dead", with all its "goofs", mistakes, and dated technology still rates four stars with this humble movie goer. Don't watch it alone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the living dead (1968)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having first seen this movie back about 10 years ago when I was only 11 years old, not understand why it was in black and white. I remember being very scared about it at the time. As time went on I came across the film in an DVD sale at our local market, didn't pay a lot for it which I think at the time was only ?2.99. As being a fan of zombie films I was so excited that I bought the movie and was looking forward to seeing it on that night. I remember watching it on my own with the lights watched off. An I couldn't believe how scary it was. Even though it is just over 40 years old almost. The story was simple, a few people trapped in a house while a zombie outbreak occurs. The music was slow but fitted the picture and slow suspense at that time. Not a lot of gore but for being 1968 you would expect that for a horror film. Without doubt even today with all the CGI affects and improved way of filming. Night of the living dead has to be the best if not one the best horror films ever made. So I'am giving it a rating of a nice 9/10</fullReview>

As such a boyfriend, I can honestly say I enjoyed being the protector as my woman squealed and hid her face from the screen.This movie was not only a great movie, but a great date movie. Some people today claim that the movie is dated and less than great. I strongly disagree for two reasons. The first is that -in my opinion- it was the first zombie film that was intelligent and fun to watch. The second is that the death of the hero Ben was then and is now unexpected. Heroes/heroines don't usually die then or now. Living Dead was,is and will always be a great fun movie. My one regret today is finding a girlfriend who scares easily. 10 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They may be ghouls, sharks, cannibals, but it's always about Vietnam, Vietnam...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vietnam once again. It seems that every time I see an American horror film from the 60s, 70s, it has to deal with it. And not only horror movies but also SFX. Let's see what these four titles have in common: Jaws (1975); POTA (1968); Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974); NOTLD (1968): First, they have the same basic plot: some people put themselves unwittingly in mortal danger when intruding in a foreign, hostile, environment. The are usually young, never old or very young. Also, even if they come on top at the end, the danger hasn't been totally eliminated. Fourth, the usual way of fighting the danger is through fire or by bombing. Let's see: in Jaws the hostile milieu is the sea and the enemy is a shark. At the end it is bombed out, but it reappears (Jaws II) and this time it is burned out. In POTA the parallel is even clearer: The apes are the Vietcong and future planet Earth is Vietnam. In TCM the youths come to a strange land, where they are chased around by cannibals, one of them wielding a chainsaw. What have in common a loon with a saw and a gang of zombies? They both "eat" human flesh, they mutilate human bodies, just like hand grenades and land mines do. Then we got NOTLD. Here the heroes are also in a foreign land and they barricade themselves in a house where they don't belong. They are mostly young, while the zombies come in all ages and are locals--zombies don't drive and they may find difficult to hitch rides. So, zombies are the Vietcong here and they kill and mutilate the intruders with their teeth--mortars, mines, etc. (The Exorcist is one exception to the rule but the devil there has been unwittingly invited by the girl and, more important, he isn't going after anybody but her; so the Vietnam ref. is not valid here). There are more analogies. For ex., the ghouls, the shark, the cannibals attack mostly at night, as the Vietcong did, and they fear fire?as napalm, the Vietcong. There are many more movies of urban Americans intruding in a wild, untamed, land only to be abused, tortured, killed by its inhabitants: Easy Rider (1969); Deliverance (1972), and the list goes on. Funny thing, flesh-eating monsters appeared in American movies exactly at the time when the Vietnam war was reaching its most brutal, bloody, stage: in 1968.1968 was also a crucial year for this war. The year of the Tet Offensive and of the historic Khe Sanh siege. And at a time of great political violence at home, with high profile political assassinations and student protests. It is impossible that all that couldn't have become imprinted in the works of artists as Romero, and in fact that became their primary focus, even if probably only in a subconscious level, without them even knowing it. But it's all there: the butchery, the kids dying...and the guilt of the elders. See that, while the young are usually the victims, the old are the villains, even if already dead. In NOTLD and TCM, the youths have been lured into a trap by some dead parent and later they have their blood sucked by older people--a real guy mummy in TCM--or have their flesh eaten by older zombies. Even in NOTLD the human villain is a middle age man. In Jaws he is the mayor and so it is Dr. Zeuss. That's all in the spirit of the 60s, the generational schism that made the young blame the old for everything going wrong in the world. But at the end the old were certainly guilty of at least one crime against the young: they had sent them to fight, and to die, in that war. And that's what all talented filmmakers kept saying in their films, over and over again, during the next decade.NOTLD deals not only with Vietnam?it's actually a Khe Sanh siege in miniature--but also with other topics of the day, especially race. See for ex. those meat hooks. One form of extreme punishment slave owners used, which was meant to inflict a horrific, painful death on the victim, was his hanging with these hooks inserted into his flesh, to the bone, so he could be suspended from a tree. What GR seems to be saying in those final shots is that the people killing the zombies weren't much better than their quarry; or that blacks have always been victimized by the white, one way or another, if not by cruel treatment, as slaves, then by sending them to fight in a losing war. Strong cinematographic work, considering the epoch at which the movie was made; and its budget (!). One with a very dynamic pace also, which may pleasantly surprise those who think that BW movies are too slow; never a moment of respite. The mood, claustrophobic, somber?just as must have been that of the besieged GIs, Marines, in Khe Sanh?is well conveyed by the lighting, or rather the absence of it, especially during the outside shots. The acting of the male crew is okay and my favorite there is Cooper; you'd think the actor is just being himself, so deeply he gets into the part. Concerning two of the female crew, either they have lousy scripts or they simply aren't very good. J. O'Dea overacts all the time, and she goes over the top when telling of the initial zombie grabbing her. As for J. Ridley, all I remember of her is her giggling at something, someone. The zombie girl was great, though, and her mom up to task. BTW, that sheriff would have made a perfect Col. Kilgore, had he ever had to go to Vietnam. I say, 8 on 10.PD: I can see, by some later review, that Vietnam still strikes a raw nerve for many.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remembrance when this was first show- none of the big studios wanted it so Romeo had to travel on his scooter with copies of it to local cinemas. On his first few attempts he told the owners that it was a film about zomboids munching human flysh and flesh- understandably most were horrified by this plot and spat in his face. Romeo, being an intelligent, bearded gentleman knew that he would have to lie in order for his film to be shown. He began to tell people it was about a group of dancers called the Living Dead who were from 'the streets' and had to fight prejudice and poverty just so they could dance together. A heartwarming story, it featured the tag line 'They're coming to get down, Barbara!' The main character is a shy girl who learns what it is to live, love, and dance and ends up having the time of her life, like she's never felt before. The Living Dead recruit her by repeatedly dancing on her lawn and banging on her doors and windows- she tries to keep them out, but you can't stop the groove, baby!. The beats get more intense, the clothes get more lesser, and soon she succumbs to the ancient art of waving your arms and legs about. The group scrape together enough money to enter the (arm)Pittsburgh dance contest and finally get a stage on which they can showcase their talents. After rough treatment from rich rival dance troupe, Kobra Kyle, they find a wizened old trainer called Mr Umaga. Through him getting them to paint his house, wax his carts, clean his many chimbleys etc they learn valuable life lessons which will ensure they can form important social relationships and gain self confidence when they eventually start employment. Suffice to say, the film has a wonderfully tender ending as the group, just as it looks like they have thrown away the final dance, manage to pull off the mythic 5 metre Qwop twirl dance move and get a 10 from Brucie. Paralleled with the Vietnam war which was entertaining America at the time, Romeo's impressive social commentary manages to convey the joyous spirit of the time- before there was mistrust, before there was paranoia, and when everyone loved each other regardless of the colour of their skin, or the ugly of their face.Best Scene: The naked zomboid ass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's a trademark line from this horror genre masterpiece. Can it open in any better fashion, than at a graveyard? lol. A brother and sister have driven hundreds of miles to lay flowers at their long-dead father's grave site. As brother Johnny says, "They're coming to get you, Barbara!" in his best Boris Karloff impression, a mysterious stranger limps towards them.We learn that a rogue satellite returning from a Venusian orbit knocked out radio for a while, but there are far more sinister and gruesome circumstances coming. The film quickly launches into them from Barbara's terrified, imperiled view. We learn along with her (and other survivors she encounters) the nature of the crisis. Victims are being killed and devoured by hoards of undead corpses. There's a great claustrophobic atmosphere, as the survivors hide in a farm house, fending off invaders who bash away on the house relentlessly. Director George Romero proves how much can be accomplished with a shoe string budget. His take on the re-animated dead person coming back to seek human victims idea is the inspiration for many similar films, but nobody has equaled this movie. He creates a very believable scenario for these average folks struggling for their lives against an ever-increasing army of blood-thirsty ghouls. I love how they move slowly and mindlessly, yet, with only one weakness, prove to be formidable and dangerous.A cast of mostly unknowns, but that is used as a plus; the audience can identify with these everyday people in this situation. The acting is pretty intense and believable; I was particularly impressed by the little girl zombie-fied: she was scarier than Linda Blair in Exorcist. Another strength is how the "outside world" information funneling through was so effectively done as parallel to the farm house group's story. The film is not afraid to kill off characters, some with poetic justice, others in tragic and ironic twists of fate.Brilliantly done. A movie that can be watched many times, and still be appreciated.</fullReview>

Other survivors named Ben, Harry, Helen, Tom, and Judy join her, and try to board up the house to stay safe. There is competition between Ben and Harry over who should be the leader.

		<shortDescription>The Standard By Which All Zombie Movies Must Be Measured</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in a drive-in theater the year it was first released and long before it became a well-known cult classic. As I recall, it was the third movie in a triple bill. I had no idea of what I had gotten myself into! There I was alone in my car and, ten minutes into the movie, scared sh--less! I had never seen a horror movie like this one before, and I had seen hundreds. Forty years later, "Night of the Living Dead" has not lost its power to chill.The plot by now is too familiar to need retelling. But for those who have been living on another planet, I'll briefly explain. A group of people are holed up in a farmhouse, with a growing army of the undead outside and trying to get in. Instead of joining together to fight the zombies, they fight among themselves about strategy. The obnoxious white guy wants everyone to go down into the cellar. The black guy who is the main protagonist (a rarity in those days) says that would be suicide and wants everyone to remain upstairs. "United we stand, divided we fall" as the saying goes. And partly because of the bickering, the zombies end up invading the house.Ironically, the obnoxious white guy turns out to have been right all along. Because the sole survivor, the black guy who wanted everyone to remain upstairs, ends up saving himself by locking himself in the cellar. The rescuers arrive the next day, mistake the survivor for a zombie, shoot him, and throw his body on the fire along with all the others.This is the movie that put George Romero on the map and set the standard by which all future zombie movies must be measured. Its influence on the genre cannot be overstated. Romero would go on to make a sequel, "Dawn of the Dead" that in my opinion is even better than the original, as well as several others not quite up to the caliber of the first two.This is one helluva scary movie and a must-see for any horror-movie fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Romero's original 'Night of the Living Dead' is the only movie I can recall that I've never been able to make it through to the end of. I don't know how it ends, who lives, if anyone, or if it has a 'happy' ending, ie; are the zombies dispatched back to the grave and the world made safe once again?This horror flick, and it IS truly horrifying, is the most frightening reel of celluloid ever made in my experience. I get about as far as the point where the girl and the black guy are trapped in the farm house with the zombies scratching and groaning at the doors and windows. I invariably and automatically hit 'stop' when the first one ends up IN the house with them. I just can't take it. It may have something to do with living alone and wondering what is thumping around in the dark downstairs at 3 am (it's usually the cat).I give this movie a 10 because it is the greatest of its genre, which is low-budget, acted by total amateurs from the local technical college or something and filmed in grainy black and white in absolutely real and recognizable places, like the old farm houses that dot the landscape in my neck of the woods and old cemeteries out in the middle of nowhere.It's a dreadful experience and highly recommended for those with perhaps less imagination and stronger stomachs.A crunch and chomp fest for the connoisseurs of gore amongst you.</fullReview>

It doesn't look like its been converted, like some b/w to colour movies do, poundland &amp; Woolworth's have been stocking it in the uk, try walmart for USA buyers or buy online, its good to finally see the original in colour :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Low Budget Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the film that put the zombie genre and George A. Romero on the map. It is a classic example of low budget film-making at his finest how great Romero was and is at making films.The film is set in rural Pennsylvania, and in a small house a small group of people are having to survive against the newly raised living dead. In the house is a family, with a sick child, a black man who becomes the leader, a mentally damaged woman and a young couple. As events unfold they find out through the media that the dead had risen and that only way to stop them was to shot them in the brain or cut off their head.It's a basic story but it is layered. The film has a lot of scares in it and the apocalypse story is very exciting. There is a political sub-context to the film, especially in the politics of race, because this was one of the first films to have a black man as the major hero of the film. Other intreputions of the film is the Vietnam war and the Cold War. Romero is a very political director and this was carried on into his other Living Dead films.The story behind the film is also interesting. It costed $10,000, which even in 1968 was a pitent. Romero had to use up very favour available to him to get this film made.The special effects are simply, but easily covered by the black and white film and the acting isn't great, but the people in this film were amateurs, you didn't expert Oscar winning acting. There is also a bitter ending to this film, which I thought was very fitting for this type of film.If you like horror films or zombie films then this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the True Horror Greats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night Of The Living Dead" is not only a film that all Horror fans must see, it is a must-see to anyone even remotely interested in cinema. George A. Romero's 1968 masterpiece is, without any exaggeration, one of the most important and influential films ever made as it basically recreated the Horror genre and influenced everything to come - and all that with a low budget and actors most of whom had never been in a film before. Literally every Zombie flick ever made after 1968 took its influence from "Night Of The Living Dead", and it is debatable that the world of Horror cinema will ever see classics of a comparable influence again. This immensely creepy and genuinely scary stroke of genius is one of the most brilliant masterpieces the great genre of Horror has ever brought forth, and no Horror lover or cineaste in general could possibly afford to miss it.The film delivers everything one could possibly desire in Horror: constant tantalizing suspense, genuine scares and shock moments and an incomparably creepy atmosphere which is intensified by a stunning black and white cinematography. The plot is, as one could guess, about the dead coming back to life. Dead people rise from their graves and walk the earth as living dead, hungry for the flesh and blood of the living. The reasons for their awakening are only vaguely explained, with an undefined radiation. The film ingeniously explores a small group of people who are forced to form an alliance in a small remote farmhouse, desperately trying to prevent the masses of flesh-hungry fiends from getting in. Hardly another film could claim a mood as genuinely creepy and menacing as it is the case in "Night Of The Living Dead". The masses of brainless, flesh-eating zombies looking for the living to feed on are doubtlessly one of the creepiest sights a cineaste will ever stumble upon. Arguably THE classic shocker of its time, "Night Of The Living Dead" has long become one of THE all-time classics in cinema.Zombies had walked the world of cinema ever since Edward Halperlin's 1932 masterpiece "White Zombie", in which Horror icon Bela Lugosi enslaved the dead via Voodoo. It was George A. Romero, however, who established the idea of flesh-eating Zombies with "Night Of The Living Dead" - which makes this one of the most innovating films ever brought to screen. The film itself also had its influences - Italian director Ubaldo Ragona had created a masterpiece with an equally apocalyptic atmosphere four years earlier, in 1964, with "The Last Man On Earth" (starring Vincent Price!). Another film that influenced this one is Herk Harvey's "Carnival Of Souls" of 1962. All three films are masterpieces that no Horror fan could afford to miss, yet it is this one which single-handedly changed the entire Genre forever. The gore is extreme for its time, and it is save to say that people back then must have been shocked about the explicitness of graphic violence. The main shocks, however, are provided by the stunningly creepy atmosphere that will leave audiences breathless even after repeated viewing. I am sure I don't stand alone among my fellow Horror fans when I describe this film both as one of my personal favorites of all-time, and as one of the most innovating, creepiest and greatest masterpieces ever in Horror. I can not praise this film enough, so I will end this review with a recommendation - in case you have not seen this, stop what you're doing and go for it right now! "Night Of The Living Dead" is an essential masterpiece of Horror and no fan of cinema can afford to miss it! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was Pretty Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this for the first time today after seeing the remake colour version and i have to say i think i prefer this one. Obviously they are both slightly different at the directors are different and as they go i love Geaorge A Romero i think all of his dead films have been scarier than any other attempts of remakes of his films although i own all the dead films and their remakes and enjoy them all. the difference between them is that i believe the Romero films seem to be more built on atmosphere instead of straight scares. I thoroughly enjoyed this film even though it was in black and white but i think that added to the terror because it added to the unknown about the situation "where have the zombies come from?" I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good horrors for their atmosphere people who like horrors for jumpy scene may not enjoy it as there are very few. I am very glad i bought the black and white version and not the colour version as i know there has been a reissue of the original just in colour i might invest in it I'm not too sure but this one is a definite watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Black and White masterpiece from George Romero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While hailing Romero's sequel "Dawn of the Dead" as my all time favorite horror/zombie movie, it was really the first film I've ever seen after people from high school told me how awesome it was. Nine months later when Halloween was on the horizon in 1999, I shopped at my local Wal-Mart where they had been selling the VHS/DVD horror movies and I just happened to see this film standing in the shelves and I decided to purchase it. Take my word when I say that it'll make you have dreams.The film starts out in a cemetery where a brother and his sister go out to place flowers on their dead relative's tomb before seeing a strange man walking in their direction who happens to attack both the siblings as the brother gets his head knocked on a tombstone. The sole survivor goes to a local house to hide out where other people are involved in hiding from the strange beings."Night of the Living Dead" is a scary flick, and I don't doubt that at the time when people saw this film in the early days they had nightmares. Even the music is scary from the first second the film starts along with early graphic scenes of zombies ripping other people apart despite the fact that the blood in the film was just Bosco syrup compared to "Dawn of the Dead's" use of blood packets and intestines.An early shocker of it's time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't bother with the sequels, as this is the only good movie in the entire series. It's very scary, and surprisingly enough it had good acting for a Low Budget Horror Movie. The score was fantastic, as was the Atmosphere. The Setting of the Old Farmhouse in the middle of nowhere was fantastic - And looked real creepy at night. This movie also featured the first Black Actor in a leading role in a Horror movie, and the man did a fantastic job giving the best performance out of ANY of the characters in any of the Dead movies. Anyway, in conclusion, this is must see for anyone who wants to consider themselves a REAL fan of Horror movies. Pass on the sequels though as they drag on with pointless Dialogue and provide no scares whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A night that never ended....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This black and white film (1968) is the first from zombie-trilogy of George A. Romero. In continue on this film of Romero lies the emphasis on the action (' Dawn or the Dead ') or on a combination of environment and action (' Day or the Dead '). In this film however environment stands first and everything from the cupboard is drawn to bring about this.With the lack of color and the use of lifts and dark increased the dark and dark environment of the film because whole literally colourless and as a result Gray and disconsolately happens. The deathly and left surroundings and the fact that the tale takes place mainly at night seem the hopeless increase situation of the group. . First of all the always more becoming zombies which shadow themselves vaguely and vaguely in dark move on. Furthermore several zombies become just on the last moment (fright impact) visible when they shadow from discharging step. Ontvluchtingspoging where two group members meet end by their own clunkyly by an exploding lorry seem depressing symbolic for the unavoidable complete perdition of the whole group. Bursting out the flow and as a result, the reporting by means of the television brings finally their loneliness to expression because their last link with the outside world is broken.Concerning the cold, disconsolate, dark and imminent environment this film has atrociously succeeded call. For the occasional viewer who has nothing with the genre and accidentally in this film sailed touches this an almost unbearable grey and depressing film is. Without there optimism to discover is the complete film in the sign seems stand of sadism, sarcastic remark, dead and coldness where all group members with which the viewer has sympathized finally also still meets end. For the lover of the zombie genre however this is the ultimate zombie classic are who is to find there as well as of the best and tense horror movie of all times. This by sinister environment which the pictures call with thereby the skeletally supportive use of slightly and dark, the irony which is taken into consideration and by the tension and especially the threat which assumes the many slowly but certainly closer stumbling zombies.A worthy Classic,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It all started here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 19 years old when this first came out and I was fortunate to see it in a downtown Baltimore theater with a packed audience that didn't know what to expect. When it ended, several in the audience leaped out of their seats and shouted at the screen in outrage. Everyone else just sat there stunned, me included. I think most everyone there realized they had seen something historic.They had.Growing up in the Sixties, I liked horror movies. Horror movies starred Vincent Price or Peter Cushing. They were set in castles. Girls in low-cut nightgowns fled down hallways. Outside, it was always thunderstorms. There was a secret passage. Etc.That style of horror was almost instantly bankrupt when "Night of the Living Dead" came out. Just as John Wayne-type westerns became obsolete when "A Fistful of Dollars" arrived.I think the moment in the movie that I realized -- and I think the audience realized it -- that a line was being crossed was the fate of the little girl in the basement. To this day, I think that sequence is the single most horrifying moment in all film.I've seen the movie many times and most of the sequels. Romero owes a small debt to Herk Harvey's "Carnival of Souls" from 1962, but most of this new template is his.This is ground-breaking American art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic but dated horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmmm, I don't know about this one. At points I couldn't take it seriously, and at others I was engrossed in the characters and story. Fair to say, Night of the Living Dead is a very decent horror movie, and certainly an influential one for it's time... but I can't help but be distracted at its sometimes dated style.Firstly, I loved the photography in this film. It is probably one of the finest I have seen to date in a horror movie that manages to encapsulate the story wonderfully and bring out the real claustrophobic atmosphere present within the story. The way this is done so well is particularly through the highly dramatic lighting used throughout usually creating dark shadows across faces and objects to great effect. I also enjoyed the overall feel of the film, created by the actors and the music which always helps to bring out the dramatic moments in the film. Performances were on the whole, very good, with only a few dumb moments here and there.The story is fairly paced, but does take a little while to fully establish itself and the conflict at hand successfully. I was actually ready to change the channel near 1/4 of the way in, but I stayed with it and was glad because it finally did pick up and move on somewhere interesting. Characters were well written with realistic dialogue and most were decently fleshed out, however I was a little annoyed at the killing off of a character 5 minutes in, that I was actually enjoying watching.Aside from the pacing, perhaps the most dated features of the film are indeed the effects and make-up. Sure, they look great for a movie made in the 60's, but they just don't hold up that entirely well today. Furthermore, there are some major unanswered plot holes everywhere in the film that bugged me all the way through that I wished they had clarified just a little, but nonetheless, it isn't anything to dislike the feature for.In the end, I was entertained by Night of the Living Dead, but necessarily scared. I guess my standards are just a little higher than audiences of the 60's having seen horror films from 40 years after this film was released. Nevertheless, I absolutely recommend it to classic horror fans and just about anyone looking for an entertaining and possibly scary couple of hours to pass away.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a classic horror film that wasn't bad at all until towards the end. It is about living dead or zombies and they certainly grossed me out. It was kind of funny until the barbecue, and then is became a little gruesome. It makes me afraid as they will even eat my barbecue, which usually gets a little burned. I guess they like it crispy for the most part, but the entrails were just plain disgusting. It is just not right what they did to Ben (Duane Jones). Barbara (Judith O'Dea) was like a zombie herself the entire movie. I guess it was the trauma. It was funny watching them leave or toss their smokes without concern in the wood house. It even had nudity, which surprised me. You have to see the classics to appreciate the never movies.</fullReview>

The new score is obtrusive, and new scenes ill-conceived at best. Why John Russo tampered with it the way he did is confounding. I guess the 30th must be the poop anniversary, and he was celebrating by turning a classic into a frenzy of poop. All copies of the 30th Anniversary Edition of Night of the Living Dead MUST be disposed of by cremation IMMEDIATELY. Soak them with gasoline, and BURN them. It's the only way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a brilliant film. Sure, the special effects are dated, but that doesn't destroy the film itself. If it hadn't been for this movie, there wouldn't be Dawn of the Dead, Land of the Dead, 28 Days Later, or any other zombie film out there. George Romero is an absolute genius. "They're coming to get you, Barbra!". Brilliant. The 1990 remake was alright, but it was nothing compared to this. It is not "terrifying", like "The Exorcist", but it had a few chilling moments. Such as, when the zombie-girl kills her own mother with a garden trowel. This film, launched three sequels (Dawn of the Dead, Land of the Dead), remakes (Night of the Living Dead (1990), Dawn of the Dead (2004), and Day of the Dead (2007), and a whole array of Zombie films, that are to many to count. I strongly recommend this film to any fans of the Zombie film genre, and to anyone who wants to see a real classic. A fun, fun movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who else do you know that invented a whole genre of film? Romero invented the meat eating zombie and he has had a thousand poor imitators but none have come close to the master.Up until Romero zombies had been of the voo-doo induced kind that shuffled along and followed commands of their master.With Romero the only master his zombies have is the one that drives them to find warm human flesh to eat.In this film Romero gives us a deserted old farmhouse and a group of people trapped inside fighting with each other while trying to keep a horde of meat seeking walking dead from breaking inside.How much freaking better can it get? This film still impacts today but just imagine what an uproar it made when it come out in the late 1960's showing the walking dead feasting on the flesh and innards of living humans.This is a horror film that horror fans watch over and over.This little black and white low budget film has continued to shock and awe horror buffs for almost 40 years now and it is truly one of the top 5 greatest horror films ever.You've got to be kidding if you call yourself a horror fan or a movie fan in general and have never seen this masterpiece."They're coming to get you,Barbara!"

		<fullReview>What can possibly be written about Night of the Living Dead that hasn't already been duly noted? This is one of the greatest films of all time. The budget was minuscule and the actors were certainly not even C-list caliber, but this movie works on so many different levels. First and foremost, it's a horror movie that helped create the zombie sub genre. It shocked the entire nation when it was released in 1968. The movie was highly controversial, with it's direct references to the civil rights movement and, of course, the gore which led to it becoming the cult classic that it is today. When he is on, George Romero really knows how to deliver a great movie. This gets a very enthusiastic 9/10 and is worth owning even if you're not a fan of horror flicks.

Plenty of unforgettable moments in this one, most notably Judith O'Dea's performance at the beginning, and Duane Jones in the end. There's plenty of neat little flourishes in this that I like, particularly the shift of status many of the characters take, and of course, the obvious race question of not just the ending but the whole movie.

My favorite part is when this one girl gets bitten from a zombie and of course the parents try to keep her safe even though she is going to later turn into a walking corpse. Sucks for them. The hero in this movie is a black man and back in the 60s that is a rare thing. He is the most intelligent person and tries to save everyone else. Supposedly the makers of this film meant for a deeper plot than zombies. I think that is easy to see. I strongly recommend this film for everyone.

		<shortDescription>The one that started it all, etc, etc, etc?.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was interesting to see Night of the Living Dead turn into such a cult classic, and I think that one of the biggest reasons that that happened was because of its simplicity. You might notice a trend in the horror genre, the less extravagant they are the better, and this is a perfect example of the less extravagant category. Shot in black and white several decades after color became normal in mainstream film, Night of the Living Dead scares through some of the same tactics later used by other classic horror films, notable Halloween, with the slow but relentless Michael Meyers stalking constantly. He's slow, but like the zombies in this movie, he is virtually unstoppable. Granted, the zombies can be killed with a shot to the head or some other way of separating the brain from the rest of the body (pleasant, isn't it!), but their sheer numbers compensates for this weakness. Because we don't see the events that lead up to what is famously referred to as `an epidemic of mass murder being committed by a virtual army of unidentified assassins' (White Zombies fans are sure to prick up their ears at this radio broadcast), it's reasonable to assume that the vast majority of the human population has fallen victim to the walking dead, and the people we see barricading themselves in the house are the few remaining survivors.One of the strange things about Night of the Living Dead is the way it is structured, or I should say the time that it takes place. A lesser director might have concentrated on the widespread attacking and panic that lead to most people being turned into zombies, but not only would that not have been possible with this movie's famously miniscule budget, but it's not really the point. That timeline would fall flat because it would force the movie to focus on a few select people, who would just happen to be the ones that survived long enough to become characters with names and personalities (well maybe just names, let's not go crazy here, this IS a horror movie?). It would kind of kill the suspense.While it may seem that the movie started right on the middle of things and that we've already missed all the good stuff, I think it's important to keep in mind that, given the movie's budget and intentions, George Romero wanted it to be as simple as possible. It has a little bit of a character study, featuring characters in an extreme crisis situation who can do nothing but quarrel amongst themselves like blithering idiots who can't stand to see anyone else in power (as well as a blonde woman who periodically can't even speak). The movie is about a bunch of people thrown into this situation and how they deal with the situation and each other in order to survive the night. It's telling, for example, that throughout the entire trilogy we're never given a real reason for why people were turning into zombies in the first place, because it doesn't matter.From a technical standpoint, the movie is brilliant because of Romero's sheer ability to get so much out of so little. The movie is crudely shot, but I think that actually adds to the effect because it gives it something of a documentary feel, not the polished look of so many modern horror movies whose special effects do nothing more than remind the audience constantly that they are movies. Night of the Living Dead really couldn't afford to look so fake. The acting is terrible throughout, but the important part is that the zombies looked at least halfway like zombies. Consider the abysmal sequel (which was recently remade into one of the best horror modernizations ever created), in which the zombies look like nothing more than masses of extras with cheesy blue make-up all over their faces. In this movie, it's not hard to see that the make-up is crude, but the crudeness of the film stock as well as the shooting itself gets past that. Ironically, it's more effective because you can't really see it so clearly. Night of the Living Dead has become a cult classic because of how daring it was (in such ways as the horribly ironic ending) and how frightening it managed to be despite its miniscule budget. Granted, even this titan of a horror classic has been subdued to the point where it tends to generate more respect than fear (as is the case with most older horror films which are actually well made), but it's position in film history is unmistakable, even today, when it's sequel has been massively improve by a recent remake. It is black and white and seems ancient, but Night of the Living Dead remains a movie for current aspiring horror filmmakers to study and emulate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very scary. I am glad this was in black and white because the shadows just made it all the more creepy. There were a lot of moments that really built the tension up. And I loved all those TV reports. Some of them added humor to the terrible situation those people were in. And I have to say the scenes were it showed the zombees tearing flesh from bone and eating what looked like liver and intestines really made my stomach queezy. I think those scenes would have been less effective in color because bright red blood would have seemed more fake. And the ending was good too. It is a horror movie, why should there be a happy ending!The only part I would criticize would be Barbara. I mean, the girl was so stupid. She just sat there in a comatose like trance and wouldn't help sealing the house up. I was glad when they finally got her.FINAL VERDICT: Very good. Much better than scary movies of today. Highly recommended. Watch it with all the lights turned off.</fullReview>

The special effects are even so poor that you can see the real arm hidden behind his back to make it look like he has only one arm on one of the zombies! :)But despite those small goofs, it's a really good movie!

		<fullReview>A wonderfully dark and down-beat horror film way ahead of it's time. The characters and full and well defined, the action is intense, the tension is extreme from begin to end getting more and more all the time! The ending fits the movie to a T! The effects are fantastic and very gory for the time period! It is a film best watched while taking it seriously as it is how it is intended the main female lead suffers from shock though most of the film which is understandable and instead of screaming all the time she goes quite introvert as would more probably be the case. It's very well, conceived, written and executed there is really nothing bad I can say about it. For me it is one of the greatest movies of all time! Watch it but please, take it seriously, it deserves it! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice music shame about the footage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main think I like about this update is the music, which I think is really great and eerie and fits in perfectly with the picture although while the composer IS good at the music he perhaps shouldn't have tried acting, well at least not in this film. The character he plays in the new scenes offers to much plain comic relief which this film doesn't need. The new scenes just stick out like sore thumbs, they are executed in a much different fashion and while the original does seem quite timeless in it's setting the new footage is to obviously new footage. I mean, how many priests would you have seen in the 60s with a skin head and a goatee. So in conclusion, the extra scenes are a bit of fun to watch as an extra but add nothing to the film and perhaps take some of it away, but the music is perfect and it even brings it up to date while still keeping it's old style. Music:8/10 New Footage:4/10 Overall with new footage &amp; music 8/10 P.S.(I have never heard the original music but here it isn't that good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I was at the used video store the other day, and I see a copy of "NOTLD" for 6 bucks. "Wow!" I think, "a copy of Night of the Living dead for only 6 dollars!". I quickly scan the back of the case and see that it's the re-released edition, but, hey, I figure, it's probably just digitally remastered. So, I buy it, and I take it home, and as I am about to watch it, I see a little box of text on the back of the video that I hadn't bothered to read before. And, of course, this text is talking about how Russo et al have gone back and, uh oh, filmed and added "over 15 minutes of NEW footage?!". WITHOUT THE HELP OF GEORGE ROMERO!!!?? I think I must have read that piece of text about 12 times, hoping that I was misreading it and they had just gone back and added deleted scenes from the original filming, or at least FOR THE LOVE OF GOD had Romero help out. My heart dropped through the floor, and lower still when I saw that they had changed the opening scene! THE OPENING SCENE! HAVE these people no souls! Or perhaps no brains. I suffered through the boring and unnecessary new footage and decided to give this new version a chance. But I just couldn't, what with the glaring anachronisms (the goateed preacher, the not really very sixties sounding dialogue, etc.) and the fact that the preacher character bore an uncanny resemblance to Weird Al Yankovic. I have been betrayed, along with all the other fans of the original movie, except apparently for the person who posted below who so cleverly and eloquently informed detractors of this film that we are all idiots (Although I suspect it is actually John Russo or John Hinzman posting under an alias...).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you remember a film that changed you forever, set you on an aesthetic course and completely opened your eyes? For me, "Night of the Living Dead" was that film.I'm eight years old, I'm sitting on the creaky wooden chair in my Mom's sewing room and I'm squinting into the crummy little black-and-white TV screen. It's late, probably way past my bedtime, but I snuck in here to catch this.I had no idea what I was in for, believe me.This was raw, brutal, scary stuff...and for a kid enthralled with the gloss and flash of "Star Wars", this was stunning. The movie seemed to have been filmed by no-one, in the middle of nowhere, and for nothing. It looked like Vietnam War footage, all low-fi film stock, murky cinematography and panic, pure and direct. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.I went to the library the next day and began combing all the midnight movies and cult films books. Someone made their own movie? Without a big studio or budget or stars? And it, gulp, had a really dark, no-punches-pulled ending? This was my punk rock of film. Do it yourself and do it the way you want it. I was beyond amazed."Night of the Living Dead" showed a cinegeeky kid the way to David Lynch, John Waters, Kenneth Anger and David Cronenberg. I xeroxed articles about it and began obsessively reading anything I could about the birth of American independent film. This, of course, later led me to discover independent music and a whole new way of thinking about art and creation and inspiration. You want to make a movie? No budget, no starpower, no giant studio...you just DO it.Thanks, George. Somehow, all these years later, "Night of the Living Dead" stays with me, in all its grainy, gritty glory.</fullReview>

There was no reason for it. There was no need to know who the main zombie was before his rebirth (and don't get me started on the fact that he in no way looks the same as he did in the original even if it is the same guy.....the years have not been kind to him).

This may be bad for the very queasy stomachs but it changed my perspective of horror movies and got me to watch the black and white "Psycho".

		<fullReview>A vary entertaining film based on millennium-madness or plague??The first (but not last ...) time I saw this strange tale was in Nha Trang, RVN (1968-1969). I saw it with a group of about 300 other GI's under the stars one clear night. About half way through the film (having gotten to the good part ...) the film broke. Since it couldn't be fixed, it was about 15 years before I saw the film in its entirety to its inevitable conclusion.Basic Plot: In the near future a "plague" comes to the world. It is the story of several couples and how they come to realize what is happening, how to deal with and overcome the effects the plague, and what befalls each of them.What makes this film so entertaining is that [like El Mariachi (1992)] it is a low-budget film from someone with a story to tell in which the acting isn't as nearly important as the story-line (Plot, plot, plot).It is the story of some one's apocalyptic millennium-nightmare come true. Remember the old saying, "Be careful what you wish for, it may surely come true."

		<shortDescription>Slightly overrated, but a brilliant milestone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am almost embarrassed to admit that it has taken me this long to watch George A. Romero's directorial debut, often attributed with revolutionising horror and reinventing zombies in film. Better late than never, they say.If only the film's characters were afforded precious time. Ben, the struggling leader of seven survivors are thrown into the refuge of a farm house surrounded by a growing pack of zombies. Although the characters are completely flat and lack any development, the mix of stereotypes and qualities provides an entertaining mix.The viewer cannot help but pity the poor, helpless survivors. Frequent broadcasts reveal an ongoing national resistance, with the help of doctors, NASA and the police force. Conversely, our survivors are isolated with nothing more than a shotgun, a few slugs and an array of very hate-able useless individuals who slow down the overall progress of the group.Another welcomed theme throughout the movie was the gradual reclusion of Ben. Venturing from the country, he seeks refuge in the farm house and is eventually driven to a dim basement shared with a monster child. By this stage, sheer desperation is the only thing left to cling to.Entering this film, I knew that the previous viewing of countless zombie films would provide prejudice. Half of the fear of living dead in film has always been, at least for me, their visual awe. A man chasing another man is generally nothing special, but it is when he only has half a face. With that said, I was amazed at the genuine terror invoked through the almost cosmetic- free walkers in Night of the Living Dead. Accompanying great strides and power in numbers was a score that provided real shock-value.Put down your 28s and Walkin Dead discs and pull out the godfather of zombie films. It won't create nightmares and it can be safely watched at night on your own, but it is a decent film nonetheless. Considering the era and available technologies, Romero should be regarded as a genius.Read more of my reviews at http://silvertonguereviews.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, this is one of the first movies that ever kept me awake at night.Growing up, we had (the original) Svengoolie and Creature Features on local Chicago TV. ANd usually, they played such harmless fare as the Universal Monster movies and "I was a teenage (Fill in the blank)" films.So then Sven decided he was going to play NOTLD! And it was a very different horror film, one that gave me "Zombie Nightmares" for years. What made it different is that the heroes didn't prevail at the end. The character of Duane survives to the end of the film, but is accidentally killed by the redneck posse. So the ending was kind of ironic and scary.Hey, let's talk about Duane, shall we? He's the hero of this film, and it was quite a stretch in 1968, the year Dr. King was killed, and NBC was mortified by the notion of William Shatner kissing Nichelle Nichols. Yet here he is, not only being heroic, but talking down, beating and eventually killing the fat, white character.Obviously, this film was made on the cheap, but it was made effectively. I think the problem is, Romero has spent the rest of his career trying to replicate the effectiveness of this film with bigger budgets, better actors and more advanced special effects, and not pulling it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic black and white horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I certainly do not want to go into a long dissertation about the 'message' in this movie. The casting of a black actor (Duane Jones) as the protagonist is to me, simply interesting casting. Let's face it. This is a horror movie. It's dead people coming back to life and wanting to eat you. In short, it's a whole lot of fun.Of course there is the irony that the black guy is the only one in the movie with any brains, as he endures a Jeff Foxworthy nightmare image of white hicks, whether it's the recently deceased type, the Living Dead, or the permanently confused Barbara, the cowardly Harry, and finally meeting his executioner, the fat dumb sheriff, who, when asked if the creatures are slow moving, utters this immortal dialogue: "Yeah, they're dead. They're all messed up."I could go the artsy-fartsy route and think even Hitchcock would enjoy the novel introduction of the first ghoul at the cemetery. There are scenes inside the house that remind me of Welles' "Touch of Evil" and the claustrophobic rooms that Janet Leigh endured in that film.The idea is so simple. Dead people come back to life. This idea reached the ultimate comic conclusion in "Dawn of the Dead", which featured a shopping mall that strangely looks like your neighborhood mega-center. Take a real good look next time you are there!In short, the film not only succeeds as compelling cinema, but is a fun horror romp. The black and white gives it the look of a classic. (There is much lost in the remakes...yes, the blood is red.) There are enough disgusting scenes that color would be gratuitous. The 'homeyness' of the scene with the television set propped up on two chairs is disturbing considering the crowd of ghouls that stand just outside.What happened to great horror films like this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First thing first: Carnival of Souls kicks this movie's butt so hard that its spine shoots right out of its skull and launches forward so far that it breaks the world record for javelin throwing. The first fifty minutes or so are really terrible, about as clumsily directed and written as anything I can think of. Romero can't think of anything for Barbra (Judith O'Dea, whose look should prove without a shadow of a doubt that Romero had in fact seen Herk Harvey's film) to do than sit around staring insanely. The other characters are just as bland and illogical, although it's nice to see a black hero. Duane Jones gives the film's only decent performance. The only way Romero knows how to move the narrative forward is with the television and radio news programs, which provide us with far too much explanation for what's going on. The movie starts to pick up when the (far too many) characters attempt to escape the house in which they've boarded themselves up. There are a couple of surprises along the way, and the dread does begin to build. But then the final twist is far too predictable. Whatever little it was building towards falls apart. 6/10.</fullReview>

It's hard to believe that it never was intended to be a social commentary but ended up being such, what with the hero being a black man, and the cynicism taking over the country due to the Vietnam War. Of course, the real stars are the zombies (although the word "zombie" is never used). Silent and slow - but deadly - they are some mean mothers. George Romero created a veritable horror classic. There have been many other zombie movies since then, but only "Shaun of the Dead" was really worth seeing. To truly understand what the genre means, you have to see "Night of the Living Dead".

		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead (1968) **** (out of 4) The first of Romero's on going series has the dead returning to life looking for human flesh and find their victims in a small farm house. For my money this is the third greatest horror film ever made and I'd probably add that it's the greatest "B" movie ever made. I think the film is pretty damn near flawless and contains some of the greatest natural chills from any movie made. The soundtrack is great as is the sound effects but everything else is just as great. I think the cinematography really stands out and packs one hell of a punch by creating some wonderful claustrophobic scenes. The cinematography really narrows everything down and shows how small this farm house is and in my opinion it really puts you inside the house and you can feel yourself choking as their world gets smaller and smaller as the zombies get closer. The performances have taken a beating over the years but I think they're great as well. I think all the characters have a reason or purpose for the film and I think the actors really bring it out in them. Duane Jones really stands out as Ben as he brings a certain safe nature to the movie. When all hell starts to break loose and Ben first shows up on the scene, he does so in a way that you can feel protected. Judith O'Dea is also great at showing the paranoia of her character. I also think the film remains quite creepy even after all the viewings I've had throughout the years. When the zombies finally crash threw the door you can help but feel threatened by them. The screaming of Barbara, Ben trying to board the place back up and the frantic editing really packs a punch. I also think the little girl stabbing her mother is one of the most haunting shots in film history. The use of shadows and the way the scene is edited makes it unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most important films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead wasn't the first film to ever use the idea of an apocalypse; The Last Man on Earth did almost the same thing four years earlier - but it was Romero's film that popularised it, and this film is pretty much responsible for every zombie film ever made post-1968. Through excellent black and white cinematography, a claustrophobic atmosphere and some shocking scenes of zombie slaughter; Night of the Living Dead is an out and out horror classic. This film upset many people upon it's release in 1968, and despite being over three decades old - the film has lost none of it's nastiness. The plot is very simple, and it follows the idea of the dead returning to life and feasting upon the living. We follow a farmhouse full of people trying to evade the carnage. There is never any solid explanation given about why the dead are returning to life - only an idea about radiation from space. This actually helps the film, though, because there is never an attempt to save humanity or discover why it is happening; we just follow the people in trouble, and that immensely adds to the horror.Romero constantly makes sure that the audience is aware that we're following a group of people without much hope. The scene is always isolated, and the sparing use of radio and television gives the protagonists their only window into the wider world. Romero's use of the camera enforces the isolation in the farmhouse. He uses a lot of close-up's and angled shots, which adequately show the closed space. One of the things that this low budget zombie flick will always be remembered for is the fact that it was the first horror film to feature an African-American. This casting is just one example of Romero's lust for rule breaking, and there are many moments of zombie carnage in the film that seem to be there just to upset the more conservative Americans. These scenes also serve the film in it's bid to be frightening, and when combined with the hopeless, downbeat aura of the film; it's all very horrific. Many of the 'zombie rules' were created in this film, and the build up to the ending that sees two of the main characters killed is absolute pure brilliance. On the whole; horror cinema wouldn't be the same without this film. The fact that it's aged so well is no coincidence.</fullReview>

However, I strongly commend this film for helping to create the genre as well as getting one of the best examples of an inexpensively produced and excellent film that made a fortune (some others being CARNIVAL OF SOULS and the original LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS). Now I won't go so far as to give the movie a hugely inflated rating like some, after all the acting was at times pretty shabby (particularly by that stupid blonde). But it did have a simple but clever script, good special effects given the budget and time in which it was made, decent direction and scared the crap out of audiences--something many horror films fail to do. If you love the genre, then this is a must. Otherwise, it's not a must-see unless you are making a study of excellent bare-bones film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I type this, exactly four decades have passed since George Romero's Night of the Living Dead changed the face of horror cinema forever, introducing fans to the concept of the modern flesh-eating zombie. It is testament to Romero's skill as a director, and the brilliance of the basic premise that, forty years on, the film still has the power to chill and thrill, and that its influences are still being felt in horror cinema today.The simple yet ingenious plot sees a group of people trying to survive a night in a farmhouse which is besieged by the living dead. With only a handful of disparate central characters, a slowly increasing sense of dread and tension, and an ever growing horde of ghouls trying to sink their teeth into the living, Romero delivers a non-stop ride of terror that any self-respecting horror fan should make it their duty to see?not once, but as many times as they can.From it's opening atmospheric scenes in a rural graveyard, to the final zombie onslaught and the shocking twist ending, Night of the Living Dead is an unmissable marvel of low budget movie-making: brilliantly written, innovative, well executed, and throroughly enjoyable from start to finish (if you like to be scared, that is).And to all you young whippersnappers who might scoff at what I have to say.... next time you sit down to enjoy a 'Resident Evil' or a '28 (insert unit of time here) Later', remember.... it all started with this film.

		<fullReview>Zombie movies is something I never quite understand. Some movies (like Zombie Flesh Eaters and House of the Dead) is terribly ridiculous and filled with (awkward, not charming) clichés, but then again we have movies like this one who is terrifying, thrilling, scary, intelligent and just great! This may not be timeless for everyone, since many people who see it today may think it's past crap, but if you switch on your brain (which you mostly often don't, when we come to horror) you'll just have to love it. It's obvious what a genius George A. Romero is. While many directors see "zombie movie" as an opportunity to make "Die Hard Action Horror", Mr Romero took the chance to make a creepy, disturbing and unsettling movies, while it still is brutal and shocking. Now THAT is something to admire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just rented this yesterday, and I was extremely disappointed.Poor acting by everyone except the black guy (who was mediocre). The characters were one-dimensional and cliched (again, with the exception of the black guy). The women characters were deplorable. There was the sex kitten who said nothing, the doting mother, and the screaming fainting stupid one. *SPOILER* The doting mother character falls over and then just lays there while her zombie child takes like 10 years to come kill her. She didn't even try to kick her or anything! The explanation for the zombies was ludicirous B-movie crap from the 60's. The dialogue came off as extremely stilted and forced and didn't flow whatsover, the poor acting only made it more obvious. This tries too hard to be "The Monsters are Coming to Maple Street" and fails.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*possible spoiler* In my opinion, the single greatest horror movie of them all. Go ahead and roll your eyes. No horror movie has chilled me as deeply or kept me at the edge of my seat with suspense as much as George Romero's debut does to this very day. The scene in which little zombified Karen stabs her mother to death with a spade after eating her father's arm off is still, for me, the most terrifying sequence in horror cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last Halloween I found out that Night of the Living Dead was coming on. I was all excited because I heard it was one of the best horror movies ever made. So I watched it, and was bored the entire time. It wasn't interesting, or really all that scary (especially by today's standards), and it wasn't even bad in a funny sort of way. It just sucked. And the ending: talk about anti-climactic. If you have nothing else to do, watch it. Otherwise I recommend just about anything else in the horror section.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dubious progenitor of the zombie genre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968) is an example of a film where it seems like simply because it was the FIRST of it's kind, it gets undue praise for being a great film and in some circles the best. Here is where I beg to differ! Unlike, say, "The Maltese Falcon" (forefather of film noir) or "Psycho" (creator of the slasher genre), NOTLD doesn't really stand out or hold up as a film. The aforementioned movies have a style, interesting characterizations, sharp dialogue, and classic lines that make them truly memorable. I'm no film snob, but I also know when a movie is just not good, and NOTLD is just...not...good!Directed by George Romero, NOTLD is obviously made on the cheap, shot in black-and-white, and possessing an all too lifeless, monotone tone throughout. The main female, the (coming to get you) Barbara literally goes mute for most of the film due to the terror of seeing the first zombie, most coincidentally after her nerdy, jerk of a brother teases her as a wannabe-ghost in a graveyard as they are visiting a family member's tombstone. Barbara escapes the attacker (her brother not so lucky) and she finds a nearby farmhouse, where she holes up. THIS is where the cliché elements of the zombie genre had their began! In addition to Barbara, a ragtag group of people join her, the heroic loner Ben, the bickering married couple Harry and Helen and their daughter Karen, and the young tween couple Tom and Judy. This group of strangers must band together to fight the zombie threat. Ben and Harry are at odds as they butt heads as to the best courses of action to survive. The men strategize and plan, while the women just kind of stand there and support them, or say nothing like Barbara! The misogynistic time in which the film takes place is all too apparent, but it's interesting that Romero cast an African-American as the male lead in essentially a film that founded a new genre. Usually, it's stereotypical casting in films like this one and it takes forever for the liberal world to catch up!While Romero should be credited for starting a new genre and taking risks that other directors might not have taken, the movie itself is a very flawed, dull exercise to get through. I kind of feel about the zombie genre the way I feel about movie musicals...just not my cup of tea!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly a classic horror flick, but horror movies are terribly overrated as a film genre. There's thrills and chills, but there's a good reason why most of these films - even the wildly successful ones - are low-budget: they're easy to make. These should be graded on a sliding scale. Say you made the greatest reality TV show ever. Would it ever approach, say, The Honeymooners for overall quality? I don't think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George A. Romero recreates the entire horror genre! Night is one of the greatest American movies ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema freaks all over the world (and horror buffs in particular) should bow their heads and thank Romero endlessly for this film he made. Night of the Living Dead is an undeniable masterpiece any way you look at it and a stunning victory for low-budget artists, rich on inspiration.WARNING: Dangerous plot and structure spoilers from here!!Horror anno 2004 would have looked completely different if it weren't for Romero and his risky, innovating views. He single-handedly rewrites the entire genre and adds some radical new ideas. Extremely brutal and thought-provoking ideas that teach us that good DOESN'T necessarily triumphs over evil or that the hero's fade isn't automatically secure. In fact, there aren't any heroes in Night of the Living Dead?only scared victims who're fighting for their lives. The film starts with a moody tone, showing two young siblings on their way to visit their father's grave on the countryside. A tall, slow moving man approaches them and from that moment on the film turns into a non-stop wholesome of frightening images, unbearable tensions and downright nightmarish events. Still not knowing what is going on, a group of isolated people has to hide themselves in a farmhouse, while evil grows numerous around them in the form of recently deceased human beings! As a viewer, you can't help but sympathize with the players, yet their situation becomes more hopeless by the minute and even if there is a slight bit of hope for them?it doesn't take long before Romero adds a new disastrous twist. This immensely controversial structure keeps on rushing by at high speed until it explodes into an astonishing anti-climax that leaves everyone breathless! You really have to rewind and double-check if what you saw at the end actually happened! See it in order to believe what kind of apocalyptic and inhuman ending Romero thought up here. Night of the Living Dead is a shocking portrait that makes your blood pump faster to your heart for an hour and a half non-stop. Surprisingly simple and modestly shot, but ten times more effective and haunting then any other horror movie ever before. An essential cinema experience that has to be seen by every self-respecting film fan? George A. Romero's film is slightly influenced by the equally brilliant `Carnival of Souls' (a still vastly underrated film by Herk Harvey) but he himself opened the way for upcoming cinematographers such as David Cronenberg, Tobe Hooper and John Landis. There's no end to this film's influence and importance! The uncut original '68 version is favorable viewing material over the 30 years special edition that contains extra footage. There's an additional opening sequence in that one that more or less spoils the atmosphere right from the beginning. Tom Savini's 1990 remake, on the other hand IS worth a watch?since that one was made with an overload of respect for Romero's debut. Night of the Living Dead unquestionably receives a rating 10 out of 10, which still doesn't says enough about its brilliancy! If you haven't seen it yet?.do it now! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is the father of zombie movies, but this is a very slow moving horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to give it props for being the first of the zombie movies of this type, but I find it by far the weakest in Romero's dead series. The problem, it is very bottom heavy...nearly all the chomping action is at the end of the film and the rest of the film is just arguing and nailing boards over windows and doors. I did not find this movie had all that much social commentary in it, lets face it the guy was wrong holding up in the cellar was the smart move to make...just not holding up in the cellar and sneaking around when help finally arrived. Still it is not all bad as the zombie attack at the end was good and it was rather bloody for a film of its time and you have to know Romero did not have much of a budget so he did the best he could with what he had. Also, if it were not for this movie other zombie movies including the much more superior Dawn might not have been made. Still you can tell it is his first effort and the rules for zombies had not yet been established as sometimes they run here, but most of the time they are slow. In the end there is good and bad, I actually prefer the remake in 1990 to the original version, much better actors and effects in that one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I bought this film because I'm a huge zombie-fan, and thought that I should see one of the real early classics of this genre. But you know, it's like wanting to watch a film for the special effects, and choose "the classic" from the 30's or something. The problem is indeed that this film isn't scary or anything at all. The dead people looks like alive humans, really, and it isn't scary, maybe only in the beginning. I would recommend someone that is into zombies to watch this, but don't expect to feel involved. I didn't feel for the characters and didn't get into the mood, like I easily do in many films. The only positive thing I can think of is that one of the characters is black, that's good for a film this old. Other than that, Zombiefilms have absolutely gotten much better with time. Especially for someone like me who loves the splattering of blood and scary-looking dead people. "Night of the Living Dead" definitely don't give us that. No blood at all, as I recall, actually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched this film a few times and it never really worked for me. I find the Zombie scenes too bland, underdirected maybe. The beginning and end of the movie are very good. I think what I find unpleasant about this film are the nasty female stereotypes. OF COURSE the blond woman is a hysterical stupid dumb ass who deserves a slap from the macho lead, OF COURSE the girlfriend of the dumb chump white guy is just a supportive little sweetheart with nice hair. OF COURSE the wife of the nasty cowardly white guy is a characterless cipher. For me the movie lacked any sort of charisma or atmosphere. I think Romero's concern with social commentary blinded him to the potential of the rest of the characters and the movie's plot. This would be a brilliant film for those concerned with social justice, I suppose that just isn't my thing, I like horror to be creepy, psychological and underplayed, nothing like that in this film. I find it all a bit forced and didactic, for me, the sterile 'macho-ness' of the lead totally alienated me, and as a horror film, it wasn't at all frightening, just chumpy and flat footed.the zombies looked like middle class uni student extras. The young girl attacking her mother scene was not bad, but it was ultimately a film about racial issues, and while that was undoubtedly a horror story of the 60s, it gives the film a kind of shrill didacticism which completely dominated the atmosphere. Not scary, not engaging, just self important and self righteous.</fullReview>

Maybe back in 1968 it was an incredible film but it has not held up through the passage of time (though there is a nostalgia/cult that allows it to still be watchable). The remake was OK because the character of Barbra actually did something other than sit there like a comatose victim. And the ending was such a downer... (the all die, even the survivor of the night) I mean how can one feel for a character if they never even get to the end credits without getting a shot to the head.The reason this is getting a five is because as bad as this was... IT IS Oscar WORTHY COMPARED TO CHILDREN OF THE LIVING DEAD AND HOUSE OF THE DEAD...As much as Romero and the ROTLD and Resident Evil films ushered in a new age of zombie film to a generation those two films practically destroyed all of their hard work.</fullReview>

It's similar to the Rocky Horror Picture show in that regard.It's easily one of very worst films I've ever managed to sit through entirely and that only because I was an undergrad and there was absolutely nothing else to do that evening. The only nice thing I can say about the movie is that the decision to make it in black and white was the correct one. There are few scenes that would have been too gross in color. Also, grossness is not horror. If you watch a war picture for example and see a body get blown apart, that is not horror, that is just being gross.The ending was particularly bad. If the movie had actually been half-way decent, then ending would have ruined the movie. But there is nothing to ruin so the ending becomes the capstone to a thoroughly stupid, boring, unentertaining movie.</fullReview>

But there is nothing about the age of the camera mentioned anywhere so probably the thing was ancient and the guy using it was one of the living dead himself. The girl Barbara who is one of the lead characters looks dead before she died as well. Her acting is annoyingly bad and the way she shows us how women react in scary situations is a disgrace to her gender. The only plus i see in this movie is the Hero being a black guy which was a pleasant surprise as at the time i was watching this flick i still thought it was nearly one hundred years old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did the perfect zombie (or "ghoul," as this film's antagonists are dubbed) movie spring forth from the head of George Romero fully- formed, or did subsequent iterations simply fail to build on his promising idea? You know the drill even if you are not a zombie connoisseur: the murderous undead are on the loose, and a diverse band of survivors must overcome their disagreements while staving off the hordes. Romero achieves his vision in "Night of the Living Dead" despite financial and technical limitations. Yet the vision itself is so limited that it hardly extends beyond the premise. In this movie, as in many later knock-offs, there is little character development, little consideration of the theological or scientific implications of the situation, and? despite frequent claims to the contrary and the casting of a black lead actor?little social commentary. The ending is suggestive of the paranoia and pessimism that afflicted many in 1968, but the script's unironic portrayal of women as submissive and incompetent does not indicate a desire to engage with social issues of the day. "Night of the Living Dead" is decent as far as it goes, but it does not go far, and the genre has rarely aimed higher in the nearly 50 years since.</fullReview>

Instead of fooling around, why didn't Duane Jones pick off every single one with the gun instead of carrying it around like some sort of trophy. He could've killed every single one. of course as usual, it fails to explain how the dead could rise and live anyway. Why do they breathe? Why do their muscles work without the circulatory system providing them with oxygen. It never makes sense. Of course we must pay homage to the great master Romero who is not only a bad film maker but needs help from a psychiatrist or something. Very stupid and very lame. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1968 George A. Romero released what is arguably the greatest horror film of all time, Night of the Living Dead. This movie also involved Bill Hinzman in a small role as the "cemetery zombie" and Tom A. Russo as co-writer of the original screenplay.Go forward in time 30 years, Tom A. Russo and a now overweight Bill Hinzman for devise a terrible idea--augmenting a 30-year-old film with newly shot footage and enitrely redoing the original music score. Enter the Anton LaVey wannabe Scott Vladimir Licina for the soundtrack, which sounds like it was composed on a Casio keyboard by a 13-year-old. Licina also pollutes the movie with a the most pathetic excuse for acting I have ever seen. Also, when does your average 1960's Pennsylvanian minister look like the leader of the Church of Satan? Hinzman is reprised in the movie in the role of the "cemetery zombie", however, his classic visage is ruined by age and weight, the burning eyes and hollow cheeks have vanished over the years.Russo and Hinzman justify tampering with the movie for the same reasons George Lucas gave for Star Wars--a lack of original resources and funding. However, no amount of money or personell can recreate a classic film to the level of its original.In summary, aside from the origninal footage (minus the new score), this film comes off like a high school video project. Russo and Hinzman have done an injustice to NOTLD fans everywhere. Avoid this at all costs, unless you're looking for chuckle from some horrible acting and music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "masterpiece" from the master of independent film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who cares if this is a classic? It is still a badly done, silly assed zombie dungheap. We see the walking dead breaking into a house, eating crispie critters out of a truck, breaking into a house, chowing down on more flesh and on and on.... The director couldn't even make up his mind from shot to shot whether it was dark or light outside. But, remember, none of this matters because we are talking independent film here, not the big money boys and their junky mainstream crap. And we are also bowing down to George Romero {who?}, the master of no budget, I mean independent film making. But, hey, if this floats your canoe....go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What were they thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently purchased the DVD version and it was hard to watch. The audio track is maybe a half a second before the video. It was like watching a bad Japanese dubbed film. Did they even bother to watch this before it was released?Reading the notes included with the DVD you can tell how 'important' this movie was to Scott Licina anyway. His words were "I didn't really care what the public thought about what we were doing." Boy, was that obvious!! The soundtrack does not fit, they should have left the original soundtrack at least on the "98 version" that way we would just have the movie remastered, no tampering.The new scenes didn't belong in either. It seemed they just wanted a chance to put their wives, daughters, etc.. into the film. "Daddy, can I be in the reissue of Night of the Living Dead?" "Well... uh. sure! I'll find away to edit you in!!"I'll admit the picture is better, and I might have been easier on the film if the audio and video were synchronized. But with the re-issue of a classic I would have believed they would at least get that right! That really detracted from the film. I feel sorry for those watching it for the first time.It seemed strange Romero wasn't involved in the film. If he was busy, couldn't they have waited until he was available? Isn't this film important enough? It was just a rush for a 30th annivesary edition. If it would have been better, I wouldn't have minded waiting for the 35th edition.Oh well..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just recently watched this movie for the first time on the newly enhanced DVD. I am still trying to figure out how this movie is so highly-regarded. I was never scared or even the least-bit concerned about the characters. I understand that this movie was made for almost nothing but that's still no excuse for a boring story. Save your time and watch a classic Hitchcock</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only fans of the horror genre could tolerate this movie. From a lousy script, bad acting, cornball dialogue, and cheesy affects, this film causes one to want the time back he wasted viewing it. Stupid moments litter the script, from the obvious to downright awkward. To add ultimate insult to the injury, the ending is what ultimately burns this dead horse. If scenes of the dead don't turn one's stomach, it'll be other elements of the production. Though horror films don't tend to have the best performances, this flick is an embarrassment to them all just the same. How gifted director/screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan possibly found "inspiration" from this film is a complete crock. There are better horror movies out there. This flick isn't one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening scenes at the prison and cemetery are horrible. I have never seen such bad acting in my life, it makes the originals acting look good. The new scenes DO NOT blend in together with the originals. The minute those two hicks run away in the car the picture changes to a dark grainy print from the original with Johnny and Barbra stopping at the cemetary. The Elite special edition BLOWS away this prints picture quality. Hinzman does not look anything like he did in the original, this time he looks like he has flower in his hair and walks around like someone kicked him the the groin.After the horrible opening, I am treated with forty minutes of a bad edit of the original with a somewhat dull new music score. The score sucks compared to the creepy stock music from the original and the music is played so loud it is impossible to hear any sound effects. The music sounds like it came right out of Resident Evil. The zombies look and act great but Russo felt the need to always show close ups of that armless zombie Rosie and that zombie family. Everything is bad until the end of the film which ruins the continuity of EVERY zombie movie in the series. After Ben gets shot in the head we are flashed forward a year in time where that bible loving creepy Christian Hicks is being interviewed by some whore. If it was set a year in the future, would that mean that Dawn and Day were never sequels to Night? They were both apocalyptic but this version of Night isn't. I really wish someone would hire a hitman to kill Russo but then again, he has Moshu protecting him...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge horror fan and waited so long to see this film, supposedly one of the best horror films ever made, which was the biggest let down ever. The majority of the characters are pathetic in almost every sense, was I the only person who really just wanted to smack Barbara? The only good part was when the girl Killed her parents, I was rooting for her to dispose of the rest of them. Admitted the film was probably ahead of its time and was a first for many, but like the Exorcist and Blair Witch, why does it scare people? Why did people run from cinemas screaming their heads off, really do some people really have no life?, can't they make the distinction between film and reality?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Scary, TOTAL waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no idea how this film is so highly rated. My only guess is that at the time it was released some 40 years ago it must have made such an impact. Young people then (now old people) must relate to it in such a way that reminds them of their youth and thus they give the movie such a great review. The truth however is this movie is absolutely HORRIBLE and further proof that you can't trust the ratings. Total waste of time. Not scary. Bad acting. Just ridiculous. If you are under the age of 40, skip this piece of garbage. Bad. Bad. Bad. Very bad. And what is with this review thing that makes you enter 10 lines??? IMDb, get with it. This just makes people drone on about non-sense in order to get their review posted. Seriously. Not being negative, just trying to be constructive here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would have been better if all three of the original films were in colour, but this is still a great classic from director George A. Romero. Basically the film starts with Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) visiting a graveyard to place some flowers, and Johnny is trying to scare his sister because of her nervousness in graveyards. Then soon enough a man comes along, and attacks Johnny, but this is no ordinary man, and Barbara doesn't wait around to see him properly. She finds herself hiding in what seems to be an empty house from more of these "creatures", eventually joined by black character (there's one in all of them) Ben (Duane Jones). As they try and board up the house and protect themselves from these things, they find the phones are dead and there is only one radio and television channel being broadcast, all emergency. They also find they are not alone and that there have been people hiding in the basement for ages, these are Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman) with wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman) and sick (from being bitten by one of the creatures) Karen (Kyra Schon) and friends Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). The television and radio broadcasts confirm from many sources that these creatures are recently dead people rising back to life, and most believe this is the cause of a satellite crash which is continuously spreading radiation. They also explain that these creatures have only one instinct, to feed on human flesh, and like the daughter, turns into one of them, and eats her own father, and kills her own mother (both then controversial moments). In the end, all survivors except Ben are either killed by their own doing or by the undead, and all bodies burned on the bonfire by farmers, and Ben is mistakenly shot (another then controversial moment) and also burnt. The film may be old, but it still has the power to shock and maybe sicken audiences, even if the picture quality isn't brilliant, e.g. lighting techniques, but still a good classic horror. The film was number 93 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious and boring to the modern viewer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even for its time, minus the fact it brought zombies to mass media, I really see nothing special about this movie or anything that sets it apart from all the other typical 60's horror movies.If you take away the zombies and put birds in their place, this movie could have been The Birds. If you took out the zombies and birds and replaced it with a psycho, it could have easily been Psycho. And so on . . .That is my main complaint. Yes, this movie brought zombies to the mainstream, and I am insanely thankful for it in that right. I think for that alone it deserves to be remembered for centuries past its time. Besides that, however, nothing about this movie stands on its own two legs. Everything from the sets to the characters to the situation to the camera style was borrowed. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, about this movie can be called even remotely original, even for its time.From a modern view, this movie is pathetic. None of the intensity of zombie video games like Dead Rising or the scares of Resident Evil. None of the coolness of more modern zombie movies like 28 Weeks Later or other newer Romero films.In its time, I'm sure I would have given it at least a 9/10 because it would be the first time I'd have seen zombies on screen. But zombies existed long before the big screen. Now, decades later, I have a hard time figuring out why I even watched it.0/10</fullReview>

The Graveyard Scene SuckedHere's A "Renting This Movie" GuideDon't Waste Money, Other Than lousy Makeup Effects, Nothing Tied Together ' Try Not To Rent It! This Movie All Around Sucks, Just Like The Horrible Plot line. This movie should be destroyed, killed, shot by a tank, and have Draino sprayed in the tape, and the DVD should be broken into microscopic bits and then melted down by a gigantic flamethrower. It was the biggest waste of film in recorded history!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reputation Far Exceeds Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What has all the fuss been about with this movie? Can somebody tell me? This was not scary. It was just stupid, with no-name "fair" actors, at best. The dialog is laughable; the special-effects are too dated to be taken seriously in 2008 (actually, by the 1980s, too). Some films get get reputations early on and all the national critics follow like sheep, giving you the same unwarranted hype about how great a film is, and this "Night Of The Living Dead" is a perfect example of that. A horror movie is supposed to raise a few hairs on the back of your neck, not put you to sleep. These "zombies" look like Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin - maybe that's why it's gotten rave reviews.Trust me, this is a total waste of time.</fullReview>
