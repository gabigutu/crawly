		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but I cannot really summarize my feelings more than to say that I was ready for this to be sort of bad, you know, in a so bad that it's hilariously funny sort of way, but I never knew that a movie could loop its way around again to just plain bad. And just to let you know, this is not the only zombie movie, or "remake" of a zombie movie that I've seen. --I guess I was just spoiled by the leetness of "Dawn of the Dead."This movie IS a "remake" true, but the effects were so ill done, that except for times the actors were using something like a cellphone in a scene, you could have sworn this was made at the same time as the original. Which, seriously is not necessarily THAT bad, but really, come on... The "3D" could have been way more effectively utilized as well. Truly, if you KNOW you are making it 3D, you could do way cooler, and way more terrifying things than, "Ooh look! A Doobie!". *sigh*But the "horrifying" zombies were the absolute least of this thing's problems. Oh yes, I AM speaking of the acting. Let me just first say, I think I lost about one IQ point per minute (maybe second) of watching these people try to act. Now, that's not that I'm saying that I thought this was supposed to be an Oscar worthy film. When I walked in, I knew I wasn't going to be enlightened. But dang! The crappy delivery of the "witty" lines that the script offered was the only thing in the whole movie that was worthy enough to make me gasp in horror. COME ON PEOPLE!! Absolutely everyone watching has fairly low expectations of you and yet you decide your mission in life is to lower them even further?!?! There was not ONE person in the entire cast (including the lead actress) that you could EVER feel for enough to root for THEM against the zombies. I myself, was cheering for the zombies. If they could have eaten everyone in the first 15 minutes, THAT would have been worthwhile.I'm not going to say more because no more is needed. It was bad and that is it.You can hate the review, or agree with everything. I don't truly care. I just wrote this because I needed somewhere to vent. I had already used up my boyfriend, who by the way agrees with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Wanted To Be Hit In The Face With A Shovel After Watching This....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have yet another remake of the zombie classic Night of the Living Dead, this time with the new addition of being in 3-D. In this version, we have Barbara, who likes to be called "Barb" being attacked by zombies when a white BEN saves her by giving one of the zombies a close line. Ben takes Barb back to the Coopers plant farm. Once there we meet the rest of the victims, as zombies begin to attack the home.If I hadn't won free tickets to see this film, I probably would never have given it a chance. Aside of it being in 3-D it doesn't really have anything else going for it. Upon first glance it would seem to be a direct to video, armature film student remake of the classic Romero film and that is exactly what the film comes off as. The only thing that made this film slightly enjoyable would be that it was fun to make fun of it. I couldn't tell if the film took itself seriously or not because there were a lot of times when the film was just so bad, that the filmmakers had to of known the cheese factor was through the roof. The thing that rules against this is that there isn't enough comedy in it for it to be considered a cheesy "B" movie.The horror fans will notice Sid Haig is the one throwing his shovel around hitting the zombies in the face. He delivers an over the top performance, but then again when does he not? If it weren't for his goofy delivery in his lines the film would be rated even lower. The rest of the cast can be completely forgotten because none of them seem to care for what they are doing. Everyone is one-dimensional and half seem to have never been to acting school. There was no conflict between any of the characters that lasted more then one minute. Once there was some conflict it was solved mere seconds later. "I'm going outside!!!", "No you're not!!!", "Okay". Even the zombies didn't act like real zombies, I swear some of them were walking slowly like in the classics and others were as fast as hell, much like those in the remake of Dawn.The gore in here is lacking as well. Only two scenes showcase any real gore, first is when a zombie is dragging itself to go after the little kid, he has no legs. The second is when Haig thrusts his shovel into a zombies face, it goes through his mouth and he sticks to the wall. The zombie effects were satisfactory for the most part.I cringe every time I think about the dialogue, which throws in awkward pop culture references that shouldn't really be there...Scarface for example. Whenever I laughed in the film it wasn't with it, it was at it and most the time it was because of these horrible dialogue. More then 75 percent of the dialogue was unintentional humor.The 3-D was painful, plain and simple. For some reason we're still stuck in the old days of red and blue 3-D glasses for this film. It took so much away from the experience. The red was very distracting and was all over in this film. I had to take the glasses off on five separate occasions because my eyes just couldn't handle it. They could have used the 3-D to their advantage, but dropped the ball here. Only a handful of things really "come at you", which include a bullet, shovel, glass and zombie hands. Nothing to really make the film more enjoyable, although I did get a kick out of the things that actually did come at me from the screen.For some strange reason the makers of the film felt like they had to put in the original film, for what purpose I still have no idea. We know this is a remake of that film, is it ironic, or comedic in a way? No, it's just pointless and incoherent. They watch the zombie flick and know that these things attacking them are zombies, yet when one gets bitten no one seems to care or even know that he will turn into one. Did they just happen to forget that big plot device from the film that they were just watching? Don't even get me started on the continuity because this can rival the Evil Dead films.Bottom line is that the 3-D isn't worth your time or money. You'll leave the theatre with a headache, from the glasses and the trash that's on the screen. I wouldn't even recommend this for hardcore horror fans, is just an insult. It doesn't look to good for zombie fans after this film hits theatres, or even when the remake of DAY does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a pale imitation of George Romero's original. Giving characters the same names isn't enough, pitting characters against zombies isn't enough. The 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead was outstanding, while this one fails almost completely on every level. Remember Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho and Roland Emmerich's remake of Godzilla? This turd is somewhere in between, trying to step in the footsteps of greatness, but, like a zombie, exhibiting no life of its own. This zombie movie is simply, well, dead.I suggest you go rent the original Night of the Living Dead, or either version of Dawn of the Dead, or Return of the Living Dead or 28 Days Later. These are the zombie movies that will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is truly an insult to George Romero. The acting and the zombie effect were barely above normal but the story is so weak. It's essentially a zombie movie taking place in a pot farm. The pot humors aren't funny at all and they never ever gotten around to barricading the windows.Yes, they added nudity but was that remotely necessary?The ending was also very weak with Barb just standing there even though she was holding a gun and could have run. They had a perfectly good movie from which to base this movie on and they still managed to botch it up. I really do wonder about all these direct-to-DVD horror movies that have no reasons for being made and can only trick people into buying because there are no reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies suck and others suck the life out of the fabric of the universe -- the latter is true for Night of the Living Dead 3D. High school talent show level acting, oatmeal face makeup, and dialog written in crayola on construction paper, NOTLD 3D has everything except for charm, wit, or that occasional saving grace of 'B' film, unintentional humor. Look! It's bad acting in 3-Dimensions, rather than the plain ole two we mere mortals are stuck with until the holo-projectors show up in the cineplex.On a scale of one to ten, -200 would seem a fair score, but I feel IMDb needs a more quantitative rating system for films that defy rating - The Gigli Scale. The higher a film rates on the Gigli Scale, the more soul-sucking, time and space fabric ripping it is. While only Gigli currently scores a perfect ten on the Gigli Scale, Night of the Living Dead 3D certainly is a worthy contender to dethroning the current world champion of suck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Offend a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barb (Brianna Brown) and her brother Johnny (Ken Ward) travel to the country for the funeral services of their aunt, but they arrive late and drive direct to the cemetery. They see the location empty, but sooner they are attacked by zombies. Johnny escapes in his car leaving Barb alone, but she is rescued by the drug dealer and college student Ben (Joshua DesRoches). He drives his motorcycle to the Cooper farm, and the patriarch Henry Cooper (Greg Travis) does not give credit to Barb. When the farmhouse is under siege of a group of flesh-eaters zombies, the local mortician Gerald Tovar Jr. (Sid Haig) arrives and tells a scary story about the origin of the zombies.I do not like remakes, but every now and then I see good ones. I bought this "previously-seen" DVD in a rental expecting to watch a good remake of the George Romero's greatest classic. My first deception was in the beginning of the movie, indicating that it would be necessary a pair of glasses to see in 3D that was not delivered with the DVD. After watching this movie, I realized that it is an offense to the original "Night of the Living Dead". The insulting story is absolutely stupid, with terrible dialogs, unnecessary nudity and a ridiculous conclusion; the direction is awful, with an inadequate pace associated to some weak performances. When the group is trapped in the farmhouse, most of the windows have glasses, and the group never protects with wood or wardrobes or whatever. In the end, better off watching the classic again, and I do not know how George Romero could authorize the release of this crap using his name and the original idea. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "A Noite dos Mortos Vivos 3D" ("The Night of the Living Dead 3D")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is utter and complete garbage from start to finish and goes absolutely no where in the 80 minutes that it runs. I thought it could be good despite the fact that it is a remake. I like Sid Haig a lot and the 3D idea sounded fairly good. I was totally wrong and am now hitting myself for watching this catastrophe. It's so bad that it plays out like an Uwe Boll film.I think the producers realized that they had a crap script so they tried to save it by making the film 3D. The 3D does absolutely nothing for this film. The story is ridiculous and goes no where, The acting is miserable with the exception of Sid Haig, and there wasn't even one memorable scene in the entire film. The only reason it doesn't get a 1/10 is because of Sid Haig.Don't see this movie. It's not worth your time or your attention. If you've blind bought it, do yourself a favor and throw it away without watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GENERAL COMMENTS: The original Night Of The Living Dead had blatantly amateurish acting yet the film worked in spite of it. This remake has truly incompetent, amateurish acting and doesn't work because everything else about the film is also incompetent. The direction is static, basically place a camera in position and film some idiots talking. The writing is absolutely atrocious and makes you squirm, like watching a grade school play where you feel bad for everyone involved. The zombie makeup is truly amateurish as well and the zombies are the kind that you could run around and tickle. This piece of rubbish rivals the Uwe Bolle films for sheer incompetence. RECOMMENDATION: No. Avoid at all costs.ACTING: amateurish SCRIPT: terrible dialog VISUAL: rubber suit zombies SIMILAR FILMS: Night of the Living Dead</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I am a huge Romero and horror fan, I saw this movie pretty impulsively and without giving it much thought. I watched the trailer a few days prior and thought that it looked like your typical direct to video, shot on video, low budget whatever movie and left it at that. The fact that it had Sid Haig in it, or that it was 3D, were if anything just deterrents. I had no idea it was theatrical, so when I saw it was actually playing down the street in about 30 minutes me and my friend said what the heck. I'm not necessarily opposed to remakes as savagely as many other horror fans are (I liked savini's notld remake and I thought the dotd remake was fun enough, not to mention house of wax and hills have eyes) so I went in neutral.that said, Night of the Living Dead 3D is a competent enough and, thankfully, relatively straight horror film that I personally thought was enjoyable. this is a quiet, reserved zombie movie vs a balls to the walls gorefest or whatever that many people might expect going in, but don't let that deter you - if anything, it just means the filmmakers are more interested in characters, story and atmosphere than a couple of cheap shots (although their is some slightly distasteful nudity...which I am fine with).a lot of other people have cited the acting and dialogue in the film as terrible, but I thought everyone was serviceable in their roles and the writing completely respectable. I can't say any of the actors are real standouts, but I sympathized with the characters and cared about what was going on. Sid Haig does the typical Sid Haig thing which I find borders on self parody a little bit too much, but I thought his "zombie explanation monologue" was awesome.I thought the zombies and makeup effects were top notch - more of the return of the living dead/EC comics style zombie look than the more modern, KNB effects version, which I personally think looks hokey. to clarify, these zombies DO NOT RUN!!! they lumber around and groan and moan and are pretty classy numbers. I liked the overall l Gothic look of the film - everything is cold and dark and desaturated, and there's always plenty of fog rolling around everywhere. what else do you want? bats? I guess they could have thrown some in there.the 3D in the movie is, ironically enough, the films weakest link. there's just no reason for it. the filmmakers try their best to include some 3D gags, but you can tell its mostly just going through the motions and to satisfy the title. I'm hoping when this is released on DVD there will be a non-3D version because the movie plays much better without it. red and blue 3D technology is outdated anyway. even captain EO used polarized lenses.in conclusion, check Night of the Living Dead 3D out, but go into the theater without any expectations, and stop being so damn cynical too! it's clear these guys were just trying to homage one of their favorite horror movies and make something the fans would enjoy. the movie doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's solid enough and worth a gander.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is terrible! The few good things about it are the tits, Sid Haig, and maybe the special effects. Everything else sucks!!!! So yeah I'm suppose to fill this comment box with ten lines to have it posted. But the problem is I pretty much summed up the movie in twenty two words or two lines. So the 8 lines remaining is just a bunch of jibber jabber. One part in the movie which I found stupid as f%$# is when Ben comes to the rescue on his bike. The way he punched the zombie was sooooooo stupid! If I had a spoon handy I would have dug my eyeballs out!!!! I also found another screw up that wasn't posted on IMDb. The scene where Sid Haig's character enters the house and cooper (who had been bitten earlier on the neck, and had a bandage on it) is standing there with no bandage on his neck, the next scene he has the bandage on his neck again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't care if it's a remake. It's horrible on it's own...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second remake of George Romero's classic. Zombies, small group of people banding together in a house, etc.This time, we're given an explanation to the outbreak. Aside from some pretty good zombie makeup, this explanation was the ONLY decent part of this movie. It was a fairly decent back story, but a lot of fans really don't want that.So now that I've gotten the two positives out of the way, onto the long list of feces this movie dumps all over it's viewer.For one thing, the characters are shown watching "Night of the Living Dead" multiple times, then relating the events going on to the events in the film. ...This is a ridiculous way to do a remake. It's fine in a PARODY sequel like "Return of the Living Dead", but not in a remake. In addition to this, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND ZOMBIES! They JUST watched "Night of the Living Dead", yet they don't understand that you need to hit them in the head to put them down? They also don't shoot their buddy when he gets bitten. They don't seem to worry about him too much.The famous "They're coming to get you Barbera" line, (which I totally want on a t-shirt), has been modernized by showing up in a text message... I didn't find this funny... just irritating... especially since it's written in text abbreviations. I just thought it was dumb.You may be thinking what I thought going into this film... "How bad can it be? I hear it's terrible... but it's in 3D!!! Zombies and gore reaching out of the screen. Even if it sucks, how could this not be a fun viewing?" Well I assure you, it succeeded in being completely unenjoyable despite it's possible advantages. The 3D is very poorly done, utilizing the old school red and blue, (which annoys me very quickly in itself). There were also very few 3D gags and the few that were there were pretty lame.We had a gratuitous nude scene that made the film feel immature. I can't even describe how stupid the scene was... She runs away completely naked, gets into a car to protect herself, while the guy, (in his boxers), runs over to the car and starts trying to pull zombies away from it with his bare hands. The idiot actually doesn't die for a good 30 seconds. Then the dumb chick in the car is apparently too stupid to lock the doors, as the zombies keep opening them while she makes a frantic attempt to keep them shut. The overall scene was just so painfully stupid.But what of gore? It's a zombie film, so surely there's some good, gruesome eye candy that makes the film mildly entertaining? Nope. Very, VERY little effort is put into the violence. We see one gun wound, one burning body, a tire iron that was discreetly impaled through a guy without him noticing (???), and one zombie that's been stabbed in the mouth by a shovel. (We don't actually see the shovel nail him, but we see him standing there with the indented shovel against his mouth.) That's IT. I recall thinking the gore in this film could EASILY be topped by a school play. There was absolutely NO effort behind the violence. That says something about makers of a horror film... something very bad. Throw down some devotion, guys. Come on. Making a good film is one thing, but making an ENTERTAINING film really isn't that hard.Another thing that REALLY made me angry was a scene in which a man gives another man a gun and asks, "You know how to use that?" The other guy replies, "Of course; I grew up on video games." while he loads the gun knowing every single detail on how to operate it. This supports the idea of violent media training kids how to kill. What kind of horror film maker supports this idea? It goes against the horror genre itself. It was insulting and ignorant. Absolutely ridiculous.To top it off, the acting was terrible and most of the music was very bland.Lame directing, stupid story decisions, bad acting, terrible 3D editing with few 3D gags, lame music, and next to NO EFFORT towards any violence. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. If you're like me, you'll want to check it out anyway, but do yourself a favor and rent it first. Don't throw away the $20 I did. I can't believe how terrible this was.I'd give this a zero if I could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw John Russo's raping of Night of the Living dead, laughingly released as the 30th Anniversary edition, I sat back, shook my head, took the VHS out of my machine and tossed it in a corner thinking, "No one can possibly screw up what is a classic film ever again." Wow, was I wrong. I saw this horrendous abortion of a film in 2-D, since it was released to a movie theater within 500 miles of where I live. Luckily for any theater, since I would certainly have demanded my money back. This was a horrid, terrible, stupid movie. How can anyone sit around and go "Yeah, we made a winner here." This, along with Dawn of the Dead 2: Contagium and Day of the Dead (2008), should all be taken, piled up and burned, the better that no one ever remembers them ever. They should be erased from the collective memory of humanity, yes they are that bad. Acting, bad. Story (Laughable) Bad. SFX. Bad. Even the momentary nudity from an obviously enhanced woman was bad. Just do yourself a favor. Watch the original or the 1990 remake and avoid all this garbage. Your brain will thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor cash-in on a true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This pointless rehash of the Romero classic sees the original story retold as a modern-day Z-grade effort, replete with amateur night acting and Halloween masks. Yes, it really is that bad, and the biggest surprise is that cash-in king John Russo ? a guy who's made an entire career from the fact that he wrote and produced the 1968 film - is nowhere to be seen.The story diverges little from the original, except to introduce an extra, extraneous character ? played by B-movie stalwart Sid Haig. The zombies are so ineffectual here and the gore so tame that two things happen: first, an extra villain is introduced to little end, and secondly, their origin has to be explained in depth. Both take away from the eerie impact of the Romero original, where the horror came from the fact that the world ended abruptly with the 'what if?' scenario of zombies arriving at your door.The film's hook is the 3D, but anyone going in looking for guts and entrails flying out of the screen (a la the MY BLOODY VALENTINE remake and the latter FINAL DESTINATION movies) will be disappointed. A 3D spliff and subsequent smoke ring are all you're going to get (way to take advantage of the technology, huh?). Speaking of spliffs, the awful dialogue is loaded with stoner jokes and a far cry from the terse exchanges we all remember from Romero's classic.The acting is terrible, aside from Haig, an actor who always seems to be enjoying himself (complete with ghoulish chuckle) in his recent B-movie outings. The story is so slim that at one stage we take a softcore detour to the barn, where a sex scene between two unappealing characters plays out in all its nude detail. Incredibly, the end result is a film that feels more dated and less grisly than the film that inspired it, made all those years ago; making me appreciate Romero all the more is the only thing this movie does right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ill make this short, no reason to go on and on about how bad this movie is because anyone that has heard about it has probably heard all the same things.So basically this movie was horrible, the only reason i watched the whole thing was because sid haig had a role and it was 3D, yup, thats it. Sid haig has done great work and continues to and i felt i owed it to him to watch this piece of crap regardless of how bored and disinterested i was.The 3D in this movie is only JUST 3D, it had that cheesy 80s attempt at 3D that was cool back in the day but come on, 2006, we have better ways now. The red was bleeding out all over the screen and not in a good way. If that red had been from the zombies or victims, then the gore level of this film would have at least reached satisfactory, but no...the makeup, effects and gore were just so low budget and poor that i actually thought maybe this was supposed to be an ironic type of zombie movie.The acting was sub-par at best, the characters put no real emotion towards their dialogue or actions, it felt like they didn't even care that there was a horde of flesh eating undead trying to rip there skin from bone. "Oh no, ah, its a zombie, im going to feebly try and get away but not really because i just don't care, ahhh...". The only character that brought any kind of entertaining dialogue was sid haigs' character (of course, he always delivers great screen play) but even THAT was not enough to keep me attentive.To me, the scariest thing in the world is the thought of our family and friends returning from the undead to chew our brains out thru our skulls, but i could not get into the story at all or imagine these lumbering, lethargic corpses to be true zombies, they had every opportunity to eat the characters, hell, sid haigs character has his arm up in one zombies face and the thing is just moaning and shuffling around, not even snapping its teeth at him. A zombies main goal is to feed, thats it, it is going to have so much gumption and determination to eat you that its not going to stop for anything short of having its skull caved in. But these "zombies" stop coming with a (what i considered) a very poor and staged looking clothesline (from the college kid on the bike in the beginning) if that had been a real zombie (or any zombie from any other respectable horror film) it would have grabbed that suckers arm and ripped it off like a chicken wing.OK, so not so short, im sorry but im sure you were more disappointed in this movie than finding out i went on for quite a while, at least this was more entertaining right? I don't care if you hate my review or agree with it, i just had to get my disappointment vented out there somewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With acting at or below the level of the worst late night Cinemax movies, dialogue as believable as Pam Anderson's trademarks ("When the dead walk, ya gotta call the cops!"), and direction that pales in comparison to even Uwe Boll, Night of the Living Dead 3D might be in the running for one of my least favourite films of all time.There is absolutely nothing redeeming with this movie. Nothing at all. You'd think that as the film progressed, there would be at least SOME glimmer of hope for us viewers, but no. It just got worse and worse, like Sid Haig's career. The filmmakers didn't even throw us any relief other than one naked blonde with a dumpy body and gore as revolting or terrifying as a fluffy teddy bear. Luckily, there were at least a couple of laughs. Unfortunately, it was at the film's expense. . . not actually humour.Cell phones! What's that you say? No one had a cell phone in this day &amp; age? Well, apparently the idiot owner of the house is convinced that they'll give you cancer. And something about Bin Laden I didn't really catch. His house, his rules. . . But, correct me if I'm wrong. . . wasn't Barbra texting her brother about twenty minutes ago? Did I miss her dropping it? Or a zombie eating it? Another thing I don't really understand. . . before Barbra got there, they were watching Night of the Living Dead (the original). . . Isn't it odd that NO ONE would take any advice from the film when the zombies starting attacking their farmhouse? "Let me unload a clip into this zombie's chest, then stare at it when it doesn't die." C'mon, man! Get with the program! Another great piece of dialogue: "Don't worry, if I'm going to shoot him, I'll shoot him in his *beep* foot." Now. . . if you're trying to threaten someone's life at gunpoint and they're in earshot, you probably shouldn't say you're not ACTUALLY going to kill them, right? Not with Mr. Slicked-Back-Hair.Anyway, to sum, avoid this film. Really. It was made at the expense of an error which negatively impacts the greatest horror director of all time, George A. Romero. The low level of quality isn't even worthy of 'funny B-movie status'. . . it's just. . . bad.Final Verdict: 1/10.-AP3-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this at the World 3-D Film Expo and wasn't overly taken with this re-imagining of the original. If it weren't for the use of the 3-D and CGI this would be headed straight to the bargain DVD section of your local Walmart.I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. It had lots going for it. A sold-out premier in high definition 3-D using the polarized glasses instead of the inferior red/blue glasses. They used special cameras as well as stedicam in shooting the entire movie. So, it looked as good as it was going to get.But...geeking out is just not enough to carry an entire movie...The script was clunky with some odd use of dated language mixed with present day dialog. A couple mis-castings didn't help matters much either.And, it just wasn't creepy or scary...at all...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was basically unwatchable (I was rooting for it to just END towards the end of the movie), and I found it to be personally offensive that they would try to ruin a classic movie like "Night of the Living Dead" by "re-imagining" it in this crappy way. The ending of the movie was just a pile of baloney IMO.The film starts out promising, with some clever nods to the original movie in the first couple of scenes, but it goes waaaaay downhill after that. There are so many plot holes in this flick that I can't even count them. Basically, I think they were hoping that just having Sid Haig in a very few scenes could carry the movie, but they failed miserably. The acting is God-awful &amp; unimaginative. There are many scenes in this movie that do nothing to move the "plot" along.Some of the creature effects are pretty cool, but the other "special" effects are amateurish at best. I didn't watch the movie in "3D", but I don't think that I missed anything. I also paid zero dollars to see this piece of trash, and I still feel like I deserve a refund!</fullReview>

I thought it was gonna get a theatrical release. But I was wrong only a limited theatrical release. But on with my review. I finally saw this movie on demand and I thought it was horrible. I should have listened to all the fans who said this movie sucked. The acting was bad. No really I've seen better acting in a porn movie then this! And the special effects were god awful! No really I've seen better special effects in a home movie filmed by a 2 year old! I mean the special effects looked so fake! I was highly let down. And it hardly remakes the original! So whats the point to remake it then? the dialogue was unbelievably cheesy! No really I've heard better dialogue from a drunk guy then from this movie! This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What were you thinking Sid Haig? Why were you in this god awful mess of a movie?! This movie is just as bad as Halloween 3: Season of the witch and the sinfully bad Jaws: The Revenge!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What we have here isn't the original 1968 Night of the Living Dead re-released in 3D. It's a remake following the same script (mostly) only this time out it's a horror-comedy. In 3D. Couple of things about that. First off, it isn't 3D. Sure, there are shots of vomit or bullets coming at the camera using cheap CGI effects (think Babylon 5) but that doesn't make it 3D. Nextly, the comedy. There is only one joke in this film and it gets worked harder then a 10 year old in a Macao soccer ball factory. Check it out, the original Night of the Living Dead is playing on a television in the film and the characters constantly point out how their situation is 'Like we're in a zombie movie'. Funny stuff...very original. The bad acting and mugging to the camera robs the film of any real suspense and the claustrophobic tension of the original. The final problem with the horror aspect is the producers decided to cheap out on the zombie make up. Instead of prosthetic appliances being attached directly to the actors skin they used discount masks. The result is, well, trick or treaters in dirty clothes. Romero has made a career off one idea and some of his Dead films have been pretty lame, Land of the Dead comes to mind, but none of them are as awful as this piece of sh--, you get the idea. Skip this, read a book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crap from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off: I like zombie movies, I really do. I like them that much that I rent zombie movies which are almost definitely bad.That said, I simply had to rent this. Only when I started the movie I noticed that this was NOTLD 3D, as it was just labeled "Night of the living dead" here. Even though the notion of "3D" implicated that this one would be a pretty awful remake, I simply wasn't prepared for this. It's pretty damn courageous to begin and end your film with the the opening scene of the original and also have the original running on TV during the movie when the remake is such a pile of garbage. From terrible acting over just plain awful special effects and missing wounds, everything here. The worst thing though is that the script only bears a slight resemblance of the original's story. True, it begins at a graveyard. True, at some point in the movie some guys are trapped in a house. The names of the main characters are the same. That's it. All the other things that were good about the original (and even about the first remake) are gone and replaced by a completely generic "horror" story, centered around Sid Haig. There is no reason why this movie should be called "Night of the living dead". It has nothing to do with NOTLD... well, about as much as any other zombie movie has.Problem is: Even most really, really low-budget zombie movies I've seen were far more enjoyable than this one. Simply stay away from this one. And if you're like me and simply can't stay away from it, don't say you hadn't been warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 3Ds of Carlos Mencia...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his standup routine (as opposed to his sitting or horizontal routines), comedian Carlos Mencia has a term for people he has deemed idiots (for whatever usually valid reason): he calls them the DDDs (pronounced "DeeDeeDees"). That's three Ds. Like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 3D. Ds. I was convinced, when I saw CHILDREN OF THE LIVING DEAD, that we'd seen the last of the inept, inbred "spawn" of the genuine classic, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Boy, was I wrong. Not only wasn't this one "three-dimensional," no matter how much we tinkered with our television settings, but it was so lame storywise that the characters themselves came across as one-dimensional. (Which is a shame, really, because some of these folks seemed to have some genuine talent.) Direction? There was none to speak of. It's because of movies like this that "horror" has such a bad reputation. If the filmmakers themselves aren't capable of telling even this simple (and familiar) a story, then they ought to learn a trade; the world has need of good tradesmen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably one of the dumbest zombie rip offs relying only on a good a title,poor 3D and the current trend to stick Sid Haig in just about anything.Forget about the head blasting and gut munching that made the Romero films so memorable this flick has got "hack" written all over it in almost every way. It's very slow,the dialogue is groaners-ville, there's barely any suspense or nudity and the audience I saw it with at the premiere didn't scream or jump once. The 3d doesn't hurt your eyes or over lap ( I saw the full color polarized version)but it doesn't really float out over your head the way Friday The 13th 3D did.Even Jaws 3D is a better film than that and that was smoked turkey deluxe.Haig is kinda funny but he's only in it for about fifteen minutes.Watch Shaun Of THe Dead instead. That's got more depth even in 2D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dead have risen in a small town and group of people take refuge in a farmhouse weed farm.With the original film never properly copyrighted and in the public domain director Jeff Broadstreet wastes no time in trying to cash-in with a 3D re-imagining. This is best viewed in 2D as the 3D shots are gimmicky and are few and far between. The 1968 original appears on TVs scattered across the movie reminding you how superior it is to Broadstreet's offering. The opening is quite interesting following to the tropes of the original (the "Coming to get you, Barbara" line absurdly phoned in via text message). It has a bit of atmosphere but over all its all tongue and cheek stuff, suffering from a TV feel and low budget production values. It's on par with its 2012 follow up Night of the Living Dead 3D: Re-Animation but not a touch on Tom Savini's superb Night of the Living Dead (1990).Horror character actor Sid Haig appears but even with its short running time and Brianna Brown, Johanna Black and Cristin Michele it's still totally forgettable.</fullReview>

It's that simple, so don't question why Ving Rhames does Zombie Apocalypse 2012, and don't question why the great Sid Haig is in this crap-fest.Now, on to the real issue. Theft. Another filmmaker totally devoid of integrity, discovers the so-called public domain status (which myself and others whole-heartedly refute)of Night of the Living Dead and he gets a brainstorm,..oh donkey dung, did I say brainstorm?? I meant he has a brain-Fart!!! Night of the Living dead belongs to the people who created it. Someone claiming to be an artist and then stealing from other artists is disgusting. It's an outright Us VS.Them situation. And Jeff Broadstreet you have defined yourself as one of them. You make me sick.Fans and supporters of the real Night of the Living Dead...Boycott this Garbage.

		<shortDescription>Not even as good as the 1990 remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my personal opinion, George Romero's original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968) is one of the five best horror movies ever created, so any film that attempts to remake it has its work cut out for it. And yes, I'm one of those die hard horror fans who believe that remakes should be held up to the high standards of the original film. After all, why even make them in the first place if there's no real way to improve on the first? Are certain filmmakers arrogant enough to actually think they can do a better job? Do they feel modern special effects technology will somehow improve it? Do they feel hiring every other person frequently employed by the CW network will improve it? Or do they want to lazily and cheaply cash in on a name made bankable by another person? In the case of this film, I lean toward the latter. Either way, NOTLD '06 fails to justify its existence since it brings absolutely nothing new to the table. One could argue the 3D effects justify it, but it's not even the first zombie film shot in 3D and many people who watch it won't have 3D glasses on hand anyway, so that theory doesn't really cut it with me. Even though I'm not even a huge fan of Tom Savini's 1990 remake (which also pales in comparison to the first film), I can still recognize it as a decent and fairly well made zombie film. This second remake is a further step down in quality. While usually teetering on average much of the time, it never once musters up any genuine tension, suspense, atmosphere or horror. The political/social subtext is now gone, the acting is very uneven, it's full of lame attempts at humor, the dialogue is mostly awful and the changes made to the original storyline are neither inventive or interesting. So what's different between this one and the original? Of course, it's in color. Of course, the zombie make-up is more elaborate. Ben is now a white, motorcycle-riding college student with perfectly groomed hair throughout. Barbara doesn't go crazy and is actually kind of a bitch. The Coopers are friendly backwoods pot harvesters with an adopted daughter. Judy and Tom are limited to a barn sex scene and she runs around outside naked to provide some customary nudity. There's also a pothead handyman who I think is supposed to be funny. The fog machine never stops. There's also a subplot here involving a mortician (played by Sid Haig) who is responsible for the zombie outbreak. Even though much has actually been changed, this material still isn't anything new and the whole thing is by-the-numbers, predictable and forgettable. Then again, I suppose those who don't hold the Romero film in such high regard might find it all brainlessly entertaining. It just didn't do much for me. I've seen it all done - and done much better - many times before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a long time since I've seen the original version of "Night of the Living Dead", so some details of it are fuzzy in my mind. But I can remember enough of it to know it was a lot better than this remake. Even the equally ill-advised 1990 remake was a lot better than this second remake! Everything goes wrong this time around. It's a pretty cheap- looking enterprise for one thing, with ugly photography that 3D probably didn't help during the brief time the movie was in theaters. The characters are extremely unlikable, with most of them stoners or drug dealers, and ALL of them being extremely stupid. The script also has a number of plot holes and other flaws, like the fact that the fate of a couple of characters is never revealed. But the biggest flaw is that the movie is not the least bit scary. The original movie slowly built and held a level of terror, while there's almost a casual feeling here. Even fans of Sid Haig would best avoid this feebleness.</fullReview>

The acting (who told Sid Haig he could act, cause he can't and he's the best actor in this) is simply atrocious. The story barely exists. The attempt at explaining the zombies is pathetic. I'm not sure those are spoilers, but I'm being careful here. The comedy elements are barely funny in fact only the opening titles show any imagination whatsoever.

Plus a good remake of this already exists , which Tom Savini did an excellent job making in my opinion . One of this remake 's finer points is they did 'nt just reshoot the original story. However the story they cooked up is pretty lame , as are most of the characters. On the positive tip, Sid Haig was cool and the blonde babe with the big boobs, did a good job as Barb in addition to looking great . That is unfortunately the only good points of the film . Most of the other actors suck and what we have here are the lamest looking zombies I've seen in a long, long time . The f/x blow pretty much as bad as every other aspect of the movie. This crapfest offers little in either drama or entertainment , or originality . Overall a waste of time and money .

Beyond that, however, this movie descended into a slow paced, poorly acted travesty that brought to mind the terrible experience of watching Day of the Dead 2. The scene where the old zombie guy gets lit on fire in his chair was PAINFUL to watch - it was like an awkward and bumbling outtake from a high school drama class! How about directing the guy to react - do anything while his father is burning! And this is only one of the grueling scenes I forced myself to endure in order to get to the end of this movie.It would seem that the living dead have been dealt yet another insulting hand in the tradition of Day of the Dead 2. The original 1968 version is still your best bet, along with the 1990 remake (which I thought was awesome).Avoid.</fullReview>

I gave it a 1 out of 10 because this movie has no good qualities, bad makeup, no gore, and bad acting equals a dumb and pointless horror film. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even the hardcore zombie fans like me because if you watch this, then you will most definitely want your money back, I know I do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This time in 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two remakes for the same film, each watering down the elements that made the original a master piece for a cheap knockoff.The original night of the living dead even plays on screen at certain points in the film to show how far along we are in each and adds humor by making a potheads believe a curse is upon them for watching this flick. I kid you not.Todd Farmer being the one dimensional character he portrayed as everyone else decided to do his own version and did nothing to improve on the other two in anyway.Bland atmosphere, dumb characters, an implausible reason for the dead to rise and an anticlimactic ending that doesn't leave any impact or make you think. Zoey sneaking out of the house to ease drop only to get attacked and the new Tom &amp; Judy trying to drive away only to hit the has exploding when they easily could've avoided It.It doesn't follow any rhyme or reason like the characters having the same names from the movie, Johnny texting I'm coming to get you Barbara as a zombie or how the undertaker was able to keep his creations understand for so long.Even the special effects looks much worse with the zombies looking like regular humans with rabies.If you hadn't heard of it before there's a reason for that. It belongs buried in the five dollar bin at Wal- Mart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting re-imagined, modernized take on a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version really surprised me. I am a bit late to the game and only heard about this version like, yesterday. The character names remain familiar, however their personalities and actions became modernized to relate to a modern audience. Loosely following the story line of the classic, George Romero had his hand in the screen writing for this version. A couple of new characters not in the original version are thrown into the mix, creating an interesting twist to the climax of the plot. Haunting in itself as there are points where the classic version is playing on miscellaneous television screens in different locations. This version is different enough that it is engaging and not just another spit up failed attempt at being a copycat. I give this movie an 8 out of 10 due to the fact that the story did pull me in, being different enough, but keeping the integrity of the original story line from the 60's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but better than given credit for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so this is pretty bad (it is a fairly low budget zombie flick), but I think its a lot better than its given credit for. There are a few honesty clever lines, such as "Maybe we're being punked" lol, cute. The silly little plays on Mary Jane/drug culture are decent little inside jokes. Also, I liked the fact that they actually commented on the smell of the corpses, cuz in reality long decayed corpses would be so ripe as to induce immediate vomiting upon nasal contact. The explanation for the outbreak is actually pretty decent and funny, I like the purposeful play on the fast/slow zombie controversy. On the idiotic side, they were just watching the original "Night of the Living Dead", and yet they didn't think about the bite infecting them or the whole you have to hit them in the head thing. On a side note , the Left Behind books, puuuuuuuke x.x The serious stuff is pretty da*n sappy, and come on people, a matrix-style bullet for no reason? You really shoulda put that money into some decent gore, it leaves a bit to be desired. The ending is just plain stupid. Still, it could have been a lot lot worse. I definitely thought it was worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only one thing might save this movie - a less important, but nevertheless lacking feature in other remakes of this classic theme - which is a relatively credible background of why and how zombies became zombies. All the other stuff: acting of both living/dead, script and continuity is so full of potholes even a mindless zombie would be crying his/her (rotting) heart out over the final product. Events are too predictable, save for the key role of the undertaker (played by Mr Sid Haig) that even steals some humor into the action. The end credits make me smile too, but alas, they'd come too late to get me feel I spent these 70 minutes of my life worthly to remember - so, try to avoid it and better re-watch the classic and Romero versions instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barb and her brother Johnny arrive late for the burial of their aunt -- and walk straight into a nightmare,with zombies... Barb flees the cemetery and is rescued by Ben, a local college student. The two seek refuge in the nearby farmhouse, where the laid-back residents aren't remotely prepared to have their lives turn into a nightmare.....It's only an hour and fifteen minutes long and Sid Haig is int, so I thought to myself 'why not?'. Its short and it would be funny to spot where all the 3D should have been.It starts off okay, we have references to the original Romero version, and the zombie action kicks off almost instantly. And then there more references to the original, by way of showing the original on TVs scattered across the movie, and this continues throughout..The film soon becomes tiresome, very quickly. We get the usual trope characters, nudity for no good reason, and really poor performances.Even the 3D parts are pointless, as there are hardly any in the movie. One saving grace is that I didn't see it in 3D, that would have been the iceberg on the proverbial cake.Of all the Romero remakes and sequels, Day of The Dead 2009, and Survival of the Dead included, this has to be the worse one I've ever seen.Really pointless, and a waste of time, even at this short length.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOTLD 3-D - Dumb Desecration for Dollars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This follows the original NOTLD with a few twists. Barb (Brianna Brown) and Johnny are heading up to a funeral when they encounter zombies. Barb escapes and makes it to a mortuary run by Gerald Tovar (Sid Haig), who is trying to deal with the problem. Barb runs to the woods, is attacked again and then rescued by Ben (white boy Joshua DesRoches). Ben takes Barb to the Cooper family farm where the family is - hold onto your head - watching NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD on TV! Henry Cooper doesn't believe Barb's story and won't call the cops because...wait for it...he is a pot farmer! Of course, the zombies then show up and all hell breaks loose.I've seen enough NOTLD inspired junk (Russo's 30th Anniversary re-edit, CHILDREN OF THE LIVING DEAD) that this actually didn't seem halfbad. Don't get me wrong, it's bad but not as bad as the others. The stuff director Jeff Broadstreet (of SEXBOMB infamy) and screenwriter Robert Valding add to Romero's original are downright bizarre. Why are the Cooper's pot dealers? Why is Ben white? Why must the Tom and Judy characters battle zombies in the nude? They also make this event an isolated incident. It seems it is all the fault of mortician Sid Haig as his refusal to cremate bodies and medical waste led to the two combining to re-animate the dead. He is just trying to keep the situation under control.The 3-D must have been cheap (I saw the 2D version) as they don't do anything too exciting (the swooshing opening title or a cheap bullet time moment were probably the highlights). Believe it or not, this actually made it into theaters last fall for a few weeks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is more of an homage than a remake. The use of the NOTLD title opens up a world of negative reviews and comparisons to Romero's work. Perhaps the filmmaker wanted to capitalize upon the Living Dead franchise, and if so it's really too bad because I think as a stand alone film this 3D movie is entertaining. As a NOTLD remake... this use of the name creates a problem for the purists and an opportunity for the haters out there. It's fun to see Sid Haig performing and I think the movie works just fine in standard def (without 3D glasses) which is how I watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland rip-off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a mess this movie was.Ripping off the great George Romero has been a full time job in the horror world.But this movie just doesn't steal his premise, this movie steals the whole darn "Night of the Living Dead" movie.And then to top it off in the house that is getting attacked by the zombies the original "NOTLD" is playing on the TV.Bad mistake---I just kept thinking "keep the camera on the TV and let me watch the original,it's way better than this crap".You know the plot if you've seen the great Romero original--- a lonely house is attacked by hordes of flesh seeking living dead.Apparently this time the zombie outback is due to sloppy practices down at the local mortuary where the owner has been stacking up the bodies instead of cremating them.Add some weird leaking medical waste brought in for cremation getting on the bodies and you get zombies.The mortuary owner is played by Sid Haig and you get the feeling that this movie was basically created around him since his character wasn't in the original.He is usually pretty good but here he seems out of place and he never seemed comfortable with his character.I not sure I would believe a mortuary would get any business if it were run by a big bald guy with an Amish type beard and a warped sense of humor.Anyway the 3D part of this movie was a complete waste.....crappily done and utilized very little I'm not sure why they even bothered with it at all except for the novelty of it perhaps.Some full frontal female nudity was a welcomed sight ,as it is in any sucky movie,and she sported a pretty good set of headlights.But it didn't do enough to make up for this bad movie.But I did give this movie 4 stars but truthfully about 2 of those stars were earned solely because I like to see naked chicks hold their wobblers while they run and this movie had that.This movie seemed sloppily done from the script to the sets to the 3D.Most of the people playing zombies looked like they wearing cheesy rubber masks and rubber hands....the kind of junk you can buy at Wal-mart around Halloween.The whole movie felt like an after thought----a bunch of half wits were sitting around a table trying to come up with a good idea for a horror movie and when no good idea came forth this 3D suck-fest was cobbled together.Remember when you put off writing that book report all weekend and then slopped something on paper on the bus Monday morning on the way to school?This movie felt like that to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love 3D and Night of the Living Dead. . . This is mediocre at best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually found out about this remake while working on a short film and the guy who played the hotel manager was one of the zombies in this. I love 3D and Night of the Living Dead, so of course wanted to see this, though I am really not a fan of most remakes and like field sequential 3D way more than anaglyph 3D(Red and Blue Lenses). I was also not happy that George Romero or Image Ten People were not involved in the making of this, though the actor told me this was intended to be an homage to the original. Okay cool. Well, the movie does have some real crap acting in it(not the zombies, but the humans), but so did the original from certain people playing humans, not all. However, I can look past that as long as the movie still has a descent plot and flows pretty well. Some elements of the film are sort of distracting, but the effects were good. When Barb gets all mad at Ben because she finds out that he is selling weed, I wanted her to get eaten right then. Come on, she just met this guy, not like it is any of her business anyway.The movie is only okay(Actually, no it sucks!) and the 3D is good(some naked folks in 3D!), so you could do a lot worse.</fullReview>

This is nothing less than a truly majestic entry in the Dead Canon and no one who sees this will ever forget the haunting imagery of this film. The legendary Sid Haig gives a superb performance and the entire cast is uniformly excellent. This is not a remake but a re-imagining of the original groundbreaking masterpiece and it is a very lovely homage to that black and white landmark. Those who have studied the 1968 motion picture and hold that film sacred will find this 3D movie a stunning, incredibly exquisite tribute to mother ship film. The casual audience member will simply be astonished by the horror, the suspense, and overwhelming apocalyptic intensity that is Night of the Living Dead 3D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the remake of George Romero's 'Night of the living dead' this morning and I certainly wasn't expecting much because I had read some reviews on it and judging by the 3.4 rating that it got, I wasn't sure I was going to like it.As soon as I saw that Sid Haig or 'Captain Spaulding' from the famous 'House of 1000 corpses' and 'The devils rejects' which I personally thought were two of the best films I've ever seen, I wanted to see it. I loved Sid as Captain Spaulding and I thought if he acted as well as he did in the 'The devils rejects' and 'House of 1000 corpses' then I would be satisfied. And I was. Obviously he wasn't as good in this as he was in the other two films but he still managed to make me laugh.Anyway, I'm not here to review Sid Haig's acting, I'm here to review the whole movie as a whole. People are saying that the acting was awful, I thought that the acting was good, they weren't going to win any awards or anything but it certainly wasn't terrible. I did not watch this film in the cinema so I did not see it in 3D. I've heard that the 3D was pointless so I'm not too disappointed to of not seen it in 3D. The effects weren't very good because the film had such a low budget and the gore wasn't very realistic. The film had a few flaws, such as there wasn't very much zombie action which I was a little disappointed about seeing as I am a big fan of blood and guts in horror films! Overall this is not a bad movie and I would definitely recommend it to any fans of zombie/horror films, it was fun to watch and it made me laugh in parts but it also had some saddening moments, which I'll leave to you to find out if you decide to watch this flick, and I definitely think that is worthy of a 7 and not the ridiculous 3.4 it's been given!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies vs. Deadheads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because Sid Haig was in this, I really wanted to like it. But even though his character is responsible for the army of zombies walking the countryside, Haig can't bring a dead script back to life.Given stronger material, these actors might have promising futures. But there are no characters I really cared about. Worse than that, the one sympathetic character behaves in such a stupid manner that I was shouting at her to get her stuff together and RUN (fortunately the rest of the family is out of town). At the end of the film she just stands there like an idiot while zombies finally overrun her because this was how the film is supposed to end.The film starts well. We see the opening footage of Romero's film, and we see more footage from it at the Coopers' farmhouse. We again have Johnny and Barbara going to the cemetery, this time for an aunt's funeral instead of to visit mom's grave.To remind us what century we're in we have cell phones, text messages, and a reference to Mapquest.Later on we add tons of profanity, major drug usage, and nudity in an attempt to wake the audience up.I am glad I saw this on DVD and not in a theater in 3D. Many of the scenes are too dark to see what's happening. If you were watching through 3D glasses it would turn the film into radio drama. As is we get to see characters thrust arms, shovels, guns, and anything handy into the camera. Whoop.Sid Haig is totally over the top. This is why we love Sid Haig. Maybe some day he'll make a film with Meryl Streep where he delivers a subtle, nuanced performance...but I'll bet he won't whack any zombies in the head with a shovel in a Streep film.The audio commentary and behind the scenes footage reminds us that the people who made this are smart and talented. This just wasn't their lucky day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead 3D (2006) BOMB (out of 4) Zombies attack a group of teenagers and apparently they're being led by the one and only Sid Haig. It turns out this film is more of a remake of I Bury the Living than the Romero film but the producer needed a known title so they borrowed that from Romero. Either way, this film is horrid from start to finish and there's really nothing worthy in it. I went through some of the extras on the DVD where they talked about the 3D process but as far as I'm concerned these guys didn't know what they were doing. For starters, there's only one effect at the very end that comes off in 3D. Yes, I know the technology isn't the greatest but I've seen 3D videos that come off better. Very seldomly do they have anything coming towards the screen and most of the time they have objects moving away from the camera so you can't get any 3D effect. The story is stupid as well and none of the characters are interesting. Even the zombies come off very lame and their connection to Haig is just pathetic. The cast are all horrible and that sadly includes Haig who adds nothing to the film. The story makes no sense at all and there are so many unanswered questions that you have to wonder if the producer's ran out of money before everything was shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different but Campy Retelling of the Romero's Classic "Night of the Living Dead".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barb (Brianna Brown) and her brother Johnny (Ken Ward) are traveling for the funeral of their aunt. But once, they are in the cemetery. There's strange human beings are attacking them and Johnny left his sister alone out of fear. Now Barb is running from her life and he finds help from a guy on his motorbike named Ben (Joshua DesRoches). She goes along with him on his bike to a near farmhouse owned by Harry Cooper (Greg Travis) for help. But Harry's farm isn't what it seems to be and getting help is out of the question. But there's more violent human beings are attacking the farm house. Barb, Ben, Harry, Harry's wife (Johanna Black), Owen (Adam Chambers), Harry's daughter (Alynia Phillips), Tom (Max Williams) and Judy (Cristin Michele) are trying to stay alive for the night to trying battle these odd people. Which they are back from the dead and in the need of human flesh.Directed by Jeff Broadstreet made an watchable but misfired remake of Romero's classic "Night of the Living Dead". One of the reasons why Broadstreet remade this film, because of the copyright laws. Which Romero's film is in public domain. Which Broadstreet didn't want to remake this film at first. But oddly enough, this film seems more under budget than Romero's movie. Which there's not enough Zombie action. Which this Second Remake certainly needed and the script has a completely ridiculous third act. Which it's a downer and fun is over, once the third act steps in. The characters of Tom and Judy are sacrificed and the two are extremely lame but they are only bit characters in this version. Which you only see them about five minutes in the picture.This feature is in 3-D only like the original theatrical release. There's no 2-D versions in this DVD. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an amusing commentary track by producer/director:Broadstreet, editor/screenwriter: Robert Valding and actor:Sid Haig. Which Haig has an supporting role as a mortician. Which he's good for a few laughs in the movie and as well in the commentary track. DVD includes Three Featurettes, Blooper Reel and more. The second remake of NOTLD is fun to watch on a Halloween Night but it's insulting for the fans of Romero's. Which Romero wrote the original screenplay with John A. Russo (Midnight, Return of the Living Dead). Probably the worst thing in the second remake that Broadstreet has the original NOTLD playing on television is some scenes, which it probably made the die-hard fans of the original very angry. It's a forgettable movie. It would have been much better if the script was better, Broadstreet had better film-making skills and a bigger budget. But at least, the cast is decent. Despite some amateurish acting and lousy dialogue at times. (***/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: going into this movie thinking you're seeing a horror film will severely disappoint you. That's probably why a lot of people have been mad about this one - if you think you're going for scares, think again. In the vein of "Return of the Living Dead", this is just plain fun. OK, so ROTLD did have some good scares, too, but the comedy was obvious and a whole lot of people enjoyed it, right? So why not this time around? Whoever wrote this had a good time, they look like they had fun making it, so why can't audiences just giggle, yell at the screen, and enjoy themselves? I sure did. Ride this story like a rickety old roller-coaster and you'll enjoy it. However, some of the acting...yow. The leads look like they just came off an overnight acting class. Terrible! Barb comes off as a Barbie Doll, and Ben is just a moron. Am I mad that Ben was white in this one? No. Am I mad that they made him a stupid wuss? Yes, very much. Ben is a strong character, and this guy is just a joke. The two shining points as far as acting in this are Sid Haig and Greg Travis (Cooper). Travis is a corker as the weed-growing farmer and Haig is a scream as a mortician who's afraid of fire. The rest of the cast (which is only a few people) I won't bother mentioning because I really don't have anything good to say about their performances. Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and would see it again. Can't say a whole lot for the 3D because it gave me a headache, but some scenes looked really good. I think I would have liked this even more if it was left in 2D, because the headache was distracting. I'll definitely be buying the DVD, which I'm hoping will either be in 2D or at least have a 2D option. I think if they market the DVD better than they did the theatrical release it'll do well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Was Not Terrible!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not complete trash as most of the others have stated in many of the earlier reviews. This movie has many great features to observe and enjoy from a lower budget film aspect. First things first you can not go into this movie expecting a movie that owns up to a movie such as dawn of the dead remake. That remake was made with over double what these people where given to work with all together; so that should be your first sign that your not getting a dawn of the dead remake. Secondly, with the budget being considered you should understand that the 3-D moments may not be as crisp or as often as a movie given 30 million dollars to use equipment that is necessary.Next thing to be reminded of is that we are now in a different day and age when being a *donkey* is now considered funny. If a character is playing the stoner kid he is obviously going to get the roll of a dumb, slow, retard kid, that lost all his brain cells to the use of drugs. People laugh and thing that is great now and day and when the movies today do not contain such things as drinking, sex, partying, drug use, and nudity the audience grows bored more quickly and the movie suffers more because lets be the main thing horror fans want to view these days is all the things i just listed above. Which is where the word remake is okay for this movie. I myself would probably call this movie more of a remake update sort of film. My final characteristic that i think made this movie a 7 out of 10 is that this movie added a campy Friday the 13th element to the film itself and in my opinion it was much needed. It once again added that "zest", if you will, to the film that is so lack in the prior classic, at least that is my opinion.In closing, I am not saying this film is anywhere near as good as dawn of the dead remake but once again the budget difference was $27,250,000 million dollars. Yeah, that should say it all I shouldn't need to continue. Judge the movie the way it should be judged and not to Hollywood status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Crap Fest That Some Have Called It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who views this movie expecting a remake of George Romero's 1968 classic is sure to go away disappointed. Apparently the creative minds behind this film wanted to do a remake of the obscure 1950s film, I Bury the Living. But the producers, wanting to make the product more marketable, decided to turn it into a rip-off of the Romero film. Under the circumstances, I can understand the disappointment of many reviewers and the low ratings.However, if a viewer is willing to accept this film for what it really is -- a movie about the living dead that merely references the Romero film from time to time (as in the opening credits) -- he or she may be in for a pleasant surprise. Although it will never end up on anyone's 100 Best list, and I can't honestly call it a good movie, I did find it to be an entertaining, "not bad" movie.The premise is actually quite different from the Romero movie. Instead of being a worldwide plague threatening to destroy humankind, this zombie outbreak is limited at first to the mortuary of "Junior" Tovar (Sid Haig), who cannot bring himself to cremate the dead people whom he's embalmed. So he simply leaves them lying around the mortuary. Over a period of two years, the corpses begin piling up and eventually become infected with a mysterious virus that gets into his embalming fluid. They then begin to come alive again. At first Junior manages to control the problem with his trusty shovel, but it soon gets beyond his control.The main action takes place in the house of a local pot farmer, where the stoned-out characters are watching a broadcast of Romero's "Living Dead." They initially fail to comprehend the gravity of the situation, as a frightened young woman who has escaped from the zombies at Junior's mortuary seeks refuge in their house. The fact that the owner is engaging in illegal activity explains his persistent refusal to call the police. The house is finally overrun by zombies, and the remaining survivors flee with Junior (who has joined them and explained the source of the zombie outbreak) back to the mortuary. Then it turns out that Junior has been keeping a secret that threatens the lives of the other survivors.Some reviewers have called this the worst zombie movie ever made. I wonder if they have seen some of the stuff I've seen. In my opinion, it's head and shoulders above such Italian-made crap as Zombie 4: After Death and Zombie 5: Killing Birds. The question that I ask after watching such movies is: do I feel that I have just wasted 80 minutes of my life or do I feel like I've been entertained? And . . . would I consider ever watching it again? Thus far, I've seen this movie twice and have felt entertained both times. If you want to see a decent retelling of the George Romero film, then watch Tom Savini's 1990 remake. If you're willing to settle for some mindless entertainment with plenty of zombie action and some gratuitous nudity to boot, then you may want to check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 3D &amp; make-up effects, can't save a barely above mediocre remake, of a horror classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968) was a break through horror movie, that marked the debut of genre fave GEORGE A. ROMERO. The film was groundbreaking not just in terms of the way it would forever change the horror genre, but also in terms of where future zombie movies would be concerned &amp; paved the way for the many rules that would be frequently used in practically any &amp; all zombie movies made ever since then. Unfortunately, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968) was not copyrighted &amp; as a result, the film fell into the public domain, meaning that anyone who owned a video camera a few friends &amp; a farm house location in the area, could shoot their own versions of the film &amp; have it distributed. None of the remakes thus far have even touched Romero's terrifying original &amp; NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 3D is just one of the many proofs of such. Not that NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 3D is a complete loss, since it does indeed have some pretty good stuff in it. But by the time the film ends, you'll will be wondering why they even bothered. To date there has been seven remakes! (including this one)! First I will get into what I liked about the film &amp; then what I didn't like.I will say this, the 3D effects are pretty impressive &amp; the zombie make-up is far superior here than anything George A. Romero had to work with on his classic, or that make-up master TOM SAVINI was able to do on his 1990 remake. I also liked the opening of the film, where we see a black &amp; white opening shot of Romero's film, one assumes that the film-makers are doing the opener in Black &amp; White as a tribute &amp; then will fade to colour, however as the camera pulls back, it shows that NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968) is merely playing on a TV monitor at a gas station, that Barbara &amp; Johnny pass on their way up to the funeral. Director JEFF BROADSTREET is also able to muster up some pretty cool shots &amp; some of the acting is okay too. The modes of death for the characters are all different, so for the most part, the film isn't predictable in these areas &amp; the gore is pretty cool &amp; SID HAIG is fun to watch.On the down side however, this film is a prime example of the old saying "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" &amp; what can happen when a really good, classical film falls into the public domain. There tends to be more wrong with this remake that there is right. The film-makers try to be clever &amp; subvert expectations, by turning the lead hero Ben into a white character, not black, also gone is the boiling tensions between him &amp; Harry Cooper, in fact both characters here are presented as good friends &amp; are nothing like the characters fans seen in the original Romero classic. Comparing the characters in both films is like the difference between apples &amp; oranges, in fact, Ben is a dope dealer who works for Harry! which eliminates the rather intriguing racial tensions the original had. Harry's daughter isn't injured from a zombie bite that keeps her bed ridden for most of the movie until the end when she becomes a zombie. In fact, when the attacks begin at the farm house, she is bitten outside &amp; transformed almost immediately. Tom &amp; his girlfriend don't play a major role either, they just happen to be a lust filled couple, Harry has hired to help him harvest the weed &amp; who get dispatched as quickly as they arrive &amp; serve the plot not at all. Harry's family &amp; helpers (which are all stoned, minus the daughter) is also watching George A. Romero's black &amp; white classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968) on the television set when Barbara &amp; Ben arrive, although I don't know if the film-makers were trying to be clever, by saying the film is not a remake, or if the events that happened in that film are spilling over into real life &amp; putting them into an eerily similar situation, although when you stop to think about it, such an idea is just plain stupid. Director Jeff Broadstreet also does away with any kind of suspense &amp; tension, since the zombie threat is never truly felt, since the group never has to board up any windows or block any doors, to prevent the dead from entering. We also learn that this is not a world wide epidemic that is sweeping the nations, much less a root cause of a fallen radioactive space probe, that came back to earth carrying a virus, that has resurrected the dead, but rather a few small handfuls of corpses that were supposed to be cremated over a two year period &amp; never were &amp; now they are languishing around for the past couple weeks in the town.In the end, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 3D isn't a total loss, since again it does have some good stuff in it, it just winds up being...well a pointless endeavour, it adds or does nothing new for Romero's story &amp; the only recommendation I could give here would be the 3D &amp; make-up &amp; gore effects, or if you seen the other remakes of Romero's classic &amp; were curious. Apart from that, I would leave this one alone, unless you can get it for free. Certainly not the worst remake (anyone see NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: RESURRECTED?) but not great either. This wasn't SID HAIG's last venture into the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD territory either, as he would return to play himself in MIMESIS: NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Followed by a sequel NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 3D: RE-ANIMATION.**1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not too bad, but it fell apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a remake attempt, not too shabby. I enjoyed the beginning and the middle and then, it just seemed to run out of ideas. the "rationale" for the dead coming back to life was funny but kind of dumb. I would have liked for Haig to explain that they started coming back, and he tried to hide it, but not that he CAUSED it.. I found that dumb. The Texas Chainsaw daddy thing was kind of... stolen, but OK. But the ending left me feeling like they ran out of ideas and/or time and had to end it, so they just stopped where they were and ended it. Which makes the viewer rather frustrated.If there is a 2D version, I'd consider picking it up. As others have said, there was no reason at all for the 3D. The text message "coming 4 u" was funny but pointless too. Zombies don't know how to use phones in the Romero zombiverse (they do in real life, but only while driving).So, a decent attempt, and a mixed result. Not painful to watch, but not worth watching again unless you're a horror geek like I am.Definitely much better than Children of the Dead or Day of the Dead 2: Contagiuum. But a far cry from such classics as the original NOTLD or any of the other Romero dead films or any of the Return of the Living Dead films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>well watched this last night and for 3/4 of the film it was true to a good zombie movie "all being it lacking in any real gore but had some zombie tension in it and a few laughs",trust me I've seen a few zombie films in my time! to know what is good or bad .Acting was reasonable for most characters but the odd 2 or 3 were very poor including Sid haig .now I've seen a few films with him in it and most were average at best, for a horror film ,and my point is when you see his character again you get a few lines explaining what has happened and why it has happened and then things take a down hill slope and the rest of the film is campy ,incoherent and just plain stupid ,there are a few minor blips before hand but you can overlook them cos the action and direction are still flowing.All in all better than most strait to DVD/indie zombie films. had no problem that it was based/remake of notld cos the the remake notld90 did not hit the spot and the original was just to old to scare but was a landmark in producing what is today .my vote for a zombie movie 6 out of 10 . 10 being dotd 78</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fans may get a kick out of it, but everyone else should just stay away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost totally randomly, my little brother had me rent him the original Night of the Living Dead a few years ago. I did not think much of it at the time, but I managed to watch it a few days later and was fairly impressed by it. Eventually, I managed to see the rest of the films in Romero's series and really enjoyed them for the most part (cannot say I am too big of a fan of Day or the remake of Dawn). Having never seen Tom Savini's re-imagining of the original film in full, I was still pretty intrigued by the idea of a second remake in 3D. And while the film is terribly silly and nowhere near as good as the original film was, it may still be worth a look for real hardcore fans.While a few liberties have been changed from the original and the remake, this film stays pretty true to the roots. On the way to their Aunt's gravesite, Barbra (Brianna Brown, called Barb here) and her estranged brother Johnny (Ken Ward) get attacked by the undead. Johnny is not so lucky in the ordeal, but Barb manages to flee. After a quick run-in with new character Gerald Tovar, Jr. (Sid Haig), she is saved by Ben (Joshua DesRoches). They end up at the Cooper house with a few other random people who really get very little by way of development, all pretty oblivious to Barb's desire to call the police for help.On the whole, the film itself is pretty bad. The storyline is alright, and some of the major changes are not too bad either. I can appreciate a Caucasian Ben, and I can appreciate the change in why the zombies exist in the first place. Yeah, it takes away a little bit of the biting satire Romero intended for the film (not having any police/hunter presence at all detracts from it), but in a way, it still works. It becomes a little ridiculous and downright silly after the big revealing moment happens, but by that time it really does not matter that much anymore. I did not like how the characters all seemed to be one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs. Yes, Barb, Ben and Tovar are interesting characters, but they all feel half-baked in their developments. I never really got a sense of terror from any of them, and there was little-to-no development from any of them. Even worse is the Cooper clan and Company. All of them are one-note characters who just do not seem to have a reason to exist in the first place other than to create a few laughs or help make the plot have somewhere to go.Even worse is the dialogue. It is totally off in many places, and feels like it was really just thrown together in a blender. I did not expect any Oscar worthy material to be said by any of these characters, but I expected a little more than just self-parody. What it comes down to is either totally inane pop culture references, funny one-liners or unintentionally funny quips coming out of these characters' mouths. What is worse is the fact that the unintentional humour dominates the film, and appears every few minutes or so. And with the movie only running for about 80 minutes, it becomes jarringly distracting. Yes, I did laugh more than a handful of times, but it was more out of how terrible the dialogue was more than it actually being genuinely funny. I am unsure if the actors really were making an attempt at making the movie sound serious, but they just really feel like they know how bad what they are saying is, and are just going with the flow as best they can.But I must contend that other than for a gloriously over-the-top performance from Haig, the real reason anyone would see this is for the 3D. And for the most part, it is not too bad. Not a lot pops right out of the screen, but when it does, it is done pretty well, and makes for an experience to say the least. Yeah, you probably will laugh at it, but the care that was taken with the shots makes the cheesiness of it feel all the better. The only problem I could really see with it being in 3D is how dark the movie gets from time-to-time. Of course being called Night implies it will be pretty dark, but it becomes hard to watch with the glasses on. Nevermind the headache you get from wearing the glasses for too long, it becomes pretty painful to try and make out distinguishing features of the people on screen while you are wearing them. When you can see everything perfectly, the makeup effects shine brightly, as do the really trimmed down death and gore sequences. Being a remake of a film from a series that relied so heavily on sequences like those, I was surprised to see so many either being trimmed down or cut away from.I also liked how they incorporated footage from the original film into this one. It was nice to see the great film playing out on screen, and how the characters reacted to it.For all of its bad qualities, I did get a kick out of watching the movie in 3D. It made for a unique and fairly amusing film experience. While the acting and dialogue are pretty bad, the story itself is alright, as are the effects. Fans of the original series will probably get some enjoyment out of it, but everyone else should probably just stay away. It has a few creepy moments, but just not enough to satisfy the average horror fan.3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually liked this movie. The filmmakers are not trying to redo or outdo Romero so there's no reason to compare it to the original. This is a 3D zombie movie, based on Romero's flick, not a social message movie. It's also a low budget movie. So if you're expecting funky computer graphics, super loud sound effects, explosions, and "A-list" teenage actors racing to deliver their lines as fast as they can, then this movie is not for you. And this is precisely why I liked this movie. It doesn't sacrifice story for the sake of visuals. It must have a script twice as long as most Hollywood flicks. The characters actually talk to one another, they reason together, and even crack some funny jokes. The jokes are not in the vein of late night show punchlines but sort of natural jokes. This movie is refreshing in a way. It doesn't try extra hard to manipulate the audience into laughing, jumping, or feeling sad. It doesn't try to control you like a 80 minute roller-coaster. So its pace is slower, but it isn't boring. Many have criticized the acting. I didn't find any problem with the acting at all. What I think people miss is the hysterical over the top screaming and shouting that you won't find here. The story itself is good, it explains the origin of the zombies and there are some surprising twists. The 3D effect was neat. Looked holographic. The's some good gore and the zombies look good as well. The only thing that could have been better is the direction and acting of the action. Because it's low budget I imagine, there was no time or money to shoot action scenes the way Hollyood does: shoot dozens of takes of 1 second instants, which results in absurd situations where a character has superhuman energy for 2 hours straight and never tires. Here the actors's motions are natural, that is slower than what you're used in the movies where the action looks accelerated. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Zombie Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, what a surprise! This is an excellent zombie movie. Since this film's release last year (I believe on the West Coast) I have read much of the comments on this board and wasn't expecting to get a chance to see NotLD 3-D in a movie theater, much less here in Cincinnati. Mostly because of how negative a lot of the posters here have been I wasn't expecting much. When I found out it was playing here in town on the 10th at a late show, I dragged along a couple of my friends, went down to the Esquire and put on our red and blue 3-D glasses. WE ALL LOVED IT! Now, first let me say that I love horror movies. Zombie movies are not my favorite -- but I've seen 'em all. Inlcuding some of the really cheesy Italian ones. Original NIGHT, DAWN, DAY, remakes, the horrid Russo piece-o-crap, the remakes and even that awful thing put out on DVD by Taurus, Day of the Dead II. Well, this low budget zombie movie ranks as one of the best. It's more like Return of the Living Dead than Night of the Living Dead. This movie's really funny in places, but it's not a comedy. And it doesn't have all those pot jokes ( is that a spoiler?) that everyone keeps talking about. The movie has a couple of pot jokes, but not a bunch. I just really liked the low key horror and the feeling that what was happening in the film was being treated in a realistic fashion. AND THE 3-D IN THIS FILM IS REALLY GOOD. I had seen some of the 3-D films that were made in the '80s and the 3-D in this movie is probably better and less gimmicky than almost all of those 3-D films. Kudos to the 3-D people who worked on this movie and also to the director who I think did a great job on what was probably a low budget. I have a cousin who works on low budget movies in Hollywood and I've gone with her a couple of times to visit some of the movies she has worked on and based on what she has told me and what I've observed on my visits, the movie makers on this movie did a really good job. Sure it's not a Hollywood blockbuster and the movie does move kind of slow in a few places but Sid Haig and those two actors who play Ben and Barb are just real good in this zombie film. As a matter of fact, the whole cast is good in this movie. Also, if you've seen the actor who is in Toolbox Murders (Greg Travis?) he's in this movie and he's good some really good lines. If you get a chance to see this movie in a theater, I highly recommend it. I can't wait to buy the DVD when it comes out, I want this one in my collection.</fullReview>
