		<shortDescription>Romero and Savini create a horror masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wanting to re-visit the genre he created, George Romero approached Tom Savini to direct a remake of his 1968 masterpiece, Night of the Living Dead.While the film follows the original closely, it does have some important changes. Notably the character of Barbara is no longer a gibbering vegetable but now much more balanced. Other changes help blend the film much better into Romeros Dawn and Day. The use of tools by the zombies for example, is lessened and removed at times, creating more continuity between Night, Dawn, Day and Lands time-line of the undeads abilities.Some seem to automatically shoot down the remake in favor of the original, I've watched this version almost as many times as Dawn and Day, and believe the film tops the original in almost every way. Although the groundbreaking nature of the original will always remain, Savini's Dead is a without doubt a classic Zombie flick and in my opinion a perfect first chapter in the Romero Dead series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is pure hell on earth."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This is pure hell on earth." Actually, what Tony Todd meant to say was "This is one hell of a movie." Tom Savini and George A. Romero have succeeded in recreated a classic (which is quite hard to do). Night of the Living Dead '90 is faithful to the original, but still manages to scare and surprise you by throwing in a few unexpected twists. Director Savini creates a great atmosphere. This is one of my favorite claustrophobic films. It has the feel of an old, secluded farmhouse, and thankfully lacks that Hollywood gloss. The characters feel real as well. The cast is perfect. Tony Todd, William Butler, and Tom Towles are the re-incarnations of the original Ben, Tommy, and Harry Cooper. And longtime Romero collaborator, Patricia Tallman, revamps her character Barbara for the nineties. And you gotta love Bill Moseley ("They're coming to get you Barbara. They're horny Barbara."). All of the classic elements (the feud between Ben and Cooper, the claustrophobia) and a few new ones (a smarter female lead, new ending) make this one unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of something that didn't need to be remade, but it's still alright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero turns over his classic horror film to be remade, and it's in the hands of Tom Savini (who did brilliant makeup for Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead). Now, I do have some mixed feelings about this movie. While in some aspects it's well made (er, for a remake), it can not match the original, if only in tone and style. But it also doesn't match up with the original because until the end, most of the movie is a shot for shot remake. More style is added, to be sure, but Savini and Romero (who scripted this one) could've gone farther.With that said, Night of the Living Dead (1990) was an enjoyable horror flick experience, one where it's a good time with color and gore and all (plus more full frontal zombie nudity) and as long as you don't think too deeply about what you are watching (and certainly don't try to compare the 1968 and 1990 versions together), you'll have fun.

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Remake Of A Classic Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of remakes of classic films rarely live up to their predecessors. The original Night of the Living Dead was a classic horror and this adaption did the original movie justice. There were a few changes but it generally stayed faithful to the original.Tony Todd as Ben and Patricia Tallman as Barbara do a wonderful job. Ben is the character who is trying to hold everything together in the face of insurmountable odds. Barbara is the female who initially encounters the zombies but soon turns into an ass-kicking heroine. This differs to the original where Barbara was a timid little madam.The tension builds throughout the film. Perhaps there would have been a bit more tension if it had been filmed in black and white but it was very tense throughout.The ending is also different as well but good nonetheless.If you liked the original, then I recommend this version as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but could have been better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen every "Dead" movie many times, and I've even written a spec script for "Dusk of the Dead." Here's what's right and wrong with this remake of the 1968 classic.***SPOILERS AHEAD *** SPOILERS AHEAD ***1. RIGHT - Barbara getting strong. Looking at Romero's other films - "Dawn" and "Dusk," strong females like Fran and Sarah play tough, believable characters. The catatonic Barbara in "Night" '68 was way too weak, especially for a Romero film. Although the execution wasn't as good as I would have liked (more on that later), it was the right decision.2. WRONG - The music. Though the original used library samples for its music, they were very well-picked and added a chilling side to the action, with very few hitches. Here, though, an annoying score sometimes takes the viewer out of the picture. Better to leave the music out altogether.3. RIGHT - Playing on people's expectations. The opening cemetery scene is one heck of a shock. Shooting at a gas pump? Not a good idea:).4. WRONG - Harry Cooper. The point of this film was to make Harry out to be a complete a--hole. He hits his wife, drinks, argues, and doesn't even sound rational. The original made Harry an angry, nasty guy, but he helped some (throwing the cocktails, etc.) and made some good arguments for staying in the basement. Here, all he does is shout at everyone - not fun.5. RIGHT - Effects. Great makeup here, absolutely convincing. Much better than the average horror film.6. WRONG - Pacing. When the house is being boarded, the zombies attack constantly, and overpower the humans several times. You'd have to be an idiot to stay up there if the zombies were THAT strong. The first one made staying upstairs a viable option.7. RIGHT - The third option of just getting the heck away. With a rifle and a shotgun, it shouldn't be too hard to get everyone past the zombies and into the open.8. NEUTRAL - The ending. Certainly a radical change for Barbara's character, but it makes sense in context of Harry's behavior.9. NEUTRAL - Decreased role of TV/radio reports. It's nice to focus on the matter at hand, but seeing the wider view of things is fun, too. It's good that they didn't explain WHY the dead were rising.There you have it. Comments from a die-hard "Dead" fan. The film is about a 6-8/10, depending on how you like the series in general. It's comparable to "Day," in other words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting twist on the old formula.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't help but feel a tingle of deja vu while watching the color remake of Night of the Living Dead. It is essential for full enjoyment to have seen the original since the remake takes the same story and twists and tweaks it to bring it into the 90's. People are divided into two camps on this film. They either absolutely hate it or they have been enraptured by the change-up's that it pitches at you. I am of the later camp. At least Barbara (played by the beautiful Patricia Tallman) has enough of her wits about her to point out how irrational everybody else is being instead of being the catatonic victim like the first time around. "They're so slow. We can just walk right by them." She remarks to Ben (Tony Todd) who is adamant about staying in the house. Perhaps this version isn't socially relevant like the first, but it's nice to see that Romero can add a twist ending that can stand on it's own merits, but really is amusing in light of the former movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than I expected, but the original is still the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always wary of remakes of horror and science fiction classics as they are almost always inferior to the original versions, in many cases REALLY inferior. There have been a few successful and worthwhile attempts, especially John Carpenter's 'The Thing' and David Cronenberg's spin on 'The Fly'. Tom Savini's 'Night Of The Living Dead' is another good one. Even though Savini is a legend in the special effects world I really expected this to be awful. It wasn't. While not as literal as the misguided 'Psycho' remake by Gus Van Zant, Savini sticks very close to the source material, and doesn't mess with it as much as Carpenter or Cronenberg did. George Romero scripted, adapting his original screenplay co-written with John A. Russo, and both men co-produce. The main difference in this version, apart from obvious ones like being filmed in colour and with some more sophisticated special effects, is the expansion of the Barbara character, who is much less passive and more important to the plot. Barbara is played by Patricia Tallman who worked with Savini on Romero's cult favourite 'Knightriders'. She is probably best known for her recurring role on 'Babylon 5'. Tony Todd ('Candyman') plays Ben, and is very good, and the underrated Tom Towles ('Henry:Portrait Of a Serial Killer') is excellent as the slimy Harry Cooper. The scenes between the two are really strong, and add a lot to the original. I also enjoyed seeing Bill Mosley (Chop Top from 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2') playing Barbara's brother Johnny in the opening sequence. My only real gripe about the movie is the surprising lack of gore, and also the new ending which to me is nowhere near as good as the original. Apart from that it is much better than I expected, and I highly recommended it to anyone who enjoys Romero's "Dead" trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politically correct remake of George A.Romero's classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Make-up maestro Tom Savini's color remake of Romero's 1968 classic follows the original almost shot-by-shot,but it's of course not better film.This remake was clearly made for younger viewers who refuse to watch black-and-white films,no matter how good they may be.The result is passable,but it lacks dark atmosphere and mood of the original.If this version has anything to offer,it is Patricia Tallman("Army of Darkness")in an engaging lead performance as a tough,independent heroine.This is only my opinion,but I'm really fed up with "strong female lead" concept that every new horror film seems to have.The next thing I dislike in this picture is the lack of gore.For God's sake this film was directed by gore wizard Tom Savini-the man behind such hard-core splatter flicks like "Maniac","Nightmare" or "The Prowler".The violence is very tame-even by today's standards.However the acting isn't bad,the zombies are pretty scary and the film is never boring.Recommended for horror buffs all around the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A faithful remake of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another zombie movie? How could there possibly be another variation on this tired horror theme? These were my thoughts as I slipped my money through the window at the ticket booth back in the fall of 1990. After all, I was a poor college student who had to take prudent measures in order to ensure that I had beer money when its all said and done. Not to mention the fact that I was quite a horror fan, in particular a zombie fan who was very familiar with the original Romero film. Needless to say this movie had a lot to prove in order to win me over. Well, it did. What Tom Savini and company were able to do out in the Pennsylvania countryside was nothing short of masterful. Of course I'm talking about horror here. This is no Cassablanca, but within its genre Night of the Living Dead is a standout. This film basically faithfully retells the original Remero story with the benefit of better make-up, special effects, cameras, lighting and cinematography. Notice I did not say better casting or acting. Aside from the actual story these are two areas that are partly responsible for the original's lasting success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not needed--but OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dead come back to eat the flesh of the living. A small group of people are holed up in a farmhouse. They have to fight the dead from getting in...and each other.There was no reason (that I can see) to remake the 1968 classic "Night..." but George Romero (director and co-writer of the original) wanted it. He scripted it and got makeup artist Tom Savini to direct. The results are OK. It could have been a disaster but wasn't. It's not a scene by scene remake but it does have some of the original dialogue. Still it makes some pretty extreme changes.Barbara in the first movie was little more than a basket case. Here she is strong and intelligent and can hold her own. It's never really explained how she became such a crack shot though. Tony Todd is a good actor--but not here. He has the unenviable job of playing the part that Duane Jones played so well in the original. He is good...but not enough. The other actors are all pretty OK--the same as the originals were.There are some cute visual and verbal references to the first film and the gore has been upped drastically (though not as much as it could have been). There is also an eerie and very effective music score throughout the movie. I found this a little slow but that's because I've seen the first multiple times in the past. And this one tacks on a screamingly obvious "ironic" finale.It's OK--but the original is still the best. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acceptable remake about flesh-eating living dead taking over the world , in which again a bunch of people are chased by Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting remake of the original classic film filmed by expert make-up artist , Tom Savini . This powerful horror film is the Tom Savini's directorial debut with more budget than George A Romero classic film , one of the most successful independent films of all time that was initially dismissed as exploitation, but when was re-released , it struck deeply with a disillusioned youth angry with the desperation about Vietnam . Tom Savini's gruesome first film, combining gore, 'bona fide' frights horror and in colorful style with skillful characterization . A mysterious plague expands about people , as every cadaver for miles around hungers for their flesh , it creates the recently dead to rise from their graves and scout the countryside and surrounding a farmhouse for feed on and where find shelter a hapless group . The legions of dead people who stalk the house are looking exasperatingly for live humans . A woman (Patricia Tallman ,she had known Tom Savini since they went to college together, he chose to cast her because of her strong-willed demeanor) along with an African-American named Ben (Tony Todd, Laurence Fishburne and Eriq La Salle both auditioned for the role of Ben ; Ving Rhames was also considered) escape the frightening zombies to take refuge at a house . The group is trapped inside a farmhouse as legions of the walking dead try to get inside and use them for food .The first time the Zombies appeared was in ¨White Zombie(1932)¨. From then on Zombies remained a firm staple of terror B-genre , bringing the dead back to life was a popular pastime in the 30s and 40s . The early zombies were basically genteel beings and generally likable and agreeable types . Romero created in Pittsburg his own production company Image Ten Productions with his friends, John Russo among them and they each contributed 10.000 dollars and formed the budget for his first ¨Night of living dead¨ movie which made Romero world famous and he gave birth to the modern Zombie genre . Tom Savini cast an African-American Tony Todd , Duane Jones-alike , along with usual horror secondaries as Bill Moseley and Tom Towles ; furthermore ,Billy Cardille appears as a reporter in both the 1968 version and the remake . And acting debut for Katie Finneran and Heather Mazur . Claustrophobic picture , giving interesting consideration to the violence executed by the zombies and , along with the original ¨Night of the living dead, has had a lasting importance . It was one of the first successful independent terror productions influencing and inspiring countless imitations, copies and rip-offs . The scene at the end of the film, where several zombies are lynched from a tree and shot at was in fact scripted in the original 1968 film, but was cut because of the racial tensions gripping the country at the time , the scene pays homage to the cut. As is tradition with most zombie films, the word 'zombie' is never once used in this movie to describe the Living Dead . The motion picture was well directed by Tom Savini , though Peter Hyams was asked to direct, but turned it down to make ¨Margin narrow¨. However , Tom Savini's originally wanted to start the film in black-and-white, then slowly add color. Other equally celebrated sequels are the followings : ¨Dawn of the dead (78)¨ where the zombies attack a shopping mall ,¨Day of the dead dead(85)¨ and scientific experimenting on zombies and ¨Land of dead (2005)¨ with high budget played by Simon Baker, Asia Argento and Dennis Hooper .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh. My. Goodness. I LOVE zombie movies so I thought, HEY! Here's a brilliant idea! let's watch night of the living dead since it's the one that STARTED the genre! How I wish I hadn't. I sat around LAUGHING at the bad acting and moreso the hysterical girls always screaming their heads off all the time. I never thought I would be GLAD when the main characters started to die, but I was. I was only disappointed that the main annoying chick didn't die too. The zombie acting and makeup was horrible, and so was the use of dummys. You could INSTANTLY tell when a dummy was being used, so much so that it was laughable. This movie is good for a laugh, but don't watch it if you love the zombie movie genre. It will turn you off from it, FOREVER.</fullReview>

While it had some comparisons to the original it lacked what made the original so good. The pace of the movie was slower then a death march. It would give you some zombie action only to bore you with stupid unimportant scenes of Ben and Barbara kinda hitting it off. Which I found totally ridiculous. Not to mention that Barbara's "going crazy" in this version was her turning into a girl Rambo. It made you miss the "You can't start the car...Johnny has the keys." All in all this movie is a total waste of time. Stick with the classic Night of the Living Dead.</fullReview>

As a seasoned horror fan, I expected a little more gore, the small bullet holes could not compare with some of Romero's earlier work. Another thing is that the remake missed out what I thought was one of the best parts of the original and that is the long radio announcements. The remake only shows a few seconds of a news report and only a brief radio announcement. The film drags on for too long.Lastly, I won't spoil the ending for you but the original film's ending was much darker and horrific than the remake.I say, rent the original and give this a miss. 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a sad state of affairs that George Romero, creator of Martin, and the classics Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead has sunk to "reinventing" his ground breaking horror film of the same name from the 1960's. The original "Night" was a riveting horror ride that at times could overwhelm the senses with it's violent imagery, though tame by todays standards. The remake is a lifeless rehash, that breaks no new ground in any direction. The plot and characters are basically the same, with the exception of Barbara, whose character in the original served only to scream and babble, is now transformed into a combination of Athena/Wonderwoman/Xena:Warrior Princess. The use of color as compared to the B&amp;W original just highlights the latters superiority for this particular subject matter. It is difficult for most horror films to be compared to the original "Night", but even without considering the first film, this one is a journey into the inane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is a direct remake of the original Night of the Living Dead, but if you're going to breathe new life into a series, don't make it EXACTLY like the original, I would have been more satisfied if they had just released the original in colour. Tom Savini tries too hard to make this like a 50's and 60's horror flick...including the over acting from the cast.but, my opinion might be a bit biased, because I personally am a fan of remakes that just take the principal plot and make it a different way much like the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead.I say, watch this one but keep an open mind that it is a direct remake of a 60's horror film in every way possible. and if you see this before you see the original (as I did), don't bother watching the original, in fact you're better off watching this one in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, I don't know....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five years after the last sequel to the original Night of the Living Dead someone decided to have a go at starting the whole thing over again from scratch! Nothing wrong with that... I think we can all name some decent remakes. Unfortunately, this particular remake suffers from two blights upon late-eighties/ early-nineties movie making 1) The need for a happy ending and 2) the need for political correctness.The original Night of the Living Dead was fascinating because it had at least one person we could identify with no matter who we were, and in many cases we could identify with the entire cast because each represented a part of ourselves. The film was also ahead of it's time because the Hero is African American and befriends the frightened woman and helps to protect everyone involved. The ending isn't a happy one, but it's very realistic.The remake unfortunately elected to eliminate certain personality traits that we can identify with in favor of more politically correct motifs. For example, the frightened girl who is muted by fear and horror evolves into a female Rambo (played admittedly very well by Babylon 5's Patricia Tallman) who swoops in with the cavalry and saves the day at the last minute. Very PC, not very realistic. The tone doesn't really promote sympathetic fear at all, and the happy ending where everything is tied up by the 180 shift of Tallman's character doesn't help this problem.On the other hand the movie is not a total loss. The acting is not bad, and while you're never really scared as you are watching the original you're never moved into the realm of laughter either. Never let anyone tell you that this film is terrible... it isn't, but compared to the original it's not great either. Don't rent them on the same night by any means... rather, buy the original on DVD, and catch this remake on the Superstation. That way you waste nothing either way!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a piece of garbage. I mean, I could go along with this if the remake had actually been a respectable piece of work; the original Night of the Living Dead is one of the finest horror films ever made, and quite simply THE uncontested best zombie flick. With that masterpiece, George Romero managed to transcend the world of schlocky B-movie horror and deliver a genuinely frightening look at humanity's failure to cooperate in times of crisis. Through that movie's realistic characters and skillful script, the audience learned the real definition of terror. But this . . . it's like the 1990 version was made by people who utterly hated the original and wanted to smear its name. The shining, serious message expressed in the 1968 work of art has been buried under a mountain of hideous acting, cheesy makeup and needless, unrealistic profanity. Real people would not behave like this in a crisis situation. This movie has absolutely nothing going for it--not even the excessive gore that made Day of the Dead at least watchable (and you'd really expect a lot of it, seeing how Tom Savini directed this monstrosity). I realize a lot of zombie fans happen to like this one, and they are entitled to their opinions; if you have any respect for the original movie, though, I'd advise you not to take any chances. Seriously, if I could change just one day of my past I would choose to rewrite the day I decided to watch this film.</fullReview>

That is unless you are a die-hard fan in which case you'd probably gain nothing from the experience.There's nothing that I can throw at this movie, it doesn't reflect badly on the original, nor is it a bad film in its own right.I just don't get why it was remade, we know and love (maybe loathe) these characters already, do we need another clutch of actors to repeat the performance like a dodgy kebab? Nothing's added, no new light is cast, no performance is either bad nor outstanding, it's just 'there'.Ah well, if you see it cheap then you probably won't regret your purchase, just don't go expecting something new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Romero heads his series into the nineties with an updated remake to his cult classic night of the living dead.The story is pretty much the same with a few new twists thrown in like Barbara (Patricia Tallman) is now a xena warrior princess instead of the meek helpless character from the previous film who breaks up arguments, shoving zombies out of her way and bringing in the Calvary. Tony Todd does an excellent job as Ben and makes him his own.Now set in color losing the old fashion Hollywood style feel and reveals the rubbery texture used for the makeup. Johnny hitting his head on the headstone and Barbara breaking the iron over the farmer zombie's head are obviously dummies. The camera angles hung to far on the moon and cuts back to the same image throughout as if to allow the audience a bathroom break.Another flaw was the revelation they could walk past the zombies the whole time neutralizing the threat and made the whole 80 minutes a waste of time. It makes the characters look stupid and feel inferior to the originals who came before them.I don't know what happens to George Romero and Tom Savini but both lacked the creativity and skull that made them a brand.While some will appreciate the new changes, it was an epic fail for me and undone the greatness that is the original night of the living dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as re-makes usually aren't sitting well with me, then I just had to take a chance on watching this 1990 re-make of the 1968 movie that just revolutionized the entire horror genre and sparked the zombie sub-genre; "Night of the Living Dead". But with the dread of director (and special effects master) Tom Savini failing to fill out the massive footprint left by George A. Romero hanging over the movie, it was either a make or break experience.And now in 2016, I can say that I have watched this 1990 re-make numerous times since back in the 1990's. Yes, it is a re-make that is well worthy of the original movie upon which it is founded. And director Tom Savini really stepped up to the task and showed that he was able to skillfully grace the re-make in the spirit of the father of all zombies; George A. Romero.The story told in "Night of the Living Dead" needs no introduction. And if you are a fan of the horror and zombie genre, then you will already be familiar with the storyline. And if you are not, and if you are a horror fan, then you seriously need to get around to watching the 1968 original and this 1990 re-make. As such, I am not going to delve into story details here.Director Tom Savini did deviate some from the original story, which was acceptable and good, because a frame by frame re-shooting of the original movie would have been disastrous. And I must salute him on his accomplishments with this movie.The cast also deserves a good share of credit for making this movie into what it was, because people really did good jobs with their given roles. Again, especially since they had a lot of pressure hanging over their heads, as they had to live up to the 1968 classic. But they managed to do so quite well. Tony Todd (playing Ben) and Patricia Tallman (playing Barbara) in the lead roles were carrying the movie quite well. And Tom Towles (playing Harry) really portrayed the despicable character quite well. Personally I think it was a shame that Bill Moseley (playing Johnnie) didn't have a bigger part in the movie, because he really is an iconic actor in the horror genre."Night of the Living Dead" does have some great special effects, and why wouldn't it have with director Tom Savini also being a masterful special effects man himself. The zombie make-up was really nice and had lots of good details, which is essential for a zombie movie.I enjoy all things zombie, and it is sacrilege not to be familiar with "Night of the Living Dead" if you are a zombie aficionado. And this 1990 re-make is a well-worthy addition to the zombie genre, and is most worthy of a place in the movie collection right next to the original 1968 version.So the only thing left to say is: "They're us. We're them and they're us."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as strong as the original but still decent enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes and reboots by far are one of the most despised and looked down upon ideas and concepts that many film goers and critics a like do not enjoy sitting through. Whether it's because Hollywood is trying to cash in on people's nostalgia or running out of ideas, nobody really favors their beloved pieces being redone. Another problem most fans have with these plans is that the people who make these decisions have no understanding of what made the original so beloved. Then they hire a group of people who have no knowledge either, it just insults many viewers' intelligence. But there have been occasions where the exact opposite happens. Take this project for example. To this day, director George A. Romero is best known for his feature film debut with Night of the Living Dead (1968). Being the first of his "dead" franchise, it was quite the groundbreaker. It reinvented horror for filmgoers at the time and had interesting characters to follow and sympathize with; a classic. Why would anyone remake it? Apparently Romero thought it could use an update.The majority of the plot itself, written only by Romero, remains largely unchanged. Groups of people end up crossing paths at an abandoned house after they are driven away by cannibalistic dead people known as zombies. The characters involved are also the same. The leads Ben (Tony Todd) and Barbara (Patricia Tallman) work together to defend themselves in the home. They also meet couple Tom (William Butler), Judy Rose (Katie Finneran) and the Cooper family headed by Harry (Tom Towles) who wants nothing but to hide in the basement. Bill Moseley best known at the time for playing "Chop-Top" Sawyer from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2 (1986) even has a small role as Barbara's brother. Aside from these similarities, Romero does pen in some new ideas and changes up several events. One of the new ideas thrown in is Barbara being a strong female lead. Unlike her 1968 counterpart, Barbara takes charge and even questions as to why staying in the house is good idea if you can just walk past a zombie quick enough. All valid points.Having a strong female lead in a horror movie was not a new thing by the 1990s, but for Romero's remake it was. Tony Todd as Ben plays it up well as the no nonsense type and isn't willing to play games. Even William Butler plays an empathetic character. Lastly, Tom Towles as Harry Cooper plays his role well as the antagonist of the group looking not to fight back. The characters are developed enough as well to where if an individual makes a mistake, the consequence is tough to accept. What's also appreciated is how first timer Tom Savini (who normally does special effects) directed the film. Savini takes Romero's script and helps bring the changes to certain events with ease making the execution almost feel like an alternate reality if things were to happen in a different way. However the film does suffer from its issues. A blatant problem is some of its continuity for unexplained reasons. There are certain things that happen to some characters that don't get an explanation to what exactly happened.The overall effects to this remake look great too. Everett Burrell served as the special makeup effects supervisor to this project and as a stand-in for Savini, it's fairly decent. Before this Burrell also worked on well-regarded films like Re-Animator (1985), Aliens (1986) and Glory (1989); all of which had a significant amount blood squibs and dismemberment. The zombie designs in this creature feature are much more grotesque than before and that's good. However it's not even the kills in this movie that make this a zombie film, but more of the all the ways a zombie can be displayed. Here there are some severely gnarled up zombies that are quite comical to look at because of their persistence no matter how banged up they are. For a normal horror fan, the shock and scare value aren't much to be seen but there is enough tension buildup to make the viewer wonder "how are these people going to survive?". The solution may seem trivial but from the past three "dead" films, in greater numbers, zombies aren't easy to fend off.It is surprising to know that the MPAA gave the original cut an X rating and required certain scenes to be cut. After all the gory films that appeared during the 1980s, it's amazing Romero's still received the deadliest of all ratings. There were other infamous films far worse than his were. Frank Prinzi was hired as the director of photography for this remake. Since the 1960s many filmmakers moved to color and seeing a retelling of the classic story in a different color tone is a nice touch. Prinzi keeps the scenes well lit even for night and keeps the camera focused as well. The musical score was a disappointment however. The composition was scored by Paul McCollough and looking at his prior work, it's rather unimpressive. The score is entirely made up of synthesizers and rarely does it work. With no main theme this remake feels like it has no identity. A signature tune somewhere would've helped but instead the listening experience is just garbled mess of sporadic tones. It could've been worse though considering it's a remake.It's music feels largely uninspired and the script does suffer from continuity errors. But for a remake (which many do not support) it's rather decent. The updated script changes, the added color visuals and overall situation is enough to keep the audience engaged for the hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For George A. Romero's sake, who else would be better off directing his film masterpiece, Night of the Living Dead, over his right hand, special effects man, Tom Savini. Savini's take is still raw and Gothic like the original but there is definitely a different level of storytelling and character brashness added in. Remaking a movie is tough, since there are some questionable changes and there are also lots of scenes that seem like they were shot-to-shot. At times it felt like there were also too many moments of homage thrown in that were over doing the original concepts. With Savini and over twenty years of past experience, of course the blood and special effects are vastly better than the original. If you've seen and liked Romero's classic definitely take a look, because there are a lot of changes made that are interesting and should be left without spoilers. Night of the Living Dead, 90's edition, is a good take and a success to Savini's director belt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original creators of the seminal Night of the Living Dead (1968) reconvene 22 years later to, well, make some money!It was a compromised production, with director Tom Savini announcing that the finished cut is not half the film he set out to make. Surprising, then, to find it still works to the point of being viable. It's a very effective zombie pic, one performed with quality by the cast, with the concept of a group of people holed up in a house - under intense attack by the walking dead - still terrifying. Group dynamics again explode, heroes and villains are born, and the creatures are high grade in scary construction. Caveat, though, is that although it's a faithul(ish) remake, where with the new tools to hand it's understandable why the makers thought they could create another horror classic, but one for the 90s horror hordes, it still remains that it's utterly bloodless. While the finale is a bit stinky... 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not really a "zombie movie" guy. I was always more of a werewolf movie fan than a zombie one. However, there are aspects of the genre that do fascinate me and there are 2 zombie flicks in my top 150 favorite movies of all time. (REC) is the the first one, and this is the second. I haven't actually seen the original classic, but just on its own, "Night of the Living Dead '90" is every bit a masterpiece in its own right. This is an incredibly smart, compelling and tense thrill-ride, everything I wanted it to be and more.Patricia Tallman is outstanding as Barbara; her arc from weak victim to fearless badass is handled perfectly. Barbara goes through some pretty hellish and life-scarring situations in this movie, but these experiences only make her stronger, even downright ruthless near the end. That said, she isn't entirely cold and callous, and Tallman does a great job bringing some true emotional weight and depth to a character who very easily could have become an unrelatable hardass in the case of a less talented actress. If anything, I think that Barbara is something of a feminist icon in a movie genre that's severely lacking in pro-feminist characters.While Tallman does a fantastic job, the "Candyman" himself Tony Todd totally steals the show as Ben, a man very much thrown into a leadership position that he admittedly might not be 100% ready for. Ben becomes more and more emotive over the course of the movie as tensions rise and circumstances become more dire. Tony Todd has to get a wide range of emotional depth for this character; from hope to fear to anger to sadness to compassion. He's a character that has so much pressure on his shoulders and even when he makes the wrong decision, you can understand why he did. There wasn't a single moment where I didn't want this character to get out of this situation alive. William Butler, Katie Finneran and Tom Towles turn in fine performances as well, though admittedly Towles's character Harry was a bit of a one-dimensional whiner."Night of the Living Dead '90" is a movie that is just DRIPPING in atmosphere. From the superb, chilling musical score by Paul McCollough to the haunting and claustrophobic farmhouse set, the atmosphere truly adds to the tense and heart-pounding nature of the film.While the acting, characters and atmosphere are all excellent, my absolute favorite parts of the movie are the themes. The film touches on some very interesting themes about war and disaster in general and the affect that it can have on individuals (Such as the strength and ruthlessness gained by Barbara and the growing emotional nature of Ben) and social groups (shown by the constant feuding between characters eventually leading to outright bloodshed). The movie also has a very intelligent message about the power of fear; the power to bring strength as well as weakness, to bring unity as well as destruction. For a zombie movie, it's surprisingly deep in subtly examining these themes.As I said before, I'm not a zombie movie fan. But I don't have to be a zombie movie fan to know that "Night of the Living Dead '90" is a phenomenal movie and one of the best of the genre, if not one of the best horror movies ever. Whether you've seen every zombie movie, played every game and read every book or you're an outsider to the genre like me, I highly recommend you check this wonderful remake out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pretty Good Zombie Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of the 1968 film of the same name. In essence, the dead come back to life and seven people take shelter in a farmhouse somewhere in western Pennsylvania. Once inside the people disagree on their next course of action. One wants to fight them off by fortifying the house and waiting for help to arrive. Another wants to retreat to the basement and hide. Yet another wants to make a run for it. Now, rather than say which person is right, I will refrain so that it won't spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it. I will say, however, that the differences between the original version and this one were rather stark. For instance, the original was filmed in black and white and when it was released shocked the nation. The remake, on the other hand, had some improvements but wasn't nearly as impressive. For example, the original character of "Barbra" (played by Judith O'Dea) was in a state of shock and hysteria which added greatly to the suspense of the film. The new and improved "Barbara" (Patricia Tallman) was sleeker, more capable and less catatonic which added more versatility to the storyline. However, it seemed to lessen the effect. Likewise, the other characters seemed more polished but less effective as well. Now, that is not to say that there was anything wrong with the acting abilities of any of the characters as all of them were adequate. If anything, I thought Patricia Tallman performed quite well in her enhanced role. In short, this was a pretty good zombie movie. But even so, the original version was much more horrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mainly heard of this remake because of Tony Todd, better known as Candyman, starring, so I suppose I had to see whether it is a worthwhile one, from director Tom Savini (who produced the special effects for the George A. Romero films, and stars as Sex Machine in From Dusk Till Dawn). It sticks to the same premise, Barbara (Patricia Tallman) running away from zombies, and finding an empty farm house, and quickly joined by African American Ben (Todd). With all the noise, the other people: Harry Cooper (Tom Towles), his wife Helen (McKee Anderson), Tom Rose (William Butler), and his wife Judy (Katie Finneran) come up from the basement. Eventually, the house is swarmed by zombies, and they are doing everything they can to keep them out and eating their flesh. In the end, Barbara is the only survivor, Ben - turned zombie (unlike the original) - is shot, and Harry is shot for being basically a pretty chauvinistic prick. Also starring Bill Moseley as Johnnie and Heather Mazur as Sarah Cooper. Besides the changes in colour (although the original was turned colour too), casting and dialogue, the big difference is the ending, and ultimately the feel. It just feels too much like 90's cheese (which it is), and it was a remake that should have done with more style, or not at all in this case, I can't see why the critics give it four out of five stars? Worth watching in my opinion, at least once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not awful, just irrelevant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Major Spoilers *** This movie is by no means horrible. Seen outside of the context of the NOTLD series, it wouldn't be a bad popcorn muncher. Arguably, it even improves on the original in some ways, but in most ways it pales in comparison.- On the positive side, the acting is better than the original, and the production values are improved. This is not a major shock given the tiny budget of the original (only $114,000) and the unknown cast and crew culled from the Pittsburgh area theater and local commercial circuit.- Some might feel that the Barbara character is an upgrade. I feel neutral on that. In the original, Barbara was nearly a vegetable, but this is in line with the shock we might expect from her trauma, and in the end she does try her best to help out, and we appreciate her effort to overcome the shock. Yet I did enjoy the new Barbara's role as an interesting twist.- Some might argue that this version is better because it is in color, though I would disagree strongly. I feel that the black &amp; white original, along with its wooden performances and choppy editing, actually added to the creepiness of the movie.The original was groundbreaking in many ways. The remake, however, is merely conventional. That doesn't make it bad, but it does make it irrelevant.Here are some ways where the remake fails to deliver: - When Barbara first enters the house, she leaves the door standing fully open. This is despite the fact that she is being chased by a couple of zombies who had killed her brother and tried to kill her. She never tries the phone, which is inexplicable. Even the vegetable Barbara from the original movie had that much sense.- The people in the house wait waaaayyyy too long before beginning to board up the house. There is no logic or explanation for why it takes the zombies so long to cross the lawn (seemingly hours, from daylight to darkness) and start attacking a house full of juicy meat.- Often in the midst of zombie attacks, some people in the house manage to allow themselves to focus on other matters. This seems implausible.- The lonely, shocked aspect of Barbara wandering around the creepy house looking for wood amidst the animal heads and jewelry box is completely gone, yet those scenes set much of the critical tone in the original.- We never see the dead really devouring the living. I guess it's just assumed that the audience understands what is going on.- The radio and TV broadcasts were an essential component of the original, not only for expository purposes (what is happening? why is it happening? what do we do about it?) but again for setting the tone for showing the widespread nature of the attacks and defining this house and its inhabitants as being truly on their own. One could really place themselves in a similar position, and watching the world kind of falling apart through local emergency TV broadcasts was riveting.- The fact that zombies catch fire easily is not exploited at all as in the original. The scenes with the flaming chair and the Molotov cocktails were effective in the original, but gone in the remake.- The remake added a strong female character, but at the same time the Mrs. Cooper character became weaker and less effective.- The scene in the original that really sent audiences into shock and really made this movie famous was the basement scene with the child killing her mommy with a garden trowel. It was extremely graphic although mostly done in shadow, and as I recall there were reports of people fainting in theaters. This is just totally gone in the remake. The subsequent scenes of the girl eating her parents are also gone. Wow, so much for shock value.- The death of Ben was a major shock moment in the original that is completely lost. The new ending is interesting enough but somewhat predictable and trite. The original ending was truly... original. It was definitely not a conventional happy or even moderately hopeful ending, resulting in people walking out of theaters quiet with their thoughts - a real win for a director.- The musical score in the remake is just awful. It's distracting and inappropriate. By comparison, the spartan soundtrack of the original was extremely effective and creepy in a Hitchcock sense, varying from screeches to soundlessness, to heartbeat sounds.In summary, it's an OK movie worth watching, but if you're a fan of the series don't expect it to be a suitable replacement for the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" immediately lapsed into the public domain because the original theatrical distributor, the Walter Reade Organization, didn't place a copyright notice on the prints. In 1968, United States copyright law required notice for a work to maintain a copyright. Image Ten had a proper notice on the title frames beneath the original title, "Night of the Flesh Eaters." The distributor inadvertently removed the copyright statement when it changed the title, an act of negligence which ensured widespread distribution, but without royalties to the film makers.Romero wanted to get at least some restitution for himself and others who worked on the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrific And Memorable Remake From Tom Savini And George A. Romero.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night Of The Living Dead is a terrific and memorable remake that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,a good score and great special make-up effects. And while the Night Of The Living Dead remake isn't a good as the original it is a well-done and worthy remake of the original classic from Tom Savini and George A. Romero.Set in Pennsylvania,Night Of The Living Dead tells the story of a group of strangers including Ben(Tony Todd),Barbara(Patricia Tallman),Harry Cooper(Tom Towles)and his wife Helen(McKee Anderson)Tom(William Butler)and his girlfriend Judy Rose(Katie Finnerman)who are holed up in a farmhouse and have to fight off Zombies who want to eat their flesh.Night Of The Living Dead(or Night Of The Living Dead 90)is a wonderful Horror remake that was the directorial debut of Special Effects master Tom Savini and with a screenplay by George A. Romero(the director of the original film). Remaking a classic landmark film like Night Of The Living Dead(1968)is no easy task but I think Savini,Romero and company have made a film that is one of the better Zombie films and remakes around. One of the reasons Night Of The Living Dead 90 is a great remake and Zombie movie is that while it's the same story as the original with the same setting,characters and some of the dialog but is updated and works not only as a remake of the original film but as an homage as well. While NOTLD 90 lacks the genuine scares and Black and White documentary style atmosphere of the original it some moments of suspense and atmosphere that hangs over the movie throughout. This film doesn't have a lot of the social commentary like the first film or any of Romero's other Zombie films(like Dawn Of The Dead in 1978 or in Day OfThe Dead in 1985)it does tackles that same themes as the original such as tension among the human characters and pulling in different directions showing how things fall apart in drastic situations which will always be relevant. The Action scenes in NOTLD 90 are simple but effective with a lot of shotgun action that is done with great timing and editing. The blood and gore in the movie is fine and memorable although compared to the gore in DAWN and DAY the blood and gore is pretty light(which was because of the MPAA which gave NOTLD an X rating and the movie had to cut some of the gore out although an unrated version of this has been released). While the main characters are the same as the original with Ben being the headstrong leader,Cooper being a jerk,Tom and Judy being a scared young couple and Helen having problems with Harry the biggest character change is with the character Barbara. Where as Barbara in the original and was pretty weak and was always screaming,the Barbara in this film is strong and tough always shooting and fighting the zombies and holding her own when things start to fall apart which almost like Ellen Ripley in the Alien franchise. Strong female characters have been a long staple in the Horror genre and the character Barbara in this film is apart of that fantastic tradition. The Zombies are still the slow walking dead creatures they were in the original film coming from every corner and wanting to feast on the living and attack in packs. Although NOTLD is not a Horror-Comedy and is very serious there are some moments in the movie that are over the top and make me laugh whether it's Ben and Cooper's bickering or moments that are just unintentionally funny. The ending of Night Of The Living Dead is great because it's an ironic twist on the original's ending and offers a powerful message about human beings and society's own destruction. An amazing conclusion.The cast is great. Tony Todd is excellent and intense as Ben,with Todd bringing depth and power to the role. Patricia Tallman is terrific as Barbara,with Tallman being tough and fierce. Tom Towles is fantastic as Harry Cooper,a jerk who wants to do things his way. McKee Anderson is wonderful as Helen Cooper,Harry's wife. William Butler and Katie Finnerman do fine jobs as Tom and Judy Rose,a young couple. Bill Mosley is amusing in his small role as Johnny,Barbara's brother. Heather Mazur(Sarah Cooper)and David Butler(Hondo)give good performances as well.The direction by Tom Savini is great for his directorial debut,with Savini using a style that is simple but effective with good angles and wide shot giving the movie nice lighting and atmosphere. Good direction,Savini.The score by Paul McCollough is good and is filled with enough tension to match the movie's tone. Fine score,McCollough.The Special and Practical Make-up effects are outstanding,effective and work for the movie. Great effects.In final word,if you love Zombie films or Horror films in general,I highly suggest you see Night Of The Living Dead 90,a terrific and memorable remake that's not as good as the original but still an entertaining Zombie movie. 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remaking a classic is rarely a good idea. If you do remake one, at least try to do it differently and not just a shot-for-shot remake. Those are always terrible. This remake is actually pretty good because it modifies the original enough to be different while still sticking close to the same story. That George Romero wrote the screenplay no doubt helped. Tony Todd and Patricia Tallman lead a good cast. Tallman's character Barbara is probably the one area the movie improves upon the original. They turn Barbara from a passive shell-shocked victim (understandable and realistic though it may have been) to a proactive kick-ass character. It's not as frightening as the original and it never builds up that high level of tension. But it is entertaining in the same non-scary way zombie movies have been pretty much from the '80s to today. The biggest negative is that the score is often obtrusive. It's a good movie. Way better than you probably expect if you're a fan of the original. Give it a shot and I doubt you'll be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead (1990) is the remake of the 1968 black and white horror by George Romero. In Night of the Living Dead (1990), a cast of citizens end up in a farmhouse escaping a maraud of flesh-eating zombies. The movie begins with sister and brother Barbara and Johnnie, played by Patricia Tallman and Bill Moseley. During their visit to their mother's grave they are attacked by zombies. Barbara escapes and makes it to the said abandoned farmhouse where she discovers not only a corpse but more zombies and fights them off with Ben (Tony Todd) who comes onto the scene. After that, it becomes a fight for survival as there are more people hiding in the cellar: Helen and Harry (McKee Anderson/Tom Towles) and their daughter Sarah who was bitten and soon becomes a danger to them all, teenager Tom Bitner (William Butler), and Tom's girlfriend Judie (Katie Finneran). Debates ensue on how to evade the zombies such as barricading themselves in the cellar, protecting the house or escaping on foot.The Zombie film was nominated in 1992 for the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films USA's Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and Best Make-up for John Vulich and Everett Burrell. There were scenes in the movie that were cut so as to negate an x-rating, but these scenes have been shown at conventions and some are on the DVD. - Asif Zamir</fullReview>

It's no longer the moody black and white '68 indie with odd shooting angles. This one is much more straight forward.The actors are pretty good. The biggest name at the time has to be Tony Todd. Also this is Katie Finneran's first film. And Tom Towles is quite effective as the obnoxious dad. But it's Patricia Tallman that's the big discovery. She's got the great look, the force of will and the physicality to drive the movie and compete without being overshadowed by Tony Todd.</fullReview>

Make-up wiz Tom Savini's big-screen directorial debut is a a doozy: a remake of the seminal zombie horror classic for a contemporary day audience doesn't disappoint with more than enough tension, terror and violence. Teaming up with frequent collaborator - and the original's creator/director - George A. Romero (who also does a better turn with the screenplay), the film echoes its counterpart nicely yet layers on the dread. While Todd does a comparatively equal (if not better and tougher) job as the Duane Jones hero, Tallman is a bit off for the most part (a bit stiff and then suddenly gung-ho makes an uneasy transition) while Towles is perfectly cast as the obnoxious loud- mouth whose negativity is only second to the slow-moving corpses taking a stranglehold on their holed-up farmhouse sanctuary. The original is the bellwether curve for modern-day horror and this well-produced homage is just as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake but why?---</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A color re-do of the original B &amp; W movie. But why? Did they need a color version that could be shown on television with out a lot of gore and graphic make up FX that might need to be edited out to allow for TV showing? This played on a local movie channel the weekend of Halloween recently and I happened to have a digital copy on my computer, so I started it up and got the 2 in sync to watch and compare the differences. Oddly the only thing that stood out was the language. When Tony Todd first comes to the house he goes back outside to finish off a walker he had hit with his car and disabled but not killed. After shooting him he shouts to the skies 'God damn you' and the TV version cut the 'God' out. But the movie kept all the squib gun hits intact. There's no half-jawed dead, no extreme makeup effects or gore in this version, so it seems to have been done only to produce a color undead movie with this classic title that could easily be shown on TV, and perhaps re-claim copyright on the title. Dunno. The makeup is poor, and the script holds nothing special or creative past the original story. Nice to see 'chilly Billy' the newsman in the original film appear in this version. I used to watch his Saturday night creature feature show on Pittsburgh TV and enjoyed his smoking/drink in hand horror host persona. His daughter went on to star in the third Romero film in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible, but why bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll never, at any point in my life, understand why people don't like black and white. It's an opinion that will never make sense to me. Inevitably, though, there's going to be someone who talks about how much better the Psycho remake is, because it's in color. And the same sentiment, it seems, will be held true for this movie. But take away that little update, and do we have a whole lot of anything that makes this movie better than Romero's 1968 masterpiece? Not really. I'll give an immense amount of credit to Tom Savini. The man, by all standards of his trade, is a genius. His work ranks right along with Rick Baker's. In a cruel twist of fate, the least of the Dead movies have also had the best make-up work. Day of the Dead, a talkative and uneven film at best, has amazing effects. And so does this remake. As with the original, they are sparing, and not as splatter-oriented as the sequels, but they are good. And I'll readily admit that there is an interesting aesthetic to color Zombie movies. But Night of the Living Dead was never really about the gore, the effects, or the Zombies themselves. In fact, go back and watch the original. How much do we really see the Zombies? It's not as though Romero couldn't show more of them. It's that he didn't need to. The movie works well as a claustrophobic horror film. The characters are trapped by a force beyond their control. They don't really understand it, and neither do we. To bring them to full-color, with high quality effects, doesn't really help the movie. Of course, there's the other slight problem. The new ending, and the new treatment of Barbara, don't quite mesh with the old movie. The original messages and ideas begin to get lost, and the new message seems hurried and tacked on. The feminist ideals would be fine in a movie written for them, but this movie wasn't, and they don't completely fit. I'll be the first to admit, though, that this movie can be taken at face value, and enjoyed. Some of it's quite disjointed, but that doesn't detract from the guilty pleasure. It's more entertainment, than anything else. Sometimes funny, and for some, sometimes a bit scary. It may not reach the level of horror that the original did, but it does the Zombies justice. In this age of teeny-bopper horror, maybe that's all we can hope for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barbara's packing heat this time!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Makeup FX master Tom Savini took the role of director for this entertaining remake of George Romero's zombie classic.Strangers must battle armies of zombies when they become isolated in a rural farmhouse.While this remake rather wisely sticks to the basics of the original film, it does differ at some points. Besides being in color and having much more graphic gore, the heroine is much tougher in this version which ultimately leads to a different conclusion than that of Romero's film. Thankfully these changes don't hamper this solid retelling, as it manages to keep the spirit of the original film. The action is strong, the special FX are great, the direction is slick, and there's a nice slice of spooky atmosphere over it all.The cast is a strong point as well. Tony Todd puts on a good performance, as does determined heroine Patricia Tallman. Tom Towles also does a good turn as a truly dis-likable refugee. Supporting cast McKee Anderson, William Butler, and Bill Moseley are also effective.While no horror film will probably ever live up to Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead (1968), this remake certainly doesn't try to. It just serves well as a fun and frightening homage.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: This will be very rant-y, read at your own risk, also contains spoilers. First off, this remake is an insult to the original! Everything chilling about the original is instead poorly parodied as campy, goofy cheese. It's like the writers and directors purposefully set out to lampoon the original and ruin its legacy! Even by 90s standards, this movie it terrible (and that's saying something). The whole movie just screams "low budget", and the writers/director obviously didn't care how the movie turned out, as long as it was finished so hellywood could crank out another by-the-numbers remake. The main character woman magically goes from a helpless feeb into a rambo-esque bad-ass that almost never misses a head shot to a zombie and, at one point, literally just mosies on past all the zombies as she leaves the farm, even though before it was a life and death struggle where she barely escaped from only one or two of them.What really kills the movie for me is how they made it into a liberal politically correct propaganda film. Most of the characters are hillbillies of the worst kind, and at one point they're having an almost carnival-like "county fair" deal, with the movie showing some guy in a ring with a zombie and people taking potshots at zombies strung up on ropes, clearly using the zombies being "victimized" by the hillbillies as an analogy for blacks being lynched/attacked by "racist whiteys". The lead actress even makes an insipid little snark about it, telling the audience that the hillbillies are just as bad or worse as the zombies are.Shame on you, Savini! &gt;:O</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original is a classic as it is the first or one of the first to portray zombies as we know them today, dead humans coming back to life hunting for the flesh of the living. What me always bothered about the original is the characters are not given much background. Here we get to know a bit more about backgrounds and the relations between the characters and that the young couple was actually related to the inhabitants of the house where the group is hiding. Another thing is that in the original Barbara is a vegetable for most of the movie which really got annoying. The remake makes her at least fight maybe a bit too much. I thought her changing into a GI Jane (as if she served in the army) was a bit too radical given I always pictured her as a feminine woman not the tomboy she was here. I prefer the ending of the remake even though still feel sad for Ben but the ending for Mr Cooper was well deserved I think (couldn't help to cheer there) as he was even nastier than in the original. What I miss mostly about this remake that the original got is the creepy atmosphere. I guess the original being in black and white sure helped a lot there as color in my opinion takes away some of that in my opinion. I would say I like both versions equal but I prefer the later Dawn and Day of the Dead (original versions).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>just watched this and thoroughly enjoyed it! same basic plot as the 1968 original, so not particularly surprising, but very well done. savini does some great work here, and the move up to colour enhances the gore effects, which are certainly more gruesome than the first. music is not so good, the original had a better score, and goblin's work is also better, nothing wrong with the score but nothing catchy/moody as could be. one of the best aspects is, of course, watching how quickly people's civilised exteriors fall away under pressure. tallman is notable as a very different, much stronger barbara, another one of the good differences, there is also more time spent on the aftermath as we see more of the rednecks and the remaining humans. recommended.&#xfeff;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing Modern remake of a an absolute Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to a copyright problem, the original film makers of the classic "Night of the Living Dead" made little to no money of the enormous success of the original. This is part of the reason for this remake, so John Russo, George Romero and Russ Streiner could actually make some money that was rightly due to them. Legendary effect master and friend Tom Savini takes over the Director's chair and this remake rolled with a script by Romero. Romero sticks closely to his original storyline of a bunch of people thrown together in a country farm house fighting off the undead. Many of the new cast members look like the old ones and at times the dialog is word for word. There are some differences, with one of the biggest being this one is of course is in color and some of the grit that made the original almost feel like a documentary is missing. Ben is still the main character played this time by the talented Tony Todd but there is a slight twist to his fate this time. Tom Towles as Harry Cooper manages to be just as big a weasel as the original. The biggest change in the entire movie comes in the role of Barbara played by Patricia Tallman. In the original, Barbara is so shocked by the events that happen to her brother and herself she is pretty much in shock the rest of the film and a side character. Barbara this time is a kick ass leader who is on par with Ben and is actually the smartest one of the group. This may have bothered fans of the original but this tougher Barbara fits this modern version and is a welcomed change. With Savini's background as a makeup wizard, this new version could have been a gory blood bath, but Savini shows great control as a director and the movie never goes over the top to its credit. There are solid scares and the makeup and gore is excellent. With some well timed jump scars that work and great zombie design this remake has a lot to offer in the Zombie film genre. Savini wisely knows when to pull back, take the scene in the basement when the zombie girl comes back to life and kills her mother. Romero's original vision resulted in a shocking scene and is one of the most horrific deaths in horror history. Savini recognizes this and doesn't try to top it. Instead, he pays homage to it by showing blood splash on a trowel that is hung on the wall. Classy and well executed. Savini achieves everything he sets out to do with this remake. Does it have the claustrophobic feel or atmosphere of the original? No, how could it? It still is an effective modern zombie film that has scares and memorable scenes. This film allows a newer generation to see an updated version of horror history and is a worthy remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is very good remake of the classic movie, especially since it was directed by Tom Savini. The special effects are done very well, the autopsy zombie is especially gruesome. The movie also has a creepy feel to it, much like the original. The story itself did not change much, and characters retain the same names. This version is also the best one to come out with the same name as the original, and there have been plenty of horrible movies that keep the name of the original. The whole movie is solid and the acting isn't half bad. The violence is very tame though, especially coming from Tom Savini, and I believe it focuses more on human nature more than the violence. I would recommend this movie for George Romero's fans and Tom Savini fans. Very well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Todd and Patricia Tallman star in Tom Savini's 1990 horror remake of George Romero's 1968 classic. This update is slightly different, but basically the same story. It begins with a young woman, Barbara (Tallman) and her brother, Johnny (Bill Moseley) heading to a cemetery to visit their mother's grave. They become attacked by flesh hungry zombies and Barbara barely escapes while Johnny becomes unfortunate. She seeks shelter at an isolated farmhouse nearby and is attacked by more zombies. She soon meets trucker, Ben (Todd) who helps her and together they protect themselves along with a few other people. Savini (Creepshow, From Dusk Til Dawn) wanted to do the make-up effects for Romero's original, but got to helm this version that's also written by Romero. Todd (Candyman) and Tallman (Army of Darkness) are great in it and I like the make-up effects. I recommend this good remake.</fullReview>

I just love horror movies so much that I don't mind sometimes even watching very-low-budget horrors.This movie is not bad but is boring as a remake. To enjoy it, you have to deal with it as if you are watching a good movie again just like when you watch old good ones from your library.The one good scene though in the movie is the one of the naked girl in the car when the zombies eat part of her face before she turns into one herself.

		<shortDescription>What is this? A remake that works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is fair to say that, in zombie movie terms, the original 'Night of the Living Dead' was a classic. Not only was it pretty gory and creepy for its time (hey, it was still the sixties!), but it also carefully alluded to the racial tensions of America at the time. Therefore, it not only cemented its place in the horror hall of fame, but also won praise for its daring social commentary.How could anyone truly do the original justice by remaking it? Well... perhaps one thing that may go a long way is by giving it back to the people who made it to begin with! Yes, zombie overlord George A Romero returns at (well, near) the helm to make sure the remake goes smoothly. If you don't know... the film is about the start of a worldwide zombie epidemic. While society crumbles a rag-tag bunch of people try to survive the night in an abandoned farm house, while trying to fend off seemingly never ending waves of flesh-eating ghouls. Now, that synopsis actually describes both the 1968 version and the 1990 remake. The latter's first selling point is that it sticks to the original concept pretty tightly. In fact, the story is basically a shot-for-shot remake (okay, not 'shot-for-shot' in that depressing 'Psycho' remake, but shot-for-shot enough to keep the basic premise constantly the same).Yes, it has some changes. First of all the remake looks better. It has a higher budget and has a more 'polished' feel to it. Plus all the actors really do play their parts well (some even being improved, in a few cases). Basically, the original is so good, that a remake that simply takes everything that's good at it and just updates its look and feel for a more modern audience isn't such a bad thing.Yes, the original was a classic, simply because it was ? for want of a better word ? original. There had never really been anything like it before, therefore it's stayed the test of time. Yes, it was filmed in black and white (and the 'coloured in' version looked a little odd) so having what is technically a 'properly coloured' version of the same movie is no bad thing.If you were to ask most (a) zombie purists and (b) film critics, they'd probably tell you that nothing could outdo the 1968 version. And, to be fair, they may be right. However, that doesn't stop the 1990 remake being a decent enough little zombie film in its own right. If you like your undead slow, creepy and relentless, give this one a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as scary as the original but still very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this 1990 remake of the scariest film I have ever seen is not anywhere near as scary as the 1968 original, it is still a very good film and has improved with age and repeated viewings. I first saw the original NOLD upon the initial 1968 release at a drive-in, again in 1970 at a drive-in and then not again until around 1980 on VHS video. In the interim I was lucky enough to find and buy the original paperback edition of the 1974 Warner Books novelization. In the remake, Tom Savini does a fine job with the director's chair and the film benefits hugely from two very strong performances from Tony Todd and Patricia Tallman. The make-up effects, on-location filming and music are also all first-rate. It is a very worthwhile film despite being a remake of a true classic. It does not attempt to be equal to or better than the original. It doesn't copy the original scene-for-scene and dialog-for-dialog. Although the plots are indeed very similar, the remake offers some very unexpected twists and enhances some characters while it somewhat changes others. And for those who have seen the original film but not the remake, steer clear of reading spoilers for the remake's ending. It was a touch of pure genius and won't be at all what you will be expecting. See the remake but don't compare it to the original classic. It stands very well on its own merits and even compliments and pays homage and tribute to the 1968 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review from someone who never saw the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like zombie movies in general and so was curious to see a remake of the seminal film that ignited the genre. I can't compare to the original material as I haven't seen it, but I thought that by itself, the remake was still a very good film. I thought there was intensity, surprises and disturbing moments, and not because of the relatively little amount of gore. I think Tony Todd (the only "living" Black actor here) offered a strong tormented performance that made his character's plight more poignant. He's a severely underestimated actor in my eyes. Patricia Tallman, the redhead, had a fascinating character story arc and she pulled it off in a competent yet not outstanding fashion. Tom Towles in a great performance as Cooper played a selfish man you really loved to hate. Whenever he was interacting with the others, especially Todd, there were lots of psychological tension that made the pressure more intense.The "action" scenes involving the zombies were not particularly dynamic or gruesome (perhaps it's because I'm desensitized from having watched too many horror flicks ;-), but such was not the point. I sometimes found the zombies pitiful and pathetic, and I thought they moved very well, "in-character" so to speak, all compliments. The intentionally grotesque zombies with minimal make-up effects were not the stars or the main menace here, it was more about survivors in extreme conditions and especially human nature. In that regard, the ending was not only morally powerful and satisfying, I found it pretty memorable. Night of the Living Dead has a limited scope (mostly in an isolated house) and non-spectacular zombies, but it still packs a bite and is definitely worth watching for the psychological thriller/horror fan. I think it shows that the original creator, Romero, was actively involved in the production.Rating: 7.5 out of 10 (Very good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BETTER Than The Original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very unfairly written off in favor of the original but I think that is a result of people thinking it's a bad idea to even try and remake the 1968 version. I not only find this to be one of the finest horror movies of all time but I believe this version is superior in almost every way to the original.Night of the Living Dead follows the same storyline as the first one. The recently dead are coming back to life and a small group of strangers must hide from the zombies in a country house.The acting is not Oscar quality, but it is definitely better than the original. The characterization in this version is much better than the first one. Barbara is an interesting character, which she wasn't in the first one, and she even ends up being the most level-headed of all. The back and forth between Cooper and Ben is much better as they both make good points and are both portrayed as being unreasonable at times. In the original Ben basically pushed Cooper around the whole movie.The action is definitely better in this one and that may just be a result of how far apart the two were. Most notably would be the scene at the gas pump which was nearly incomprehensible in the original. The scenes with zombies trying to get in are much more excited and realistic. And of course the zombies look much better.I even prefer the ending in this one, even though that was one of the more original elements of the first one. This one may be more crowd pleasing but I find it more interesting and even more ironic.So if your going to see one of the two Night of the Living Dead movies I suggest you watch this one and if you've seen the first one you should watch this one so you can decide for yourself which version you prefer. You may find this to be superior as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not one bit scary, but it is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. The one liners are unbelievable.If you haven't seen it I can't explain it to you, but if you have you know what I'm talking about. There are so many unnecessary lines and actions that make no sense. For example when they are getting doors upstairs to nail the windows down, to prove that the wood on one door was bad Ben punched through a door. Completely unnecessary, but funny if you watch the movie. It's also funny to hear him say " You know what, Cooper, I've only been around you a minute or two, but that's enough time for me to decide that I don't like you very much." It's funny hearing him say Coopa over and over. One of my favorite lines is "Cooper, I've got a shotgun out here. Open this door, you mother****er, or I swear to God I'll blow it to s***." It's also ridiculous to see Ben beat up about 10 or 15 zombies by himself. Maybe I'm the only one who sees the movie like this, but this is the way I felt about the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This flick does compare to the original. The first version, because it was in B&amp;W, was much more surreal and scary. And the acting was a lot better. This one had no originality and was just a re-hash of the first one. And of course, to be politically correct, this one had to have a female hero, taking on the zombies. Naahhh.</fullReview>

All the movie does repeat the same things what happened in the old movie. Like locking theirselves inside of their own house.Does that gets boring after awhile??? And the actors stink.

		<shortDescription>Sufficiently different to be worth a look, although of course it's not a patch on the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, it has to be said that I generally don't condone remakes, unless they are done for a point. Especially in today's world where such classics as PSYCHO and THE HAUNTING are being remade for money and nothing else, it seems a bit greedy and unoriginal that we have to seek inspiration from films 40 years old. Of course, there are a few exceptions where the remakes actually surpass the original film (THE FLY, THE BLOB, and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS to name but three). NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD doesn't surpass the original, far from it, but it is a pleasing, entertaining film if you don't compare it too harshly with the 1968 classic (or indeed, haven't seen it!).There are numerous differences between the two films. Romero's original had important social commentary, while the 1990 version lacks that and thus appears to have the moral messages overemphasised. The newer version is also in colour, in order to appeal more to today's audiences. I have no problem with this at all. The look of the film is very good, with the colours adding to the overall glossy feel (which doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing). I did see the film in a widescreen version which may explain the reason I like the look of it so much. Director Tom Savini (famous in the early '80s for his gory special effects work) includes numerous stylistic touches in his film to differentiate it from the original (such as the severed hand shot). It may not be as powerful as the '60s classic but it's quite entertaining. There are a lot of shock scenes involving the zombies, as to be expected, but also by contrast we have generally atmospheric build ups too.The film benefits from having a relatively unknown cast of more than competent actors. Patricia Tallman plays Barbara firstly as the snivelling wreck we know from the original, but then as a gun-toting killer, more in line with Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ripley from ALIENS than anybody else. This is something of a welcome, if clichéd change. Tony Todd, best known to audiences as the frightening hook-handed villain from the CANDYMAN films, is actually excellent in his role of the young drifter and admirably fills the shoes left by Duane Jones. He brings a genuine warmth to his tragic character, who is doing what he believes his right, and we can sympathise with him because of this. Tom Towles is also notable as the manic Harry, and is totally obnoxious. He overacts a lot here and it's great fun to watch the shouting matches between him and Todd.Surprisingly, although the film is violent it is actually quite tame compared to other zombie offerings (notably DAY OF THE DEAD). In fact there is little gore in the film, which comes as something of a surprise and a bit of a disappointment. I was looking forward to some more of the excess gore we have come to expect from Tom Savini but not this time around. This film is nowhere near as horrific or powerful as Romero's original - which may have you asking what the point is. It is, though, a fleshed-out, entertaining zombie romp, which is nicely filmed, has a good cast, and has enough action scenes in it to keep the boredom from setting in. My only complaint would be the comedic scenes at the beginning of the film, especially as regards the zombies, but these disappear as the film takes a more downbeat tone as it nears the finale. Not to everybody's taste, and criticised by horror fans, some of whom consider it a sacrilege, I find it very watchable and a mildly successful 1990s remake. I would ignore the many detractors of this film and instead give it a go. Who knows, you might even like it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George A. Romero wrote the screenplay again, and Tom Savini, who was in charge of the effects for Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Day of the Dead (1985), takes over the directing chair this time.This movie takes a fresh new look at the original characters. And I think that it takes the already good characters and updates them accordingly. Most noticeable is the change between the Barbra's. In the first one Barbra becomes almost catatonic and was a very interesting psychologically. But this one she becomes much more independent and almost forms the background of the group. Now aside from the characters, this movie doesn't really add anything to the original. So it improves on the characters but the parts similar to the original that were already great aren't changed or made better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i admired the fact that they remade this film for the 1990s and did a pretty good job with the end result. relying more on dialogue than just sheer gore and violence to keep the audience's attention, this film is definitely worth a second look. it was nice to see the main character named only as barbara develop from a once meek and frightened thing into a strong-willed, feisty and independent person who can hold her own against the hordes of the un-dead. she starts thinking for herself and finding different tactics to over-come the zombies as they descend on the small farmhouse she is holed up in with several other survivors. upon finding refuge, she meets another line survivor named ben played by tony todd famous for his role in the horror franchise candyman. i respected ben's take charge attitude and not letting anyone tell him differently. he always kept everyone in line and was open to suggestions and ideas on how they can continue to survive in such desperate times. tom towles who has a knack for portraying sleazy and despicable characters does a great turn as harry cooper, a man you love to hate. he merely scoffs at the others as they try their hardest to keep their spirits up and find means of survival. while he mocks and ridicules their ideas, he does nothing in aiding them except insisting the safest part of the farmhouse is the basement where his wife and ill child are being kept. one is just itching for someone to kill him off but you know by the end he's going to get what's coming to him one way or another. i however, did not like the character of judy rose who i found was just annoying and grating on the nerves. for most of the picture she's just screaming, crying and having a lengthy emotional breakdown while doing little else. it's difficult to sympathize with her as most of the time you just want to slap her to shut her up. i was thankful when she finally got killed off towards the end. otherwise a fine and intelligent update of a classic zombie flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent if unnecessary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1990 remake of the 1968 zombie classic comes as a pleasant surprise. Director Tom Savini follows the original closely, almost scene for scene, but with the addition of color photography and a gun-toting female lead. The original's shell-shocked heroine always annoyed me. A young Tony Todd stars. The zombies are nicely done and reasonably scary, and Savini surprised me by making the film slightly less gory than one might have expected. There is one funny moment, when the heroine keeps clobbering a fat bald zombie over the head with a fireplace poker. It is plain that the guy's head, seen from the back, is just a rubber prosthetic. Instead of splitting the guy's skull in two, the poker continually bounces off his head. Watch for the final hit as this particular zombie goes down for the count. It is priceless. It's every bit as funny as the scene in the original where the zombies, in closeup, eat various parts of some folks who were burned to a crisp in a truck fire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dead walk again in this remake, which isn't quite forgettable, but it's still nothing to get worked up about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero's original 1968 horror masterpiece "Night of the Living Dead" is just that - a horror masterpiece, and a bona-fide landmark horror film that gave birth to an entire sub-genre of horror. Romero followed it up 10 years later in 1978 with the superior sequel "Dawn of the Dead," my personal favorite horror movie of all time and my favorite zombie movie of all time. 1985 saw the premiere of the second sequel, the somber yet effective "Day of the Dead," and concluded the series with "Land of the Dead" (2005). 2007 saw the high-tech, revisionist "Diary of the Dead."We know that in 1968, seven people barricaded themselves inside a decrepit farmhouse on the Pennsylvania countryside from the hordes of flesh-hungry zombies on the outside. And in 1990, Romero approached his right-hand special effects man Tom Savini to direct the remake of his 1968 landmark horror masterpiece.The two best things that can be said about Savini's remake is that the special effects and gore are better and the acting is slightly improved and the characters are a bit smarter than those in the original (though this can be explained by the fact that 22 years passed between 1968 and 1990, which was more than enough time for zombie lore to be effectively fleshed out by zombie movie fan sub-culture, and the filmmakers rightfully took a few of their cues from the source material).Like a lot of remakes, "Night of the Living Dead" is pretty by-the-numbers all the way through and neatly repeats many of the most significant events of the original. However, there are a few differences, some of them are actually quite good, while others are not-so-good. For example, the film's heroine Barbara (Patricia Tallman) is no longer the near-catatonic screamer she was in the original. Here she eventually "nuts up" (so to speak) and learns to carry a rifle (and later a revolver) in order to effectively defend herself and others from the legions of the living dead trying to munch on warm human flesh. (It's the work of some post-"Aliens" cinematic feminism at work here.)Ben (Tony Todd, the understated and underused actor who would later play Candyman is an adequate substitute for the late Duane Jones, but doesn't approach the late actor's intensity or heroism) leads the survivors because he is the only one with a level head and a truck with a near-empty tank of gas as their only means of transportation. He's also quick and resourceful and brave, qualities a lot of his cohorts don't share. (Duane Jones was also notable in the original for being the strong black hero, with no reference made to his skin color.) Of course, he butts heads with the arrogant Harry Cooper (Tom Towles), who was hiding in the cellar with his wife Helen (McKee Anderson), injured daughter Sarah (Heather Mazur), and a young couple named Tom (William Butler) and Judy Rose (Katie Finneran). Tom and Judy Rose both make themselves useful in helping to barricade the house from the zombies outside along with Barbara once she snaps out of her catatonia state.To be fair to Savini, he does a good job of mounting the tension and dread from the get-go. But where he falters is the by-the-numbers plot; I would think that Romero would take a few hints to not be so by-the-numbers in writing the screenplay to a remake of his own film. Of course, since this is Savini's film, after all, the special effects are top-notch. The zombies here all look like they were once living people, and the spectacular make-up effects employed here are skillful in making them look like real-life walking cadavers. The effects also give way to some pretty startling imagery, such as one zombie that is seen carrying a baby doll and another who was clearly a heroin junkie and is seen with a telltale needle dangling out of his arm.When the movie ends, it's the same as the original, but some details are quite different because Savini's film ends on a slightly more positive note, with some ham-fisted social commentary (about Us being not-so-different from Them) for good measure."Night of the Living Dead" is not a bad film because it does have some significant improvements from the original, but like most remakes it was unnecessary and seemed to be a bit of a cash-grab. Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" was remade in 2004 by Zack Snyder; true zombie movie fans and fans of Romero's original need to check it out because it scared the living daylights out of me when I first saw it. "Day of the Dead" also received a very poor direct-to-video remake in 2008.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>''They're us. We're them and they're us.''</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Specialist make-up FX maestro Tom Savani (who was involved in Romero's sequels 'Dawn' and 'Day') would helm the 90's b-grade remake of the 1968 George Romero influential classic b/w zombie horror 'Night of the Living Dead'. What big boots to fill, but Savani's craftsmanship is earnestly pull off by keeping it quite faithful (same idea, little changes) with only the last 10 minutes deciding to put a spin on its original sources. The angle it went for in the dying stages was effectively pitched with some striking imagery and a blunt message on society. Other than the opening stages (with Bill Moseley chanting "They're coming to get you, Barbara!"), it's probably the most interesting act in the film too. Even though I enjoyed it, something still seemed to be missing? possibly atmosphere. Less moodily dark atmospherics, more glaringly forceful jolts and gory flesh. The special effects and make-up FX was simply first-rate, but while the simple, grim plot ensures an air tight build-up it never really struck any sort of dread induced intensity or even thrilling urgency. In the end it was less threatening, and didn't have the punch. The original was much cheaper, but benefited from that rawness. The tension stewed from the pressure and stress between the characters with some riveting clashes of egos. Tony Todd is an obvious standout with that imposing presence and booming voice in what is an unyielding performance as Ben. Tom Towles is great as the pig-headed Gary Cooper. These two really did hold you there, even though the script is rather wonky with some questionable aspects. Patricia Tallman gives a fine performance as Barbara? but this is a different type of Barbara to the 60s take, which could be a disappointment. The rest of the theatrical performances are suitably tailored. Respectable update on Savani's part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not fault Romero for the way the original looked, but you can tell it had a really low budget and it looks kind of choppy in places. This film makes up for that and has a nice look to it, just a shame it is not nearly as gory as other zombie films like "Dawn of the Dead" and "Day of the Dead" or even lesser known Italian zombie films of the late 70's and early 80's. The story is sort of the same, with just enough differences to keep it interesting and not look like a carbon copy remake where it is the old virtual shot by shot deal. So we get the zombies attacking and survivors trying to hold up in a house in the middle of nowhere. We have are arguing that ensues about where the best place to hide is and we have the poor sick child that has been bitten by one of the undead outside and of course we have the speculation about what those outside are as well. Differences are plenty though as the attack scenes on the house seem faster than the original and the lead female is not some very spaced out girl who lacks any and all survival skills. Also, the ending is very different and more to my liking than the original as well. The highlight in the movie though has to be the little girl scene as that looks creepy and is very good in this version of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, though seemingly useless, remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In rural Pennsylvania, a group of average people gather together in a farmhouse to fight off the undead hordes taking over the area.Night of the Living Dead (1968) is my favourite film of all time. I've had the 1990 remake for a long time, but have only watched it once. The first time I saw it, I remembered nothing but mediocrity, and shortly thereafter became embittered that they attempted to mess with the film at all. Then, I saw Night of the Living Dead 3-D and I got a little more respect for the 1990 remake, seeing as it's not one of the worst horror films of all time (and NotLD3D is). So, I decided to revisit it. This first remake is not a bad film. But it's just not very good either. I think the majority of my dislike for it comes from its very 'TV-movie feel': From the direction/cinematography, the acting, and even the credits. . . it just feels like some kind of gory Hallmark Showcase or something. The gore &amp; makeup are well done, even though Tom Savini didn't do them. Overall, as a remake, it's hard to consider overly excellent as it's essentially a subpar clone of the perfect original. On its own, however, it's a good zombie flick that should be watched as a separate piece to be enjoyed. Unfortunately, due to its lack of straying from the original, it's hard to view as special.Final verdict: 6/10.-AP3-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Savini didn't need to remake this movie, but I don't think anyone's complaining. First of all, we have full Savini zombie effects, in color. And despite what critics think, it's awesome to look at. Secondly, just listen to this cast. Tony Todd (Candyman) is Ben this time around. Tom Towles, who played Otis in "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" plays Tom. Bill Mosely (Choptop from Texas Chainsaw Massacre II) is in the movie early as the ill fated Johnnie. And to top it off, the only man to be killed by Jason Voorhees, Leatherface, and zombies, veteran Bill Butler plays Tom, complete with a Pittsburgh Steelers hat.So is the story different? No. Not really. Everyone ends up in an abandoned farmhouse again. This time, Barbara is much stronger, and far less catatonic, thanks to great work from Patricia Tallman. The same basic chain of events happen. Ben and Barbara bar up the doors in the house, then a group of people in the basement come out and introduce themselves. Harry and Ben bicker about whether or not to go to the basement. Once again, they decide to take a truck out, which needs gas, which Tom goes to get and of course, blows himself up.This time however, Harry and Ben start shooting at each other. Ben goes downstairs after being hit and Harry goes to the attic. So, Barbara just decides to leave. She goes outside and teams up with those trusty Western PA gun slinging rednecks in different kinds of zombie killing games, including hanging the zombies and throwing rocks at them, as well as randomly shooting them. Hoo-ray. As far as social commentary goes, this scene pretty much has the most, as Barbara mutters, "They're us. We're them and they're us." But the movie really isn't too preachy. It's a gory fun mess.So she goes back to the house safely, as the zombies are either too slow or just plain outnumbered. Inside she finds Ben, who is now a zombie. But what's even better is finding Harry alive, not a zombie. Does she help him? No. She shoots him. Good for her, because that guy, I have to say, was a real prick.So that's the remake. Was it necessary? Not at all. But it was a blast to watch. And really, it didn't take anything away from the original, in the way that the "Dawn of the Dead" remake would tarnish the original years later.__________________________________ For all of the Horror Banana's reviews, visit http://morozov924.hubpages.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as remakes go this one is pretty good. In fact the movie far more polished than the original. That said, there are some aspects of this film compared to its original that I didn't like. SPOILERS AHEAD! 1. No mutilated lady upstairs. That was an important element in setting the mood of the original film. 2. None of the characters are very likable, ie. Ben seems just as unreasonable as Harry. Tom comes off as a dolt. Judy is whinny, Barbara Has some unexplained childhood mommy issues that lend to her inner rage. The sheriff comes off as a complete unprofessional, in fact the hole posse portrayal as a bunch gun nuts at a sporting event seems quite unrealistic. The sense of urgency doesn't seem to quite match the original film. Everyone seems to act like they are inconvenienced by the situation. Don't get me wrong, the acting is light years ahead of the 68 version, just a little over the top in spots. The most glaring difference is the films conclusion. In the original the irony was that the cellar was after all the safest place. In this film it seems that the outdoors is the safest place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie Classic Rises from the Grave in Not-Too-Shabby Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most remakes, spin-offs and rip-offs of George A. Romero's original "Dead" trilogy, the 1990 remake of "Night of the Living Dead" didn't exactly need to be made. Sure, the original pre-dates it by a good 20+ years and audiences are always seemingly thirsty to see a good thing come back from the dead again and again, but as it stands, Romero's seminal zombie opus is still pretty darn perfect. Nevertheless, special effects maestro Tom Savini (who worked with Romero on both "Dawn of the Dead" and "Day of the Dead") took a stab at the material and with the blessing of Romero himself (who also rewrote the script and served as a producer) set to craft his own take on the undead epic.So how does it fare? Well, the updated "Night" is hardly brain-dead or DOA (whichever dead analogy you choose to use). For the most part, Savini's version stays pretty true to the source material, only deviating in a few spots to keep things fresh and interesting. The film hits pretty much all the basic beats of the original: cannibal corpses spring to life for no apparent reason and corner a rag-tag band of survivors in a secluded country house. Domestic disputes and racial tension rears its ugly head as the group winds up hurting itself more than their would-be predators.With Tom Savini at the helm, it's expected that the film should be a blood and gore bonanza; however, such is not the case. While the effects here are (mostly) top-notch, Savini keeps things relatively tame, letting the characters and their predicament take center-stage. The first-time director gives the film a quick, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants pace and handles it all with enough of a sense of dread and tension to make the grandfather of zombie films proud. Unfortunately, Savini doesn't reel in his actors enough, and from time to time the cast seems bound to choke on the chunky dialog they spew. The group is almost a "who's who" of late '80s/early '90s horror, with the likes of Tony Todd, Bill Moseley, Tom Towles and William Butler, but unfortunately some awkward performances here and there threaten to squash any fanboyish joy that can be drawn from their presence. On the flipside, the character of Barbara is seemingly injected with steroids as Patricia Tallman gives the former damsel-in-distress the Sarah Connor treatment. The Barbara of the '90s is a much needed addition with Tallman pretty much saving and stealing every scene she is in.Overall, the makeover given to "Night of the Living Dead" is a decent if underwhelming affair. Like so many remakes before it, it fails to greatly improve upon its source material, nearly rendering itself moot. Compared to the disastrous 2008 remake of "Day of the Dead" and the over-rated Zack Snyder-helmed "Dawn of the Dead," Tom Savini's take is rather harmless and, for lack of a better term, adequate. Nothing touches the original, and even Romero himself has stumbled in his effort to top his masterpiece(s), so take this one for what it's worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost as Good as the Original!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago, my family and I returned late from a long car trip. It was around 2 in the morning and even though I was tired, I found that I wasn't ready for bed yet. So, turning on the TV, I stopped on USA and saw that they were having NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD on. At the time, not yet being the zombie fan I am today, I shrugged and figured "Why not?" From that terror-filled evening on, I became a loyal follower (aka DEADITE) of all things zombie! To this day, some sixteen years later, it still holds a candle for me! Normally, I'm one who hates remakes, considering them pointless. Most of the time, you get the feeling that filmmakers of remakes are saying "The original sucks in some way, so I'm gonna do it better." And most of the time, their work is worse. However, NOTLD 90 (as I call it) is a remake done right! What's brilliant about good remakes is that they respect the original work, but then take the concept in new directions. In many ways, a good remake is an alternate story. Acting in NOTLD 90 is top-notch. Tony Todd (AKA: Candyman) delivers his best performance as Ben. Opposite him, Patricia Tallman is equally good as Barbara, now a lot tougher as Romero originally intended! Having Romero as Executive Producer and screenwriter may be the reason for this remake's success. Because now, Romero has the rare opportunity of trying new things, intensifying the in-fighting between characters, altering the fates of various characters, and eliminating the need for all that unnecessary "Venus Space Probe" explanation from the original. This time around, everyone is dropped into the middle of a situation where nobody knows what's happening. But even a good remake doesn't come without a price. In NOTLD 68, we were faced with a group of ordinary people, no heroes or villains. Throughout the entire film, they kept making mistakes and ultimately wound up dooming themselves because they couldn't stop warring against each other. In NOTLD 90, we still have a group of individuals. But now, as the movie goes on, there seems to be a clear distinction between the heroic ones and villainous ones. In terms of on-screen blood and guts? Surprisingly, this is the tamest zombie film in my opinion. In NOTLD 68, Romero set the bar for modern horror films with zombies munching on body parts, blood dripping down walls, and showing us man's inhumanity to man. In NOTLD 90, we only get a few scenes of zombies feasting, no-one gets pulled apart, no zombie limbs get ripped off, etc. Ultimately though, this remake retains the power of the original and is a good start for anyone interested in become a fellow Deadite!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whereas Zack Snyder's recent remake of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead utilised only the bare bones of the original's script, Tom Savini's 90s version of Romero's Night of the Living Dead took far fewer liberties with its plot, opening almost exactly like the '68 horror classic?with a brother and sister being attacked by the undead in a rural graveyard?and rarely straying from the original for the rest of its duration (bar a few subtle tweaks to keep things interesting).However, although the film will undoubtedly feel extremely familiar to fans of the 'Dead' series, there is still much to enjoy about Savini's effort, and it is highly recommended viewing nonetheless.Patricia Tallman plays Barbara, a young woman who seeks refuge in a farmhouse after the dead begin returning to life to devour the living. She is soon joined by natural leader Ben (Candyman's Tony Todd), who snaps Babs out of her catatonic state and begins to formulate a plan for survival. Problems arise, however, when more survivors emerge from the cellar and personalities begin to clash.Savini's direction is workmanlike, but certainly does the trick as far as delivering the scares. Surprisingly, he doesn't allow gore to overpower the action, preferring to concentrate on characterisation and atmosphere instead (in fact, what little bloodletting there is tends to be rather restrained and those seeking excessive amounts of entrail eating would be better off looking elsewhere).The cast are uniformly excellent, with Todd and Tallman making likable heroes, and Tom Towles being throughly despicable as a cowardly father; even the zombies are very good, with their awkward undead shuffling being quite convincing (so many films in this genre fail thanks to laughable zombie movements, don'tcha think?). The make-up is also rather nifty, with the ghouls sporting not-too-OTT dead complexions and hideous milky eyes, and several of the corpses featuring some nice individual touches (there's a drug-addict corpse with a needle in its arm, and one with a knife in his chest).After plenty of exciting action, and some knuckle biting fracases between bickering blokes, Savini closes his film with a twist ending that differs slightly from Romero's original, but delivers just as much of a punch to the gut.This version of Night of the Living Dead might not have been absolutely necessary, but considering that so many remakes end up being rather disappointing, fans of zombie films should be grateful that this one ended up in the hands of someone so knowledgeable and reverent of the genre. Thanks Tom! 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable but unneeded remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why? The original Night of the Living Dead is a classic horror film. Why remake it? Although the acting, makeup and production values are higher than in the original, this remake is flat. It's not scary which is a cardinal sin for a horror film.Most of the plot is lifted from the original. There are a few new ideas and the ending has been substantially altered. The acting is not embarrassingly bad as it was in the original. Some of the FX bodies look like rubber, particularly the severed hand which the female lead deals with early in the film.This was not nearly as bad as I expected and it is watchable. With inevitable comparison to the original, this has to fall short as almost all remakes do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Romero's monochromatic creation found me at a tender age, when all but the blackened November sky frightened me. By far my favorite "undead" movie. To this day I have seen nothing close to how intensely real that movie felt. It's also a great "date" movie, I love being scared, and nothing scares me more than the normal people you see everyday limping around your front yard, gnawing at you and peeling flesh from corpses. The black and white in this film only adds to the ambiance of dread, when every corner of darkness comes to life. The nerve pinching terror when your life is close to it's end is awe inspiring talent. A talent I have yet to see again.. The horror genre's foundation to greater heights was truly established when this film took to screen.</fullReview>

I know there were other amusing bits, but it's been years since I've seen it... In any case, it sounds like it's fairly true to the original (which I've never seen) and all, but I recommend going into it with tongue in cheek.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the black and white one, it copies almost every element of it. It has a good deal of suspense, pretty good acting, great special effects, and all the zombies you can handle.What makes the movie boring after a few views is the fact that it's very predictable. You always know what's going to happen. Plus, the whole damn movie is filmed in a house. Also, Cooper and Ben are always fighting, taking you away from the plot.I recommend renting this film to see if you want to buy it.Rating: 6 out of 10"This is Hell on earth.

		<shortDescription>A night to remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original NOTLD about two weeks ago and thought it was amazingly bleak for it's era. It was a shame that it was limited by some factors. For one, the effects were a tad primitive, no matter how good they were. It also shows it's age in a sense, as the styles of clothing, mannerisms of speech, etc. seem dated now. It was also marred by a huge injustice: It was never properly registered and fell into the public domain, and therefore fell prey to bootlegs and ripoffs. This remake was fueled by the desire for a copyright claim on the title by the original creators, Romero and Russo. While this may seem like the kind of project that can fall victim to greed and neglect, but in Tom Savini's directorial hands and Romero's updated scriptwriting, the film ends up perhaps superior to the original. Despite following the original plot point by plot point, the film adds superior effects, great acting, a STRONG LEAD in BARBARA, who in the original was catatonic, a stronger dramatic climax, color (which may or may not have helped), great action sequences and a much better ending in my opinion (no, not a happy ending, simply a good one.) One other thing that makes this film great that shouldn't be overlooked is the character development. Cooper, a real nasty SOB in the original, is still a complete jerk, but he isn't evil. Just misguided. In one scene, he secretly takes a TV from the top floor of the house downstairs. He is caught by Ben, our protagonist and Cooper's polar opposite, who thinks Cooper is trying to take the TV downstairs into the basement for himself. After a scuffle, the TV is smashed, and Cooper says, "I wasn't taking it downstairs! It can't get any reception in the basement!" He just wanted to see what was going on. Tom is also much more developed. In the original, he simply existed, got a tender scene with his girl friend and died. He was established as a nice guy and that's it. Here, he actually seems like the moral compass of the group in a sense. He's afraid, but he won't deny it. He just wants to help, and he's coping as best as he can. Barbara is the biggest character change. In the original, she is attacked by zombies and falls into a catatonic state for the rest of the film until her death. Here, she's the strong lead, the one who understands that the zombies are SLOW, and she's also the one to survive by the end. If you saw the original or at least want to see a good zombie movie, this is a great place to start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wanting to re-visit the genre he created, George Romero approached Tom Savini to direct a remake of his 1968 masterpiece, Night of the Living Dead.While the film follows the original closely, it does have some important changes. Notably the character of Barbara is no longer a gibbering vegetable but now much more balanced. Other changes help blend the film much better into Romeros Dawn and Day. The use of tools by the zombies for example, is lessened and removed at times, creating more continuity between Night, Dawn, Day and Lands time-line of the undead's abilities.Some seem to automatically shoot down the remake in favor of the original, I've watched this version almost as many times as Dawn and Day, and believe the film tops the original in almost every way.Although the groundbreaking nature of the original will always remain, Savini's Dead is a without doubt a classic Zombie flick and in my opinion a perfect first chapter in the Romero Dead series.Rated R for Graphic Violence and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually remakes are terrible, but not in this case. Savini had Romero on board as a producer and really did not deviate from the original NOTLD. He found a way to mordernize the film and stay true to it's integrity. He did change things a little mostly the ending but did it a way that left Romaro fans very happy. Savini's respect for George Romero is seen in this remake. Weather it is Martin or Dawn of the dead the Savini/Romero team really shine. The movie opens much like the original and stay's remotely close to the original movie for most of the film. Of course Savini throws in his own changes and the final plot twist is different from the original NOTLD. Savini show's promise as a horror movie director here and as always the special affects are great for the era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>waste of time. great zombies, but poor acting..not realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie stinks. And I mean it. I'm a big fan of zombie movies in general, and I've seen most of them. Also Lucio Fulci's, Lamberto Bava's Demons 1 and 2,return of the living dead, the last man on the earth, fear in the city of the living dead, 20 days later, and many many more. Well, this movie just doesn't make any sense to me. The original was better. I gave it a 4 just because the makeup and zombie acting was very realistic. Everything else was very poor. The acting was awful. People freak, and panic totally, then in the next scene they learn how to use a rifle, aim for the head and then shoot, in perfect synchronism, and as if they did it 1000 times before. I wonder how many people out of 5 can handle, reload and fire a 1980's rifle. How many would know that the bullets need to go upside down from a small entrance almost at the tip of the rifle. Yeah right...anyways, this was just one of the many things that stinked. Another thing was the poor fighting skills that Ben (the black guy) suddenly has when fighting with tho old and fat and clumsy cooper. Ben seems to fight pretty well against even 10 zombies with his bare hands, but with cooper, (which my 10 year old brother could beat up with a pillow, he suddenly becomes clumsy and weak, and almost gets his ass kicked...bah... What about the brother of Barbara at the beginning of the movie? When he falls and hits the rock, you can clearly see that its just a plastic model, worse than the ones they use in stores to put clothes on...come on Savini, you can do better than that... And what about this facts??Crew or equipment visible: After Ben shoves a body out the kitchen door, you can see a cameraman's reflection in the door window.Continuity: The blood smudge on Barbara's cheek changes shape several times.Continuity: The string that pulls the stairs to the attic down is not seen until the very end. It is not present in any other scenes where they are upstairs.Plot holes: Barbara is wearing glasses in the first scene, but loses them after the first zombie attack. Never again, for the rest of the movie, is she hindered by not having her glasses on.Just to mention a few!!! How about how they board the wood on the windows??? they put 2 nails close to each other on the top, and thats it...oh yeah that Will hold zombies, man, good job..lets have a beer now...loosers...just 4 screws, one at each corner of the doors they use to board things up, would be able to stop those stupid corpses but NO, they have to mess that up as well...OK...whatever...even return of the living dead 1 and 2 were better than this movie...and they already are pretty pathetic...at least some scenes are funny... wanna see a good zombie movie? give me the same budget as night of the living dead, and Ill give you something better than this piece of junk. Sorry Savini, you should stay in the prop department, and not behind the camera...some shots were good, the lighting was good...but in a movie the acting is the most important thing, and here its very lame! What a good zombie movie for my taste you ask? dawn of the dead aka zombie, the original 1978 by G a. Romero... the 2004 remake was just OK... but why make zombies run?? also 28 days later was OK...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll never watch it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my friends is a huge fan of all kinds of horror movies, especially of George A. Romero's work, and he said that I definitely had to watch one of his movies once. I'm normally not too much a fan of horror movies about the living dead and I'm pretty sure that I would never have watched it if he hadn't insisted. But I trust him in his judgement, because he also told me to watch "The Evil Dead" once and I must say that I did like that one. So despite the fact that I'm not a fan of this genre, I gave this movie a try, not yet knowing that this was the remake of the classic.When a young woman and her brother want to visit the grave of their recently deceased mother, they are confronted with people who attack them while being in some kind of trance. For a reason we don't know, the dead have returned to life and attack the living as their prey, using them for food. The woman escapes and manages to reach a farmhouse where other people have taken refuge. While the living dead seem to come with hundreds from everywhere, they will have to try to stay alive until the next morning...I don't know what the original movie is like, but this one was just laughable. The performances were far from good as the zombies looked ridiculous, the men only seemed to be shouting and sweating all the time and the women only seemed to be able to scream. There was absolutely nothing remarkable about their performances and the same can be said about the story. You don't know why these zombies attack, where they come from, how they managed to get back to life,... You don't know anything about them except for the fact that they prey on humans.There is absolutely no tension to be found in the movie and the acting and the story are very weak. If I ever get to see the original version, I'll give it a try to compare both, but I already know that I'll never watch this version ever again. I give it a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Entertaining Remake from the Original 1968 film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this faithful remake of the 1968 original "Night of the Living Dead" is satisfyingly enough to overcome sereval flaws moments of this remake. The remake is directed by George A. Romero long time friend:Tom Savini (Who is best known for his Make-Up effects work). The remake is penned by George A. Romero (Bruiser, The Dark Half), who re-wrote his original screenplay from the 1968 film. Which Romero wrote with John A. Russo back in 1968. The remake has a few new ideals with a different third act.The remake has basically the same story about Barbara (Patrica Tallman) and her wise-cracking brother-Johnny (Bill Moseley) went to the graveyard to visit their Mother's grave. When Barbara is attacked by a strange man. Her brother tries to save her but he ended getting killed. She runs away to a nearby farmhouse and she finds herself with a sensitive but tough African American man (Tony Todd). Thinking that they are safe in that farmhouse but once it turns night. Barbara and Ben, their world turns upside down, because these strange people are trying to get in the house.Then later... Barbara and Ben finds out that they are not alone in the house. When they find themselves with five other people (Tom Towles, McKee Anderson, William Bulter, Katie Finnerman and Heather Mazur). Thinking that they might have more hope but one of the survivors in the house finds out that these strange people are actually the living dead coming back to life and attacking (and eating) the living.This film is a scene for scene remake of the Disturbing Original until near the end. Only difference, the remake is color with a tougher heroine and more potent violence. But the film in the film, it has almost none of the impact from the 1968 movie. This is familiar territory for Romero and Savini. Producers of the original 1968 film-Russell Streiner and John A. Russo are also producing this remake. Originally, this was not the film that Romero and Savini intended to be. In fact 30 to 40 % of George A. Romero's Screenplay wasn't filmed, because of Budgetary Reasons. Most people hated this remake, when it first came out (even i hated it). But over the years, the remake got better, thanks to sharp performances by Todd, Tallman and Towles.The music score by Paul McCollough is a mixed bag. Sometimes the score works and sometimes it doesn't. But it does have a good music score at the end credits. Savini does let his actors overact at sereval tense moments, which almost makes the film funny unintentionally. This is certainly a flawed remake but better than expected. The remake of "Dawn of the Dead" is more successful than the "Night of the Living Dead" remake. DVD Quality of "Night of the Living Dead" remake is very good with an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (also in Pan &amp; Scan). The Dolby 2.0 Surround is good and clear sounding. The DVD has an commentary track by Savini (Which the Commentary has some dead air, Savini should have someone with him in the Commentary like Romero). The DVD has an amusing 25 minute feautrette and the original trailer. This is not the best horror remake but Romero and Savini come very close. If they filmed the entire screenplay from Romero, maybe it would have ease the flaws of this film. It is worth a look. Romero also Executive Produced the film. Followed by the remake of "Dawn of the Dead". (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This updated version has been refined and improved in many ways. Aside from being in color and including more updated special and make-up effects, the plot and script have been drastically improved. It felt as though less emphasis was placed on the zombies, which is important in conveying the overall meaning of the film. The film is not about zombies, but about human beings and what we do under pressure. If the viewer never saw a single zombie, the film would not lose any momentum. With added dialogue and character development, this play-like film has become more of a drama than a horror. Kudos to the executives in charge of casting - Patricia Tallman delivered a profound performance as Barbara, whose role in the film has been cleverly modified from the original. Tony Todd was brilliant as Ben. Although Ben's character continues to be a lead role, his character does not drive the film in the same way as it did in the original. Tom Towles and McKee Anderson also shine with ingenious performances as the conflicting couple, Harry and Helen Cooper. If this film were not entitled "Night of the Living Dead" and not classified as a horror film, it would probably have received far more acclaim and perhaps even garnered some serious awards. I hope that horror fans and horror critics alike will be able to understand the film's underlying comments on war, politics, and the overall state of the human race.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy installment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script is pretty weak and at least as many bad things as good things were brought over from the original for this remake, but the 1990 version of George Romero's classic horror film has its heart in the right place, I guess you could say. The movie wastes no time, starting out in a cemetery where a bickering brother and sister have driven no small amount of distance to visit the grave of their mother. So the Don't Go Into A Cemetery rule of horror movies is immediately broken and swiftly punished. I really liked the way the zombies were introduced, it reminded me of the zombies in Shaun of the Dead, where Shaun walked among them, not paying attention to his surroundings, before noticing that he was surrounded by the walking dead.Patricia Tallman turns in a satisfactory performance as Barbara, the sister involved in the opening scene and the heroine of the movie. I thought it was strange that she turns out to be such a strong character when at the beginning of the movie she was immediately reduced to a blubbering basket-case when she arrived at the farmhouse in which most of the movie takes place. Granted, she had just witnessed her brother being killed by a zombie, but no matter how much I sympathize with their plight, I can't stand hysterical people in horror movies, male or female. When someone starts whining and moaning and screaming and crying and sobbing and blubbering and won't even respond to someone shaking them and hollering into their face, I just want them to hurry up and get killed so they'll shut the hell up.Harry Cooper is still the same ridiculous jerkoff he was in the first movie, displaying an entirely unacceptable and unjustifiable state of constant rage, even when finally finding himself in the company of other living, breathing people rather than mindless zombies. Just like the security guard in Dawn of the Dead, this guy wants his own way, even if it means separating himself from other living people, who are fast becoming an endangered species. One thing I'm not sure I understand is the way his insults have been updated to fit the modern times of 1990. At one point, after locking himself, his wife and his zombie-bitten daughter alone together in the basement, he flings a few more vicious insults at the people in the rest of the house, curiously calling them 'lame-brains,' and 'yo-yo's.' If this movie was meant to be shown on the Disney channel, I could understand including such words in the script. But it wasn't. I don't even think the Disney channel was around in 1990.The zombies are updated, needless to say, but they're not over-the-top and they maintain the general appearance of the original zombies. There's nothing worse than using special effects just because they're there, and this remake doesn't do it. Then there are newer horror movies made that try to improve upon the make-up in the original films, such as the first color installment in the Night of the Living Dead series, the original Dawn of the Dead, tried to do it in color and wound up with a lot of bad extras wearing blue make-up all over their faces. Awful.(spoilers) There are lots of radio broadcasts throughout about an epidemic of mass murder being committed by a virtual army of unidentified assassins and do not attempt to reach loved ones and blah blah blah. A brother and sister finally get Ben's truck running enough to get it to the gas pump (the fact that it was out of gas should have been mentioned earlier than it was, because it looked a little ridiculous to see him drive up to the house and then frantically shake Barbara, asking her repeatedly if she has a car), only to be killed by fatal stupidity.I have to admit that I thought the ending was fairly clever. The horribly ironic ending of the original has been changed, but it's still horribly ironic. The whole gang of characters gets saved by a bunch of drunken rednecks, who gleefully and repeatedly shoot zombies between pounding cans of beer, stringing them up in the trees and whatnot, while one character has a bit of insight about the zombies, 'They're us and we're them.' Nice, but I could have done without the philosophy lesson.I think this remake really tried hard to justify itself, to be more than just a static colorization of a classic, and I think that to a large extent it succeeds. Where it falls short is that it doesn't know what is good and what can be changed about the original. Lots of good is brought through, but there are a few things that I could simply have done without. I'm not a big fan of people remaking classic movies and changing them, but Harry Cooper needs a total character overhaul. Nevertheless, this one's worth a look.</fullReview>

For example: Cooper hates Ben, because he is a natural leader and he had good ideas to survive, therefore they were fighting every time and they shoot each other when the daughter of Cooper one became into a zombie. Other example: when the "militiamen" appear,they have fun shooting, torturing and burn the zombies (when there are 3 zombies hunded in a tree and the humans are laughing while they shoot to them).

		<shortDescription>Not Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit, I wasn't expecting much from this remake, but it wasn't anywhere near as terrible as I was afraid it might be. Following the same storyline as the original, NOTLD centers on 7 individuals who have barricaded themselves inside of an old farmhouse in the rural Pennsylvania countryside after the dead rise from their graves and begin wandering the earth in search of human flesh to feast upon. In this updated version, it is Barbara who takes charge alongside Ben, but Ben keeps getting distracted by loudmouth coward Harry Cooper, who proves to be worse than the gutmunching ghouls outside. Cooper's wife Helen is more willing to help out, if it means getting her injured daughter Sarah to a hospital. Rounding out the cast of characters is dumb, sweet hick Tom and his constantly screaming girlfriend Judy Rose...and, of course, the hordes of zombies outside. Despite the fact that this was directed by graphic gore master Tom Savini, there is surprisingly little gut-ripping here. I was afraid that gratuitous splatter would replace plot...and I'm also a total wimp who can't stand seeing bodies ripped apart, so I was quite happy with the lack of flying intestines here. Savini manages to capture a truly tense atmosphere and creates some realistic characters, especially in Ben, Barbara and the thoroughly unlikable Harry. Ultimately, it is up to Barbara to save the day and off she goes, plowing through zombies with a loaded gun and a bandolier! The ending of Savini's version perfectly recaptures the opening shots of the original Dawn of the Dead, complete with ignorant, beer drinking yahoos in plaid flannel making sport of the zombies in some of the films most upsetting scenes. As Barbara wanders through the carnage of the aftermath, our sympathy is now with the undead and not their inhuman tormentors, who seem to get a real thrill out of drunken sadism. Dead eyed Barbara, stranded among the local yokels, has a great scene with the last survivor of her party, which I will not reveal here for to do so would be to spoil the ending. This version of NOTLD is not so much a remake as it is a retelling, and a pretty good one at that. I'd give it a fat 7 on a scale of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the original NOTLD. It was the first film to really, really scare me as a kid and I love it for that reason. Even though its a pretty old film, it still has a cool, creepy atmosphere and still can give you a sense of dread. I always thought it was because its almost like a documentary at times and it is easy to feel like you are in the house with the survivors as they are besieged by the dead. As much as it pains me to say it, the 1990 remake has none of the qualities that made the original NOTLD so great. While the acting is better and the zombies look creepier, the film isn't scary and I can't figure out why. I just sat there the whole time comparing it to the original and finding it lacking. I also was bummed by the way they changed the story from the original and made Barbara a fightin, cursin, tough as nails chick. To this day I am still perplexed and baffled by why I don't like this film better. I really tried and I really wanted to. Its a shame because I really love the remake of Dawn of the Dead. I guess my recommendation must be somewhat neutral. Its not an awful film, it just seems to be missing something that makes it good or memorable. In the end I don't think it should have been made and added nothing to the legacy of the original film.</fullReview>

In fact, this could very well be the last Hollywood remake that was done right.Tom Savini's directorial debut is solid as he takes what many feel is an untouchable classic and actually improves upon it. This movie features solid action, great direction, great cinematography and great makeup effects.Tony Todd is brilliant as Ben. Patricia Tallman is a pleasant surprise...far more likable, tougher and more convincing than Judith O'Dea was as Barbara. Cooper is as annoying as ever. Acting in general is far better than most Hollywood horror fare.Solid effort all around. It plays off your expectations from seeing the original and twists them nicely. I can't recommend this movie highly enough. Put it on your "must watch" list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Is Hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not one bit scary, but it is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. The one liners are unbelievable.If you haven't seen it I can't explain it to you, but if you have you know what I'm talking about. There are so many unnecessary lines and actions that make no sense. For example when they are getting doors upstairs to nail the windows down, to prove that the wood on one door was bad Ben punched through a door. Completely unnecessary, but funny if you watch the movie. It's also funny to hear him say " You know what, Cooper, I've only been around you a minute or two, but that's enough time for me to decide that I don't like you very much." It's funny hearing him say Coopa over and over. One of my favorite lines is "Cooper, I've got a shotgun out here. Open this door, you m**********r, or I swear to God I'll blow it to s**t." It's also ridiculous to see Ben beat up about 10 or 15 zombies by himself. Maybe I'm the only one who sees the movie like this, but this is the way I felt about the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start off, I have never seen the original 1968 Night Of the Living Dead, but I love this movie! Tony Todd is a spectacular actor, and was great in this film. This movie wasn't "drop dead terrifying" or "blood curdling". It was sort of scary, but it was more edge-of-your-seat excitement and entertainment. All in all I love this movie! I give Night of the Living Dead a 10 out of 10!!!! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary remake of a classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really tried to enjoy this movie as I have tremendous respect for Romero and Savini but it just didn't cut it. I'm a huge fan of the original but this really is an unnecessary remake and I can't understand why Romero wanted to change certain elements of the original which in his mind he wished he'd done in a different way. The end result with a few twists (i.e. Barbara becomes the tough heroine) just isn't as effective as the original and even the effects are far from special. One would expect a Savini film to contain a lot more gore, but he was obviously more interested in the direction, which to his credit is rather good. I just can't help thinking that the whole project was a waste of time. Why didn't they make a fourth installment of the Dead series instead?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sorry Ploy to Capitalize on the 1968 Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" (1990) is almost a carbon-copy of the original 1968 version. Every shot is filmed the same way and the screenplay is just as invisible as before. The only real difference is that this version is in color. There is a lack of pace in the direction and the characters are all uninteresting and somewhat annoying. A useless film. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Remake of the 1968 Romero Classic Night of the Living Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of the inexperience of the people who made The Night of the Living Dead back in 1968, the film quickly fell into public domain and they lost out on the lion's share of the profits as it developed from a cult favorite to a genuine horror classic. The Tom Savini directed remake was a way for them to get back some of what they lost as the old crew reassembled hoping lightning would strike twice. Unfortunately, it wasn't the hit they were hoping for but it's a pretty good movie which faithfully recreates the tone and feel of the original while throwing in a few welcome twists and maxing out the prerequisite gore. An early starring role for future Candyman headliner Tony Todd.</fullReview>

Maybe people were inspired by the original one so they had to like the 1990 Night of the living deadAs for me, this movie is a Poor acting, poor Plot and, finally a waste of time.I only liked one sentence said by Barbra "We are them and they are us" as far as I can remember.The film is very short. Bad feelings began to arise between the characters in no time. Why did Ben and Harry fight for the TV? Why did Barbra kill Harry at the end? Why did Ben turn to a living dead although we didn't see him get bitten?Can anyone tell me?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers!!! Continue at your own risk!!! Let me begin by saying that I like zombie movies. I own all of Romero's "Living Dead" films as well as some non-Romero offerings ("Shaun of the Dead" among others). I will watch any zombie related film or show that pops up and I really intended to like this film. Having said that, I knew I was in trouble when I gave up watching in disgust a mere 10 minutes into the picture. Frankly, I found myself rooting for the zombies to hurry up and eat "Barbara" just to silence her incessant shrieking. I absolutely detest whiny, screaming, simpering female leads. I don't mind characters (male or female) screaming in fear. It's a healthy and natural human emotion. I do mind unnecessarily prolonged hysterics. Perhaps "Barbara" grew a spine and became a worthy heroine after I gave up watching, but I'll never know. It's a shame, because Patricia Tallman is a wonderful actress. However, in the first 10 minutes of film she spends most of her time in the front seat of her car screaming hysterically and grabbing her ears. I'm assuming that the ear grabbing was for dramatic effect, but instead it just makes her look silly. When she finally exits her car, she continues to scream (Hey! Zombies! Follow the screaming!) and then makes her way to a farmhouse where she stupidly leaves the door wide open (Hey! Zombies! Come on in! Door's open!). Enough of this crap. I'm outta here, and I didn't even get to see the usually magnificent Tony Todd who is one of my favorite actors!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Dead (1990)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always liked this remake of the classic zombie flick. It has the same plot as the original NOTLD. After being attacked in the cemetery, Barbara makes her way to a house in which she meets six others and they board up the windows/doors to survive a zombie attack. There are some differences to that plot in the remake, but for the most part it is the exact same story told by George Romero. There is obviously much more blood and gore in this one than the original, but it doesn't go overboard like in Dawn or Day of the Dead. The acting from everyone was well done, Tony Todd puts in a great performance as Ben. Tom Towles and Mckee Anderson are also very good as the feuding Mr and Mrs. Cooper. And Patricia Tallman puts in a strong showing as Barbara, the legendary NOTLD heroine. In the original film, Barbara was pretty weak and out of her mind after seeing her brother murdered. But in the remake, Barbara is strong and ready to fight off the creatures that roam around outside. It was an interesting change to the story and it worked well.I liked the changes to this ending compared to the remake. Barbara survives in this one and there is a pretty cool finale involving her and Mr. Cooper. It isn't perfect, but overall Night of the Living Dead 1990 is a solid remake that I really enjoyed. Fans of the original will not be disappointed.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Zombie Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead might be a remake, but this is the definitely the best and my all-time favourite zombie movie ever made. It ages so well and still in 2011 feels like it came out last year.Zombie make-up effects are top-notch even for 2011. It doesn't feel like the zombie effects have lost their scare-tactic. In the beginning of the film it is plainly obvious that the large zombie is a doll/dummy. But even that doesn't take much away from the movie.George's screenplay is the main reason of making this film so good. He's the zombie expert and the way he secludes the film to an unknown location makes the viewer feel just as claustrophobic, especially if you watch this at night in the dark.Patricia's acting is decent and although she's the main character, I truly believe this film belongs to Tony Todd. He's great in all his scenes. He's truly the zombie killer to have on your team. He is able to be strategic and be physically useful by overpowering or out-maneuver the zombies in many instances.Once the zombies get into the numbers of two dozen, the movie becomes very eerie. But, in the climax of the film is my favourite part, without giving anything away. I like the twists and turns the movie (George) throws at you.It's untouched by any modern movie that has come out, even Resident Evil because this gives you the vibe that it's just Barbara, Ben and a couple others. It's not a SWAT team fighting hordes of zombies. It's a few people surviving like normal people. That's what makes it such a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best remakes in history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I spent years trying to track down this remake. For some odd reason it took a long time for ANYONE to acknowledge this incredible remake of the 1968(?) classic.I'm not a huge fan of the original, but I've watched it several times. I've watched the subsequent (2009?) remake as well. Honestly, I loved this version of Night of the Living Dead the best.I kept coming back searching for this version so many times... For some reason I could not find this version. Netflix didn't have it, IMDb didn't list it. For several years it seemed like no one wanted to admit this version existed.The major characters are developed and introduced enough that you actually care what happens to them. There are enough variances from the original to keep you kind of guessing during the first time watching this version.Patricia Tallman is, in my opinion, VERY convincing as Barbara. Contrary to the original version where she is little more than a cardboard cutout typical 'girl in a horror movie' who you can't help but wonder "how did this girl last 5 minutes, much less the whole movie?" Patricia Tallman delivers an excellent performance as Barbara, and when it comes to the end, maybe there is all of 2% doubt as to whether I as a viewer agree with her decision to put a bullet in the coward who tried to hand EVERYONE over to the zombies to buy a few extra minutes of life for himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Zombie Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always heard of this film, heard it was an amazing classic, so when it came on free one day I decided to check it out. I'm not sure if the "classic" is only the original or if the remake qualifies for that title as well, but I thought it was good! The 1990 Tom Savini-directed version follows a young woman who goes to visit her mother's grave with her brother but is attacked by a zombie and seeks refuge in a house with other uninfected humans.The graphics are pretty good for the '90s! I was cringing a lot. This movie really scared me, not in the way where it's hard to go to sleep, but I was scared for the people in the film. The characters were all right. The acting wasn't amazing and the character development wasn't top-notch but it wasn't horrible. You could tell whether Savini intended for you to like the character or not, which is nice. I like when you either favor or dislike a character in a horror film because the feelings you have about them directly influence how the movie makes you feel: you're happy when your beloved character survives and stoked when the one you hate gets his head bitten off, or you're bummed when your favorite dies and your least favorite walks away with nothing but a scratch. I just love when movies make me feel something, even for just a little while, and this film succeeds.There aren't any especially beautiful shots. I didn't notice any spectacular cinematography, but I still really enjoyed it. The zombies are great. I love how they walk, I love their appearances, I love how they attack. This movie is a great zombie flick! Completely satisfying in its genre. I laughed, I got angry, I got frustrated, I celebrated (not really, but I got stoked a few times :P). The script is pretty good, it fits the genre and the style. There's a character you hate (you'll know which one) and his lines are incredibly ridiculous! Seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if he got his insults from a kindergarten playground. I didn't really blame the film, because it's a zombie film and from the '90s, I thought I'd let it go. Like, I'm not expecting an Oscar-nominated film, you know? Haha.So, yeah, I loved this movie a lot. It's everything a zombie movie should be. I may or may not buy it, I dunno, but I would love to watch it a few more times in my future. It's good stuff! I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few remakes to get it right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" the classic 1968 horror film that shaped what is considered to be a zombie for every movie after it. The film is a staple of horror, and only the man who was suppose to do the FX for the movie (but was shipped off to 'Nam before he could do it) is the only person who could have remade this movie.Perhaps it was his close friendship with Mr. Romero that made this remake so loyal to the original. The movie almost follows the original shot-by-shot, word-for-word. It is, without a doubt, the best remake ever. It isn't until the end that the story changes, I assume is to get constantly considered racist ending (although it is not) of the first. The ending is not as good as the first, though. That is one of the two problems with this movie. The ending was too obvious, and poorly done. It didn't show the gun-crazy ways humanity has turned like the first one. That was what the original ending symbolized to me, it was to show that people stopped caring to check to see if they were zombies.Now, off my rant, the acting was amazing, each character delivers the same powerful performance, and the changing of Barbra into a fierce fighter was a nice one (and a nice escape from the feminist criticism of the first.) And who ever played Barbra did a great job. The whole cast does a nice job to show the mentality of someone trapped in the position. And the effects for this movie were top notch, with really good look of blood. The zombies have a nice look to them, looking more realistic than the shreds of flesh that are in more modern zombie flicks. My other problem with this movie is the zombie acting, it all seems to fake. They move and act with an increased indifference, and act as if zombies are they really weak, stupid things.In conclusion, this movie is an incredibly well done sequel, nice for those who hate black and white movies, and nice for horror fans who like closely (and correctly) done sequels, bearing almost the same script. 8/10, any fan of horror should see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before horror remakes were popular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dead have returned to life and a group of individuals with varied backgrounds hideout in a farmhouse with hope to survive. Before horror remakes became popular and the the term 'reboot' was only used for computers Tom Savini horror effects maestro directed the remake of the black &amp; white classic Night of the Living Dead. Originally Savini worked on Dawn of the Dead and other films directed by zombie godfather George. A .Romero, his gory effects were influenced by the real life deaths he witnessed in Vietnam.The secluded and atmospheric location works a charm and Candyman's Tony Todd is on top form but the film is let down by some bad performances from the supporting cast, who I wont name.Savini proves he is a competent director. He makes the wise decision to stick close to the original material giving us a pacier update, a coloured version that comes with a few welcomed tweaks to the story line. It's worth every zombie bite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great remake, I liked everything they did with this remake.The plot While visiting the grave of their mother, Barbara and her brother are attacked by a rabid flesh-eating Zombie. Barbara manages to escape, and reaches the relative safety of a seemingly deserted farmhouse. She is joined shortly by a young drifter, Ben (Tony Todd "Candyman"). Soon they find out, that more survivors are inside the house. Trapped inside the farmhouse, they prepare themselves for nightfall, and the massive onslaught of the army of the Undead.Tom Savini , special make-up artist on such horror movies as "Dawn of the Dead" and "Friday the 13th", guides you through his shocking and visceral 90's remake of George A. Romero's horror classic "Night of the living Dead".This is not scene from scene remake, well it started of like that but it change a lot scene and bit of the story in this movie but made a lot better even more scary.Small spoiler I did like scene Barbara enter the house and big zombie about fall on her, that was really scary (i did shout get out the way) Really liked that scene.

		<fullReview>In my opinion both the original and the remake are about just as good, although personally I think this one was slight bit more enjoyable. No I like the original, but there were certain things that i felt were missing. And I guess the creators of the film felt so to, that's probably why the made a remake.For the first the female lead role, Barbara, is a lot better in this movie. I think it's stupid to Call Romero a sexist just because the original Barbara was frantic during the whole movie. I've seen male character from the same period that freaks out more than she did. Still it's nice to see a Barbara that actually fights back. Ben was pretty much the same guy as in the original movie, but I felt they (SPOILER) killed of the character in a much better way than the original. (SPOILER ENDING) Also I liked the ending in this film, I'm not gonna spoil it, but I felt it was easier to swallow than the original. Also this being a movie directed by Tom Savani, the makeup artist of the original films, this movie got some really awesome looking zombies, which also stayed true to the original film. In my opinion; even though the original film is a classic, and can be considered better because of it's impact on film, this film succeeded more when it comes to the actual film. but the original should always been remembered as the mother of all zombie films, and i would advice an each horror and Sci-Fi fan to See it as well. I give this movie an 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barbara (Patrica Tallman) and her brother Johnny (Bill Moseley) are out from the city to visit the countryside to see their dead mother's grave in a graveyard. That is until they get attacked by a ravenous rotting man that looks like it came from the ground as it murders Johnny leaving Barbara to flee for her life into a isolated farm house as she joins up with a large black man named Ben (Tony Todd) to keep her safe from those zombie creatures outside. There appears to be some kind of phenomenon involving the dead coming back to vicious life and attacking the living in the state of Pennsylvania, there are some human survivors named the Coopers (Mckee Anderson and Tom Towels), Tom (William Butler) and Judy (Katie Finneren) join up with them as they struggle to survive a night of terror.Gory colored remake from director Tom Savini is based on George A. Romero's timeless classic of horror. It's an enjoyable but completely unnecessary remake with George A. Romero as executive producer as this one remakes the original from black and white to color as it does a few different things while the film is sort of shot-to-shot at times of the original masterpiece even a different ending. The acting is very good and the casting is well done, i'd say this one is inferior to the original and i believe that "Dawn of the Dead (2004)" from Zack Snyder was a better remake of a Romero movie then this cause at least that did something more successful and different to it's source rather then being a semi-clone of the original just this remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, honestly when you have Tom Savini directing a George Romero film you know you in for a zombie gore-fest. The old night of the living dead, yes, was ground breaking for its time but I feel that this remake does justice. In the 1990 version; Barbra is not helpless like the typical 60's woman, the Zombies are well put together and have much character, There is more gore which where would a zombie movie be with out, and it gives nice homage to the original film. There are a few classic lines in this 1990 version which crack me up as well ha ha. Otherwise the ending of the old film I think does justice to this newer film. I suggest you watch both of course the old one first (because you will appreciate the new one more). Honestly it is not a super masterpiece but it has its charms and makes me laugh and does what I want zombie movies to do, entertain me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior horror remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes of classic horror films are being released all the time, and although they provoke plenty of screams from horror fans, that's generally because they desecrate the originals, rather than due to any intended shocks they contain. George Romero's influential Living Dead series is no survivor of the remake plague either: there are now remakes of the first three films.The NOTLD remake is an exception to the trend for several reasons. Firstly, it was released in 1990, a few years ahead of the curve. Secondly it was remade by George Romero and Tom Savini as opposed to an unconnected Hollywood director working for a major studio. Thirdly, most importantly and perhaps a result of the aforementioned, NOTLD '90 doesn't suck.The original NOTLD has a lot of fanatics, and plenty of them would argue that the original never needed remaking. The fact is, however, that NOTLD was made on a shoestring in 1968 and its zero-budget, amateur roots shine through in the dodgy acting (where they simply couldn't afford to reshoot scenes over and over), the stock music and the necessary use of limited narrative techniques (NOTLD is possibly the only critically-acclaimed film I can name where the characters sit and watch an exposition-spouting TV for long periods). As a result I can understand why George Romero wanted to go back when he was an experienced film maker and give his classic the treatment it always deserved.NOTLD succeeds where it doesn't tamper with a winning formula. This is an update intended to smooth out flaws in the original, not attempt to make it trendy. Although the film's setting remains contemporary, Romero and Savini go to great lengths to maintain the 1960s feel of the film. Using the "middle of nowhere rural house" setting to their advantage, they model everything from the wallpaper in the house to the clothing design and the black and white TV to fit a creepy mise en scene that evokes shades of haunted houses and the classic American Gothic tradition without ceasing to tingle the paranoia of modern audiences.For the most part, the script is a scene-for-scene recreation of the original film, although Romero and Savini prevent it from being a yawn-fest for fans of the original by adding crucial twists and subversions to the original that ensure you're never QUITE sure what will happen next. An iconic scene near the beginning is cleverly reworked into a moment that will jolt new viewers and long-time fans alike.The biggest change comes to the ending, which is now much closer to George Romero's original vision, and its worth giving this review Spoilers to discuss these changes. The escalating conflict between Cooper and Ben now concludes with a shootout between them, where Ben retreats to the basement and Cooper to a previously undiscovered loft-space. Barbara, who is now a much stronger character, finally flees the house as she's threatened to do all film, and is found by the rednecks we flew over in Dawn Of The Dead. They return to the house, and Ben emerges zombified from the basement, while Cooper lives, only to be unceremoniously killed by Barbara.Now, there are crucial changes to the subtext here. In the original, Cooper talked a lot of sense, and for all his flaws he was a highly stressed man concerned for his daughter, as opposed to a genuine villain. In this film he's a coward who hits his wife, refuses to help and ultimately murders Ben. He has very few redeeming features and it's much easier to see him as the antagonist, a view Romero rewards by having him killed off at the end by Barbara, a rather naked enactment of the cosmic moral code in many films where good guys live and bad guys die for their sins.The original NOTLD was powerful and original precisely because it did away with binary good/evil distinctions that most films sport. There are no heroes and villains in NOTLD '68, just highly-strained and flawed humans, any one of which can and will die: from a little girl to the film's most obvious candidate for hero. Romero's message is clear: humanity's own flaws and tendency to self destruction are far more threatening to the species than even the most outlandish act of God. The zombies are a mirror he holds up to our dark side. In the remake this subtext is expressed directly by Barbara: "We're them and they're us", and yet it takes on a radically different spin in a film where there ARE obvious heroes and villains.NOTLD '90 seems to be saying that not everyone is a monster deep down, and it is only clearly identifiable villains who threaten to destroy us. It ends with a note of justice where there was exactly the opposite in the original. For all its technical improvements, the remake is held back by finishing on this ray of optimism where Romero originally communicated utter darkness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very very good and very respectful remake of the classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, if you are going to enjoy this movie, it is essential to first watch the original. I watched the original recently and liked it very much. When I found the remake I was very skeptical but decided to give it a shot anyway. When I began watching the movie I was pleasantly surprised how faithful it was to the original. I heard many of the same lines, straight from the original. I then feared it would be identical and I would just know exactly what would happen next. However, again I was wrong. It is just different enough to keep you guessing about what will happen next, but not different enough that you could fail to see the resemblance. I have very few complaints about this remake, I actually have more complaints about the original. The movie makes almost constant references to the original, even in its differences. Almost as if it is an identical story being told by another witness, another point-of-view. I think one of the finest remakes I have ever seen, as well as one of the finest Zombie films I have ever scene, and I am very particular about my zombie films. The ending is not the same as the original, but if you have seen the original you will see how it parallels the original ending. I think the way that characters in this remake actually act more realistically than those in the original, and this remake captures the fear that they would experience better than the original did. I loved this movie, I do not think the original could have been remade any better than this. The only reason I do not give it 10/10 is because I feel you need to see the original first before watching the remake. The remake can stand alone, but it is much more enjoyable if you have seen the original and can recognize the parallels.</fullReview>

On Halloween 1983, MTV showed the original Night of the Living Dead, which was my first exposure to George Romero's film-making. Later that year, I caught his masterpiece, Dawn of the Dead at a midnight movie.To review the contemporary Night of the Living Dead, it will be juxtaposed to the original. The remake follows the same storyline of Barbara (Patricia Tallman) visiting her mother's grave with her brother. He starts acting kooky when they come across some zombies.She flees from the walking dead and finds an abandoned farmhouse. There, she meets Ben (Tony Todd). Of course, there are others like Tommy (William Butler), his wife Judy Rose (Kate Finneran), and the nefarious Harry Cooper (Tom Towles). Tommy is good to deal with, but Cooper is a major league jerk. Even his wife has trouble defending him.Then the group works hard to board up the windows to protect themselves from the zombies. Unfortunately, while the living dead have no divisions, the living continuously vie each other for power. Guess who wins.As for its strengths, the remake has a lot going for it. At the outset, the new one has a budget that allowed for better acting and better special effects. Tom Savini also takes the directing reigns from Romero, proving he can offer his own unique vision for the classic.Another strength was enough changes in the storyline to give fresh scares and avoid predictable pratfalls. In the original, the Barbara character was a weak, simpering fool. Thanks to feminism, this time around she is stronger and takes a more active approach to her predicament. Unfortunately, she also falls to the over arching theme.The moral to the story is also a strength. While the first rendition of Night gives us a panic of revolutionaries, this movie simply makes a statement on how we treat each other. "We're them, and they're us," contemplates Barbara. How we treat the dead is an indicator of how we treat life. How they treat us is also reflective.This leads to an ending that is, while cynical towards human nature, not as dark and depressing as the first movie.The only weakness, though, is the new Night is not original. It does not have the freshness of the original 1968 release. If that is the only weakness, though, it must be good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to the original Night of the Living Dead this film doesn't cut the beef/zombie. Though as a stand alone I do believe that this is quite a good film.Not much changes with this and the other film except the ending, which I won't spoil for you, and they argue more about the TV which some people think is stupid but I actually think is quite a good aspect of the original, and even better in this one.All in all, a good film, but not as good as the original in most aspects. Though certainly it is better than most common zombie movies that are just gore 24/7. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that George A. Romero was remaking NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, I groaned. Romero, one of my favorite filmmakers, hadn't had much of a track record the previous few years, and I thought this to be a signal of his officially giving up.Then I heard he was remaking it only to stop another group from doing so, feeling if anyone should mess with the greatest horror movie of all time, it should be the original's creator. Then I heard he was only writing the screenplay, and that his longtime effects collaborator Tom Savini was going to direct. My interest was officially peaked.I saw the movie. I walked out of the theater thinking, eh. Romero is a gifted writer, and his screenplays are usually full of cutting edge satire and wit. Not so this time. It didn't really bother me too much, but the lack of any of his usual zing was a disappointment. He came up with many interesting ways to twist the plot around and rethink original scenes, but the dialog is heavy-handed and the characters are one-note, two aspects of his previous work that one could always count on to be rich and intriguing.Savini does a serviceable job of directing the movie. There are a few genuinely creepy moments, and things moves along at a swift pace, but he never comes close to recapturing the raw, nightmarish terror of Romero's original. What made the original NOTLD so intensely scary was the way it played out so matter-of-factly, with characters behaving in a believable manner, reacting as people really would to a horrific, unbelievable situation. Duane Jones in the original spends the first few scenes trying to make some sense of what's happening. Tony Todd here immediately realizes that the dead are coming back to life, and even curses God when he kills one of them early on.One of the most effective scenes in the original is when the newscaster reports that it has been revealed that the dead are coming back to life and killing people. His delivery of the news is totally believable, as he maintains his composure and reports it as calmly and objectively as he can. The newscaster in the remake gives a nervous little giggle and twitches and is visibly befuddled when he reports the news. It is this unnecessary "acting" and contrivance that is the remakes failure.Overall, it's a watchable movie. It's better than the average zombie movie, and has a surprisingly dire and non-tongue-in-cheek tone at a time when horror movies were overrun with goofy humor (a trend that has unfortunately come back). I wouldn't go so far as to recommend it, but you could do worse on a rainy day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"eh" remake of an "eh" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittingly, the original Night was good, but not great. NotLD did not need a remake. It was kinda fun seeing Tony Todd, the Candyman, play a role as the hero, and it was nice to finally see a character realize `Hey, Zombies are slow . . . we can walk right past them' and actually follow through. Unfortunately, that's overshadowed by the original flaws of Night of the Living Dead which translate to the remake as well, and with improved technology and budget it's simply made those flaws more apparent.Romero's bland style and artistically stale vision becomes even more bland and stale. I'm a bit hesitant to criticize Savini on this, though--I do not know if he did too good a job copying Romero or has the same fault in his own style. I'll have to check out another Savini film to see. In an attempt to surprise the audience and keep something fresh, the screenwriter's opted to change the ending. The new ending, unfortunately, comes across as a typical Hollywood formula, which is much softer and friendlier than its predecessor. This is horror, not a family film, I love it when a production team has it in them to give an off the wall or even a downer ending. The original Night had this. I would've been happier seeing the original ending a second time with the satisfaction of watching a good ending, that Savini and crew did not censor their film, alas we get a momentary `surprise' of a new ending and ever after feel ripped off.Romero went beyond the means of his miniscule budget. Savini used a greater budget to make virtually the same thing and more or less got it. I'm disappointed Savini didn't shoot for much higher because Night of the Living Dead (68) had a lot of room for improvement. It's a lot easier to forgive the original considering it had much much less to work with . . . that and Romero pulled no punches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice film, shame about the muzak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Savini's done a pretty good job on this one, considering that the original's a legend, and there's more than a few movie snobs out there who'd see the whole undertaking as sacrilege.The first thing I'd applaud is the fact that the Barbara character actually has a character this time round, rather than being the token useless drip she was in 1968. Not only does she become the strongest character in the film, but also one of the most sympathetic - I had no sympathy for the original character - she was just a waste of space.All in all, a well made movie, surprisingly restrained on the gore and - in keeping with the Romero tradition - driven by characters, not by effects.The biggest letdown was the dreadful music - sounding like someone's raided an archive of bad '80s Joe Satriani soundalike shopping mall muzak. It brings nothing to the movie, and deadens many aspects that a more sensitive score would have boosted.Still well worth watching!</fullReview>

I know we don't have Duane Jones or Judy O'Dea as Ben and Barbara, two KEY characters. But alas, we have the great Tony Todd of CandyMan fame...and the sexy Patricia Tallman as Barbara.And at no spared expense, Savini's vision of Barbara is to die for. She's a gun toting, zombie kicking, non-cry baby, unlike the black and white version of this character. So you got the traditional Cooper "blah blah blah" get in the basement dialogue. And thanks to Todd and Tallman, Coop gets put in his place.So, pick this flick up. VHS, DVD, LD....just get the thing and enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of zombie flicks, I'm sure I've seen them all. The sad thing is that although wonderful, most are now looking a bit worn, low budget and in many ways, comical (Flesh Eaters / Dawn / Creeping Flesh).Night of the Living Dead 1990 is one exception.A remake of the '68 classic, Romero's special effects man Tom Savini this time takes direction, and does so well.The movie is largely set in a large spooky house. The characters converge from various places, all seeking refuge from the flesh-eating zombies.The human vs zombie flavour is always there with the marauding presence of the zombies outside and to crank up the tension, a human vs human element provides a threat inside - with the argumentative and cowardly "Cooper" and authoritative "Ben" frequently coming to blows.Special effects are top-notch as you'd expect from effects supremo Savini 9/10.Performances of all are believable and crisp 8.4/10.Gore factor, could be more - 7/10.Overall 8.8/10.A worthy beer &amp; pizza movie for anyone, a 100% must-see for zombie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, this isn't as terrifying or disturbing as the original was, but it was a whole lot better than the horror films they were putting out at that time. This time, Barbra is no vegetable, she kicks ass and is out to blow heads off. The plot is basically the same as the original with a few new twists especially the ending of the movie. The acting is much improved over the original's, except Tom Towles seems to over-act at some points. The special effects in this are the best in any living dead film hands down. The ghouls actually LOOK and ACT like real dead humans. They stagger, moan, and don't have any grey paint on their faces like the horrible zombies did in Dawn of the Dead. The only drawback to this film is the music, it is dull and is not a driving dynamic score as in Romero's films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well yes I do have to admit that this is several times better than the black and white rubbish original, but it isn't as good as Chopper Chicks In Zombietown which is the greatest zombie movie ever. This one was filmed in colour which immediately gives it roughly 5 marks more than the other one, and it has plenty of blood, head explodings, and excitement moments. The original didn't have any of these; it just had some deaf and dumb woman running around feeling sorry for herself while some naked fat man ate a chicken drumstick. The story is pretty much the same which is to say it isn't very interesting- a group of annoying people are chased by zomboids and decide to camp out for the night in a haunted house, wait for help and try not to be eaten. Woopdie balls.Luckily we have a much better cast of actors and female actors this time, including the man who played Sweetieman in the horror film of a different name. The woman is very active this time, screaming and kicking not weird and mute like in the 'first'. The best character by far is the teacher who has a wife and child, played by Mauser from Police Academy. He is very clever and funny and knows that they should all just shut up and hide in the basement. Everyone else though wants to be cool and stay upstairs and wait for help. They don't have any or many weapons, none of them are soldiers or ninjas so I don't see why they would stay upstairs and try to fight. The teacher is a very caring person and just wants to protect his family, then all these other peeps come in and ruin it for him. I like the way that this film has a much happier ending than the dreary golden oldey one. Just when the the zombies break in to the house, a gang of local bikers (in an obvious nod to the superior Chopper Chicks) arrives loaded to the oxters with firearms. They blow the zombies away in a blaze of guts and knees in a 7 minute slow motion scene reminiscent of The Weird Bunch, and the survivors exscape saferly. In a poignant and creepy ending the gang join the bikers and look off a nearby hill into a city lit with flames and view the destruction. The creatures are everywhere, people are being chased and killed, and it looks like the end of the world. The ponder their next step while the leader of the bikers (an old woman from Alabamy) walks up on her walking stick and announces 'It's time, to make, our stand!' Best Scene: When the zombies break in to the house at the end and kill every character in gory fashion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid B-remake with some big shoes to fill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is at once satisfying and disappointing about Tom Savini's 1990 redux of George Romero's penultimate horror film "Night of the Living Dead" is that it's a well-done B movie that retains the same western-Pennsylvania atmosphere of its predecessor. It's a credible, reverent take (re-scripted by Romero himself) that falls prey to some notable flaws (particularly a lack of real scares and some campy performances) while moving quickly, efficiently along with some periodically chilling moments (the re-constructed freeze-frame ending being one of them). What this "Night" lacks, however, is a sense of purpose (save for letting the makers of the original see a long-delayed paycheck) and the gritty, raw look that made the 1968 original a visceral, horrifying experience. The performances are a mixed bag, with solid turns from Tony Todd ("Candyman") and especially Patricia Tallman as a much tougher Barbara; Tom Towles plays Harry Cooper as a cross between Archie Bunker and Homer Simpson; and William Butler and Kate Finneran (as Tom and Judy) are exceedingly weak links, dumbing the characters down to shrill clichés. Like I said, as a stripped-down B movie, this "Night" has its merits and is fairly entertaining, but lacking the sociopolitical subtexts (and historical reference) that made Romero's original resonate on a much deeper, more disturbing level, this can only be seen as pupil that just isn't apt enough.</fullReview>

Aside from the obvious rubber prosthetic head used for the dead uncle's pummeling scenes, the special effects deserve a big severed thumb up. The film had all the elements that make a decent zombie movie; hordes of the undead, generous head shots and a bit of gratuitous gore for seasoning. To be honest , after reading some of the reviews I was a bit hesitant about the remake but I threw caution to the wind and bought a copy on DVD. Definitely worth seeing. I enjoyed both films but found the remake easier to watch partly due to the updated special effects and make up. Good job Tom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Really Not As Bad As You'd Think...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero's original "Night Of The Living Dead" is among the all time horror classics. Why would they remake it? I don't know. I don't really mind remakes, actually, and this one was pretty good. The plot is the same as the original, Barbara and her brother Tom drive out to an isolated cemetery to visit their mother's grave, and run into a walking-dead person. Tom is killed after hitting his head on a gravestone, and Barbara flees to an old farmhouse out in the woods. Turns out there's much more than just one of these zombies, a radioactive fallout has caused the dead to rise, and they are hungry for flesh. More people seek the old farmhouse for safety, and Barbara and the others must fight while the flesh-eating walking corpses try and break in.I can't say that this remake was really bad. Tom Savini, known as the king of horror makeup effects, directed the film and provided the makeup and effects (of course). The plot doesn't stray from the original at all, for the most part just about everything was the same. Besides that the remake is in color, and that the special effects are much more elaborate (although I have to admit, the effects in the original looked great, especially for the time it was made). The acting is good, Tony Todd (who later went on to play the title character in the "Candyman" series), plays Ben very well, and Patricia Tallman plays Barbara decently, although I have to admit I wasn't so fond of her short boyish haircut. There are some great sequences throughout the movie, just as in the original, plus the zombie makeup looked really great, but this movie isn't quite as good. For being one of the first remakes before the sudden horror remake boom that has been going on lately (the movie was made in 1990), it's very watchable.Overall, "Night Of The Living Dead" is one of the better (and the earlier) horror remakes out there. Watch the original movie before you see this one, but definitely check this one out, because it isn't nearly as bad as many would assume that it is. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It almost hurts to say that because of the fact that it is a remake, but it's true. With so many horror films being remade we lose the flavor of the original but the essence of the original is still here in this flick. With so many people from the first film being involved with the remake it's easy to just label it as an "update".I find the characters to have a lot more depth in the remake. The zombies have more of a vacant sadness and the setting is a lot creepier. This is one film out of only a handful that I find truly scary, even to this day. It definitely stands the test of time and is bound to be just as much of a cult classic film as the original.Not taking anything away from the original which is definitely a masterpiece. George Romero has gone above and beyond any other horror director in cinema history and Tom Savini is a welcome addition to the zombie tradition (now if he would just get back in the director's seat).If you're looking for a fun, scary, thrill ride of a movie, look no further. Tony Todd and Patricia Tallman give the most memorable performances of their respective careers and Romero and Savini come through like a horrorcane and deliver the greatest horror film ever conceived.With today being Halloween, this is my pick for a great creepy movie to watch on this Day of the Dead 2005.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 Blueprints for Tom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Savini's first real film as Director, the "re-make" of the 1968 classic horror film, Night of the Living Dead, was an interesting and good movie with its moments. Every Director has a blue print that he uses when making a movie, it's called a script. Tom Savini had 2 blueprints to use in making this movie. He has the script, but also he had Romero's first film which Tom carefully copied. There are original moments throughout the film, which adds even more horror to the story. Knowing what we've seen the first time, we do not know if Tom will repeat the scenes as they were in the original, or if he is going to trick us with new additions to the original blue print. It is moments like this that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.Tallman is terrific as a modern day female victim. Although she is terrorized, she is not the same victim as before. For 1990, her character is much more independent that she was back in 1968. Times they are a changing, as well as many of our classic horror films of the past. Savini's success only adds to the greatness which was the original Night of the Living Dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb mark: 9In order to give some actors and members of the crew of the 1968 version the opportunity to gain some money from the un-copyrighted franchise 'Night of the Living Dead', George Romero thought it would be a good idea to do a remake. And he let Tom Savini direct it, even though Savini hadn't directed before. Thus, 'George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead' was (re)born.-Gore: Very, very good effects here! Like most zombie movies, it will not disappoint horror fans. Still, there was stuff that the MPAA demanded to be cut, but some of it can be seen in the documentary on the DVD. And, apparently, there exists a VHS uncut version. However, even for the R-rated version itself, highest mark has to be awarded. 30/30-Suspense: Just when you think it's a safe enough environment for the characters, another scare comes their way. Exactly the way it should be in a horror movie. 15/15-Ending: It is very different from the one in the classic version. But, apparently, from what I've read, it's more faithful to the original script. I liked the new ending, but not as much as the ending of the original. 13/15-Death Scenes: Again, excellent! My favourite death is Johnnie's, even though you can see how they did it. I don't think I'm spoiling much by saying that the death scenes of the same characters are different in this remake, so don't expect a carbon copy. 11/11-Atmosphere: Being stuck in a deserted house while monsters are trying to get you. What more can one horror buff want? It doesn't get boring at all. 10/10-Nudity: In a lame attempt to imitate (some of) the nudity in the original, a zombie is seen nude, from the back only. 0/10-Cast: Tony Todd and Patricia Tallman weren't exactly unknown when they took part in this movie, but the rest were quite unknown; oh, and there's this guy, Bill 'Chilly Billy' Cardille, who was in the 1968 movie, too. 2/5-Genre: This is a horror film. 4/4--&gt;Overall: 85/100I don't understand the people who say this is inferior to the black-and-white film. Maybe they are just being nostalgic. From Swordlord, 4 swords up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** out of ****, Great remake directed by special effects master Tom Savini does not disappoint in many ways. The performances are great, especially from Tony Todd as Ben, and Patricia Tallman as a very tough new Barbara. The plot is the same, as seven strangers board themselves up in an isolated farmhouse while mindless, flesh-eating zombies roam the countryside. The music score I must admit sounds like a MIDI file someone would use on their website, but I liked the music for some reason (probably because that's the type of music I'll be using in MY movies...hehe). Savini does a good job of directing and the effects are realistic enough, however some of the out-of-your-seat scares don't work which I found detracted from the viewing experience. But otherwise, this was a great remake and I am glad to have ownership over it. It's fun, entertaining and scary and often pokes fun at itself. Rated R for violence, some gore, profanity and brief nudity. 1990</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film suffers from our acquaintance with the original. On the other hand, it has a first rate performance from Tony Todd, and the production values are staggering. And...Tom Savini, and George Romero have stirred the pot just enough that you won't be able to predict everything. Definitely worthy of 8, out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Remake of the Best Horror Movie Ever Made Does Not Disappoint the Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barbara (Patricia Tallman) and her brother Johnnie are visiting their mother's grave in a cemetery in the country, 320 km far from their homes. There, Barbara realizes that dead persons are walking again. Barbara escapes from a walking copse, gets in a farmhouse in panic. Then she meets Ben (Tony Todd) in this house. They realize that there are other survivals inside the cellar. All of them get trapped in this house surrounded by dead bodies that eat flesh. The 1968 `The Night of the Living Dead' is, in my opinion, the best horror movie ever made. I have watched the original film more than ten times, and I intend to see it again and again. This remake was a wonderful surprise for me: It is also a great movie, with some minors modification in the story. The actors and the direction are sharp and many actors and actresses look like the original ones. I have watch this remake at least five time. Yesterday I bought the Brazilian DVD. This DVD is great: you have both versions (widescreen and fullscreen) and lots of extras. I regret only that the extras do not have subtitles, so Brazilians that can not speak English will lose this bonus. My vote is eight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't like purists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this version of Night of the Living Dead is one of the greatest horror movies ever. The original has it's charm, but I think this version is superior in terms of directorial quality, editing, acting, and special effects. I think it is a great remake designed to appeal to a new generation and make use of new technology. I don't like how purists say just because the 1960's version was the first, that it was the best. I watched both of the movies in the same night, and I believe that the newer one is better. Which version of the movie aside, I think that Night of the Living Dead possesses a type of magic that is not found in any horror movie since. There need be no explanation of WHY the zombies are here, they are just HERE. This is one aspect that I don't like about Resident Evil. They strive too much to create a justifiable reason for the zombies to be there. Night of the Living Dead also uses traditional horror movie imagery to create the creepy environment. Also, this movie makes me WANT zombies to walk the earth, cause I have no shortage of ammo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie doesn't make that much sense without the sound!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was eleven, this film was a new release. After the first time watching this movie, and my brother and I thought this would be the greatest movie to make fun of. So we got out the tape recorder and recorded our own plotline of what was happening and then dubbed it onto another video tape. It was extremely silly, and we had a lot of fun doing it. If you ever do this with this movie, you'll realize there can be no logical plotline for the movie if you think the Zombies are regular living people. I guess what I'm trying to say is it's one of the silliest movies ever made if you turn down the sound and add your own words. I guess Weekend At Bernie's II would be another good one to make fun of as well.As for the movie itself, it really frightened me when I watched it the first time with sound. It was one of the scariest movies that I had seen when I was a child. Later I saw the original and felt it was missing something the updated version had. I could definitely see why it was considered a masterpiece, but it didn't quite give me the same chills this one gave me. I also thought Barbara was a bit disappointing in the first one. I wanted someone that would fight, and not just sit on a couch staring into space. I think this movie was partly responsible for the concepts of the Resident Evil games. Overall rating 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead starts as brother &amp; sister Barbara (Patricia Tallman) &amp; Johnnie (Bill Mosley) visit their recently deceased mother's grave, there they are attacked by one of the living dead &amp; Johnnie is killed although Barbara manages to escape on foot to a nearby farmhouse. There she is attacked by more of the living dead but a man in truck called Ben (Tony Todd) arrives &amp; helps her, the truck is out of gas &amp; they have no choice but to stay put. Then out of the cellar some more people emerge, together they decide to board up the house to try &amp; keep the flesh eating living dead outside as they desperately try to come up with a plan of escape, as the night draws on tensions in the house escalate &amp; the cannibalistic living dead outside rapidly grow in number...Directed by Tom Savini this is absolutely brilliant remake of the George A. Romero classic Night of the Living Dead (1968) who actually turns in the screenplay for this, made years before the recent Hollywood fascination with horror remakes, The Hills Have Eyes (2006), The Omen (2006), The Ring (2002), Dawn of the Dead (2004), The Wicker Man (2006) &amp; Black Christmas (2006) to name just six of the top of my head this '90 version of Night of the Living Dead is how it should be done &amp; I thought it was a great film on many levels. The script stays pretty faithful to the original which to be fair I haven't seen in a number of years so the exact details of it are a little hazy, it starts out almost scene-for-scene although it changes things at the end. This treats the original material with respect &amp; adds it's own ideas without drastically altering things which is how a remake should be I suppose, I really liked the ironic ending where the heroic Ben was in fact wrong &amp; if they'd listened to the selfish Harry they would have all been rescued. The character's are very strong here &amp; I particularly liked Ben who gets some really good dialogue as he tries to explain things from his own perspective &amp; what he has seen prior to meeting Barabra. The film moves along at a great pace, it's never boring, it's as plausible as any film can be featuring flesh eating zombies, it's really nice to see a pretty intelligent horror film with good adult character's rather than annoying teens &amp; a well thought out script.This was the directorial debut of special make-up effects man Tom Savini &amp; it perhaps comes as a surprise that this Night of the Living Dead remake is pretty tame in the gore department, there aren't even many gory head shots, there's a severed hand, a few rotten zombies &amp; not much else but the story compensates. To be fair the filmmakers were forced to cut some of the gorier stuff to get the rating that they wanted, however there is a documentary on the DVD release with some of the gore shots that were cut out. There's a nice tension to the film, the in fighting between Harry &amp; Ben together with the ever growing hordes of zombies outside.With a supposed budget of about $4,200,000 this is very well made with good production values, impressive special make-up effects &amp; very good acting especially Todd.Night of the Living Dead '90 is a top film, it's how remakes should be done &amp; is a fantastic homage to original that is a great film in it's own right. Definitely well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had some anticipation that this might be a good horror zombie film. All that was evaporated, within the opening sequence, hackneyed, unrealistic characters, but not particularly funny characters. The zombies are not scary. Mostly this is a cheaply made film. Zombies are normally shown on camera at night time or at a distance whereby you don't see any detail. It could be you or I just ambling about. A couple of bits where zombies pop up, OK maybe make you jump but this is a frustrating to watch film. First the zombies move so slow you could run by them easily, the acting is over the top and not funny. It is a ridiculous film.Beware this film is not so awful that its good, its just awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night Of The Living Dead 1990 - Perfect example of how NOT to remake a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched The Night Of The Living Dead 1990 Remake, I can say it's flat out terrible.Tom Savini... good effects man... Horrible director.But it wasn't the bad direction that bothered me as much as the writing. It was absolutely meaningless. The original worked together perfectly. But the ending of the remake was awful, and the least of it's problems. You see, the original film had a simple ending with a great message. Also, it came across very well that the lack of working together is what doomed them.The only epilogue in the ORIGINAL is that when the "posse" comes the next morning, they see Ben in the window. He was the sole survivor, but they shot him in the head assuming he was a zombie. OK, good. Irony well done. It was simple and powerful. With this film, there is No surprise, no drama, no fright and we're off to the start of what is a VERY unfulfilling film when all is said and done. Technically incompetent, badly directed, no clear focus, a bad script, a loose re-working of points that were strong in the original, turned into an unfocused mess of points that fail to emerge coherently.Barbara is the survivor, this time. She escapes and comes back for help. This is done VERY unconvincingly, first of all. I mean geez. In the beginning, she could hardly do anything. But then after spending time with people that annoyed her to no end she suddenly gets survival skills OUT OF NOWHERE.She says she can walk right past them. So... at this point if she was in there with people she wasn't liking that were fighting and arguing, why doesn't she? She just got done screaming at everyone saying they were fighting like 2 year olds. Yet, she stays. This is ridiculous for the next reason: The ridiculous thing is that she DOES leave and DOES walk right past them.Yes... AFTER everything falls apart, and AFTER everything has gone from bad to worse, when the horror of it all is getting bad when they are ALL out there, THEN she just runs out there and gets away.....makes no sense. None. She could have done this at any time, but it feels like she didn't until it was "convenient" for the writers. And she had MUCH less trouble out there than Ben had for 2 minutes! WHAT???? So OK.... THEN...After Ben and Harry had their shootout, Harry locks himself in the attic while Ben, with the good common sense is the one that finds himself in the basement. He sees the keys to the gas pump which they thought they had but failed, and laughs.OK... that ending worked well enough. But then it gets very stupid.Barbara comes back the next morning, and sees Zombie Ben coming from the basement, and he's shot. ..........WHAT???? Well, there goes the intelligent ending to the first film. It didn't bother me so much that they "changed" it. Rather it's because they failed to HAVE an intelligent ending because of what happened next.Barbara then finds Harry that made everything fall apart. He's glad to see her and he's alive. Yes, the selfish, troublemaking guy you hated was the sole survivor. Barbara puts a bullet in HIS head.uhh............ OK. What a stupid ending.I mean... what are we supposed to learn from this? That if you're selfish and you can't work with the others, then you'll survive, but then the other survivor will come back and shoot you? What an incoherent mess of an ending. There's no moral. Just some "haha he got shot" ending. The ending went on way too long. In the end there was no strong moral. No point.Where's the irony? Where's the message? Where's the point? It's the least of the film's problems. Incompetent directing, a general disregard, and an "let's get through it" mentality, a sloppy lack of attention to detail of character development, sloppy story writing, plus more.Rather just a rehashed concept from a superior film. These, classic characters, re-imagined as flat, uninspired characters who "go through the motions" and play their cardboard parts until the plot ends and the confused multiple mixed "messages" begin and last for 5 minutes more than original ever needed to make one, solid point. A lingering, confused ending with no real point is our reward for a full runtime of a shlocky and incompetent film based on a masterpiece of cinema. Why even release a film as bad as this?There was no real mystery. Just a mindless action film with an ending that was tacked on. Nothing was horrific, and the film even sorta hits you over the head with "Well, you know what's going to happen. So here's some zombies." The intelligent commentary, all gone. Replaced with points that make no sense.OK, it's fine that the timid, catatonic girl from the first one, took charge of her situation for once. But they made her TOO much into "G.I Jane" in this remake. It went too far, was heavy handed and everything. It was also poorly pulled off. I would have loved the idea if it was done right.Oh what? Suddenly she gets a pair of pants instead of a long skirt, a gun, and suddenly she's Sigorney Weaver in Aliens?! If it had looked convincing or felt convincing, I would have got behind it. But it didn't. I could get behind nothing in the film.It's not that the film couldn't have been remade, but if it was remade by someone who understood the concept and by a competent director and smart writing, it could have succeeded. The film fails largely due to the lack of these things.And by that, I mean it REALLY fails. Nothing is done well in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're coming to get you again, Barbara!!! ?And in color this time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Professional and surprisingly successful remake of George A. Romero's groundbreaking horror milestone with the same title, that retells ? in color ? the simplistic, yet still very unsettling premise of recently deceased corpses that rise from their tombs for unknown reasons, and go after the living. Remakes usually are a curse for us, horror fans, but "Night of the Living Dead" is a different story, since director Tom Savini obviously made this film because he wanted to tribute the original instead of using the idea of a remake as an easy excuse to further exploit a profitable franchise. This new version also is a full-blooded and genuine horror film with loads of tension (even though you mostly know what'll happen next, it's still scary), good acting (a lovely B-cast with names like Tony Todd, Tom Towles and Bill Moseley) and excellent make-up effects (although, it has to be said, the gore is a less outrageous than expected). Of course, the original can't be topped anywhere, since the initial shock-impact has gone and since Savini can't create the same unbearable atmosphere of mystery and despair. However, even if you swear by the original and know it by heart, I'd still like to encourage you to watch this version for the following reason: after about sixty minutes of sticking loyally to the original, Savini's "Night of the Living Dead" all of a sudden stops being a homage and NEW script-elements, either specifically added or recovered ideas that didn't made the final cut of the 1968 version, are brought in! Barbara's character, for example, is a much stronger female lead here that courageously assists Ben in kicking zombie-butt. The entire ending is different as well, and leans closer to the events in "Dawn" and "Day". In fact, you can almost state that the last half hour of Savini's film is a tiny third sequel, rather than a docile remake. Either way you look at it, this film is warmly recommended entertainment for horror fanatics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its a remake of the classic Zombie movie that we all know and love, and after seeing it again, I was thinking 'yes, the makeup is very good, but what exactly is the point of all this?'.....So the story goes that a Molly Ringwald lookalike and Bill Mosely are attacked by the living dead (in the day, may I add), Bill gets it, and Molly ends up finding refuge in a nearby house.Not long after, Candyman of all people arrives, and soon the film goes down the house invasion way, with added guests. Soon, the middle class family finding refuge, become the monsters, and all subliminal messages about ethnicity, race, and racial tension arise, whilst all the while, Tom Savini's wonderful creations pop through windows and doors....It's all very well with the great effects, and the competent acting, but when all is said and done, its a pretty pointless affair, just like the remake of Psycho, it's not a bad film by any means, just very pointless.But, this is a film that's been remade a fair few times, and they are worth seeing just to see how they mess it up each time.So all in all, great make up, good performances, but it's like a broken pencil.Pointless.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to say that I have not seen the original so I know that I am not technically allowed to be rating this at all, but I felt like it needed rating.I'm going to start out by responding to some of the negative comments.Barbara's screaming in the beginning may be annoying, but it led into a great character transition which amplified the whole magnitude of the situation she was in. As for the overall acting, I would tend to agree with the claim that it was bad. However, it was not OBNOXIOUSLY bad. It is at least as good as most horror films.I did read one comment that said that the screenplay was bad...which is kind of funny because some respected guy named George A. Romero did it. Not to mention it contains what is now my favorite opening line to a film, "They're coming for you Barbara (evil laugh)" I'm putting it on my myspace.But the real brilliance of this film is how, unlike other horror films, it provides a perfect balance of character sanity. This film actually has characters making SMART decisions, and it keeps all of the scares along with it. However, there are of course plenty of bad decisions that balance it out...but i don't feel like writing spoilers...I could go on forever, but im not going to waste our time. I just wanted to respond to those critiques. And once again i haven't seen the original so i cant talk, but i got this one because its impossible to find the original anywhere, and from what i hear they're both very similar.

		<shortDescription>A Well-Done But Unnecessary Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While visiting the grave of their mother, Johnny (Bill Moseley) and Barbara (Patricia Tallman) are attacked by a handful of zombies -- Barbara escapes. Her escape is only temporary, though, as she soon finds herself boarded up inside a house with only a few other survivors trying desperately to fend off the growing zombie menace.I gave this film a lower rating for one primary reason: it was not a necessary remake. The original "Night of the Living Dead" remains a classic and I think many, if not most, horror fans would agree it cannot be topped by a remake. I suppose the argument could be made about most remakes being unnecessary (and this is true), but this one really seemed just too much. Also, I didn't like all the screaming. (And I should say the zombie girl just wasn't as scary here as in the original.) Okay, those gripes aside, this was a pretty decent movie. The main actress (Patricia Tallman) started off a bit annoying, but once her character adjusted to the invasion of the undead, really came into the part. Her militant look really helped. Tom Towles gives a decent performance, but nothing compared to anything he's done with Rob Zombie or in "Henry". Bill Moseley's part is small, and thankfully so. I didn't like his character one bit, and would not have enjoyed seeing more of him (or of Moseley).The best actor award easily goes to the male lead, Tony Todd. Although Todd has appeared in countless horror films of the past two decades, he will forever be known as the Candyman. This film, pre-"Candyman", really lets him shine. He shows anger, compassion, fear and plays all aspects wonderfully. I am glad the part went to Todd and not others who had tried out for the role (Ving Rhames or Laurence Fishbourne, allegedly) -- I would not be surprised this was what lead Todd to becoming the horror icon he is today. Clive Barker (or whoever casted "Candyman") would have loved this.This is also Tom Savini's directing debut. While there's nothing overly stylistic about it, there's nothing really bad either -- a fine debut. Savini is of course best known for his makeup work, particularly with George A. Romero, so it's no surprise he was given the okay to work on this project in the director's chair. Russ Streiner, the original Johnny (and a heck of a nice guy in real life), makes a very brief cameo as a sheriff (blink and you'll miss him). Romero acts as a producer, and I wouldn't be surprised if other original cast/crew have a hand in this one.Although this remake was not needed as I said, it does have a few advantages. One might say the color helps, but I wouldn't. The gore is noticeably increased, which many horror fans will appreciate. The language is more violent and modern, which I think is good (to be in a zombie crisis and not curse seems strange). And the notorious lynching scene looks great here, possibly the best new thing added to this version (it's a great concept and a fine visual experience).Howard Maxford calls this one "disappointing" and says it is an "Over-talkative, lethargically handled remake, rather pointless given that the original has now been colourized." Why the color issue matters, I don't know. One thing i enjoyed about this version was the zombie with the slit clothes (yes, kids, sometimes funeral directors dress your relatives in clothes with no back to get them on easier).If you're watching this to avoid seeing the original, I think you're making a big mistake. In my opinion, all original films should be seen before the remakes, and in this case the original is simply better. Embrace the fact that even older films have a charm to them and can be great in their own way even by modern standards. There's a reason George Romero is a legend, and it's not for producing this remake. However, if you liked the original and want to see another vision of it, this one is better than a lot of the other versions that have been floating around in recent years (such as the 30th Anniversary edition or the 3-D version).</fullReview>

However, after seeing this I can honestly say I have no regrets and I believe that fans of the original are likely to enjoy this movie as there are enough twists from the original movie to keep them entertained and guessing throughout.Perhaps not surprisingly the performances aren't as good as the original but they certainly don't subtract from the overall quality of the movie. One of the coolest things about the original was that it was in black and white and looked grainy.This movie is in colour and because of this, the zombies have more visible make up effects and look more like the living dead, rather than a bunch of people who just don't look too good. Because of this, I'd go as far to say that this remake is, in a way, more creepier due to the realism of the zombies.Overall, I would say if you are a fan of the original, you should see this as it is a great example of how to properly remake a movie without damaging the integrity of the name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOTLD, 22 Years Later (and with a different tone)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS Of The Living Dead* This is a remake of the superior 1968 movie, but is still an enjoyable movie in its own right, like Poseidon, Hills Have Eyes, John Carpenter's The Thing, David Cronenberg's The Fly, Ocean's 11 and The Ring (even if Ring and Poseidon are superior to the originals, but I digress...) You know the drill. Barbara (Patricia Tallman) runs away after having been attacked, along with her brother Johnny (Bill Moseley), by zombies, and hides in a farm, where she meets Ben (Tony Todd), the Cooper family (Tom Towles and McKee Anderson, with I-Don't-Know-Who as Katie, their daughter) and young hicks Tom (William Butler) and Judy (Katie Finneran).Will they manage to survive the Night? In this movie Barbara is the total opposite of how she was in the original; she's like a Lara Croft ante litteram, tough as nails yet capable of compassion.Harry Cooper is a 'jerk without a cause', which does not make sense.There are also a lot of in-jokes for people who (like me) have seen the original; the shot of the garden spade (which was the weapon zombie Katie used to kill Helen in the original) while Zombie Katie was killing her mother Helen, or the 'Zombie!... not' gag at the beginning.There is also a heartbreaking scene which involves a female zombie (the one who holds a doll like it was her baby in the one-sheet), Barbara and a gun.All of this gives the movie a self-consciousness which makes the movie less scary, but not less fun to watch.All in all, I think this is a fair remake.NOTLD (1990): 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're coming to get you, Barbara!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you're George Romero, writer and director of one of the most influential horror movies ever, Night of the Living Dead (1968), and it's some twenty odd years later and you're executive producing a remake of said movie. Who do you get to direct? How about special effects master Tom Savini, the man responsible for the horrifying effects in Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Day of the Dead (1985)? Seems a pretty good choice to me...Night of the Living Dead (1990) stars Tony Todd and Patricia Tallman as Ben and Barbara, respectively, two individuals who seek refuge in a farmhouse as a legion of hungry corpses descend upon them and soon find the house not so much a haven as a claustrophobic nightmare. They also discover they aren't the only ones in the house, as there are five people locked in the basement. Emerging from their hidey-hole are Harry and Helen Cooper, a married couple, and Tom and Judy Rose, a younger couple, Tom's uncle being the owner of the house. Also in the basement is the Cooper's daughter, Sarah, who has become ill after being bitten by one of the undead (guess where that's going). A diverse group, for sure, and one that finds itself at odds in if it's better to fortify the house or retreat to the fairly secure basement. Harry thinks it's best to go into the basement and bar the door, but Ben would rather board up all the doors and windows, using the basement as a last option, as there is only one way in and out and he doesn't want to trap himself down there unless he absolutely has to...Harry, who is quite vocal throughout, thinks this plan foolish and says once he goes into the basement and bars the door, he won't open it for anything, regardless. As tensions flare, night falls, and the dead begin arriving in greater numbers, I guess sensing the warm, living flesh they so crave to be inside the house. As the situation grows worse, an escape plan is formulated, but the plan soon falls apart, and it's back to the house. Who lives? Who dies? Is rescue in the wings, or should they just put their heads between their legs and kiss their hinders good-bye? It's always a sketchy affair remaking a film, especially one that's deemed a classic and definitive representation of its' genre. Look what happened in 1998 when director Gus Van Sant released a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. A total and tremendous flop...Yes, I am sure there was a awful lot of apprehension to redoing a movie that really didn't need to be redone, but the end result turned out an interesting update, remaining true to the original while adding a few surprises along the way. Tony Todd is excellent as Ben, and is definitely the strongest characterization in the film, bringing a lot of what Duane Jones did in the original, while adding personal nuances to make the character his own. Patricia Tallman's character of Barbara starts out the same as the original played by Judith O'Dea, but goes through some serious changes by the end, allowing for the a modernization of the character to fit more along the lines of the strong female lead, as seen in the Alien films with Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver. Was this for the better? I am still undecided, but it certainly made interesting viewing. The character I found most annoying was that of Harry Cooper, played by Tom Towles. His portrayal was overblown to the point of being silly, with his constant yelling, screaming, and berating of other characters. The Harry Cooper in the original was a jerk, for sure, but at least you got the feeling it was a jerkiness borne of overriding desire to protect his family, even if his plans were at odds with the rest of the group, allowing for viewers to develop some empathy for the character. Here, the character is played as a bonehead to the nth degree, and it only served to, in my opinion, disrupt the flow of the film. The biggest difference between the original an the remake is obviously the color factor, but one will also notice that the undead are much more detailed than in the original, due to a much larger production budget. You can tell a great amount of effort was taken in this area, enhancing on the original film. The film wasn't quite as gory as I thought it was going to be, but that's pretty well explained in a making of featurette. Seems in order to avoid an X rating, these scenes were either removed or toned down. Savini didn't seem too upset about it, as he felt, and I agree, that sometimes what you don't see is just as effective as what you do see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not overly terrifying, but pretty good remake of the classic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead tells the story of a radioactive contamination that raises dead people from their graves. A small group of people end up trapped in a remote farmhouse and having to fight off the living dead as they swarm the house, hungry for human flesh. Granted, this movie isn't as creepy as the 1968 classic, but the concept of the film is still creepy, and it makes for a fun watch.The whole plot and concept of the movie is creepy, what with the living dead just popping out of nowhere and attacking this small group of people. Since this is basically a scene for scene remake of the original film, there's nothing really new to make a comparison with, except for the special effects and make-up. The zombie make-up in this movie is extremely well done.The acting in this movie is pretty good for a cheap horror movie. Tony Todd, best known for his role as the Candyman, is a good hero in this movie.Overall, it's not perfect, but it's nowhere close to terrible.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" is a pretty serviceable remake.**SPOILERS**Barbara, (Patricia Tallman) and her brother are attacked in a cemetery, and seeking to escape, she comes across an abandoned farmhouse in the middle of nowhere. After a while, Ben, (Tony Todd) comes to her aid, and together they stay in the house for protection. Later that day, from the basement emerges Harry Cooper, (Tom Towles) his wife Helen, (McKee Anderson) and local kids Tom, (William Butler) and his girlfriend Judy, (Katie Finneran) and they decide to formulate battle plans against the threat outside. When it's finally decided that zombies are the ones outside, the house is boarded up, but they still come after them. After trying many different ways of getting out, they resort to increasingly dangerous ideas to get out alive.The Good News: The original "Night of the Living Dead" is still considered one of the best zombie films around, and really doesn't deserve to be remade. That being said, this isn't that bad of a film if looked at on its own. The zombies here are certainly far better-looking than in the original. Decayed and rotting just a tad, with the slightest amount of facial scars and wounds that give them a little edge over the zombies in the original. The Cemetery Zombie at the beginning is the best of the redesigned zombies from the original, and a rather hideously realized Autopsy Zombie looks really spectacular. It should be known from his description what he looks like, and it comes across beautifully in a great gag. In keeping with the spirit of the original, the gags here are a little on the small side, and held back, which makes it a little more impressive. Considering the talent involved, the fact that it isn't an over-the-top gore-fest, and is instead a more restrained film, making it a pretty subtle film that is easier to get into. There is none of the political sub-text in here to bog the film down, which is certainly a case with the original. Here, we don't have much in the way of political sub-text, or at least any that's highly noticeable right off the bat and this helps to make it a more singular film. It doesn't need any to be enjoyable and it's nice that it doesn't. However, the one thing great about this film is that it uses the knowledge of the original to get you off center enough to not expect the shocks coming. It's a masterful trickery that comes across so nicely and unexpectedly to get the shocks. Again, bringing up the cemetery scene as an example: seeing Johnny and Barbara talking about one of his insensitive comments, they don't see a man shambling up behind them. When he tackles Barbara and is revealed to be just an ordinary man, it sets up the shock of the real zombie coming out of nowhere into the scene. Other such scenes is a couple brilliant scenes in the farmhouse that don't need spoiling. There are plenty of such scenes along the way that trick you from watching the first one.The Bad News: That above being said, there are a few problems with the film. The biggest one is the zombies themselves. They are just too slow to be threatening at all. I love the shuffling kind of zombies, but these are taken to the extreme and are just ridiculous. At one point, one remarks that they are slow enough to walk around with getting bit, which is exactly what happens later, and yet at the time it was uttered, no one takes it seriously. When it is revealed to be just the way to escape makes it all the more ironic at the time it was said, and all the more ludicrous why it wasn't tried earlier so that the whole situation could've been avoided. I pointed out the lack of gore in the beginning one as well, and this can be a curse as well as a blessing. This isn't something for the gore-hounds out there, despite the names involved and their reputations. We do get a couple neat and inventive gags here and there, but this is nowhere near what it could've been or should've been. The role reversions from the original may get under people's skin a little, but I didn't feel this was enough to distract from the enjoyment of the film. One more thing: the gag with Ben at the end is pretty confusing. We never are told what the probable cause was that lead to the creatures, nor are we told that it comes from bites. His fate is direct contradiction from zombie lore, and what happens makes you scratch your head a little.The Final Verdict: Not exactly as pessimistic as the first one was, or as ground-breaking, this is still pretty enjoyable in most places. It doesn't damage or tarnish the reputation like the v30th Anniversary release does, and is a pretty nice viewing anyway. Give it a chance and don't judge it against the original, it isn't that bad.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, themes of matricide and Brief rear Nudity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Remake by Tom Savini!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was wrong about this film when it was released in-1990, thinking it was just a lame-hijacking of George Romero's story by some moron. Boy, was I wrong! It was co-produced by (and given a slight-revision in the screenplay) Romero and John Russo, the co-creators of the original. With Tom Savini directing-it, you cannot-go-wrong here, it's incredible, and Tom wanted to make it gorier, but the distributors wouldn't allow-it. I think at-this-point Savini was burned-out doing the makeup-gig, and has continued-directing since this film, whenever he can. He should, he's great-at-it, and has a good-eye for composition and timing--both crucial to effective-horror. Coupled-with his makeup-expertise, he is just excellent as a horror-director. I recommend his recent DVD-production, it's classic-horror that looks professional and solid.It should-be-noted that the film was made--in-part--to "shore-up" Romero's and Russo's (as-well as everyone who was involved-with the original) copyright to the original-film, which is only-fair--they have barely-been-paid for it since 1968. You know the little-copyright underneath a film-title in older-films? A distributor forgot-to-include this in the theatrical-prints, which is why you see DOZENS of shoddy-editions of the 1968-version. The Elite edition is the only-one to own, period. The only-downside is Elite should have wrangled an isolated-score function (which should be on all horror-films where the materials-exist to do it), as the original-score is very hard-to-find now.The film? It's an excellent-updating! I'm not-sure it should ever be remade after this one, honestly, it's so basic in the look that I cannot see it becoming-dated anytime-soon. Ususally, it is VERY young-individuals who say something is "dated". What does this mean?! Dated. Nothing, it just means you watched bad-prints of a film, and it created a false-aesthetic in your mind. Where-else does it exist? Your coffee-table? Anyway, Tony Todd was the best-choice in this remake, he's a Shakespearian-trained actor, and possibly one of America's greatest-living-actors. He even equals Duane Jones, one of the best-heroes in film-history in the 1968-version. But what is so radical in the 1990-version is the character of Barbara (played-wonderfully by Patricia Tallman), who is assertive and a genuine-survivor, a big-step even for-Romero at the time. But don't trust me, look at other horror-films from-1990, and you tell me.It should-be-noted that Bill Mosley is in the beginning-sequence as Barbara's brother, Johnny: "They're coming-to-get-you, Barbara. They're coming-for-you!" He's great! Overall, this is a worthy-remake that is gorier, freakier, and scarier in some-spots than the original. This is only due-to the constraints that faced the original--mostly because it was treading-virgin-soil! You can never top the 1968-version, it will never be done, because it was so revolutionary (still is) and original. It is THE original, and can be cited as truly kicking-off modern-horror as we know it today. The social-commentary should be obvious, and the film wears its politics openly, and proudly, as-it-should. Tom Savini's makeup-crew did an excellent-job on this film, and it had me cringing!I especially-thought they got the blood correct, it is usually-dark in real-life (ugh). If a remake doesn't say-something (anything) about the time we live-in, it isn't worth-much, but this film spoke (and speaks) well. The Columbia DVD is pretty-good, and has great-sound and an excellent-featurette.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Night of the Living' Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A surprisingly good remake of the 1968 George A. Romero classic, directed by make-up effects artist Tom Savini, making his directorial debut.Seven strangers barricade themselves in an isolated farmhouse while cannibalistic zombies walk the countryside. The heroine is stronger, the violence and gore are more frequent and disgusting, and the zombies are ugly, to say the least.Sometimes characterized as a scene-for-scene remake, those critics should open their eyes a little wider because the end was completely different from the original, as was the beginning -- also taking the second paragraph's points into consideration as well.Good job, Mr. Savini! George A. Romero also wrote the screenplay for this one, too. Yes, Romero and Savini make a great team!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a great remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that i am surprised... I have now for the last two months or saw seen all of the films that are related to this series and this ends up as the second best. The original will always get credit, with all right, for being original but it it really lacks when it comes to acting, score, makeup etc. Savini, John A. Russo and Romero have really added was missing in terms of casting and script. The movie also gains a lot from not trying to be shocking. There are scenes in the original version where the movie really became to pretentious in that aspect. A thing that surprised me during the movie was the fact that the comments from media was largely removed. I can understand why they wanted to remove the babble about radiation from Venus or what ever it was. I bet Romero really regretted this part of the original NOTLD (with good cause) since there has was no mention of this in the remake. I was wondering though how they would tie up the ending. I must say that the new ending was much more in line with what could be read between the lines in the original. Anyway, it is of course not perfect. The acting by Tony Todd is good and Patricia Tallman as Barbara get better as the movie progresses. This can be said about the movie too actually, the beginning is not as gripping as it should have been much due to Barbaras overacting brother. All in all 7/10, treat your friends to this version if they are not die hard for classic horror. I really can not think of anyone i know who would sit through the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good remake of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you start to watch this film, it never gets boring. For those who have seen the original, you can see that Romero stayed very close to the original movie with alterations of course which looked like politically correct moves if you ask me. I will get to that later. From beginning to end we see what effect it has on a small group of people locked inside a house. Here the characters are very much like in the original with the exception of Barbara. Her character has changed while the girlfriend of Tom behaves very much like Barbara of the original, even though in the original the girlfriend acts totally different. The characters aren't very likable but we do begin to like to them because they do whatever they can to stay alive during this tragedy. Harry Cooper being the arrogant prick who wants to be in charge, but is defied by Ben who soul purpose is to stay alive and help those around him to stay alive as well. Barbara is the only character that has changed and had adapted to our social standards. At first she get's into shock over the tragedy of losing her brother and being attacked by creatures who appear to be not to be alive at all. But after she meets up with Ben, she starts to change to become as dominant as Ben is. I don't mind that, but it did the original some injustice by turning one of the leads into a dominant lead while in the original she was in shock throughout the movie and get's killed. I think most people might agree that of fear of being called a sexist or being un-PC, they changed Barbara's character. Like I said, I don't mind, but lately that is all we get shoved down our throats in horror movies these days. In most modern horror movies, the men and woman start as equal, probably the men being the dominant, but when tragedy strikes, the women take charge and survive while the men die. The feminists may complain that the original was to sexist because it portrays women as weak and defenseless. Whether or not the Barbara character was altered out of fear of being attacked by feminist groups, I don't know, but I do know that too many horror movies these days are about though, dominant female leads who survive the tragedy that befalls them while the men succumb to the tragedy. It is like women have to prove themselves that they can be emotionally and physically strong. We know that there are both men and women out there who are either one of those and sometimes both. But what is the point of killing of all the characters except of one female one? Oh well, it is probably my fault for not being politically correct all the time. I don't really care if I'm PC or not. Okay, I stop ranting now. Anyway I do recommend this movie to every horror buff in the world and fans of the original. There wasn't much gore present, but than again, there wasn't much gore either in the original. They insinuated the gore instead of showing it. although I do prefer seeing the gore, but the insinuation of it works very well. Afterall Alfred Hitchcok made his career from making movies where everything happens in the human psyche instead of on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make-up effects wizard TOM SAVINI slips into the directors chair, for this very worthy remake to genre fave GEORGE A. ROMERO'S ground breaking &amp; very influential, scary NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968).Bickering sibling's BARBARA (PATRICIA TALLMAN) &amp; her childish brother JOHNNY (Genre fave BILL MOSELEY) are visiting their fathers grave site, when they are attacked by man eating corpses, recently risen from the grave after a radioactive space probe, returning from mars brings with it, an odd virus that returns the dead back from their graves. Boarding herself up in a farmhouse with BEN (A good turn by TONY TODD) hot headed, racial HARRY COOPER (TOM TOWLES) &amp; his wife &amp; badly injured daughter, naive TOM (BILL BUTLER) &amp; his girlfriend. However Barbara soon realizes, the zombies aren't nearly as much a threat as the boiling tensions going on in the house with those with whom she is holding up with.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is a really fun &amp; well put together remake! Unlike his original outing, Romero was gifted with a real budget to do better zombie make-ups &amp; stunts. TOM SAVINI who missed out on the chance to do make-up effects on Romero's original film, makes up for it here both in front &amp; behind the camera. Savini turns out to be a really good director &amp; he was also able to amp up the gore &amp; zombie make-up, as well as surprising genre fans with a few nice twists to the already by then, familiar story, to help keep it fresh &amp; interesting. The film's opener adds a nice twist, while Johnny is teasing Barbara about the dead coming back to get her, we see someone staggering towards her, much like the original film had happen. However when he grabs her, it turns out to be a confused &amp; scared old man &amp; not a zombie, only for the first zombie to rise instead attack Johnny from behind &amp; not Barbara! The special effects by EVERETT BURRELL &amp; JOHN VULICH are great! in fact they are far superior to anything Romero had to work with on the first. Also far superior over Romero's film, is the acting, which blows the acting seen in the original classic right out of the water. Savini radically changes the ending of the film as well. After dying in the basement from his gun shot wound, Ben returns as a flesh hungry zombie that gets shot in the head by a posse investigating the insides of the house. Barbara survives &amp; shoots Harry, who survived the zombie home invasion by hiding in the attic. Therefore the ending isn't nowhere near as controversial as in Romero's film. Savini also toughens the character of Barbara up, by having her fighting back at the living dead, rather than leaving the character in an almost cationic state like she was in the original &amp; Savini as well pays tribute to DAWN OF THE DEAD, by showing scores of Hunters shooting the zombies that have been strung up from trees. Amazingly though, Savini, while having done tons of spectacular ground breaking make-up effects, on many genre favourite horror films, doesn't really ratchet up to much gore, certainly not what one would expect, at least to where zombie films are concerned. In fact, in many ways, it's actually quiet tame in this area. The suspense &amp; tension is well orchestrated throughout the films running time, so even though genre fans will recognize many moments of the original repeated here, it somewhat manages to pack the same punch as it's predecessor. Great score as well.All in all, while the film lacks the same impact the original had &amp; was nowhere near as groundbreaking (Not surprising since genre fans had seen quiet a few zombie films by this point, bearing the same rules that Romero introduced in his original film) it still manages to be well worth a look for horror fans. Ironically the film is (at the time of this review) just one of seven remakes! (This film included). NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 3D (&amp; it's sequel) NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: ORIGINS 3D, NIGHT OF THE LIVING 3D DEAD, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (2004 unreleased Canadian production), the truly deplorable NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: RESURRECTION, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: RE-ANIMATED (An animated feature) &amp; spoofed in both MIMESIS: NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD &amp; ANOTHER NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Out of all the remakes I seen, this one is still the best! Associate Produced by CHRISTINE ROMERO. GEORGE A. ROMERO serves as an executive Producer.***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the 1960's version of this, but this is still okay for me. It gave me the creeps I swear. The zombies were very surprising from the beginning and came as a shock to the two, Barbera and Johnny. And then there is still Ben played by Tony Todd, this has got to be a cool role he plays and very good acting too, as he plays the loner from the city who seems to know how to fight these beings. His acting was very convincing and dramatic and the last scene of him was creepy, and really frightening! And it does seem very faithful to the original Night of the Living Dead, the farm, the people, and the dad Cooper, who is mean and disgruntled, very intense acting from him. And his famous lines were great and went like "a way in is a way out!" or "none of them yo-yos has got a car! Yo-yos! Ya bunch of Yo-yos!" Classic. Recommended to all fans of the dead trilogy, which no longer will be one as Romero is filming another, and to those who have seen the original, this one has many more surprises, which you will notice, watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead (1990) was the feature length directorial debut of Special F.X. master/Actor/Stuntman Tom Savini. He made a fun remake/ update of the seminal zombie/apocalyptic horror classic. Even though the film had a low budget, the effects were amazing. Tony Todd and Patricia Tallman play the leads whilst perennial cult villain Tom Towles co-stars as well. The film for the most part is a scene-for-scene redux with a few changes (that I found quite refreshing I might add).Some fans of the original have been critical of this movie for some reason. I was stoked when this movie came out and when I left the cinema I was satisfied with the end results. Tom Savini did very well and I hope he gets a chance to direct in the near future.Recommended for genre fans</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is This The Best Zombie Movie Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It probably is. I don't know what you cinema fans think, but I think this remake is even better than George Romero's original movie from 1968. When the original Night Of The Living dead came out, it was very scary, and also original... Even though nowadays zombie movies aren't the most original things ever, this one is probably the best one out there.The story is the same from the 1968 movie. Seven people are trapped in a house, and out there, just zombies, lots of them. It looks like some radioactive disaster has happened, so all the dead are now back to life, and they are looking for food - human brains.Tom Savini has always done an excellent job by doing make-ups in horror movies, and now he shows himself as a very good director (make-up is another important aspect in zombie movies, and it was done well in this one). The movie isn't very original, and it doesn't have anything that makes it so good, but when you watch it, you'll agree with me... It's a fun movie to watch, and being this way, I consider it the best zombie movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is pretty much an updated Remake of the original NotLD. Every thing the same happens except: The Female is now "Hard" and isn't a complete wimp. She destroys zombies and actually runs to find help and does infact find help. The blackman is a zombie at the end of the movie. The other person man who they find in the house is alive at the end and they shoot him. The effects are generally better. Although I felt like I was watching a 2hour long Tales from the crypt show. Nothing wrong with that, I happen to be a fan of TftC. Made by Tom Savini. 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw the original NOTLD film about ten years ago after having first seen Dawn of the dead and its follow up Day of the dead.After having seen those two films I was looking forward to seeing the first dead movie.What a disappointment! With great apprehension I hired out a copy of the remake and prepared to be bored stiff.But I wasn't.I thoroughly enjoyed it in particular the character of Barbara.In the original she was weak and pathetic this time around she was much more aggressive and seemed to enjoy herself blowing away the living dead. The storyline is pretty much the same as the original bar the ending but the acting and the make up effects are superior.Tom Savini did a great job with this film and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really do enjoy this remake. It doesn't require too much thinking, you can pretty much be a zombie and enjoy the flick (knuck knuck).... Considering all the other zombie flicks that are out there.. this one is pretty decentThe acting is a little campy... the special effects are sort of lame by todays standards.. it never explains why the zombies are there... they just are.. All and all, these components contribute to me enjoying this film.I really do admire George A. Romero and Tom Savini for all their work they have put into Zombie movies... I, myself, am I huge Resident Evil fan but this is classic.8/10 for zombie genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Often, remaking a classic is not recommended (eg: Psycho) but sometimes it works, and this is a good example. The acting was great as "Candyman" star Tony Todd was a welcome Ben (He even looked like he was holding a hook the first time you see him) and Patricia Tallman from "Babylon 5" was great as a more fearless Barbara. The gore was tame for my standards, but was tasteful in its presentation of gore. One would expect more gore in a Tom Savini Film, but perhaps it was better suited to a less gory treatment.&lt;SPOILER AHEAD&gt; The only thing that bugged me was hot Ben became a zombie in the end after locking himself in the cellar. He killed the Helen zombie and locked himself in, so who else was down there? &lt;SPOILER END&gt;Overall a fun, scary film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the best horror remake ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a great reamake of an already great horror classic. I enjoy this one more for several reasons: 1) This one's in color. You can see the grisliness of the corpses 2) The charachter of Barabara isn't like she was in the original a blabbering idiot in a dazed state of shock.This Barabara is a fighter who says what I think most of us watching zombie films say to ourselves "Look how slow they are? We could run right past them and go get help!" And she does. The first films Barabara was very annoying in her state of helplessness. This Barabara rocks! 3) Seeing Harry (the Basement King) get his in this one is a much better revenge sequence than in the original movie as he is a bigger bastard in this movie than the first. Tom Savini should definatley make more horror films as he definatley has a great knack for making horror films. Bill Mosely's short-lived Johnny charachter is a stand-out performance as is the casting of Candyman hisself Tony Todd as the black man main charachter Ben. I heard their in talks of remaking Dawn of the Dead now and my only advice to Hollywood is to get the man who starred in that 1979 classic sequel to Night of the living Dead and that is to get Tom Savini to direct this one as well. Thank you Mr Romero and Mr Russo for such a great story that caused me to have many a nightmare as a young kid as to me the most awful death to think of would be to be pulled apart by a bunch of dead people to be eaten alive.***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like edge of your seat action and non stop fright, then you have to see the 1990 remake of "Night of The Living Dead" a horror fan's dream come true.This movie was just indescribable! I have never seen such a nerve wracking movie! I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end!The cast was one of the best ever assembled and the talent in this movie was as evident as champagne at an aristocratic event.What can you say about Patricia Tallman except that she is dynamite incarnate! She plays Barbara, a shy, timid and somewhat neurotic woman who was obviously under the thumb of her recently deceased mother. But she soon does a lot of growing up and has a wit for survival that could rival any Navy SEAL or Army Recon and an aim to match!Throw in her brother Johnny, played as only it could have been by the awesome Bill Mosley and you have the makings of a night to remember.When one thinks of cool, bad as they come and a force to be reckoned with, you can't help but think of Tony Todd who stars as Ben in one of the best roles in his life. When Ben speaks, he commands your attention and you find yourself hanging on every word, hoping that he is the savior they all need.The chemistry between Ben and Barbara on the screen in magnetic and makes for as believable a movie scenario as I have ever seen. You can't help but hope that Ben and Barbara make it out alive so they can start a life together they are *that* good as a team. As two people who, through no fault of their own, are thrown into a nightmare situation where certain death is like a shadow hanging over them, they act more like leaders than victims of their horrible reality.A great supporting cast includes Tom Towles as Harry Cooper whom you pray that if the zombies get anyone, it will be him. I have never in my life seen someone so convincing as Tom was in this movie. When he finally gets his in the end, I stood up and cheered!Mckee Anderson is just as convincing as the mealy mouthed but tired of her husband's crap, Helen Cooper.Notable performances were also put in by William Butler and Katie Finneran as Tom and Judy Rose, two sweethearts who as naive as they are, have smarts of their own to help them survive.The zombies were believable, the makeup was incredible and the scenery was top notch. From cemetery to farmhouse better scenery couldn't have been found.I could have lived with a different ending but realize it was necessary to make the movie as powerful and poignant, yes poignant as it was.I would recommend this movie as one of the greatest horror films in history and would suggest you watch it with ALL the lights on!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best zombie film since the original..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD scared half the people around the world due to George A. Romero's ability to create a cult classic hit. The remake is even better. Because, for one, its in color. Two, the zombie attacks are intensified. And three, it just never slows down. The horror sequences just keep on coming. The film is great on every level. Yes, it does lack certain emotion, but it is still one of the best zombie movies ever made. The later RESIDENT EVIL scored just as many points for director Paul Anderson. I also recommend George's other zombie films, DAWN OF THE DEAD and DAY OF THE DEAD. They are not quite as good as this classic remake, but still satisfy the public's need for zombie violence and gore. I look forward in thirty years or so, to another remake of this great story.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: 5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, when you try to remake a movie such as this you do NOT expect another great master piece and at the same time you just watch this with lofty amusement I personally think. It is NOT as good as the original in some aspects, but I think its better. The acting for example was better since this time they went to acting school!The story line I felt was NEVER truly explained and as a result I couldn't understand WHY these creatures were coming back from the dead, and am I alone in thinking WHY!!?? Hehehe, I liked the whole `doomed humans struggle valiantly against those who want to eat them' bit, but in this movie there was at LEAST an attempt to show people that its not just your usual southern redneck moron who can be stupid and LOVE to shoot anything and everything that comes into sight. I didn't mind watching this movie, if anything it was, well I thought it was, a p*** take of the original movie. It almost said to me `well, we can't beat the first one but hey! Lets at least have some fun with it!' shown by the amount of old ladies and naked bodies (hey! Some of them WERE funny!) in this movie. I'm not saying for a second that this movie was a joke and designed to make you laugh, but I couldn't help it sometimes! I just hope to dear God that this movie was just about making you feel scared, because it just soooo did not succeed if it wanted to scare you, at least with me!This movie had two things going for it in my view, it had two actors which I REALLY like and will stomach ALMOST anything for, the guy from `Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyyyymannnnn..' and also the telepath from `Babylon 5.' I will watch pretty much anything with these two guys and gals, I think that they have good acting skills and wish that they could get more roles. (Coincidence that both of them at one point, though not at the same time they were in B5!?) But really, back to the movie, it was fun and well, not just a little bit silly! It had me giggling sometimes, just who REALLY shoots a God damned gas pump!? Even out of frustration! Now THAT was stupid! Hehehe, and also, the makeup on some of the zombies.. Was it makeup or lack of coffee on the scene which caused some of them to look like they'd just got out of bed? Ok, I KNOW I'm gunning a movie which I SAID I liked. but I can't take this movie serious.I mean REALLY, who CAN take this seriously?! It was not inspiring, it was not good, it was actually rather crappy. The budget for the bloody extras I'm sure was higher than the budget for this movie I'm sure! Ok, I'm in a morbid mood and as a result I'm ripping this movie to shreds but REALLY it was bad, and the final few scenes.. Oh LAWD have mercy. I just could NOT understand it. and that whole impromptu `wrestling' scene. oh God, think I'm gonna leave it and tell you plain and simple, I like this movie for its status as a `B' movie and it has two actors who I love, but otherwise if u don't like `B' movies or more to the point if u don't like actors who can't act very well, steer well WELL away, but otherwise. Sit down with the popcorn and have fun, just make sure your either stoned or very drunk when reviewing this. I think it would help. Hehehe ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I have to admit that this movie is 10 times better than the original. I've been told by numerous people that it isn't, but, I have reasons to support why I think so. 1. The pop-out Zombie in the cemetery is brilliant. 2. The make-up is outstanding. 3. Barbara doesn't just sit there. 4. The first scene in the movie is shot on a nice spring day that creates the atmosphere (for those who don't know) that it's going to be a nice movie. I could list more but there are just too many. I would also like to mention that the original film from 1968 is great as well. And something that I like about both of them is that they were shot not too far from my home in Pennsylvania. Watch both versions of the film. But I give this one a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only adds to the lustre of the original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Far from being a hackneyed reworking, Tom Savini's version of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is an excellent film in its own right. His direction is surprisingly tight for a first-time feature film director. There are very few miscues (in fact, the only one I noticed was the reflection of a cameraman in a window pane, a minor problem that a bit of judicious re-editing could correct). This production was roundly criticized for being undertaken for "financial reasons." The mind boggles. Has there ever been a feature film undertaken for any OTHER reason? (Public Access doesn't count; they're not in it for the money, anyway; I know; I've done it for years.)In terms of storytelling, the movie progresses logically, using the premise of the original as the template, and eventually veers off into uncharted territory. The direction is, again, topnotch. (So much so, in fact, that one wonders why Savini can't seem to get backing for some of his other proposed projects- like VAMPIRATES. Lesser lights are being afforded opportunities every day...) I would also go so far as to say that this is near-flawless filmmaking, on all counts. You can quote me on that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The classic 1968 version is exactly what it is, a classic, but when you watch that version you must ignore your modern perspective. This isn't so for the 1990 version, and the director Tom Savini did a wonderful job of transforming Barbara from the 1968 version of a screaming, deeply upset, useless individual, to a model of Alien's Sigourney Weaver. Other than that, the two films are very similar; the only other notable difference is the tension of the conflict between Ben and Harry Cooper, it is more intense and violent. It is a great movie, and if you enjoyed the 1968 version, or honor movies in general, you will like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes. Sequels. Who needs them? If the original movie was great, why do a new one? If the original bombed at the box office, why try again?I'm a big fan of the original movie. Claustrophobic, atmospheric and cheap. George A. Romero showed just how you could make a movie on little money which still scared the pants off of you.But I bought the DVD of the new version, even though I had never seen it. Usually I'll preview a DVD by renting it first. But I didn't do that with NOTLD 90. The main reason was respect for Romero's work. I felt that he wouldn't allow a bad version to be released. But the main reason was this: Patricia Tallman.I was familiar with Tallman's work in "Army of Darkness" and the TV-series "Babylon 5", where she played the feisty telepath Lyta Alexander.I didn't regret the purchase one bit.The script follows the original version for a good portion of the film. Once again, we hear Barbara and Johnny bickering about the visit to their mother's grave. There they encounter the first of the Undead people and Johnny dies. After crashing a Mercedes into a tree, Barbara flees to a nearby farmhouse.Once we get to the farmhouse is where it changes a little. Barbara started out mousy and meek. In the original she remained a meek damsel in distress sort. In this version, she changes into a stronger Barbara. The one who notices "They're so slow!" and that they could easily evade them. She's also the one who thinks to search Uncle Rege's body for the gas pump keys. (Funny thing, even though those keys were so important, I never saw anyone search for them.)And ultimately, it is Barbara who goes for help as the sun rises.The DVD comes with an alternate audio track with commentary by Tom Savini. Not terribly edifying, except that you hear how much gorier the film might have been. The Powers that Be cut almost all of the exit wounds.There are a couple of surprises in the ending for those who have seen the original and not this one. But rent it, or buy it: it's a keeper.</fullReview>

But Tom Savini, who also was responsible for the make-up in "Dawn of the Dead" and "Day of the Dead", did a good job with transfering the well-known story into the 90s. It is true that the social criticism and the cynical comment on the situation of the American society from the end of the 60s are completely missing, but the suspense is in no way inferior to the original and the zombies look really scary! This remake is not better than "Night of the living dead" from 1968, but it´s a really good horror movie that all fans of George A. Romero´s zombie-trilogy should have seen!8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are from the school that all remakes are lousy, you need to see this movie. Superior to the original in terms of budget, very little of the original has been lost and a lot has been added or changed to establish another nearly different movie. The same indications that the movie is a study into human behavior works here as well. The characters are the same, but there is more profanity. Details have been changed and circumstances have been altered. The color footage does affect the atmosphere established in the black and white original. The heroine becomes a different character to change with the times and update from the stereotypical woman-in-distress. Anyone who doesn't appreciate this movie probably prefers the sensationalism than the script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know my one line summary will heat some people up but sorry I think the 1990 version is truely a better movie all together. Night of the Living Dead 90 is my second fave zombie movie of all time the BEST is Return of the Living Dead (when the hell are we gonna get a special edition dvd of it) but NOTLD 90 is great. First off Romero is still on board and the best news was that Tom Savini directed it (he was the only person capable if Romero didn't do it). Tom Savini is of course a legend in the field of horror and special makeup effects and suprisingly this movie was not gore drinched like I thought it would be, its got the gore but its not overused (even though Savini says on the dvd commentary that all zombie kills were cut in one way or the other). The acting is good but it does get cheesy between Tony Todd &amp; Tom Towles (and Bill Butler's girlfriend was the best actress ya know) but for the most part it was good. I really liked how the main female went from a character who stayed in shock in the original to a character who fights for her life by the end of this version. The makeup effects were really good, the dead are not the purple big toothed ones they were in Dawn &amp; Day (which were still cool) but this time they look more like what dead people really look like....the main cemetary zombie being the highlight. The music was also really good it added a lot of atmosphere to the movie like the opening where u see the moon and the title comes across. This was one of the best horror movies of the 90's and way better than the original (thank god there was no library music)........and suprisingly all this was co-produced by Menahem Golan (someone will understand what I mean by that).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone knows the plot: Several strangers, trapped in an old farmhouse, combating the cannibalistic corpses of the recently deceased. This was very similar to the original, but a few plot additions, for example, being told who the farmhouse was owned by, added to the story. In addition, the ending was completely different and less apocalyptic. Barbara, instead of being a woman who has gone out of her mind, is more powerful and strong-willed. I liked the original ending better, but those out there who like happier endings(bah) should like this one. And to answer someone who asked: The reason Ben died and became a zombie even though he wasn't bit by one is because you do NOT have to be killed by a zombie to become one. ANYONE who dies becomes a zombie, regardless of how they die(unless of course they died from being shot in the brain). He died because he had been shot. A few interesting facts: this film was originally supposed to have a much larger scope, I assume it would have included different things outside the house like in other states and such. This was not done due to budget constraints. Also, the original NotLD was supposed to end with Barbara being the only one who survived, but this was changed. The new movie had something closer to the unused, original ending. Finally, there is a much more graphic version of the film floating around, and you might be lucky enough to find it somewhere. It supposedly shows more graphic shots of zombies getting blasted in the head, and one zombie's head explodes. This explains to one of the reviewers why the head shots didn't look very good- they were considered too graphic and cut. According to this very IMDB, the original cut of the 1990 film was rated X. Since this movie was only made to make back the money they lost on the original, they probably felt it best to not "go for the gore" like they did in the other films and release a more marketable "R" rated film. In summary: a good film with a few flaws here and there, but definately enjoyable. See both versions. I give it *** and 1/2 out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People knock it because it's a remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and not just like the first one. This is one of the best remakes ever! Did you know the director Tom Savini would have directed the original had it not been for Vietnam? He was set to direct but went of to Nam instead. Thats why the remake is so good. Romero liked it and funded it. I hear this on every remake. The first is better yadda yadda yadda. It is because it's the one you grew up with. Well those who compare with fresh eyes usually like the remake! Don't get me wrong I love the first. It was quite good. But this one is a better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie. I haven't seen the original one so I can't say it's better or not, but this was a good movie. The Zombies looked really cool, and the music was creepy. I enjoyed every minute of it. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definite high quality film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, to start it off, I have seen the original, and yes, I agree, it is a great movie; however, I must say I like this one better. I don't think they really updated this for the nineties, so much as edited the plot to make for a better story...besides, should the movie have been identical, there would have been no point for a remake, would there? A point other movie producers would do well to recognize...I find it humorous, that everyone comments on the political/social statements that this movie makes, while the whole time George Romero has stated time and again that he wasn't trying to say anything, he was simply making a movie. This isn't about racism, not about humanity's inability to pull together in a crisis, this is about the dead coming to life and trying to eat the living. Period. Yes, you can infer many things about the story, but that is all they are: inferrals, not implications.At any rate, this movie was top notch, they didn't need to include gore to make it creepy, the acting was more believable, and it made a much more effective prequel to the other living dead movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it was a lot better than the original. First of all it had higher production values, secondly: Barbara is a better character and doesn't lie down on a couch for the entire movie. Also the original's LAME A$$ ending has been changed to be much better. It questions human morals + Ben doesn't get mistaken for a damn zombie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective and welcome rendition of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an almost identical remake of the original 1968 classic filmed also in Pennsylvania, the only difference being a slight change to the ending. Stuntwoman/actress Patricia Tallman is brilliant as Barbera, giving a really committed performance, and Tony Todd (Candyman) is also good as Ben. Although this is a 1990 version it is not very gory and had a lot of scenes cut by the censors, but it has a more visceral impact. The story concerns a group of folks stranded in a farmhouse while an army of zombies wander around outside. The tension in the farmhouse is given a boost by a stranger (a manical turn from Tom Towles) who wanders in with his wife and kid. And that becomes the focal point of the movie, and it simmers along until eventually something has to give, and the ending is satisfactory. Also, the music at the end is great. Overall, a excellent remake by Tom Savini on his directorial debut. Let's hope Tom directs more movies in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living Dead Rule!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake, to the classic " Night Of The Living Dead " is a superior film, and it's really a masterpiece. Zombie-lovers, like me, praise Tom Savini, for his excellent direction in this horror-fest. The characters are spectacularly acted, byTony (Candyman) Todd, Patricia Tallman and the others. Paul McCollough has given horror fans a GREAT SCORE! The overall mood of the flick, is wonderful. The movie runs at a superb pace. I place this 3rd, in a tie with " Day Of The Dead " as my favorite zombie film. I can't wait to see what Tom Savini will do with Vampirates. If that project is still alive. This movie starts off the same as the original classic masterpiece, and tricks the audience a little in the cemetary scene, with GREAT AWESOMENESS! From there Barbara (Patricia Tallman) finds, and enters the remote house, out in the country, like in the first flick, and then meets up with some zombies, before,Ben (Tony Todd) with a GREAT entrance into the film, meets upwith her. And then from there, they meet up with more zombies, and some people, who are hiding in the basement. And from there there's a lot of boarding up, a lot of zombie action, and a lot of shocks. This is really a spectacular horror flick, that I will always love!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great remake of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Savini has proven himself again with this remake of the original. It follows the plot closely with subtle differences, &amp; updated special effects. One would wonder how can anyone do this movie, the original was great, it was a breakthru in horror plots etc. Well, one way to say it is that imitation is the greatest form of flattery. But this movie stands on its own feet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human behavior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie way better than the original. I never could finish watching the original cause It pained me too much to watch. This one has better acting, and It has something else the other doesn't. Human behavior. I feel by watching the night of the living dead, that George romero created this story with that in mind. Basically this movie is about a bunch of strangers locked in a house all dealing with this dilemma in their on way. Why do the trapped people try to kill each other? Two word answer. Cabin fever. Every single character in the movie deals with the situation at hand differently. But they each handle It like anyone else would. How would you (the reader) react to being locked in a house with just a bunch of strangers in a house for god's knows how long? Keep in mind you've just saw your brother die, and were being chased by what looked like a zombie? I will admit that this movie is campy, but so was the original. But what I feel makes this movie good is the sense was human behavior which was something the original doesn't have. Next time you see this movie just hear what Barbara says in the end of the movie when she sees the rednecks shooting a zombies while he's being hung by a tree. "Their us, their us and We're them". We are all animals, some of us may not eat human flesh, but we still act like mindless, violent, zombie sometimes and I think that's what the message of the movie was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know the film is practically a shot by shot remake of the original, but director does a better job of executing the story than romero did in 1968. This remake is better than original mostly due to the performances, which are far better than that of the original cast. And one last thing, you got love the different ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a great remake of the original. I liked that it was in color, and also that the ending was more hopeful. The characters were a little less developed, though, and this time, Barbara (Patricia Tallman) was like a superwoman. I liked it better when she was somewhat enfeebled and scared since that scared me more than the Barbara in this version. All in all, this earned a 9 for a great rehash, but not being able to pull it all of the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror-Movie Remakes Don't Get Any Worse Than This!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ask me - I don't believe that George Romero could've taken more than, say, 2 minutes to write the screenplay for this atrociously awful, scene-for-scene, remake of his original, 1968 version of "The Living Dead".And, with that said, I think that little, giggling George so rightly deserves a good, swift kick in the ass for his unwelcome involvement in this utterly dead-end production.With this entire dumb-ass film being completely inferior and anti-climatic to the original (in every way imaginable), the one word that I think sums up 1990's "The Living Dead", in a nutshell, would be the word "embarrassment" - 'Cause, believe me, that's all that it was from start to finish. (And, nope, I'm sorry, but more graphic gore didn't make this film better) And, finally - While the original, 1968 "Living Dead" was made on a $114,000 budget, this remake cost $4.2 million in all. That rounds off to this remake costing about 37x more than what the original did and yet its total mediocrity (on all levels) rendered it as being nothing but a putrid heap of horror-movie excrement, in the long run.Tom Savini should be banned, outright, from ever directing movies, regardless of their genre. He clearly doesn't know what the hell he's doing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead (1990) *** (out of 4) Remake of George A. Romero's 1968 masterpiece about a group of people who board themselves up in a farming house when they come under attack from the living dead. This remake comes nowhere near the original picture but then again, how could it? That 1968 film is one of the greatest movies ever made so expecting this to come anywhere close to it would be a mistake. When viewed on its own terms there's no question that this is a good movie but I still blame Romero's (new) screenplay for many of the faults. I'm really not sure why the writer stuck so close to his original movie and why he chose not to mix things up a little bit more. If you've seen the original then you're going to know that there's really not too many changes here and what changes there are are pretty minor to say the least. There are a few small changes, which are more winks to fans of the original than anything else. The perfect example is early on in the cemetery where fans are expecting a certain zombie but it doesn't come just as you'd expect. With that said, for the most part I thought director Tom Savini did a nice job with the handling of the picture, although there's no doubt that he doesn't add too much style to it. The film manages to be entertaining thanks mostly to the cast who do a nice job with their roles and there's also some nice effects scattered throughout. Tony Todd and Tom Towles are certainly the best things about the picture even if their back-and-forth fighting gets a tad bit old here. Patricia Tallman is good in the role of Barbara and of course she's given an "updating" from the original. William Butler is also good as Tom. The special effects were trimmed by the MPAA but I still thought the look of the zombies was good and there are a couple good kills but considering who the director was, it's pretty noteworthy that the violence and gore is rather low-key. This version of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD certainly isn't a masterpiece and you could say it was a missed opportunity for something more but it's still an entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standing on it's own, honestly, it wasn't bad, but looking at it as a remake, yeah, it was silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had my doubts, Night of the Living Dead the original is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's perfect. It was made on one of the lowest budgets possible, but it worked on so many levels, politics, claustrophobia, fear, racism, everything blended so well and was so perfect for the time. But seeing how George still had his hand in the remake, I figured to give this movie a chance. After all, Dawn of the Dead the remake was a success and I really enjoyed it, well, like I said in the title, standing on it's own for a directorial debut, it wasn't bad at all, but from a remake standard, it was a little too much.Basically, Barbara and her brother Johnny are going to visit their mother's grave, but embark on some zombies, Johnny is killed in the process of trying to save Barbara, but she barley makes it to an abandoned house where later on Ben comes and they together try to survive the plague that is going on outside with these flesh eaters. Later on they are joined by people who have been hiding in the basement and together they must try to survive this horrific night.Over all, I would recommend it for fun, don't compare it to the original or I guarantee you'll probably not have a good time. This was a remake that wasn't needed, but it wasn't a BAD idea to introduce it to a newer generation. Tony Todd did a fantastic job and was such a great Ben, along with then new comer Bill Mosely who we now know from House of 1000 Courpses and Devil's Rejects as Odes. So, just give this movie a shot, it's one of those films you have to see for yourself.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make-up king Tom Savini and George A. Romero team up again for NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD remake.Not only making it scarier to the original but also better by all means. The plot is the same thing.Barbara(Patricia Tallman) and her brother Johnnie(Bill Moseley) go to the father's grave,then a pale person attacks them.When Barbara runs to a nearby house to get help,she finds more people just like the man at the cemetary.So now she and surviviors Ben(Tony Todd),Harry(Tom Towles),Helen(McKee Anderson),Tom(William Butler),and Judy(Katie Finneran),must stay alive from the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD! I'm one of the big fans of the original and this is far better.First off Tony Todd played a hell of a better Ben and Patricia Tallman was a joy as Barbara also.The twist in here was great to live up to the original.It wasen't as gory as I thought it was gone to be,but so was the original.Still one of the best remakes to date.</fullReview>
