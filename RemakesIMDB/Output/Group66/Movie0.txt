		<fullReview>For the first time Hitchcock was decisively beaten at his own game. This is one of the tensest films ever made, and also one of the most perfectly crafted. There are so many things right about it I can afford to concentrate on just two:(1) Sam Bowden is a firm believer in the sanctity of civil liberties until Cady starts to stalk his family - and he remains a believer even then. He is asked if he really wants the police to have the power to arrest citizens on suspicion alone; and, although his family is in danger, he cannot honestly answer yes. `Cape Fear' is clearly the product of a less bloodthirsty age. But it is the better for it: a clash between deeply held principles and deeply held desires isn't at all interesting unless it really IS a clash - unless the principles are strong enough not to give way at the first breath of wind. And damn it, Bowden is right. The police do NOT have the right to arrest Cady. The potential tragedy is genuine: not something that could be cleaned up if only so-and-so would drop a few pointless scruples.(2) Robert Mitchum really alarms us. I think it's because his motivations are a little, but not entirely, opaque. When we first see him eyeing Bowden's teen-aged daughter, we don't know exactly what he's thinking any more than Sam does. Is he sexually attracted to her? Does he want to kill her? Rape her? Is he indifferent but just trying to get a rise out of Sam? Indeed: what, exactly, does he want to do to Sam himself? We don't know: and this uncertainty is worse than any precise knowledge.I doubt I've said enough. `Cape Fear' is riveting from first frame to last. It's well shot, the acting is excellent, and Bernard Herrmann gives us his usual fitting score. It appeals to the intellect as much as to the pit of the stomach. Great stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick With This One: The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, this shows that you can still make a scary movie without a lot of blood, profanity and whatever. Hollywood didn't learn that, however, featuring all of it less than a decade after this was made. The Martin Scorcese re-make of this movie is exactly what I'm talking about.This original Cape Fear was legitimately scary, thanks to the performance of Robert Mitchum, who doesn't need to resort to the f-word to be a tough, sick and really an evil character as he stalks Gregory Peck and his wife (Polly Bergen) and daughter (Lori Martin). Bergan and Martin are two women I don't see too much in films which is too bad. They did a lot more TV work than movies. Another thing you don't see much anymore - a nice, sympathetic policeman - was also portrayed in here nicely by Martin Balsam.The ending has some holes in it, to be sure, but overall it offers a good 106- minute suspense story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese's version of "Cape Fear" had its moments, but overall was something of a chaotic picture. Its "satire" (or lack thereof) didn't really have a point, and its over-the-top visuals seemed to be compensating for a lack of content. It seemed less like Scorsese and more like DePalma.Thompson's original is better - more scary, more thrilling, more diabolical and realistic. Whereas De Niro's scenery-chewing performance in the remake was almost laughable, Robert Mitchum's spine-tingling turn here as Max Cady is one of the great human movie monsters - he's a demon at spirit, no in physicality.He seeks revenge on Gregory Peck and his family after Peck puts him away in jail for a few years.Scorsese's version was more updated and in that sense its general themes were more believable - Cady's psyche was more exposed, his violence exploitative - and the romance between Cady and Sam Bowden's daughter in the original is nonexistent. In fact, the extent of his harm towards her is when he chases her around an empty school.Still, this is a better version of the movie because it has more strengths than the remake. Visually it's not as impressive but it makes more of an impact as a thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing worse than a con who knows his way around the law,and exploits that knowledge to the hilt.Robert Mitchum does this very expertly in the original and best version of Cape Fear.You want to reach out and strangle him,but he is within the law,so you can't.This is the appeal of this film.It's the fuel that keeps it going from start to finish.Along with Mitchum,we have Gregory Peck as the tormented lawyer who sent Mitchum's character,Max Cady to jail for rape years earlier. Having studied law while behind bars,Cady's only intent with his gathering of this knowledge,is to torment Sam Bowden(Peck) and his family.It all leads to a classic finish.I truly believe that this film was a precursor to the thriller films of today.It was a sign of things to come in the cinematic world.It was way ahead of it's time.Worthy of note here is Robert Mitchum's ability to improvise almost to the point of becoming his character.The scene where he cracks the egg with his bare hand was not scripted,and the look of surprise on Polly Bergen's face was indeed real.Outstanding film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mitchum was powerful in Thompson's suspenseful thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mitchum was, if anything, even more powerful in "Cape Fear," possibly because his antagonist this time was the perfectly contrasting Gregory Peck? Mitchum played a sex criminal, freed after eight years in prison, who returned to a sleepy little town to terrorize the witness (Gregory Peck) whom he blamed for his conviction? The ex-con uttered no threats, used no violence, broke no laws ? and the police were therefore helpless? But his very presence, the tone of his voice, the look in his eyes as he turned them lazily on Peck's attractive wife and adolescent daughter showed with unmistakable and cumulative menace that he would surely take his revenge? Peck planted his wife and daughter on a safely moored houseboat to tempt Mitchum into a trap...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real good one for Thrillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) is a happily married lawyer with a teenage daughter, a quiet life and little worries to care for until released convict Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) moves near by seeking for revenge against him. Cady blames Bowden for his 8 years imprisonment because the lawyer failed to get him an innocent verdict in Court for a serious crime he was accused of (and he had committed). The man starts by stalking Bowden and his family while he waits for the appropriate moment to make his move. In the meantime, Cady does not hide his intentions and Bowden knows perfectly well they are in big trouble.The film is tense all along and interest doesn't fall at any moment. There is a correct direction by J. Lee Thompson, a slightly more than average director who probably did here one of his best jobs (the other one "The Guns of Navarone" (1962) a very entertaining World War II adventure). Black and white shooting was a good idea and helps to create some sort of sordid and dark atmosphere when required as well as the musical score.Casting is very good too. Gregory Peck is correct in one of his many common good guy roles. Polly Bergen is believable as the frightened wife and there is also good acting by Martin Balsam (as Bowden's chief of police friend) and Telly Savalas (as a private detective hired to help the family). But the major credit in this issue goes without doubt to Robert Michum's performance as the dangerous avenger. He looks calm and quiet -with few exceptions- all the way to the final climax sequences but you know perfectly the man is real mean and deadly. This surely was one of Mitchum's best appearances in his long film carrier.The 1991 Cape Fear version with Robert de Niro -although a watchable movie- is not as good and thrilling as this one where evil doesn't appear clearly till the end but menace is always there.A very good thriller indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good drama made great by an excellent Mitchum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Bowden is a lawyer who, eight years ago, acted as a witness against Max Cady to put him behind bars. Released from prison, Cady has studied the law and is set on terrorising the Bowdens without actually overstepping his legal rights. As Cady toes the line with increasingly worrying results, Browden begins to cross the line to deal with him and protect his family.Having seen the remake first I wanted to go back and see it done originally. My first impression was that the remake had done some elements better than this. For example Nolte's lawyer is a lot less clean-cut than Pecks'. Also the sexual threat to the daughter is a lot more played out in the remake. Getting past this I saw how this was actually a better film in many ways. As a drama it moves along at a good pace ? not jumping from one thrill to the next but not dragging either.The film can only hint at the deeds of Cady because of the censors but it is clear even to the blind that Cady is a monster. This ups the tension as everything is slowly build to and we don't get a bloody or sexually shocking scene as a pay-off, no, here the tension is build on top of other tension. The direction is good, giving a dark feel to the look of the film as well as hinting constantly. Even if some of the thrills are signposted it still works well.However, without Mitchum's performance this would be a very different film. With the help of De Niro's sneer or menacing tattoos, he is still a better Cady. He is on top form ? where De Niro wore his threat large, Mitchum hints at it under a veneer of casual disinterest, making the threat seem bigger when he acts. Peck is good even if his character is too clean-cut when he should have been pushed further over the line for my tastes. Bergen doesn't have much to do, but her final scene with Mitchum is powerful and she really lets rip. Martin is perfectly cast ? she looks like a child but also is `developed' enough to be a sexual role for Mitchum to prey on. It is easy to watch her as Mitchum closes in on her, almost licking his lips, but that's the power of the film.Overall this manages to be powerful and thrilling despite the censors and is a really good drama. However it is totally carried by a monstrous yet subtle performance by Mitchum. De Niro was good in the role but once you've seen this you'll realise that menace can be acted subtly and not just by sneering and getting tonnes of tattoos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One perverse individual can exploit his freedom by using it to encroach on someone else's. That is the problem with a society which cherishes personal liberty. The community has the dilemma of deciding whose freedom it ought to protect. At what point should the state intervene? Today, modern democracies have anti-harrassment laws which carry criminal penalties, and there is also the civil remedy of an injunction with power of arrest, but back in the early 1960's a man who chose to make a nuisance of himself enjoyed wide latitude. It was difficult for the law to step in without infringing his civil and constitutional rights. Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) is a small-town attorney in the south-eastern United States. He has a lovely family and a nice home, and is well thought of by neighbours and colleagues alike. This American idyll is destroyed when a newly-released convict shows up, intent on harrassing Bowden. Some years back, the lawyer had appeared as a witness at this man's trial, and the convict bears an irrational grudge. Max Cady is one of the cinema's great villains. Mitchum is irresistible as the heavy-eyed smart alec seething with sexual energy. Cady's sharp but warped intelligence is disturbing to behold (the way he obtains Bowden's vacation address is chillingly impressive). He begins to show up wherever Bowden goes, an ominous sarcastic presence to which no objection can be made, so long as he stays within the law. Cady's salient traits are placed before us right from the start of the film. He is completely callous (ignoring the girl who drops her books on the stairs) and a nasty sexual predator (picking up the waitress in the bowling alley). "Cape Fear" is a taut, absorbing thriller. Mitchum's charisma fills the screen, and the dark eerie look (by Director of Photography Sam Leavitt) compounds the feeling of menace. The incidental music is excellent. However, the film has some implausible ingredients. Why would a woman who has just been sexually degraded, and is clearly traumatised, be handed over by the police to the care of a private eye? (Charlie Sievers the gumshoe is played by Telly Savalas - with hair!) Would a criminal attorney really - no matter what the provocation - hire waterfront thugs to beat up a stalker? How come Sam's gun is still effective after being immersed in the river? Why doesn't Nancy's phone work? It is preposterous to suggest that Cady would waste time on the elaborate feint towards Peggy instead of pursuing his real victim. And how can it be that Cady can defeat three ruffians single-handed, overwhelm a police bodyguard with ease, yet fail to defeat Sam, even when armed with a stick?Verdict - Allowing for the improbabilities, this is a well-made thriller with a magnificent performance by Mitchum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Nasty A Creature As Had Ever Been Shown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So acclaimed was Robert Mitchum's performance as the amoral, animalistic Max Cady it probably escapes most people's attention that Cape Fear was produced by co-star Gregory Peck.One film before was the one that united star Gregory Peck with director J. Lee Thompson. That would be The Guns of Navarone which was both a critical and box office success. Thompson and Peck enjoyed working with each other and decided the next film would be light years from The Guns of Navarone.Both Peck and Thompson agreed that this story about a homicidal ex-convict terrorizing a man who was a witness against him and his family needed a star of equal stature for the part of the convict as well as the good citizen who Peck was playing. Mitchum was contacted and agreed.I've always felt that it always showed what a class act Gregory Peck was in that even though it was his film and Mitchum got the acclaim for the film, Peck never betrayed one hint of jealousy about the plaudits Mitchum got. Max Cady was about as nasty a creature as had ever been shown on screen up to that time. The Production Code was breaking down and Thompson and Peck took great advantage of that. Today it would be nothing, but when Cady smeared that egg matter over Polly Bergen's chest it was considered risqué at the time. Polly Bergen was Gregory Peck's wife and Lori Martin his daughter in the film. Other performances of note are of Telly Savalas as a private detective, Martin Balsam as the town police chief, and Jack Kruschen as Cady's lawyer, one bottom feeding shyster. In the remake of Cape Fear which had Nick Nolte as Sam Bowen, Peck's part, and Robert DeNiro as Cady, Both Mitchum and Peck agreed to play some of the minor parts. This time Mitchum was in Balsam's old part as the police chief and Gregory Peck whose most famous role was as Atticus Finch, played the bottom feeder. After that remake you could definitely say Peck played the legal profession at both ends.The story of Cape Fear is about an upright moral man, not unlike Atticus Finch who has to get down and dirty in order to deal with a totally amoral man who lives by no rules. Kind of like what the western world has to do in dealing with terrorists of all shapes and sizes. Their confrontation on the Cape Fear River where Peck has to catch Mitchum red handed in order to bring him to justice or kill him is one for cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Original - If It Ain't Broken, Don't Fix It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw J. Lee Thompson's film I was on the edge of my seat. It is a scary thriller without showing buckets of blood, graphic violence, monster make-up, or even using the word "rape".A bitter, amoral, psychopathic ex-con, Max Cady (the incomparable Robert Mitchum), recently released from an eight-year prison term, is out for revenge against the man who testified against him at his trial, lawyer Sam Bowden (the late, great, Gregory Peck). He infiltrates into Sam's life, stalking his lovely wife, Peggy (Polly Bergen, no shrinking violet), and his pretty, innocent teenage daughter, Nancy (the appropriately sweet Lori Martin). Sam does everything legally possible (for the time, before anti-stalking laws came into place) to protect his family, but he finds he is powerless under the law, and Cady is very intelligent in his planning. It all ends in a showdown on the river Cape Fear.Let me just say that this movie has an advantage over the 1991 remake. Cady doesn't have to be covered in tattoos or act like Freddy Krueger to be terrifying. The word "rape" doesn't have to be mentioned nor does the offense have to be shown to us graphically (since the censors of the time forbade it) for the viewer to understand and comprehend what is going on. The performances are all right on, and even when Barrie Chase's Diane Taylor is assaulted, we don't have to be told that she was raped, because it's implied and it's written all over her bruised, traumatized face. Her portrayal of this victimized and frightened young woman is impeccable - why didn't she have a longer career?Gregory Peck is compelling, and the scenes where Nancy is pursued by Cady outside her school and she escapes inside, only to fear that he has also followed her in (and she is mistaken) is absolutely nail-biting, as is the final showdown. Cady's devious plan to accost Peggy on the boat in order to "trade" her for Nancy is gut-wrenching and extremely watchable. We now have a names for guys like that - rapist, stalker, pedophile, murderer - but the first three were either not used or hadn't been made a term yet. A classic, don't accept any substitutions. As I usually give so much away in my comments, I'll leave the plot details at that. Bernard Hermann's score for the film is perfect, and ranks right along with his score for Alfred Hitchcock's "PSYCHO" - a masterpiece. And so is the movie. Don't watch it alone or in a dark room! 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Mitchum was born for this role. He played the evil Max Cady as though Cady's spirit was actually inside him. Cady was a psychopathic murderer who became obsessed with a couple and their daughter. To counteract this persistent attention, the couple hired a security agent. When this went terribly wrong, the family made a run for their houseboat. Unfortunately, Cady was wise to them leading to a nail biting finale. 5 stars go to this great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Cady (Mitchum) slips into the water, it's like an alligator sneaking up on its prey. Except this is a houseboat with two vulnerable women in his sights. With those sleepy eyes, it's hard to know just what sadistic acts he's got in mind, but we know it's too grisly for the screen. Remember what he did to poor Diane (Chase), and he wasn't even mad at her. Cape Fear should have been named Cape Fear, Shudder and Sweat.This is about the last word in stalker movies. More importantly, it shows how using less often produces more. Mitchum underplays the stalker role, but he also knows how to imply unspeakable evil, which is really more effective than blood splatter. It's what's in your imagination that's really scary. Ditto Peck, (Sam) whose on-screen reserve speaks volumes in grim determination-- he's got to protect his family. Only Bergen as the terrified wife gets to really cut loose. What a first-rate cast, plus expert pacing from director Thompson.I guess the movie's moral is that if the law can't protect you, you've got to do it yourself. At that primitive level, there's no holds barred. So the tension really mounts as we discover Cady's animal cunning is too much for the law or even for hired thugs. In the end, then, it's going to have to be Cady vs. Sam, mano y mano. It's sort of like a modern morality tale of the nuclear family vs. a swamp beast. No doubt about it, the movie's a real nail-biter the whole way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night Of The Hunter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former convict Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) seeks revenge against Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck), the man whose testimony sent Cady to prison for eight years. But that revenge is not initially physical. Instead, it takes the form of intimidation and psychological terror against Bowden's wife (Polly Bergen) and young daughter, Nancy.Cady is a low-life who hangs out in seedy bars and treats women badly. He smokes cigars and wears a Panama hat. In contrast, lawyer Bowden and his goody-goody family live in a big house with a manicured lawn.What's interesting here is that, as criminals go, Cady is quite smart. His intimidation tactics stay well beyond the law's reach. For example, at a boat launch, Cady stares lasciviously at Nancy. Bowden notices, and in disgust tries to engage Cady in a fight. But Cady refuses, noting nearby witnesses who could be called to testify against Bowden, the aggressor. And so it goes, throughout much of the story; wherever Bowden goes, Cady is somewhere nearby. He hovers, like a hawk over its prey, waiting for just the right moment. Cady's terror is what he might do.The last part of the film takes place on or near a houseboat on the Cape Frear River in North Carolina, where Bowden's wife and daughter are holed up. Here, at night, in the midst of wilderness, Cady pursues his prey. He's a night stalker, or hunter, silent like a snake, sly, ever watchful, cold-blooded and reptilian. Amid the stillness and dark shadows, Cady creeps closer and closer.Bernard Herrmann's eerie background music reminds me of the music in "Psycho". Filmed in B&amp;W, both films use high contrast lighting. The music/lighting combo exudes a high level of tension and suspense.Even though Gregory Peck is the film's protagonist, "Cape Fear" really belongs to Mitchum, who gives a very good performance as the villain. Peck's performance is adequate; Polly Bergen tries a tad too hard and comes off as melodramatic, especially toward the end. The always reliable Martin Balsam shows up in this film, as he did in "Psycho", with a very credible performance as a good guy cop.With great B&amp;W cinematography, appropriately frenetic "Psycho"-like music, effective plot structure, and a fine performance by Robert Mitchum, "Cape Fear" is a highly suspenseful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Mitchum at his creepy best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently picked up a VHS copy of Cape Fear from a market and watched and found it an excellent movie. This is long deleted on video in Britain, so I was lucky to see it.A lawyer and his family are terrorised by a killer he helped to put in prison. Released after eight years, he wants his revenge. He starts by poisoning the family dog and he kills a woman before picking on the lawyer's daughter. The family flee to their houseboat and the killer is finally arrested after he is set up and faces many more years in prison.This is Robert Mitchum at his creepy best, in a role very similar to the one he played in Night Of the Hunter.The lawyer is played by Gregory Peck and the movie also stars Polly Bergen, Martin Balsam and an early role for Telly Savalas (Kojak).The excellent score is by the great Bernard Herrmann (The Day the Earth Stood Still, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, Psycho).This movie was rather creepy in parts and is a must for any movie fan.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Cape Fear has always been one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Mitchum's sociopathic creepiness is a real powerhouse performance. I was amazed to read under the trivia section here on IMDb that it was a financial failure at the time it was released and caused Gregory Peck's production company to fold. Without any of the tricks used in today's horror films this movie truly frightens. Every time I see it I have a moment where I feel so horribly for anyone who has had to deal with a criminal who they testified against being released from prison. To this day I cannot see Mitchum in any other role without thinking of Max Cady. At one point he silently slips into water and immediately you think of a slithering snake and every fear that comes with imagines associated with snakes floods your mind. His entire character is laid out like an open book in a brilliantly designed opening shot by an extremely simple but utterly effective movement by Mitchum. He is walking up a set of stairs and passes a woman with an armload of books and ever so slightly brushes against her as he passes causing her to spill some books to the floor. Without a glance or a blink or a flinch of any kind he continues up the stairs without breaking a stride. Made even more creepy considering the time the film was made when men would always have stopped to help a lady pick them up. That simple scene brings a sense of foreboding for what is to come. This is a movie I would not watch for the first time alone at night if you are a woman. Absolutely in my top 20 films list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shockingly tough and dark suspense drama has recently paroled convict Robert Mitchum making life hell for Gregory Peck, the lawyer who put him behind bars. First-half of film is quite solid, with Mitchum full of scary bravado, but Peck is so rigid one doesn't wait for him to loosen up so much as simply become human. Final act makes a mess of the storytelling however, with Mitchum pulling a fast one and ending up alone with Peck's wife (a convincingly rattled Polly Bergen) and then just as quickly with Peck's daughter (Lori Martin, sporting an oddly mature flip hairstyle that looks like a wig). The kid has already shown us earlier to be a wise, fast-on-her-feet child who knows danger when she sees it--so why does she go all limp when Mitchum approaches her? It's one of the few clichés (in this case, the ninnyisms of females) which doesn't exactly derail "Cape Fear", but makes it simply a minor noir--not a timeless thriller. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Max Cady isn't a man who makes idle threats.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Max Cady is fresh out of prison and down in Florida looking for someone in particular. That person is lawyer Sam Bowden, the man who Cady holds responsible for his years of incarceration. Once Bowden realises that Cady is out for revenge, and that his family are in serious danger, he turns to the police for help, but unable to get help from them, he goes outside of the law, and all parties are heading for the foreboding place known as Cape Fear. Brilliant villainy, unnerving story and suspense pouring from every frame, Cape Fear is an abject lesson in how to produce a quality thriller. Based on a novel called The Executioners written by John D. MacDonald, the piece is bolstered by some perfect casting decisions and by having a director able to pace with precision, thus it stands tall and proud as a highlight in a tough old genre. Robert Mitchum is Cady, a big hulking man with an immoral face, he terrifies purely by his undaunted objectives, with Mitchum clearly revelling in such a role. As Bowden we have Gregory Peck, playing it right as the uptight and stiff lawyer forced to find toughness from within. Backed up by excellent cameos from Martin Balsam, Telly Savalas and Polly Bergen, Cape Fear also features one of Bernard Herrmann's finest scores, a complete and utter nerve shredder that hangs in the ears long after the film has finished. What lifts this above many of its thriller peers is that its dialogue is firmly accentuated by the character portrayals, watch as Cady calmly digresses about how he learnt the law in prison, or how he seeps with deviant sexual aggression when confronting the Bowden women, it's badness personified and literally a force of evil, so much so that the breaking of an egg is metaphorically a portent of pain unbound. Director J. Lee Thompson's career shows him to have been a steady if unspectacular director at times, but he directs this with no amount of zip and he deftly reins it in for a stifling last quarter at the Cape Fear bayou. Along with his cinematographer, Sam Leavitt, Thompson expertly uses shadow and light to consistently keep the feeling of dread looming as much of a hostile presence as Bobby Mitchum is throughout the play. By the time the finale reveals its denouement, it's hoped that you are as living on your nerves as this particular viewer always is when viewing this clinically sharp piece of thriller cinema. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic thriller that set the standards for later movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people know the 1991 remake but very few have actually seen the original. A shame because it is worth seeing- and to be known by more.In a way "Cape Fear" seemed ahead of its time which it was not. It merely was a trend setter for later movies. The movie feels like it was made the same way as thrillers are made these days.The movie doesn't rely on scary gory scene's and violence but more on the psychological thriller elements, it is thanks to Robert Mitchum that this works very well in the movie. He manages to put-, with his character, a certain tension in the movie.The ending is a bit of a disappointing and not really tense or exciting. Another complaint is the way the dialog is delivered, it is done way too fast almost as if the actors were in an hurry, there are hardly any pauses between the sentences.The famous musical score is from Bernard Hermann whose score was later reused for the 1991 remake, 16 years after his death. But the music wasn't the only thing that was reused, also the actors Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam reappeared in the remake. And then the question which movie is the better one? In my humble opinion the remake is even better and more exciting.But judge for yourself which movie is the better one, both are recommendable.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a classic of thrilling noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In quite possibly his best and most memorable role, Robert Mitchum is Max Cady, a smooth-talking, malicious pedophile recently released from prison after an 8 year stint in the pen. He targets Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck), a man who helped put him in jail, his wife Peggy, aid in particular, his daughter, Nancy. This original version is MUCH more thrilling, suspenseful and such a sheer joy to watch when compared to Martin Scorsese's misfire of a remake with lacked the original's spirit, substituting a glossy veneer and gore for this film's high tension and amazing performances. Director J. Lee Thomson coming off of the brilliant "Guns of Naverone", made another classic, albeit of a much smaller, budgetary if not emotionally, scale with this film.My Grade: A- DVD Extras: 28 Minute Making of; Production photos; production notes; cast and crew Bios; Theatrical Trailer; and a trailer for "Boogeymen: the killer compilation"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was ahead of its time in many ways. It's based on the John MacDonald's novel and directed by Lee J Thompson, with a terrific musical score by the amazing Bernard Hermann. The copy recently presented by TCM is perfect in that it is very detailed as it has been preserved with extreme care.This film belongs to Robert Mitchum. His Max Cady is a complex study of evil at its worst. This is a man who wants revenge for what he perceives society owes him, or what Sam Bowden, in particular has done to him; he will stop at nothing. There are hints of pedophilia in the way Max Cady leers at the teen age daughter of his enemy; it's done with a lot of class and it's never in your face.Robert Mitchum was an actor of such intelligence that is such a pleasure watch him portray this criminal, intent in doing harm to the man who sent him to jail, as well as to his family. Mr. Mitchum works with an economy of gestures, but one look at him and the viewer knows what makes this Max Cady ticks.Gregory Peck, on the other hand plays the good guy, but he is boring. Mr. Peck, supposedly, championed Mr. Mitchell for the role of Cady, knowing that he would be perfect for the part. It is after all Mr. Mitchell's picture from beginning to end.The supporting cast was excellent. Polly Bergen, Lori Martin, Martin Balsam, Telly Savallas, all in minor roles, but they add tremendously to the action.In retrospect, a lot of comments tend to compare the latter version of the film directed by Scorsese. Many think it's much better. Those people that make that claim are entitled to their opinion, but the original is more satisfying as far as we are concerned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great thriller!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, a convicted rapist (Robert Mitchum) goes after the lawyer who testified against him (Gregory Peck) and his family.This is pure horror at its finest. All of the performers here are what really make this one work, which is usually the key to making a movie work. So let's start off with that.Martin Balsam is great as the Captain of the Police, Mark Dutton, who tries to help Peck's character. Lori Martin is wonderful as Nancy Bowden, the real victim in this movie. She plays the little girl part well, without it being over-the-top and annoying. Polly Bergen is wonderful as Peggy Bowden, Peck's wife in the film who tries to convince him to not resort to murder.But, of course, no one shines more here than our two leading men, Mitchum and Peck. As he has proved in "The Night of the Hunter," he truly plays the bad guy well, and he is completely convincing. As for Peck, The same year this was released, another very important film in Peck's career came out, and it is perhaps his most famous role: I'm talking about "To Kill a Mockingbird." Once again, he plays a lawyer here, and he really knows how to play the good guy, because, in the end, you want him to win.The story itself is quite scary, but the scariest scene in the movie is when Cady moves in on Nancy towards the end. By this point, we've seen what Cady can do, and because of this, we are scared for Nancy. After all, she's just a little girl. Mitchum, himself, looked very intimidating; I can see why Peck wanted him to play the part.Now, usually, I mention how some movies got a treatment that I despise: the remake. This film got that treatment as well, and usually I avoid the remake. But, I've heard quite a few good things about the remake. First off, it's got Martin Scorsese as the director, which is almost always a good thing. Secondly, you've got Robert De Niro as the bad guy, who has acted in many of Scorsese's films ("Mean Streets," "Taxi Driver," "New York New York" "Raging Bull," "The King of Comedy" and "Goodfellas" before this role). Third, if the stars of the original appear in the remake, you know it's a decent remake. So, I say, if you feel like it, go check it out. I might.All in all, a really good movie. I only wish that I could give it a 10/10, but I can't because the ending was a bit abrupt. So, a 9/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty strong stuff for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interestingly, considering how tame it appears in direct comparison to Martin Scorsese's remake, this film was considered a particularly amoral and brutal affair back in 1962. It may be difficult for audiences now to understand this but if you watch the original Cape Fear and keep in mind its historical context it isn't really that surprising that it met with a howl of outrage. The central problem was the continual threat of sexual violence posed by the character Max Cady. This sadistic psycho constantly goads his nemesis Sam Bowden with the implied but very clear threat of rape directed at Bowden's wife and daughter. The latter is 12 years old. So it isn't too difficult to see how this caused a lot of consternation back on original release. The emphasis on this uncomfortable theme made the original Cape Fear a somewhat transgressive film. And when a film is transgressive in its depiction of social reality, history has shown that it usually finds itself in a bit of bother.Unlike in Scorsese's remake, the Bowden family here are the epitome of normality. They are thoroughly idealised, with patriarch Sam Bowden given an unambiguous upstanding morality by Gregory Peck. This means that there are clear black and white moral certainties here, where the remake operated in shades of grey where the psychopath was something of a catalyst for the problems inherent in the troubled family unit. I guess the two movies show not only the shift in screen violence in the intervening years but also the more complex and ambiguous way that families were depicted too.The original is certainly a very good thriller. Robert Mitchum is really the key screen presence here. He effectively plays a very transgressive character; essentially a rapist and paedophile. His Max Cady certainly carries a genuine threat, its a very good performance. Also of note is the excellent score by the extremely dependable Bernard Herrmann. It was more or less covered for the remake, so that tells you all you need to know about its timelessness. Herrmann proved himself with this, and the Psycho and Taxi Driver soundtracks, that he was a master at menacing film music. Finally, director J. Lee Thompson needs to be given a fair bit of credit too for putting together such a direct and gutsy thriller in the first place. I think both versions of Cape Fear work very well together, as they really come at the audience from quite different angles while essentially being the same basic narrative. As much as I respect Scorsese, I sometimes think that this older flick is the more consistently enjoyable film though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mitchum Magnificent As Menacing Max</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J Lee Thompson's "Cape Fear" is an account of a straightforward battle between good and evil. Good is represented by Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) who is both a respectable lawyer and a decent family man. Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) on the other hand, is an evil, psychopathic rapist who, having spent eight years in prison comes to Bowden's neighbourhood to terrorise him and his family because Bowden had previously given testimony in the court case which led to Cady's incarceration.Initially, it appears that Bowden is in a very strong position to counter the threat from Cady because he has a long established friendship with the local police chief, Mark Dutton (Martin Balsum). Dutton is sympathetic to Bowden's plight and comes up with some useful ideas for getting rid of Cady. These ideas are unsuccessful, however, because what Bowden and Dutton don't realise, is just how methodically Cady has been planning his revenge and how well he is able to anticipate what actions the police are likely to take. Being the honest, law abiding man that he is, Bowden makes every attempt to deal with Cady's threats by legal means but when none of them work, in desperation, he eventually takes a more unorthodox course of action which leads to him being threatened with being disbarred. Events come to a head and are ultimately resolved only after a long and hard physical battle between the two men.An excellent script by James R Webb and some intelligent direction from J Lee Thompson combine to provide increasing pace and suspense as Cady moves from implied levels of intimidation, through psychological pressure all the way up to very serious physical threats. The tension and drama are also brilliantly enhanced by Bernard Herrmann's excellent score. Peck and Balsum are thoroughly convincing in their roles but are inevitably outshone by a truly exceptional performance by Robert Mitchum. His portrayal of a character who is a thoroughly debased, violent monster, is genuinely scary and a remarkable achievement considering the strict standards of censorship which prevailed at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now THIS is a thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I am, and have always been, a fan of the villains. When I first started learning how to use Macromedia Dreamweaver, my test site was a shrine to the various villains in the various stories I've written throughout my life. The villain remains to this day the best way to advance the dramatic tension of the plot, and I hold a deep respect for them because of it.That being said, this is possibly the first movie that has made me root for the hero to win, while still having a truly good (so to speak) villain. Gregory Peck's caring and responsible family man plays perfectly against Robert Mitchum's sleazy, cigar-smoking, prostitute-beating rapist. (It would've been nice if Mitchum could've done something like this seven years earlier in Night of the Hunter, but I'll gripe about that in its own review.) Peck plays one of those heroes that even a villain nut like me can't help but root for, and Mitchum couldn't have been a more despicably good villain if he tried.Nearly everything else about this film is perfectly executed. The suspense, the relations between the characters, the script, the believability of the situations and actions, and of course, the acting...with one rather glaring exception. Where did Lori Martin learn to act? Talk about annoying! No, she wasn't bad enough that I didn't care about what would happen to her character, but it would've been nice if she had taken a few acting classes before showing up on set. I probably could've given a more believable performance as Gregory Peck's daughter when I was that age. And when I was that age, Gregory Peck was eighty-six.But in the end, the movie came through. If you ask me, this, not Night of the Hunter, is the film Robert Mitchum should be remembered for. (And before anyone (because I know there are some of you out there) starts berating me about only saying that because I was disappointed by Night of the Hunter, I actually saw this movie first.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every crime/thriller fan should see this film at least once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Lee Thompson's dark, disturbing pulp crime classic caused a stir in 1962 when it was released in cinemas. Not so due to people getting killed (actually only one character is seen killed on screen) - murder was, and still is, a common theme in film since the silent days. But rather to the film's explicit (for that time) approach to issues such as rape, stalking and child abductions.Samuel Bowdon is a middle aged, well-to-do lawyer who has a loving family, consisting of wife Peggy (Polly Bergan, who is stunning on the eyes) and teenage daughter Nancy (Lori Martin). His normal, quietly blissful life is disturbed by the presence of a man he helped send to prison for an aggressive rape act. Enter Max Cady (a very mean looking Robert Mitchum), with intense eyes and a uncontrollable gravitation to women. He had just served his term, but is still angry that he had lost eight years to prison. At first, Bowdon doesn't think Cady would do anything to his family ("He's just been released from prison, he doesn't want to go back!"). However, things turn for the worst when it becomes clear Cady IS stalking his family but the law is powerless to stop him and he hasn't DONE anything to the family.Cady pushes Bowdon's buttons by killing his dog, threatening his daughter Nancy with sexual abuse and beating up a teenage drifter to provide a "sample" of his plans for Nancy. The family then move to the isolated, moth-ridden Cape Fear swamp hoping to get away from Cady but Cady catches on and traps them there and aims to pounce on his prey...A fairly straightforward thriller, it does have its' drawbacks. Aside Mitchum's great performance, the other characters are very wooden. Bowdon's wife and daughter have very little to do in this film and just seem to be used here as bait to keep the film going. Polly Bergan almost ruined a perfectly tense scene when she is attacked by Mitchum on a houseboat. Her panting was so annoying to listen to, I had the mute button in handy. And what's with the 'perfect good family' thing? Did the writer think, "Oh, hey, the baddie's gonna steal the show. We need to make the point that he really is bad so we'll make the family all good and perfect. The audience will really connect with them because they're good! Great idea!" ... and behold the most ridiciously, unrealistic 'perfect' family in movie history.However, the film is backed up by a wonderful score, terrific cinematography and a tense build up to the climax at the end (though that's not saying very much...). Everyone should see this film at least once. Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After all these years, still frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Lee Thompson's black-and-white revenge thriller is still effective after its debut 45 years ago, perhaps even more so today with a growing awareness of sexual predators and child abductions. 'Cape Fear' was a very risqué film for its time, receiving numerous edits from the American and British censorship boards and nearly being slapped with an 'X' rating in the United Kingdom. But when all was said and done, the material for a good film was there, coming down to us with nail-biting suspense for which 'Cape Fear' is known.The adaptation by James Webb of John MacDonald's novel 'The Executioners' was a perfect vehicle for all involved. J. Lee Thompson, recently off an Oscar nomination for 'The Guns of Navarone,' was still very much within his element after a series of British realist dramas that included 'North West Frontier' and 'Tiger Bay.' Robert Mitchum, one of the more underrated strongmen in film history, was physically and temperamentally ideal as Max Cady and Gregory Peck eased into the Sam Bowden mix of family man and protector. Peck actually teamed with Universal Pictures to make 'Cape Fear'; the entire cast and crew was hand-picked, resulting in this vintage gem.'Cape Fear' boasts a plot that was extraordinary for its time and has been copied repeatedly. The story follows a Savannah layer named Sam Bowden (Peck) who is visited by Max Cady (Mitchum), an imposing man whom Bowden testified against in a Baltimore trial. Cady was sent to jail for raping a woman and, eight years removed from entering prison, he vows to make Bowden pay for his civic duty. He turns the Bowden family's life into Hell on Earth, following Sam, his wife Peg (Polly Bergen), and adolescent daughter Nancy (Lori Martin) around town. Along the way, he fatally poisons their dog and rapes a newcomer to Savannah, Diane Taylor (Barrie Chase).Sam Bowden, a man of law and order, uses every legal tactic within his reach to drive Cady out of town. With help from police chief Mark Dutton (Martin Balsam) and a private detective named Charlie Seavers (Telly Savalas), he tries to drum up pretentious charges. Cady, however, has learned a great deal about the justice system while in prison, rambling off statute effortlessly. Bowden grows desperate, soon offering Cady hard dollars in exchange for leaving his family alone, hiring a band of enforcers to rough him up, and even considering murder. To make matters worse, Sam discovers that Cady is the lowest of all sexual predators, targeting his young daughter.Shocking in 1962, 'Cape Fear' is no less effective today, in an age of Megan's Law and Amber Alerts. The social landscape has changed since this film was made - laws have been passed in an effort to restrict the movement of sex offenders - but the Bowdens, an ordinary family in an extraordinary situation a la Hitchcock, are still easy to associate with. The danger that Cady brings is excruciating and he also reveals the failures of law enforcement with his own disgusting brand of irony.As J. Lee Thompson has said, Max Cady is the focal character, a sarcastic man with visibly bad intentions. Robert Mitchum, who is listed as 6' 1" in height, is such a dominant force both physically and emotionally, that he seems closer to 6' 5" or 6' 6". Because of this, Sam Bowden comes across as quite ordinary, although Gregory Peck's character takes on a bold dimension in the final half-hour. The film could not have managed without an excellent supporting cast and everyone delivers. Martin Balsam is quietly superb as usual, Telly Savalas does well as a slick private eye, and the portrayals of Bowden's family by Polly Bergan and Lori Martin fit like neat pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Jack Kruschen (as Dave Grafton, Cady's lawyer) and Barrie Chase are not asked for very much, but help in spurring the plot.Cinematographer Samuel Leavitt ('Anatomy of a Murder,' 'Exodus') uses black and white filming techniques that give 'Cape Fear' a sinister edge not attainable in color. Part of what makes 'Cape' such an effective story is its use of shadow and the 'bare bones' feeling that is common in film noir. In the early 21st century, this film takes on an added gloominess, seeming to come from an innocent, bygone world and yet shattering our illusions. George Tomasini, an editor for several of Hitchcock's films including 'North by Northwest' and 'Psycho,' is a major complement to Thompson's well-paced direction. 'Cape Fear' is also not complete without the score of Bernard Herrmann, another Hitchcock regular. Writing on the orchestral scale of 50 years ago, Herrmann's music is notable for its use of ponderous strings and explosive brass. The score, in fact, was used almost verbatim in Martin Scorcese's 1991 remake.Largely a potboiler, 'Cape Fear' has its flaws. There are plot holes, such as the willingness of Dutton to bend laws for Bowden's sake, and implausibility, such as how easily Cady pushes around the band of enforcers hired by Sam. The final scene taking place between a swamp house and houseboat is confusing at first and Sam swims downstream rather quickly to catch up with the villain. The circa-1960 attitudes towards violence against women are also painfully outdated. But none of this takes away from the core storyline, a twisted one for all times.Universal has given 'Cape Fear' elite treatment on its DVD, offering anamorphic widescreen presentation with English captioning for the hearing impaired and subtitles in Spanish and French. The disc is chock full of bonus material that includes interviews with Peck and Thompson, photographs, posters, and the theatrical trailer. Peck and Thompson offer some fascinating insights, including censorship of the film and the original plan to cast Hayley Mills as Nancy. Bernard Herrmann's music is used throughout. The film itself is presented with clean visuals and Dolby-enhanced sound. *** out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gregory Peck's stalking moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum are the top-liners in this film that is one of the best thrillers of all time. The plot is simply a revenge quest by Mitchum for what he feels was an unjust imprisonment sentence in a case prosecuted by Peck years earlier. Mitchum is the central figure in the film as he stalks Peck and his family but stays within the confines of the law while making life miserable for the attorney. Mitchum's real target is Lori Martin, Peck's nubile daughter and he has no scruples against harming the youngster as he did another young woman earlier in the picture. Polly Bergen is also good as Peck's wife who attracts Mitchum's notice. The sides of good and evil are well drawn in the picture which has an exciting finish before justice prevails. Bernard Herrmann's music is one of his least-known but best film scores.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cape Fear" is a solid, suspenseful thriller with a taut script and a terrific performance by Robert Mitchum, as a smart, leering sadist (with obvious pedophiliac tendencies). I had watched the remake (twice) before finally seeing this, and it's hard to compare them objectively, because the rules of the censors were much more strict in 1962 (as the director himself points out in an interview). It IS a violent and suggestive film, though; they probably went about as far as they could at the time. What gives the remake an extra "edge" is that the lawyer is actually guilty of not providing a proper defense for the criminal he was assigned to, while here he is simply a witness to one of his crimes. But this is still a good film, and Herrmann's score is equal to the one he wrote for "Psycho". (***)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DeNiro (one of the best ever) and Scorcese (ditto) not-with-standing, Robert Mitchum in the original is right up there with Angela Landsbury (Manchurian Candidate) as one of the great human monsters ever portrayed. If you had never heard of the Mitchum you might think the studio had talked an asylum into releasing a psychotic inmate to play this role. The fear (in us, the audience) is greater than the re-make because we're allowed to use our imagination more. We can only guess what Mitchum (Cady) has done to his girlfriend besides beat her up. As she leaves town there is not a look of terror on her face, but rather one of deep abnormal sickness and disgust with life. We know she will never be a complete, viable human again. Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum...you can get 'different' but you can't get 'better'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the 1962 last night and was slightly disappointed, since I had seen this film before and enjoyed it a lot, but now seems a tad dated. Mitchum gives an outstanding performance, but the same can not be said of Peck who, as someone commented, seemed not to be into the story, giving a very bland performance (curious since this was a particularly good period in his career with his Oscar-winning performance in To Kill a Mockingbid, and his role in Guns of Navarone with the same director of this film). I also agree the daughter was miscast. You can't help comparing this film with Scorsese's, which has much more depth in character development, with bravura direction, photography and editing, and overall more accomplished in all production aspects (except music, of course) and De Niro's performance in that film, while it may be considered over-the-top, was to me bone-chilling. Notwithstanding, I prefer the ending in the 1962 version, compared to the ludicrous way Scorsese ended his film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ticking Bomb Named Max Cady ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cape Fear" would so easily get labeled as film-noir just because it's in black-and-white and features a dark atmosphere with a menacing figure, this is not completely untrue, but if anything, J. Lee Thompson's film (to name the director) is nothing more of a suspenseful thriller, and one hell of a good one. And there's no doubt that the pillar of the film is Robert Mitchum's performance as Max Cady, one of the most unforgettable movie villains (the score comes in second in what makes the film so great).First, since I'm pretty sure most people have watched the Scorsese's version before this one (in a perfect world, my assumption would be wrong, and I promise this is my last parenthesis), I only hope they wouldn't be disappointed by the performance of all the good-hearted members of the Bowden family, all far from being as memorable as the 'Nick Nolte - Jessica Lange - Juliette Lewis' trio ? or am I unfair by ignoring the possibility that any actor could have been overshadowed by a Mitchum at the top of his game. Maybe ? but we're talking of Gregory Peck here, on the very year he won his Oscar for "To Kill a Mockingbird". As much as I appreciate the actor, he's always been a hit-or-miss for me, and I can't ignore how laughable was his performance at some parts of the film, like when he pointed his finger at Cady, if THAT was a threat, well it confirmed my feeling that Peck's interpretation of heroism and straightness most often flirted with caricature.I also have a problem with the casting of the daughter who looked physically very young despite the fact that she was a teenager. Well, I was disturbed because she obviously looked like a young girl, and whatever level of fear and despise Max Cady would inspire, it's certainly not because he's got pedophile instincts: it doesn't fit the character who's got a more voracious appetite for a female body in its rawest and most voluptuous form. I feel guiltier for that comment because Lori Martin's performance was genuinely good, but I felt more comfortable with the gripping interaction between Cady and Polly Bergen as Mrs. Bowden that pushed the level of evil sensuality to an extraordinary paroxysm. There's one brief moment where you can even catch Mitchum smirking at the camera as if he was particularly aware of his virile magnetism.And magnetism is an understatement. While Robert De Niro played a psychopathic character, the namesake Mitchum played it all cool, understanding that the fear was best provoked from the actions suggested than committed. Indeed, we're more scared of what he might do than what he actually does. Mitchum creates a character both appalling and appealing, appalling because we can't be anything but shocked by the harassment displayed against this good American family, but appealing because they're still reduced to a bunch of one-dimensional victims. I used to think that Scorsese inserted some subplots involving the Bowdens to depict them as flawed characters, and enrich the content of their family story, in order to elevate the conflict with Cady to a sort of redemption for Sam. I thought Marty exploited his favorite theme again while it was a good way to inject some substance to rather dull characters.In the original version unfortunately, only a good supply of great supporting characters prevented the movie from being a simple cat-and-mouse thriller, with honorable mentions for Martin Balsam, Telly Savalas and even Jack Kruschnen as Cady's lawyer. Again, they all out-shined the great Gregory Peck. Sorry for the Peck fans but at least Peck knew his business when it was his turn to play memorably campy but unforgettable villains, such as Joseph Mengele in "The Boys From Brazil". So, I'm not criticizing him for the sake of it, but it was obvious he was just only a foil for Max Cady ? hell, even his name is less cool sounding. Maybe it was needed for the script, he had to be so ordinarily boring before being pushed to his limits and reach a breaking point, but these considerations don't interfere with my personal appreciation of his acting. Still, if not personality, he had enough physical appeal to appear like a fitting antagonist for Max Cady. Yes, I can't help but being obsessed by Max Cady.And in a way, Cady redeems all the movie's flaws, if only for the thought-provoking aspect of his stalking which was not just revenge, but a way to use Law as a weapon. In the 1991 version, this aspect is almost secondary because of the whole emotional and psychological mess provoked by Cady. The original "Cape Fear" in an interesting examination about the deviations of Law and the way it can also protect criminals, inspiring a double reaction as we're both impressed by an extreme level of fairness that can confine to naivety, or shocked by the limits of a system whose only merit is to prevent from accusing innocent people, but at what price? Max Cady, through his blackmails and incessant harassment, is the illustration of this ambivalence. He always insists, even childishly brags on the fact that he knows his rights, that he studied Law in prison, and we know damn well, that these are the hardest criminals to get.And even if we know that he would sooner or later get tired of playing cat-and-mouse with the Bowdens, that he's a man of action, and one of the most despicable ones, we're both thrilled by the psychological torture endured by a happy Family whose life become an endless nightmare, and by the imminence of a cruel action that would take its paroxysm in a setting with a very cheerful name "Cape Fear" ? film-noir? Maybe. Intense thriller? Sure. But It's Mitchum's show, and no one else's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what film noir is supposed to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Original Cape Fear, where to start with this classic noir film? First of all let me preface this review by stating , if you came here looking for a compare and contrast job between this and the (1991) Cape Fear with Nick Nolte and Robert De Niro, you have come to the wrong place. Now that I have that off my chest let us begin.The plot consists of a southern lawyer Sam Bowden (Peck) being visited by a felon he helped put away eight years ago, Max Cady (Mitchum). Following the initial reintroduction, Cady begins to slowly and deliberately annoy and harass Bowden and his family. As the film progresses this harassment turns more and more dangerous as Cady first targets the family dog and then takes an interest in Bowden's young teenage Daughter Nancy (Lori Martin). We see a man of the law Bowden confronted with the limitations of that law despite his friendship with the police department. This film is visually stunning shot in classic black and white with a haunting tension filled score that scares the bejesus out of you. You feel the growing desperation of Bowden as Cady skates at the edge of the law and forces Bowden to the other side of the law. Just how far is Bowden willing to compromise his principles to protect his family. You can't really help but put yourself in the same situation while watching the film and wondering what you would do.The whole cast of this film is fabulous. Peck's portrayal of Bowden as the anit-Atticus Finch is great but not as great as Mitchum who steals the movie as the increasingly creepy and lecherous Max Cady. His portrayal is even more amazing when you consider what sensors would allow to be seen when this film was made. Mitchum imparts more meaning out of a leer and tip of his hat than many modern films can with crazy CGI effects. The supporting cast is rock solid as well, Martin Balsam is great as the Police Chief Mark Dutton, and Telly Savalas is outstanding as Private investigator Charles Sievers even if he does not have a lollypop. The level of fear and uneasy sexual tension in this film will have you on the edge of the couch. I highly recommend seeing this film if you haven't in the past or revisiting it as it never gets stale. This is what great film noir is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good but the remake works way better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film buffs out there already know "Cape Fear" story due to Martin Scorsese's version in 1991. The original film, released in 1962 presents the same story but more innocently and less terrifying than the remake, although it's a very good film.J. Lee Thompson's classic brings Robert Mitchum playing the frightening ex-convicted Max Cady on the same scary level of craziness presented in "The Night of the Hunter", except that instead of persecuting innocent children he's looking for revenge against a lawyer (Gregory Peck) and his family, since he was the responsible for his imprisonment for eight years, charged of brutally attacking a woman. Cady has an intelligent method for getting attention of the lawyer, bringing danger to everyone around the defenseless man who can't count much on the police or the judicial system. And the threats will go on and on, and no one is willing to lose this implacable hunt.Considering what this film tried to do in terms of suspense in the 1960's it's a very good, scary and quite thrilling film. However, and I'm not saying this classic is dated or something but it's very difficult to not see some flaws (leaving the girl behind twice when everyone in the family knows Max is chasing them everywhere) and a lack of more shocking moments, which is the advantage of Marty's remake, who used a stylish and fast editing to create an great impact on viewers and counted with Robert DeNiro's incredible performance as Cady. The 1991 screenplay by Wesley Strick upgraded situations, added more spicy and violent things to the plot that in the original, as for today audiences, wasn't so appealing, the film loses some of its rhythm at times. On the other hand, the musical score by Bernard Herrmann remembering the themes he made for "Psycho", the dark cinematography by Samuel Leavitt and, of course, the performances by the cast, are all suitable to make us terrified, their job was brilliantly done here. If you like sinister films, stories about revenge, great acting and more, watch it because this film delivers all that. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Max Cady must surely be one of the cinema's most despicable creations. Our first sign of his depravity comes in the film's opening moments, when a woman drops one of her books just as she passes him. Any decent human being would have stopped to pick it up, but Max Cady just keeps walking as though he hasn't even noticed. This simple lack of action has already told us everything that we need to know about the man's character; he exists among the lowest dregs of humanity, and lives only to drag down those more respectable than he. Robert Mitchum plays Cady to perfection, his very presence bringing about repulsion and loathing. His character is stupid enough to do absolutely anything, and yet he's shrewd enough to avoid prosecution? at least until it's too late. J. Lee Thompson's 'Cape Fear' is a potent thriller ? certainly one of the best I've seen from the 1960s ? and there are many elements that Alfred Hitchcock himself would have loved.'Cape Fear' was adapted by James R. Webb from John D. MacDonald's novel, "The Executioners." In the same year that he brought Atticus Finch to the screen, Gregory Peck portrays Sam Bowden, a respected attorney with a loving family (Polly Bergen plays his wife, and Lori Martin his young daughter). However, eight years ago, Sam's witness testimony sent the filthy and violent Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) to prison for assault, and now the criminal has returned to wreak a prolonged and devastating revenge. Peck, though originally offered the role of the villain, here plays the epitome of middle-class respectability, while Cady's predation of his daughter prompts him to take drastic action. The one horrifying truth of the matter is that, until Cady actually attempts something horrible, the law is powerless to do a thing. Despite his frustration with this, Sam grudgingly agrees that he wouldn't have it any other way. After all, only in a police state can you arrest a man before he has committed a crime.Though Peck is excellent in this film, I can't stress enough how amazing Mitchum is. Just like Hitchcock's Bruno Anthony (played by Robert Walker in 'Strangers on a Train (1951)'), Max Cady is always perched unsettlingly in the distance, but nonetheless close enough to elicit genuine terror. He isn't doing anything particularly threatening ? and he cockily announces this fact ? but his sadistic intentions are unquestionable. The scene where young Nancy Bowden is accosted by the villain outside her school really is a harrowing sequence, and absolute horror, I'd imagine, for any parents with primary school children. Additionally, the entire climax on the house boat at Cape Fear does little to disappoint. Though I am yet to watch the 1991 remake, I suspect that even Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro will have trouble matching this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director: L. Lee Thompson, Script: James R. Webb, Cast:Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, Polly Bergen,Lori Martin, Martin Balsam, Telly Savalas.Max Cady(played by Robert Mitchum)has just got out of prison after serving eight years. Attorney Sam Bowden witnessed him attacking a women and testified against him in court. Cady is now out to get Bowden. He terrifies his family and tries to get to his young daughter(played by Lori Martin).After Night of the Hunter, this is Robert Mitchem's best performance. He is Max Cady! He has this cool, suave style about him that De Niro was not able to top in spite of his macho, over the top performance. The rest of the cast was also very good. Telly Savalas as the detective...perfect! Lee Thompson has said that he wanted Hayley Mills to play the part of Nancy(the daughter)but she was unable because of contractual obligations with Disney studios at the time. He stated disappointment about this in an interview. No doubt about it, Hayley Mills was the bigger star but I actually think Lori Martin did a fine job. I don't know why she wasn't a bigger star. She sure had the potential.This is one of my favorite thrillers. It is the last real movie to be classified as a "folm noir". It is also one of the last movies to be filmed in black and white for reasons other than budget. Your horror/thriller collection is not complete without this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like the movie. Not just because my Great Aunt is in it (who plays Nancy Bowden) but because I think it's a really good suspense film. All the Actors/Actress' do a great job!! The movie is about Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) who is a lawyer who a few years back had put Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) in jail. Well, Max is out now and seeks revenge on Sam. He will stop at nothing to get it. After Max kills the family dog, threatens wife Peggy Bowden (Polly Bergen) and terrifies daughter Nancy Bowden (Lori Martin), Sam Starts to take action. He starts a plan. He tricks Max into thinking he's leaving so Max will go for his family, but really he's hot on Max's tail. Well, I won't give the rest of it away so that you can see it for yourself. Like I said before, I personally think it's a great Suspense film. P.S. How old does Lori Martin (who plays Nancy) look? Well, actually she's 16!!! She's a very small person. Watch especially when Max Cady puts his hand around her mouth towards the end. His hand is about the size of her face!!!!! "Love You Auntie!!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The timeless plot of a disgruntled ex-convict seeking revenge is perfectly executed for a film considered the predecessor of today's suspense thriller movies. Robert Mitchum is excellent as Max Cady and a true scene stealer as the creepy tough guy terrorizing Sam Bowden's family. Mitchum's good looks and charm fool many people into believing his lies. Gregory Peck is excellent as Sam Bowden and he lends just the right amount of zest to his role. He reacts as you'd expect to Max Cady's stalking and tries to resolve matters peacefully. Mitchum's con man stint is as relevant today as it was 40 years ago and it's yet another film showing how many criminals are not reformed through the prison system. Just like the film, "In the Bedroom", some victims fight back when the law fails to protect them.Overall I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1961 Universal release is one of Gregory Peck's best films. He portrays a lawyer who had sent a convicted criminal (Robert Mitchum) to prison for six years. Still bitter about being found guilty, Mitchum finishes his sentence and gets back on the streets with the intent to seek brutal revenge on Peck and his family. He stalks Peck constantly and tries to taunt him by threatening the people who he holds most dear. An excellent suspense item from the last days of the studio system. It was remade in 1991 with mostly misfired results.</fullReview>

I love Bobby , as we his friends like to call him. Juliet Lewis sucks Max Cady's fingers? Where's the threat people? People saying this would be better in color? I know many people who won't even watch movies that are not in color. People like that should never be allowed on this site. 1962!!!! Duh! The idea that an adult male would go after a little girl was REALLY taboo then. Robert Mitchum was brilliant in this movie. His was completely vile and despicable as Cady and his performance was beyond great. Freddy Kruger? are you kidding me? He's about as scary as Yosemite Sam. He's a cartoon - so is the performance of "Bobby". The remake ranks right up there with other atrocities like "Robin Hood , Prince of Theives" and "Psycho".If you don't see how the original movie was a thousand times better than the remake just stick with Jetsons' cartoons. I was very glad to see how many writers to this space recognize this for the true classic it was. There are far too many intelligent comments and observations already posted regarding this movie so I refrain and just pass along my endorsement. 9/10</fullReview>

He toys with the mind long enough to drive you berserk and than he strikes. Too bad the rest of the film doesn't present that kind of emotion. When Mitchum is off the screen, it falls flat on its face. Peck is made into a hiding behind the law wimp. It doesn't work for me. Savalas is quite good in his pre-Kojak years, although I suggest "Birdman of Alcatraz," which was also released in 1962. J.

		<fullReview>*Favourite movie quote* - "He's here! He's here!" Being a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock, director Lee Thompson stated that with this intense revenge picture he wanted to infuse as many "Hitchcockian" elements into its story as possible.And, in doing so - The observant viewer will quickly notice that 1962's "Cape Fear" does, in a number of ways, resemble a Hitchcock production with its frequent use of unusual lighting angles, as well as offering the viewer subtle hints, rather than graphic depictions, when it comes to the violence.And, speaking about actor Robert Mitchum - I certainly do give this dude an approving nod for the sinister, despicable and nasty twist that he put on his portrayal of the sadistic Max Cady character.All-in-all - For a b&amp;w picture that is now 53 years old (and for all of the trouble that it came up against with the censor board), I certainly think that "Cape Fear" holds up quite well (and is, at least, worth a view), in the long run.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad little thriller at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any overview of Cape Fear invariably brings comparisons to the '91 Scorsese remake. While Scorsese perhaps made a more engrossing and colourful adaptation, the '62 original remains tighter and more effortlessly chilling in its execution. Robert Mitchum was the original Max Cady before De Niro, a ruthlessly intelligent, sadistic felon who pursues Sam Bowden and his all-American family relentlessly. While De Niro in the remake felt more like an slasher movie villain, seemingly unstoppable in his almost supernatural pursuit of the Bowdens like a Michael Myers on steroids, here Mitchum's Cady is more akin to a weasel. He has the ability to squirm his way through every attempt to stop him within the confines of the law, using his knowledge of the system to harass Bowden without ever physically laying a finger on him. Some critics say that the remake covered up some plot discrepancies, by turning Bowden into Cady's lawyer, rather than just the witness that was Gregory Peck's character. But I for one find the notion of a phsycopath like Cady pursuing those he felt has wronged him in such an arbitrary fashion to be much more terrifying. It shows more how woefully unlucky Bowden was to wander into Cady's path, being picked out as a victim to pay undue penance for helping to put Cady away. Max Cady in this version is a hypnotic, soft-talking, but thoroughly unreasonable monster. Much more so than De Niro's. Perhaps it is a case of apples and oranges. Are there faults with Cape Fear? Perhaps, but only as a product of its time. Gregory Peck feels like little more than a rerun of his role as Atticus Finch, and the predictable scenario of the child in danger is a well worn plot device. However, the film more than makes up for any shortcomings with a gripping and suspenseful climax in the swamp of Cape Fear, with silent black and white figures grappling in the dark, muddy waters. The inevitable confrontation between Mrs. Bowden and Cady is a fine slice of close contact acting. Watch Cape Fear mainly to see one of the greatest villains to grace the screen. The scene of Mitchum slithering into the water like a reptile full of evil intent is worth the price of admission alone, whatever that may be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I adore Robert Mitchum. The man was one of the most gifted actors of his generation...and unfortunately one of the most under-appreciated as well. His performance as Max Cady has given us one of the most terrifying and believably evil characters in the history of cinema. The only other character that comes close is Harry Powell in Night of The Hunter...again, Mitchum. The man is brilliant. Period. The foil to Cady's evil is Sam Bowden. Gregory Peck is, of course, brilliant in the role of the lawyer whose family is being terrorized by a man he sent up the river years ago, who has just been released from jail. Polly Bergen is equally brilliant as the tough as nails wife of Bowden. In fact, she steals the show in the final scenes! This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't let up for a moment. One of the best thrillers ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life was invaluable for the Bowden family; wonderful husband, father, beautiful wife and daughter, well-known lawyer, beautiful home ideal for the picture perfect family. But that picture slowly began to fade, when an animal by the name Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) had been released from jail. Eight years spent behind bars only to blame Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) for testifying against him in court. Sam Bowden witnessed Cady attack a young woman. For that, Cady spent a portion of his life behind bars. Cady was no fool he utilized his time and resources wisely while incarcerated, and studied the rules of law thoroughly. With that new found knowledge he composed an ingenious plan. For those 8 years spent behind bars Cady did not let the conviction of the attack move onward, until he sought out revenge on a key witness Sam Bowden, who had played a key role in his sentence. Sam Bowden knew that life for his wife Peggy Bowden (Polly Bergen), and daughter Nancy Bowden (Lori Martin) were no longer going to be comfortable. This nasty, malicious creature had been placed back into society. With Max Cady released from jail, there would only be trepidation of just when Max Cady will strike. "Cape Fear" (1962) is an absolute classic. The roles in the film were phenomenal despite the lack of gore we would have suspected, with such a suspenseful storyline. It is a real commendable drama from start to finish. The acting from each individual actor and actress throughout the film were well developed. My adrenalin rose every time Cady crept on both Peggy and Nancy. Each act were well played out, and made you feel the intensity as if you were there. In the film you witness the physiological aspect with Max Cady. This was displayed in the very beginning of the film, in the scene where Sam Bowden and Max Cady were in the courtroom. That very moment we witness the physiological/mental issues with Max Cady in a very distinctive way. Anger, heartless, helplessness, darkness, hates towards women, and torture is what director J.Lee Thompson portrayed throughout the film.</fullReview>

Mitchum is Max Cady, and he is released from prison after serving an eight year sentence for rape. He blames a lawyer, Sam Bowden, for his conviction, and finds him living with his family. He kills the family dog, but Sam can't prove it and hires a detective, Charlie(Telly Savalas) to help him out. His friend, Mark Dutton is a police chief, but he is also unable to pin anything on Cady, including an assault on a woman by the ex-con, as she refuses to testify against him. Fed up with the law, Sam hires three thugs to beat Cady, but he is able to injure all of them. He vows to have the lawyer disbarred. Bowden takes his wife and 14 year old daughter to his houseboat on Cape Fear to set a trap in order to kill Cady. Mitchum and Peck are superb in the two lead roles, but I was not crazy about the ending. I would recommend Cape Fear just to watch these two actors at the top of their game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrific movie--and one you can't stop watching once it gets into full swing. It's what you want in a suspense film--taut, exciting, some fine performances and a sense that this could be real. The film begins with a lawyer (Gregory Peck) being approached by an ex-con (Robert Mitchum). It seems that eight years earlier, Mitchum was sent to prison based, in part, on Peck's testimony in court. While at first Mitchum says nothing the least bit threatening, Peck knows that Mitchum's repeatedly appearing around Peck and his family is no coincidence--it's meant as a threat. Unfortunately, since Mitchum really hasn't done anything, the police are helpless--but Peck knows that sooner or later, Mitchum is going to hurt him--and he repeatedly implied it might just happen to Peck's wife or young daughter. So what's Peck to do....just wait until the worst happens? Well, see the film to find out for yourself. You won't regret it--it's a very, very good movie.Why did I like this? Well, of course the great acting (especially by Mitchum--who was great at playing menacing and evil) and writing were a big part of it. I also noticed that the sound track really heightened the tension and soon realized it was HEAVILY inspired by the score from "Psycho"--you can easily hear the similarities yourself. Regardless, all the parts fit together great and make for a satisfying film...provided it doesn't scare the pants off you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Gregory Peck chose John D. MacDonald's novel "The Executioners" as the first project for his production company he knew that by playing the good guy he'd be upstaged by the villain. Well, "The Executioners" became "Cape Fear" and Peck turned out to be right.The story concerns Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck), an upstanding lawyer who begins to be harassed by Max Cady (Robert Mitchum), a criminal who he helped to put behind bars eight years earlier. However, Cady is sly, always staying within the limits of the law, so he remains a persistent threat even though he can't be touched on any legal grounds. Nevertheless, Sam knows that it's just a matter of time until Max makes his move and hurts those who are most dear to him, namely his wife and daughter.The story is pretty daring for 1962. It is strongly implied that Max Cady intends to rape the daughter of Sam Bowden. Lori Martin was only about 14 when this was filmed and, to my eyes, she doesn't even look that old. It's no surprise that the censors were up in arms and I'm amazed that the film actually made it to theatres in its current state.As for the acting, Robert Mitchum delivers what is easily the best performance in the film. His Max Cady is a thoroughly repugnant character but he commands the viewer's full attention any time he steps on screen. Gregory Peck has the less interesting lead role but he still manages to deliver a fine performance, as always. The supporting cast is mainly capable but unexceptional though there are some standouts like Martin Balsam as the local police chief.Director J. Lee Thompson did an impressive job, often evoking a Hitchcockian atmosphere (as was his intent). Also contributing to the Hitchcockian atmosphere was the foreboding score from the great Bernard Herrmann. The attractive black-and-white cinematography of Sam Leavitt also deserves mention. Even though the film was completely ignored at Oscar time, any one of these elements was worthy of a nomination.Ultimately, "Cape Fear" still holds up as a taut revenge thriller nearly fifty years after its release. I haven't seen Scorsese's 1991 remake so I can't compare the two but I can't say that I see much room for improvement, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Mitchum!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Serving movie-going audiences with some of the most shocking material ever put on film up till that time, CAPE FEAR is interesting not the least because of the period during which it was produced. The year of 1962 may have been when the Hayes Code, a censor system established in the 1930's to prevent audiences of material that could easily be viewed as "tasteless" or "inappropriate" in Hollywood-films, was beginning to visibly tear apart. However, the system would still be in function for a few more years, and this did affect CAPE FEAR to a degree; I do believe, however, that what may have been left out of the final film hardly hurt its impact, rather the contrary.Based on a novel by John D. MacDonald, the film covers the story of lawyer Sam Bawden (Gregory Peck), whose idyllic family life in a small-town is suddenly disturbed by the arrival of ex-convict Max Cady (Robert Mitchum); years before, Bawden had served as a witness to Cady attacking a woman, ultimately resulting in him being sentenced to prison. Now released, Cady is determined to terrorize the family, albeit only to a degree where, it seems, he doesn't do anything legally wrong. However, the attitude in his approach makes it very clear that he is planning to go further, which makes Bawden exasperatedly worried particularly because of his daughter Nancy.From this rather uncomfortable premise, we are granted an experience of suspense which manages to be quite thought-provoking at the same time. Director J. Lee Thompson, whose name is seldom being referred to today, takes explicit advantage of both subtle and more direct nuances in the presentation, constantly covering the setting with overwhelming shadows and darkness to provoke forth the frightened aspect of ourselves, while letting some of the most disturbing moments occur in broad daylight, making sure that we are at the edge of our seats throughout, never daring to breathe loose. However, even though we are given no rest, CAPE FEAR does not fall into the trap of using suspense merely as a foil to not make us pay attention to the characters driving the story; especially in the case of lawyer Bawden, his changing appearance as his situation turns all the more serious makes for some quite intriguing characterization. Even though Peck, being as good an actor as he is, never allows the change in Bawden to become distracting in context to his initial, good-natured appearance, we are made increasingly observant to the fact that his eagerness to get rid of Cady, understandable though it is, begins to resemble Cady's own desire for revenge, the only significant difference being that Bawden has a family to be concerned about. This is especially thought-provoking due to Bawden's profession; as a lawyer, Bawden feels that he can't honestly say Cadey should be punished before he's done something against the law, but sometimes your own morals and principles are hard to sustain.However, what is really the high-point of CAPE FEAR, and truly the major reason why it stands as intense as it is, is the performance of Robert Mitchum. Good as I knew Mitchum was, it was this performance which made me recognize the versatility of his acting register; he is so convincing as Max Cadey that I constantly forgot who I was watching, having to remind myself that this is, after all, a performance. He is, plain and simple, magnificent. It is especially with regards to Mitchum's performance that I feel CAPE FEAR was done justice in being released at a time when censorship was more common in Hollywood than it is now; although I am principally against censorship, I do think it has done some movies good in the sense that it forces film-makers to go beyond the simple solutions to deliver their message. Nowadays, all too often a "bad guy" is given every opportunity to showcase his mean nature, making us tire of him before we reach the climax. By contrast, although Mitchum makes us genuinely terrified of Cady, not until the very end does he reveal just exactly how dangerous he really is, instead turning a bit worse for each step; hence making us paralyzed throughout.CAPE FEAR remains, as directed by J. Lee Thompson and performed by Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, a quite thought-provoking and thoroughly terrifying experience to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man terrorizes a lawyer's family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Mitchum seeks revenge against a witness who helped put him in prison in "Cape Fear," a 1962 film starring Gregory Peck, Polly Bergen, Martin Balsam, Telly Savalas, Lori Martin and Barrie Chase. Mitchum, in probably his best role, plays the psychotic Max Cady, a man with an easy smile and laid back attitude who is pure evil. He is determined that Sam Bowden (Peck), whose testimony in an assault case sent him up the river for 8 years, will pay for what he did via his family - his wife, Peggy, and his young daughter Nancy. Bowden is a distinguished attorney and gets some help from a police chief (Balsam), but apparently during his time in stir, Cady studied the law. He goes so far and no further by being a menacing presence who does nothing. When Bowden takes the advice of a detective (Savalas) and has Cady beat up by some thugs, Cady gets the law on his side, and Bowden faces disbarment. His only hope is to catch Cady in the act. He comes with an elaborate plot to catch Cady before Nancy and Peggy are hurt.This is an excellent drama with a pivotal performance from Mitchum, who is fantastic as the disgusting Cady. Peck is very good, though perhaps too measured, as Bowden, and Polly Bergen lets out all the stops, particularly in her final scene with Cady, some of which was improvised by Mitchum. My only complaint is the predictability of Cady killing the family dog. Every time there's an animal in this type of film, you know it's doomed, and it gets tiresome. Someday perhaps a writer will be able to come up with something to replace this tired cliché.The beautiful Barrie Chase, the sensational dancer who performed with Fred Astaire on his television shows, has a nice role here as Cady's pick-up; Lori Martin, who resembles Elizabeth Taylor and played her role in the TV series "National Velvet" is the daughter here. She is a mix of good looks, innocence, and youth which makes her particularly attractive to Cady.All in all, a tense, well-paced film with some genuinely terrifying moments and a genuinely terrifying performance by Robert Mitchum, which really makes the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSWow, this was an amazing movie. This is a lot better than I thought it would be. I know that is is considered a classic and considered one of the greatest horror movies of all time but I did not think that it would be THAT good. Boy, was I wrong! This is incredible. Not the best movie ever, though. The acting is this movie is fantastic. Robert Mitchum gives his usual terrifying performance of a psychopath. He is good at that, isn't he? Oh yeah, he is. Gregory Peck in this movie gives his usual terrific performance overall. Now let us talk about the music. No? Too bad. The music in this movie is incredible. It is one of Bernard Hermann's best out of his usual Hitchcock films.Here is the plot of this movie. It is very simple. A man named Max Cady has just got out of prison. He now wants revenge on his lawyer named Sam Bowden for getting him in the jail. He starts stalking his daughter and harassing the family. He even poisons their dog. Their dog, for crying out loud! The family becomes frightened after Max threatens Sam and they escape to a houseboat. The only problem is that Max follows them. Max almost kills Sam but Sam corners him with a gun and tells him that he will rot in jail.Overall, this is a brilliant movie. It is a bit better than Night of the Hunter, actually, and Night of the Hunter is a great movie. I am still flabbergasted that this is not in the IMDb's Top 250. I just can not believe it. This is a tense and of course terrifying thrill-ride from beginning to end. I was not that satisfied with the ending, though. I kind of wanted Max Cady to die, but it was a great ending and one of the best last lines ever in the history of film. Anyway, this is an unforgettable film that a fan of thrillers should not miss.10/10Recommended Films: Night of the Hunter, Cape Fear (1991 Version.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After many years I was finally persuaded to watch this by daughter who likes it, if she'd reciprocate and force herself to watch All Quiet On The Western Front for me. It's a well made engrossing film with some tremendous eye-cutting black &amp; white acetate film photography and a storyline that is still disturbing, for me at least. Cape Fear I mean.Ex-con Mitchum hunts down lawyer Peck who nailed him 8 years before to revenge himself by raping his young daughter Nancy. Mitchum's plans and Peck's thwartings are the film. Favourite bit: Nancy running away from Mitchum out of the crowded street into the empty schoolhouse - such hokeyness would be laughed at by people today from a 1930's film, but here it's treated as gripping and essential. Peck beautifully photographed in the long grass in the dark reminded me of Shere Khan from The Jungle Book. I half expected Mitchum to try to applaud Peck's closing speech. The kind of censorship thankfully displayed in this film is mostly ridiculed nowadays but would this version have been as popular if it had been as graphic as possible and if remade again will they scrap the limit on how young the child can be to satisfy todays voyeurs artistic revenge lust?Reading the other reviews it appears most people consider the remake as inferior, or certainly more "liberated", so I'll avoid that based on this. Also somebody put this should be seen once by all "crime/thriller" fans - I enjoyed the 102 minutes with reservations but am afraid that applies to me, I'll stick to The Count Of Monte Cristo (1934).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superior 60's suspense thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cunning and vengeful sexual psychopath convict Max Cady (the impeccable Robert Mitchum in peak frightening form) gets released from prison and vows to get revenge on both respectable, upstanding lawyer Sam Bowden (the always strong and dignified Gregory Peck) and his family. J. Lee Thompson's taut, capable direction deftly wrings plenty of gripping and gut-wrenching tension from the absorbingly cruel and chilling story. The superb acting from a first-rate cast qualifies as a significant plus: Polly Bergen as Bowden's loving, concerned wife Peggy, the adorable Lori Martin as Bowden's sweet, tiny teenage daughter Nancy, Martin Balsam as a helpful police chief, Telly Savalas as a thorough, tenacious private investigator, Jack Kruschen as a shrewd, aggressive defense attorney, and dancer Barrie Chase as a sexy bar girl floozy Cady brutally beats up. Sam Leavitt's stark, polished black and white cinematography makes artful use of fades and dissolves. The great Bernard Herrmann delivers a beautifully brooding and moody full-bore orchestral score. Better yet, there's a welcome and laudable element of restraint present throughout which adds substantially to the overall nerve-wracking suspense; Thompson implies more violence than he shows, thus making a refreshing concession to the viewer's imagination and ensuring that the frankly unpleasant central premise never becomes too vile or repellent. Mitchum's supremely low-key and quietly menacing portrayal of Cady clinches the whole deal: Whether he's calmly strangling a police officer in the murky swamp or breaking an egg over Bergen's chest at the picture's harrowing conclusion, Cady registers strongly as one genuinely scary and intimidating piece of nasty work. An excellent and extremely effective thriller classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The obvious thing to do is compare the original "Cape Fear" to Martin Scorsese's remake. I wish to assert that they were equally good. Both Roberts (that is, Mitchum and DeNiro) create an evil character whom you can't help but admire. In a role somewhat channeling Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck brings out man's inner beast as the lawyer having to protect his family from this vicious killer, as Nick Nolte would later do (Mitchum and Peck had guest appearances in the remake). Polly Bergen and Lori Martin as wife Peggy and daughter Nancy give a real feeling of sinking into desperation. The only thing that gives the movie even the slightest feeling of silliness - and this is only to us nowadays - is that the judge is played by Edward Platt, better known as the chief on "Get Smart". But one can ignore that. This is a classic.I still can't believe that there's a place in North Carolina called Cape Fear. Did someone actually think that that name would attract tourists?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cape Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suspense at it's best...a riveting, powerful psychological drama with two magnificent actors, Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck going head to head in a battle of emotions and psyches... Director Jay Lee Thompson gives the viewers nearly two hours of powerful emotions pitted against each other by nearly every person in the film. Robert Mitchum is the epitome of evil, a modern day Hannibal Lector from Silence of the Lambs. What could be a worse terror than being stalked nearly every hour of the day by a convicted con/murderer who seems to know every step your family will take every day and plots to follow them with a disturbing psychological game. Mitchum nearly destroys Peck's family with incredible finesse...every thing he is doing sidesteps the law and leaves them nearly helpless in putting him away. For my money this film is more scary than Psycho. Peck is the lawyer who helped put Mitchum (Max Cady) away ten years earlier on a assault charge. Cady will not let anybody or anything stand in his way in his game of revenge. Along the way he beats up a girl he picks up in a bar and she is terrified to testify against him for fear of retaliation. Peck hires a hit squad of thugs to beat up and try to kill Cady and that backfires on him and his family. The cops stay on Cady's trail but can never get enough of a rap against him to put him back in jail. Cady is too smart and outfoxes the lawyer and the law.....a series of terror awaits Peck's family, the poisoning of their dog, and the stalking of his 15 year old daughter. By the middle of the film Mitchum has the viewer nearly gasping for air. What snake deal will he pull next? In the final part of the film Peck attempts to hide his family on a lake, oddly named Cape Fear, in a houseboat. Cady stalks down the boat and kills a hired bodyguard. Then he sneaks up on the houseboat with the creaking doors and floors and assaults Peck's wife Polly Bergen. Peck finally gets the upper hand and gets Cady put back in the slammer, but it nearly destroys his family's psyche in doing so. A riveting, intense musical score by the brilliant Bernard Hermann adds to the terror. The same sound track was added to a brutal, bloody remake with Robert DeNiro in 1994; don't waste your time on that one. A very poor remake. Not for kids to see....depressing film for many but brilliantly made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A type like that is an animal, so you've got to fight him like an animal, that's my advice."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cape Fear" is an hour and a half long movie on a short fuse, ignited by Robert Mitchum's visceral portrayal of villain Max Cady, recently released from an eight year prison hitch for rape. The testimony of Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) helped put him away, and for that exercise he's about to pay dearly. Now a lawyer, Bowden finds himself suddenly searching for intricacies in the law that will allow him and the authorities to keep Cady reigned in. But this is one clever fellow, and as a viewer, you find yourself wanting to reach right into the screen and wreak vengeance on Cady yourself, so despicable and smarmy is the character that threatens the peace and sanity of an otherwise charming Southern couple and their young daughter. Polly Bergen is Mrs. Bowden, and Lori Martin is young Nancy Bowden, who winds up being menaced for just about the entire film.In addition to the lead players, you've got some major Hollywood heavyweights lending their talents in supporting roles here; Martin Balsam is Police Chief Dutton, and Telly Savalas with hair is private investigator Charles Sievers, hired by Bowden to learn Cady's intentions. A number of seamy scenarios are presented before Bowden succumbs to his baser nature, and hatches a plot to take out his aggressor with the tacit complicity of both.Cady won't go down easy though, and he remains a step ahead of Bowden at nearly every turn. When he makes his appearance on the houseboat and confronts Mrs. Bowden, the tension is palpable, and Polly Bergen's performance as she gasps for mercy is riveting. Soon enough though we learn that Cady's real objective is young Nancy, thereby extending the cat and mouse game into extra innings. As Cady emerges from the Cape Fear River drenched and oozing subdued hostility, director J. Lee Thompson draws us right into the action with a host of menacing camera angles, setting us up for the confrontation between the lawyer and the rapist. Their see saw battle is deftly handled; Bowden's decision to go limp and pretend to be drowned allows sufficient time to gather his wits and fashion a weapon from a submerged rock. When the final reckoning comes due, you find yourself rooting for Bowden to pull the trigger, but his inner strength forces a decision to allow justice to take it's course."Cape Fear" was remade some thirty years following the original with Robert DeNiro in the heel role, and Nick Nolte portraying lawyer Bowden. Interestingly, principals Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam were called upon to play minor parts. Having seen the newer version first many years ago, I'll still tip my hat to the original black and white film of 1962 as my preference. Taking nothing away from the superb DeNiro, Robert Mitchum achieves an on screen menace almost effortlessly, endowing his character with a creepiness that infects every scene he's in; he puts the fear into "Cape Fear".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be the best Film of this type of storyline ever made. If any young actor wants to learn how to play a chilling Villain is watch Robert Mitchum in Cape Fear. Personally, i say this is still a very frightening Movie. You can imagine someone terrorizing you and your Family in such a way.What makes it so believable was there were no special effects, unlike the remake and no unnecessary brutal violence and gore. The fear was installed by just the thought of what Mitchum was going to do next. Lori Martin was especially good as Nancy and considering J.Lee. Thompson the Director wanted Hayley Mills to play that part, he certainly could not be disappointed, as he stated in his interview on the DVD. A must for both Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum fans and fine performances from the supporting cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a timeless, watchable appeal to it, and the DVD version of this movie is great. A wonderful transfer in letterbox format only enhances your viewing pleasure of this movie. Peck is solid as always but the movie certainly belongs to Robert Mitchum for his menacing portrayal. I've wondered how much was acting and how much was actually part of his personality? Polly Bergen and the remainder of the cast are first rate as is the directing and the unforgettable musical score by Bernard Herrmann. What bothered me the most about this movie is that Nancy (Lori Martin) is dressed like a tiny version of her mother. She's actually freaky looking! The wardrobe department was way off with her character. I know girls didn't wear belly tops back then but even her hair style was just odd giving her a 40ish, frumpy look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get The Picture Now, Counsellor?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Except perhaps for those thrillers that Steven Spielberg and Brian DePalma have directed, few non-Hitchcock-directed suspense movies have ever carried the razor-sharp tension that director J. Lee Thompson's 1962 thriller CAPE FEAR does. Even now, over forty years since it was first released, and despite the plaudits heaped on Martin Scorsese's 1991 remake, the original still carries a great deal of terror to it--it remains plausible, menacing, and downright frightening.Based on John D. MacDonald's novel "The Executioners", the movie stars Gregory Peck (an actor seemingly incapable of giving a subpar performance) as an upstanding small-town Southern lawyer, Sam Bowden, with a good home and a good family who is met by an ex-con, Max Cady (Robert Mitchum, in one of the actor's many fine stone-cold, don't-give-a-damn roles) that he sent to jail eight years earlier. Mitchum, just itching to get back for Peck's successful conviction of him, manages to slowly but surely turn Peck's life terrifyingly upside down, menacing him, his wife (Polly Bergen) and their vulnerable daughter (Lori Martin) just enough without crossing the line of the law. Mitchum had learned a lot about the law while behind bars, and he is intent on using that very law to force Peck across the line between being an upholder of the law and a vengeance seeker. His friends in the police department, including Martin Balsam, are powerless to do anything short of Mitchum committing an overt act. And when it becomes clear that Mitchum's psychopathic advances are moving swiftly towards that overt act, Peck takes matters into his own hands on the Cape Fear River in North Carolina.Thompson, who had directed the 1961 World War II film THE GUNS OF NAVARONE, directs CAPE FEAR with a sure-handed touch, making it feel very much like a Hitchcock film without being slavishly imitative of it. Whereas Scorsese's remake clearly reflects the ambiguous sensibilities of the 1990s, not to mention a more explicit approach to sex and violence, Thompson's film suggests the menace without veering into overt sadism. The scene in which Mitchum cracks an egg over Bergen's bare body, however, is hair-raising all by itself even now. Indeed, Mitchum's performance, echoing his similar demented preacher role in the 1955 cult film NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, is one of the most menacing villain roles ever in Hollywood history; he constantly calls Peck "Counsellor" just to try to get a rise out of the prosecutor. It is a performance of incredible uncouthness. But Peck is equally fine as Sam Bowden, a man trapped between upholding the law and wanting to protect his wife and daughter by any means necessary. Bergen, Martin, and Balsam also score well, as does Telly Savalas as a private investigator who gives Peck some unconventional and unsolicited advice as to how to handle Mitchum.With excellent black-and-white cinematography by Sam Leavitt (PORK CHOP HILL), and a menacing score by Hitchcock's favorite composer Bernard Herrmann, CAPE FEAR is a terror film that holds up to close scrutiny even today, thanks to all the right elements coming together in one truly nerve-wracking package.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gregory Peck is so linked in my mind to the simplicity and grace of Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird, that it is always surprising to see him in anything else. To find him in the gritty, dirty piece of film noir that is the original Cape Fear is something of a shock. Yet, as always he does a marvelous job, and some of that grace manages to shine through the grime.The story is a pretty basic noir plot. Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) is an ex convict who just got out of prison. He has come back to town to haunt Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) who testified against Cady for attacking a woman. Cady has spent his time in prison well, and has studied up on the law. He manages to terrify Bowden and his family and still remain within the confines of the law.Though Peck gets top billing, this is truly Robert Mitchum's film. He plays Cady with a swagger and menacing smile that is simply magnificent. We can see inside his swarthy confident charm and see the evil, menacing psychopath. The brilliance of the role is that we almost never see the violence that hides just behind the mask. Yet it seethes and oozes out, ready to strike at any time.J. Lee Thompson keeps the tension pumping throughout the 105 minute film. There is hardly a moment to relax before something else occurs to tense us right back up. Yet the tension doesn't come from boogie men jumping out from behind closets. It is a slow, boiling tension that tightens as we imagine just what might happen. When the climax finally does occur it is almost a let down. The censor at the time would not allow the type of action packed blood bath it does now, but the film doesn't suffer for it. What we get is plenty good, but is in the nature of the genre that the climax leads to the come down. But, the ride getting to that point, is well worth the time.Like this review?

		<fullReview>It's the smirk on Mitchum's face that broadcasts his evil intents. He starts mean and doesn't let up, and more amazingly, repeats few of his mannerisms from Night of the Hunter. We've seen Peck so often as Atticus Finch it is a shock when he accepts the advice of Savalas and Balsam and hires thugs. Until then, he has been his usual paragon of goodness. Lori Martin is so young and vulnerable that Mitchum's lusts really frighten us. A great thriller.The second version is very different, and not just because DeNiro plays one of his out of control freaks. In it, Scorcese introduces an element that Nolte and family bear some of the responsibility for Max Cady's rage. Little hints are thrown about the lawyer Sam may not have played fair, and as William Munny says, 'we all have it coming to us.' But this is not right for Cape Fear. It is strictly a good versus evil theme, and does not work as well once relativity is introduced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** 1962 ground-breaking film about how the law can be twisted to favor a vicious ex-convict at the expense of an innocent family as well as a number of innocent persons. Who end up falling victim to that borderline psychotic along the way. Robert Mitchum plays it slow and easy as ex-con Max Cady who was convicted in Baltimore for assault and battery because of assistant D.A Sam Bowden's, Gregory Peck, prosecution that put him behind bars for over eight years. Cady now out of jail after serving his time and self-educated in the law and the American Justice system is back and back for revenge against the man who took away his freedom. He's also after Sam's family his wife Peggy, Polly Bergen, and fourteen years old daughter Nancy, Lori Martin. Back then in 1962 like now the movie "Cape Fear" shows how the law can be manipulated by a cunning and dangerous psychopath when educated in the law and having just enough control of his emotions not to cross the line.Cady drives an innocent family almost insane with fear and to the point when the husband and father, Sam Bowden, of that family, who's also a lawyer, goes as far as trying to pay him off. When that didn't work Sam gets a number of thugs to beat and almost kill Cady where he himself can get disbarred or even put behind bars like the person who's threatening him once was."Cape Fear" is deliberately slow and at the same time effective as Cady spins his web and tightens his grip on the Bowden family. Cady methodically drives the Bowdens out of their home and even out of the state of Florida. The Bowdens Going into hiding in their house-boat in the swamps off Cape Fear North Carolina sets the stage for the movies tension packed and horrific final ending. The only thing that was a bit not true with the film was the ending itself. Cady went into his murderous mode where after he killed Sheriff's Deputy Kersek, Page Slattery, he attacked Peggy on the boat and had the piece of mind to blackmail her to have sex with him in order not for him to rape her daughter Nancy. Yet a moment later Cady went back to the boat-house where Nancy was, leaving Peggy alone and not sexually assaulting her, in order to do just that! rape her! Why didn't Cady do what he planned to do in the first place! Rape both mother and daughter to get even with their husband and father Sam who Cady was really after? The final scene was also a bit unrealistic when Sam had Cady helpless with a gun pointed to his head. Instead of killing Cady Sam gave him a long and boring speech about how he'll rot in jail for the rest of his life for his crimes unlike the eight years that he just spent there. Cady tells Sam to kill him and when Sam doesn't he just meekly waits for the police to come and take him away! Wouldn't death, like Cady just told him, be a lot better then rotting the rest of his life in jail? And why didn't Cady attack Sam and force him to shoot and kill him? Still "Cape Fear" is a near perfect crime/suspense drama that's as effective now as it was over forty years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In The Presence Of Vengeance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Mitchum plays Max Cady, a lowlife criminal who has been imprisoned for assault and battery of a woman. Gregory Peck plays Sam Bowden, a lawyer who has witnessed the crime and testified against Cady. Due to his prison sentence, Cady's wife leaves him. She also does not allow him any type of contact with his child. Cady blames this and his imprisonment on Bowden. He begins spending day after day contemplating how to ruin Bowden's life and cause him the same pain he has suffered. While in prison, Cady studies the law enough to know what rights he has and just how far to push the boundaries. After eight years in prison, Cady returns with full intent to have his revenge. The director J. Lee Thompson is trying to convey to the viewers that just because a criminal is tried, convicted, and served his sentence it is by no means to suggest that they are reformed into model citizens. In some cases this is possible, but revenge is a powerful emotion that can consume a person. Revenge can be so strong that it becomes a person's only reason for living, like in the case of Max Cady. Thompson has demonstrated that Cady was willing to break every law and commit any crime to satisfy his need for revenge. Thompson does an excellent job of making the viewers use their imagination. He implies to the audience what Cady will do to the Bowden family without giving a detailed description. Thompson urges the viewer to think the worst, but keeps things morally acceptable for the 1960s. The storyline had me on the edge of my seat trying to anticipate Cady's next move. I feel that the fear factor would have been lost had the film been done in color. This was a remarkable thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Mitchum was an excellent actor performing roles of villains and shameless people, and this film is a prove of it. Here you have Two giants of the big screen, Gregory Peck and Mitchum in a very exciting and unforgettable thriller, a classic one. Sam Bowden (Peck) was a good lawyer, father and husband, but always watched and bothered by Max Cady (Mitchum), who spent 8 years in jail because of attacking a woman and the testimony given by Bowden. So once Cady was free the revenge became his immediate objective. He was able to terrorize everyone in Bowden's family and succeeded until the end of the film. Mitchum was able to play a role of a sadist not having any mercy to his rival and family. Peck was the opposite, decent professional trapped by the past story with Cady. This film is one of the real classics of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mitchum is BRILLIANT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Mitchum was a fabulous film noir actor and was at his absolute best the 2 times he played the 'bad guy'. "Night of the Hunter" may have gotten him more acclaim, but he's at the total top of his career in this 1962 version of "Cape Fear". Every moment he is on screen in this film he is just electrifying. A brilliant villain performance. If you can see it at a revival theater so you'll see it on a big screen in the dark. Big Bob rules the film in every shot he's in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Cape Fear, starring Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck, is a classic suspense, much like the works of Alfred Hitchcock. Mitchum plays ex-con Max Cady, a deviant sadist who is out for his next victim: Sam Bowden (Played by Gregory Peck). You see, eight years ago, Sam Bowden got Cady arrested for a horrendous crime of rape. Now, Max Cady has been paroled, and gradually plays a game of cat and mouse with his arch-nemesis. To make things worse, Cady seems to be threatening to hurt Bowden's beloved daughter and wife. Fearing for his family, Sam relocates his family to Cape Fear River, and plots to catch the homicidal villain Cady in his own web. But, will it end up to be too late? Robert Mitchum gives an outstanding performance as this cigar smoking, Bowden hating maniac. Gregory Peck also gives a great performance as the benevolent lawyer. The rest of the cast is perfect also! Another thing I enjoyed about this classic film is that there isn't a whole lot of violance (Some horrific violence, but not a whole lot). I liked that the movie wasn't so much scary as it was suspenseful, right until the very end. I highly recommend this movie for fans of suspense. However, I do not recommend it for children under the age of...about 12 or 13. Excellent film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most suspenseful movie of the early 1960's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as suspense and sheer terror goes, nothing can surpass 'Cape Fear'. Even taking into account Psycho (and I'm a huge Hitchcock admirer), I believe this has the best tension and terror scenes that were ever produced. Before movies got too engulfed in gore and outright brutality, the directors relied on quick editing, great acting, startling visuals, and a good musical score to produce their suspense for them. 'Cape Fear' utilizes all of these. The cinematography is brilliant and sharp. Peck is very good in the title role, the girl who plays his daughter is excellent, and of course it is one of Robert Mitchum most memorable roles. It has some of the best suspense scenes of its time; the chase through the schoolhouse and of course the finale. The biggest help a suspense film can get is from its musical score. And there's none better than one of Bernard Herrmann's most memorable compositions (this from a man who composed for 'Vertigo', 'Citizen Kane', 'The Twilight Zone' TV series and of course 'Psycho').  All these add up to one of the best thrillers of its time and one that should not be remembered for its awful 90's remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Mitchum's greatest performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1962 version of "Cape Fear" has Robert Mitchum's greatest performance in it so it ranks high with me mostly for that reason. Mitch was never better than in his villainous role here, which is even better than his caricature role in "Night of the Hunter". The best moment in this film is when Mitchum confronts Bergen on the houseboat. There he stands bare chested and dripping with swamp water as he approaches the terrified Bergen in the darkness of the boat's cabin. When he tells her why she will let him have his way with her and she first says no, he gets furious and suddenly crushes a raw egg in his hand which runs down her bare shoulder. Very creepy, scary and menacing moment and Mitchum makes it *very* believable.</fullReview>

The remake of this film with DeNiro comes rushing at you and overpowers you with its soundtrack, its cinematography and its overall magnificence. But the original does not overpower.

Mitchum was a tremendously underrated actor who should have at least been nominated for an Academy Award. The other leads- Peck, Bergen and Balsam are also excellent.

		<fullReview>I had never seen the 1962 original Cape Fear until today, but have watched Scorsese's remake twice. Thompson's holds up really well--I was surprised at how chillingly menacing Robert Mitchum is and how much of the violence in DeNiro's characterization of Cady is right there in Mitchum's. Considering Thompson was working under the last vestiges of the Production Code, his film packs considerable punch. Scorsese certainly added dimensions to the story beyond the original, but the '62 is terrific noir!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Intense Thriller Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is simple enough: a dangerous ex-convict (Mitchum) moves to a friendly small town in order to terrorize and exact revenge upon the lawyer who put him behind bars for eight years (Peck) and his wife and young daughter.Cape Fear is a straightforward thriller, and let me tell you, is it ever thrilling. Quite simply, this is the single most intense, nail-biting, white-knuckle, edge-of-your-seat suspense film of all-time. But just what is it that makes Cape Fear so intense? Well, a couple of factors.First of all, the superb performances from Gregory Peck and, more importantly, Robert Mitchum. Peck plays the every-man, and he gives a solid performance all around. However, Mitchum is simply outstanding as the relentless villain. His character is already rather frightening, as he is not just a drooling lunatic, but a clever and ruthless fiend who is careful and meticulous in every detail of his diabolical schemes. Mitchum comes off as utterly cold-blooded, yet at the same time, gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as, after all, he is a villain with reason. He lost a wife. He lost a child. He lost eight years of his life. For a few moments here and there, the audience just may actually sympathize with him. However, this doesn't detract from the inhuman nature of his character. He is also not simply a brute, but something of a charismatic charmer. But after all, could Mitchum ever not be charming? Secondly, the plot, the pacing, and the direction. This is a rather tense story to begin with, but the intensity is augmented by the gut-wrenching pace at which the story unfurls. It is both exciting and scary to watch. By the time, the climax arrives, I can almost guarantee that the audience will be jumping around in their seats.The direction is not only extremely effective, but, for its time, very innovative and fresh, and it still holds up today. There is a tense raw and sexual energy to everything, and it's quite remarkable that the filmmakers got away some of the material this film contains back in 1962.And thirdly, everything is greatly enhanced by Bernard Herrmann's classic score. It really is the ideal soundtrack for a thriller. From slow build-ups to discordant, pounding climaxes, everything just falls into place perfectly.If you think you've been thrilled by movies before, think again. Watch Cape Fear, and get ready for a nail-biting experience in classic cinema.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Mitchum is evil personified in this mystery thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1962 film version of "Cape Fear" was shown in black and white; to use color might have distracted from the mood and tension-filled atmosphere of this film. Gregory Peck is the good guy, or hero, in the film, but the viewing audience will be constantly drawn to the truly great performance by Robert Mitchum, as a returning ex-con bent on extracting a path of revenge on Peck and his family.Mitchum plays Max Cady, a drifter who was sent to prison by the work of Sam Bowden, Peck's character. Cady has been released from prison and is determined to make Bowden pay for ruining his life, unwilling to admit that he caused his own problems. The back-and-forth meetings between Peck and Mitchum, and the tension caused by these confrontations, simply causes the audience to really squirm as Mitchum uses the legal means to cause Peck and his family to be in fear of their very existence. The Cape Fear river area in Carolina is the site designated for location for this film, and its creepiness, coupled with the swamp area that Peck takes his family to for safety, add to the suspense and tension that builds with each scene. The music score also grips the film, and each moment builds to the final climax, which takes place in the swampy river area aboard a floating houseboat.Cast-wise, Peck and Mitchum are ably supported by Martin Balsam, Polly Bergen, Jack Krushen, and with hair,sans lollipop Telly Savalas."Cape Fear" rates very high on the list of thrillers, and Mitchum simply conveys evil in every scene he is in. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Peck gets top billing, Cape Fear is really Robert Mitchum's film. Peck's Bowden is entirely predictable through no fault of the actor. That's just the way the character is written and was intended to be portrayed. Robert Mitchum is simply mesmerizing as his nemesis, Max Cady. He evokes the potential for malice and violence in every scene. His unpredicatability and the fact that his macabre actions are all suggested, not depicted, make him come across as all the more sinister. I'm a big fan of both stars and I must say I was very satisfied by this thriller. Strongly recommended, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge is a dish best eaten cold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake doesn't even come close to the standards set by this classic. I'm not going to go into the plot details, since they've all been well rehashed in previous reviews. I recently saw it on AMC after having not seen it in about 30 years, and I was absolutely riveted in my seat. Mitchum was superb -- chilling in his portrayal of an ex-con with his mind set on one goal -- revenge. Having worked as a corrections officer, I can assure you that there are many people like him in the corrections system. They are real, they are in prison, and they are biding their time for release, just as Max Cady did in the film. I know Mitchum did a little jail time for marijuana, but I don't know how he got the mannerisms of a con down so well. Just watch the scene when he first gets released, and checks out a woman walking down the street. Those sleepy old eyes of his ain't missing a thing. And when he's watching Gregory Peck's daughter on the dock, he looks like an alligator examining his next meal. I'll buy the comparisons with "Night of the Hunter" (another classic, and God help the S.O.B. who tries a remake of that one). When it comes to playing stone-cold psychotics, Mitchum dusts all the imitators. Who needs Hannibal Lecter? To wrap it all up, a great story from John MacDonald, strong direction, superb cinematography and a solid cast. Watch this one on the all-night movie channel and you won't be going to sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking Degeneracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I just love it. I have it on tape and watched it routinely with my young kid, which gives you some idea of the range of its appeal. No thinking allowed in this one! Thinking is not exactly against the law here, but it's against your best interests. The world, you see -- are you taking notes? The world is divided into good and evil, just as our elected officials keep telling us. On the one side we have "evil empires" and "evil doers" and on the other side we have "freedom" and "democracy" and nobody wears a garter belt under his trousers. The good and the evil in "Cape Fear" belong to this digital universe. Nobody is better than Gregory Peck and his bourgeois family, which is composed of Polly Bergen (who comes from "tough pioneer stock") and daughter Lori Martin (who is too "good" to be true). He's Sam Bowdin here, Citizens, an upright small-townish lawyer and loving family man who works on his boat during weekends. The evil is represented by Mitchum, a slimy hoarse-voiced cunning muscular reptilian presence who absolutely makes the movie. What a job he does! And it's not a reprise of his "preacher" in "Night of the Hunter" either. He's equally rotten here but gives his filthiness quite a different spin. Mitchum may have been an instinctive actor, but when his instincts were right, as they were in this case, nobody did a better job. Peck and his family are stumped. Mitchum comes to haunt them because Peck was instrumental in sending him to "the bucket" eight years ago for "assaulting" a woman in a parking lot. Mitchum has anticipated and is now able to block every legal move that Peck makes to protect himself and his brood. Peck's friend, Martin Balsam as the sheriff, helps as much as he can, even operating in what our current president referred to in his comments on modern accounting procedures as "a kind of gray area." There's nothing more I can do, says the sheriff. I can't arrest a man before he does something wrong. "Now would you want it any other way, Sam?" (Mitchum has already killed the family dog which, in movies like this, is worse than killing another human being, but there isn't enough evidence.) Sam evidently thinks this problem over and decides, well, yes, I think I would want it another way. He hires a private investigator (Telly Savalis) who doesn't help much, but who suggests yet a farther step away from moral rectitude -- hire some bullies to beat Mitchum's eyeballs in. That doesn't work either. All of this leads, by means I won't bother to go into, to a final confrontation in a swamp on the Cape Fear River involving murder, rape, beatings, breaking and entering, pedophilia, ping pong, and first-degree bad manners.This original version is a lot better than Scorcese's remake, despite the borrowing of Bernard Hermann's effictively ominous score. In the remake, good and evil are not nearly so cut and dried. That prompts the viewer to think about the plot. Why is Juliet Lewis attracted enough to Robert DeNiro's bad guy to let him finger her mouth? What in the Gol Danged world is going on here? Why take such a simple-minded fairy tale and infuse it with such complexity? It's like turning Hansel and Gretl into incestuous siblings.The movie is extremely well laid out and well acted. The right-wing propaganda hurts my ears sometimes, though. Mitchum gets an ACLU-type lawyer on his team -- Jack Kruschen, a great character actor. "You know the type, Sam" says Balsam -- "Slap a cigarette out of some hoodlum's mouth and he's down here hollering about police brutality." In my opinion, Kruschen's character belongs down there when cops start slapping guys around. As far as that goes, Kruschen is the only character in the movie who plays it strictly legal and who is up front about everything -- no lying, no traps, no selfish motives, no dirty pool at all. Towards the climax he makes moves against Peck to see if he can't be disbarred or whatever it is that is supposed to happen to you when you hire a bunch of street rats to clobber someone who is legally innocent. It's never clear exactly how Ol' Sam gets out of that. The issue is swept aside, as it should be in a movie designed to stifle thought. But if you can get past the fact that this movie is some kind of fascist's wet dream, you may like it as much as I do. It has one marvelously tense scene after another. My favorite is when Peck and Mitchum are sitting in a bar and Mitchum lays out his reasons for wanting revenge as well as his plans for how he's going to go about getting it -- "You evah heah of the death of a thousand cuts, Counselor?" Interrupting the byplay to ask the waiter, "You got any of them peanuts still in the shell, without the salt?" If you haven't seen this yet, you really ought to. Watch it with your children, those too young to understand that there is some sort of middle ground between good and evil that all of us occupy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mitchum's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I think Gregory Peck is a better and more versatile actor than Robert Mitchum. But Mitchum was almost always very good, and here I believe he exceeds Peck. I would go so far as to say that this may be Robert Mitchum's masterpiece.But unlike a painting, a film masterpiece requires the efforts of many, and I must give equal credit to director J. Lee Thompson and screenwriter James Webb. They prepared the canvas and the paints, then Mitchum and Peck painted the picture.Peck as the lawyer-father whose family is threatened by Mitchum was perfect for the role, and plays the role to perfection. But it's Mitchum who steals the show. And what I admire most about this film is the director kept Mitchum's performance realistic and believable, instead of over-the-top, which would be a real temptation in a suspense film like this. And the reason it works better is that Mitchum seems even more calculating when things are kept more psychological than violent. That's not to say there's not violence here, but, for the most part, the suspense builds slowly to a violent (and logical) conclusion.For Mitchum's character, the task is to portray an obsession for revenge. AND Mitchum plays it as if his character knows everything will work out, he just has to plot things out carefully. On the other hand, Peck's character's motivation is the upstanding man having to go dirty to protect his family. He doesn't like it, but it's the only way he can accomplish his goal. Because he plays it deviously smart instead of violent, the role is more creepy.By halfway through the film we all know the outcome. The question is how will it all go down? Upon its release in 1962, this was a controversial film due to its sensationalism. Take the first murder scene by drowning...creepy. And, of course, the film is full of sexual tension as Mitchum stalks Peck's wife (well played by Polly Bergen), and even more so his teen-aged daughter (Lori Martin). And, perhaps I'm wrong, but in the scene where he is preparing to rape Polly Bergen, I could swear Mitchum had significantly more hair on his chest than in several earlier scenes. Very interesting.While I like this general type of suspense film, I would rarely give such a film more than a "7", but on the strength of Mitchum's and Peck's performance, this one gets an "8".</fullReview>

Sam also has a beautiful wife (Polly Bergen) and a 10 year old girl named Nancy (Lori Martin) who Cady seems VERY interested in.Unpleasant but gripping thriller. Beautifully directed in stark black and white by J. Lee Thompson this film slowly creeps up on you and never lets up. Peck, Bergen and Martin are great in their roles but Mitchum is downright terrifying in his. The scenes where he stalks Nancy are almost unbearable to watch. There's nothing explicit in the film but the direction and acting tells you everything you need to know. Superb score by Bernard Herrmann too. Martin Scorsese remade this in 1991 but upped the violence and sexual content and added blood and gore that was more disgusting than thrilling. Stick with this. Surprisingly this was not a hit when it was released but it's not considered a classic thriller. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cape Fear (1962): Dir: J. Lee Thompson / Cast: Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, Martin Balsam, Telly Savalas, Polly Bergen: Shocking thriller about the dwelling of fear and paranoia. Gregory Peck stars as a happily married lawyer whose life is interrupted when Max Cady re-enters his life. He was the testimonial witness that jailed Cady for eight years for abusing a young woman. Now Cady spies on Peck and his family, even going so far to stalk his daughter after school. He even poisons their dog but without any detection. Peck goes to the police but Cady remains just inside the law. Terrific setup that builds tension right up to its rousing climax. Director J. Lee Thompson delivers nail-biting results. Robert Mitchum portrays Cady as a repulsive animal who will stop at nothing short of retaliation. He remains a threat despite any odds thrown his way including three thugs hired to beat him up. Peck displays desperation as the threat nears. He ponders his resources even at the cost of the law, but will ultimately have to deal with this himself. The supporting roles lack greater dimension. Martin Balsam plays a police chief who issues standard advice, and Telly Savalas plays a detective who does the routine. Polly Bergen plays Peck's wife who is afraid for her husband and daughter and attempts to bring reason to the chaos. Shows fear in its extremes and our sacrifice of innocence to wash away its existence. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lawyer Sam Bowden's life becomes torturous when Max Cady re-enters his life, after going to jail for 8 years when Bowden testified that Cady attacked a young woman. Now that Cady has been released, he begins to terrorise Bowden and his family, particularly targeting Bowden's daughter, Nancy. Initially, Cady uses his newfound knowledge of the law, to annoy the Bowdens, but then poisons the family dog.......It's a difficult one this. I was at an age where an '18' certificate movie was like a treasure chest full of forbidden fruits, and when Scorcese's remake was released, I was 14 years old, and just getting into my lifelong love of the cinema.Plus, it was 1992, and trying to source the original wasn't as easy as it is today thanks to streaming, DVD, and other media, so this film went begging for a while.So watching this, without comparing the two is extremely difficult, because core scenes are almost identical, but this film has a lot more depth, and Peck and Mitchum are more desperate, more emotionally charged than De Niro and Nolte, and after seeing this, the remake feels more like an exploitation piece, enabling Scorcese to experiment with cameras and filters.The camera-work here is wonderful, and adds more to the mise en scene, particularly the scene where Cady goes to attack Bowdens daughter,the camera is used in a way to emphasise Cadys intimidating figure, almost making him giant like, whereas she is made to look almost mouse like.Regarding the ending, its a much, much satisfying ending than the remake, and the boat scene is far more tense, as Sam is not on the boat when Cady infiltrates it.So again, it's proof that a classic film cannot be remade as a better piece, no matter who is involved. Having said that, I still like the original, if only for its experimental camera work, and exploitation element.</fullReview>

Whilst not as violent or glossy as the remake this is a superior film due mainly to the acting ability of the cast. Robert Mitchum was a superb actor and genuinely chilling in this as the psychopathic Max Cady who wages war on the man who sent him down. Gregory Peck is a bit wooden but Polly Bergen is good as the mom and I preferred the more vulnerable Lori Martin to Juliette Lewis's 1991 version of the daughter. It's even got Terry Savalas in it for good measure.

He shows his anger his impulse as well as his courage, all of which are what a real world man should react when he come across the same situation. His foe Max also deserves applaus. Maybe he is a good man in reality or maybe not as an badass as he played in the picture. What I want to say is that Max you are indeed an asshole. I will have no idea but kill him only if I met a badass as him.Another thing found from the film is that the law sometimes is really useless. At beginning I had kinds of ideas to deal with the guy, however along with the movie, none of the ideas worked. Police have no idea, law can not fetch the badass even sometime it protects him. So my last idea is let him disappear in other word kill him. I heard that in American if you shoot a guy in your house or you yard, you don't need to pay anything by law. Similarly, Sam made a trap for Max and wanted to kill him out of law. Not everything went good, to make the film more attractive, Sam chose a cape to set the trap which I think is a very stupid idea, but this time it works.It's not a trill one if you just watch it as a movie, however you cannot fall asleep if you bring it to reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cape Fear is in North Carolina, so how did this movie end up being set in Georgia? I know the exteriors were filmed in Savannah, but Wilmington would have worked just as well (it's a center for film production today and doesn't look radically different from Savannah). In the scene where Sam Bowden is supposed to fly to Atlanta for his disbarment hearing, he should be on a plane to Raleigh. The Bowdens' boat's license should begin with NC instead of GA.On another note, don't forget that this was not the last time Robert Mitchum and Polly Bergen worked together; they would play husband and wife in "The Winds Of War" miniseries some two decades hence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cape Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greats often borrow from the greats. With just as much skill and style, J. Lee Thompson directs a nail-biter with obvious influence from Hitchcock, and there is a repeated musical phrase that propels one scene transition, which bears a striking resemblance to John Williams' shark theme from his score for Jaws. The only element in Cape Fear that is more menacing than Herrmann's score is the Max Cady character, played so convincingly by Robert Mitchum. Cady has strolled into town after shedding an eight-year prison sentence for which he blames lawyer Sam Bowden, who testified as a witness to Cady's crime against an innocent woman. Gregory Peck plays Bowden with his usual upstanding strength and conviction. Polly Bergen plays Bowden's wife, Peggy, and Lori Martin plays his daughter, Nancy. Both women deliver realistically superb performances. Their terror is as convincing as Mitchum's depiction of Cady's cool, calculating wrath and utter disregard for anything wholesome or decent. That disregard, as filtered through the magnetic, prismatic persona of Max Cady, becomes a mixed source of sociopathic repulsion and base, animalistic attraction. Cady threatens with a glint in his eye. When we first meet Cady, he is making his way through town toward the courthouse. Up the steps to the entrance, he nearly wrenches his neck checking out the rear end of a woman walking by. Inside, an unmasked look on his face reveals pure disdain for this building and everything it represents. He makes his way up another flight of stairs, this time past a woman who drops a stack of books, and he doesn't miss a step?not even a flicker of altruistic consideration. In a world of rules and laws, political correctness, and social posturing, that sort of naked, individualistic honesty is refreshing, like an open icebox on a hot, Summer day; but stand there long enough, and eventually you'll feel a chill. Scarier than a scoundrel after your family is one with an intellect. We discover that during his prison stay, Cady studied the law, and he plans to use it against Bowden. In the face of Bowden's dour pontificating and as the game of one-upmanship escalates, we almost find ourselves rooting for Cady to exact his ironic revenge, as he deflects even lawless acts of deterrence from the lawman?until we reach the final showdown, discover Cady's twisted plan, and realize of what evil he is really made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cape Fear is directed by J.Lee Thompson,produced by it's lead star Gregory Peck,features a spine tingling score by Bernard Herrmann and is based on the novel The Executioners by John D.MacDonald. The film stars Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, Telly Savalas, Polly Bergen, Lori Martin and Martin Balsam.Cape Fear raises good questions about how much the law really protects the innocent from the guilty,and if the guilty have more rights at times than those they persecute.In Robert Mitchum's Max Cady one of the screens most terrifying villains was born,a boogie-man who really could exist and won't stop until he has what he want's.Mitchum single handedly steals the film with his menacing portrayal of a man with no moral code who will do anything,even to the innocent.However Peck gives a fine performance too as an inoffensive man driven to extremes to stop a madman destroying his life.If the film has a weak point it's Lori Martin,she does her best however Thompson himself admitted he wanted Hayley Mills for the role.When she wasn't available he kept thinking how she would have approached the role and rather neglected Lori's performance.Mild mannered family man Sam Bowden(Gregory Peck)is a small-town Lawyer,who's worst nightmare comes true when a dangerous criminal he helped put away called Max Cady(Robert Mitchum)is released from prison.Cady starts stalking and threatening Sam and his family,beautiful wife Peggy(Polly Bergen)and young daughter Nancy(Lori Martin).Despite help from the local Police Chief Mark Dutton(Martin Balsam)and later a Private Detective(Telly Savalas)Sam is legally powerless to do anything about Cady.Finally Sam must take matters into his own hands and lead Cady into a trap on the Cape Fear River(a real location discovered by Peck).It all leads to one of the most suspenseful,edge of your seat confrontations ever filmed.Martin Scorcese filmed a successful remake in the early 90's with Nick Nolte as Bowden and Robert DiNero as Cady.It's very scary and worth watching. Sadly the violence and sexual element has been pushed front and centre and that overwhelms the film and it lacks the genuine chills of this version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that this is much better than the Scorsese remake, it is more rich and deep and Gregory Peck is the perfect actor for this role, as he showed in To Kill a Mockingbird (very similar role). With this film his brilliance strikes through, with its really rich dialogue and story. This is why you can see they made a remake, to utilise this brilliant story, of stalking and endangerment.This film is one of those many that is way better than the remake, in fact I cant think of any film that is better as a remake at this time.Brilliant directing and acting by all of the cast to fully throw you into the mood of the family and the problems and frustration caused by such a savvy and dangerous man.A clear 7 1/2 out of 10.</fullReview>

He's just out of jail after 8 years and wants revenge on the guy who testified against him (Gregory Peck, tight-assed as ever). But no simple revenge like beating him up or even murder, he wants to torment his family, especially his young daughter. He first confronts Peck in the parking lot after work one day and declares his intentions, then proceeds to show up watching the family all over town. He doesn't do anything, just shows up where the family is and keeps them on edge.What can they do about it? Can't run him out of town or have him arrested without actual crimes being committed, so he just keeps on tormenting them by showing up here and there and promising lewd things, like the skin-crawling scene at the marina where he all but says he's going to rape the 12-year old! Wild, ugly stuff for 1962. Mitchum carries the movie but the premise is a great one. J. Lee Thompson almost out-Hitchcocks Hitchcock here with a razor sharp psychological thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peck, Mitchum are at the top of their games here. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Mitchum's vengeful, sadistic ex-con stalking Peck and his family throughout the movie, their moves and counter-moves, as well as the finale in the swamp. It's tense, exciting, violent, believable for it's time and place.Nice to see familiar faces like Oliver Platt, Telly Savalas, Bergen and Martin Balsam in here too. There's enough menace, pseudo-Hitchockian suspense and location filming to push this over the top.Only debits? Well--it'd prob. have been easier to simply find and knockoff Mitchum if Peck had wanted to badly enough, instead of only trying the one time, and it does tend to drag in the second half. But considering just how well this plays even 50 years later--well you know. It's certainly worth watching and the pluses far outweigh the minuses.*** outta ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here comes Team Hitchcock....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to begin by saying that I started building my film library years ago and along with Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, Double Indemnity etc...Cape Fear was one of my first additions. This film, full of all the right ingredients(some are planned and some are not), stands out as one of the best thriller/dramas of the 60s. Now there were plenty in the 40s and 50s especially with the likes of Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity, Sunset Blvd. etc.. and Alfred Hitchcock's many unforgettable thrillers like Vertigo, Strangers on a Train, Shadow of a Doubt, Dial M for Murder, North by Northwest, Notorious, Rebecca, etc.. However once the 1960s came along there weren't quiet as many film noir type dramas as in the previous two decades. Now I'm not forgetting the film that started the 60's off with a bang: Psycho.. and I am very aware of all( and I do mean all) of the great dramas of the 60's but Cape Fear still stands out as one of the best of its time.To begin Greg Peck who was producing at the time came up with a great title/name change and the novel The Executioners became the film Cape Fear. Peck while working on the Guns of Navarone took a liking to J. Lee Thompson's direction and asked him to direct Cape Fear. From that point on the team just got better and better. Here comes Team Hitchcock.... Bernard Herman who had scored more than a half dozen Hitchcock films was on board for the score. Next an art direction great and collaborator of Hitchcock Bob Boyle was hired. Then one of the best editors in film history, and once again a friend and collaborator of Hitchcock, George Tomasini was going to be the editor of Cape Fear. What a team! Now there are many other connections to Hitchcock through this film. For instance J. Lee Thompson had worked as an assistant on a film with Hitchcock many years ago(pre Rebecca). Also Thomas Tuttle who was the make-up artist on Cape Fear was the brother of one of Hitchcocks main make-up men William Tuttle. There were also actors like Martin Balsam that had worked for Hitchcock before(Psycho). So anyway all of these connections are probably part of the reason this film screams "This is an Alfred Hitchcock film".I am not going to go very far into the plot other than to mention its a great story. Greg Peck plays a very believable lawyer in a small southern town who has testified 8 or so yrs earlier against Mitchum (Cady). This Max Cady (Mitchum) never forgot and is now out of prison and ready to exact all of the pain and years of suffering on Peck and his family. Let the thrills begin in this Hitchcockian style Drama. As Max Cady begins his evil game of cat and mouse we find out when he is picked up by the local police that he has been studying the very law that put him behind bars and is more than prepared for his frightening hunt. What will happen next? This film will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat and I regard it as one of my all-time favorite thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mitchum's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can just imagine that in 1962, 'Cape Fear' was considered one of the most suggestive and, in some corners, obscene films of the year. Even by today's jaded standards, it still packs a wallop and Robert Mitchum's Max Cady is just as evil, sadistic and threatening as ever. It is as magnificent a portrayal of a thoroughly corrupt, cold-blooded and heartless individual as has been seen in the history of cinema. Cady is out to seek revenge on Sam Bowden, whose testimony was crucial to Cady's spending eight years in prison for assaulting a woman. Bowden is played by Gregory Peck; the two stars provide a wonderful contrast in acting styles, just as their characters are poles apart in their world views. Peck's Bowden is pretty much a straight arrow, a somewhat stiff, by-the-book attorney with a wife and preteen daughter. The brilliant film composer Bernard Hermann adds much to the film's tension with his moody, eerie score which is punctuated by staccato 'stingers' at dramatic points, sounding at times like his work for Hitchcock's 'Psycho.' Cady's initial intimidation (vague comments, menacing looks) are characterized by Bowden as a "war of nerves," but that turns out to be wishful thinking. We first realize just how ruthless Cady is when he kills the Bowden's dog by poisoning it. And Cady is not only ruthless, he's smart. He studied law while in prison and is always certain not to get caught doing anything illegal. (Were people really routinely run out of town for vagrancy?) Like Hannibal Lecter, there is an aura of almost superhuman invincibility about him... he never makes mistakes; he disappears like a ghost just before the police arrive. Even three hardened thugs that Bowden hires to rough up Cady are no match for him; he singlehandedly lands all three of them in the hospital. As the film progresses, it becomes clear (as clear as a major studio pic in 1962 can make it) that Max Cady intends to sexually assault Bowden's daughter, Nancy, then force her parents to either drop the charges or have the young girl testify against him in court, which he knows they will never do. This leads Bowden to a desperate plan to trap Cady on a houseboat on the Cape Fear river, lure the ex-convict there and kill him before he realizes his ambition. This is an exciting and uncompromising thriller with some genuinely disturbing undertones. Robert Mitchum set the modern standard for realistically creepy villains that few have matched and none have surpassed since. --------------------------- Additional comment- The article in Wikipedia about 'Cape Fear' makes the ludicrous assertion that Peck and Mitchum are physically mismatched... in Peck's favor! This is ridiculous. Peck is tall, yes, but gangly, stiff, in every way the physically nonthreatening bookworm-ish attorney who is totally out of his league going up against the beefy brawler Mitchum. In a real stand-up fight, Mitchum would murder Peck, literally. If any part of the movie defies belief, it is the fight scene at the end. The Wiki article also claims that the movie came under criticism because the roles were miscast... Peck should have played Cady, and Mitchum the attorney. Again, what was this writer smoking? What a mind-bogglingly stupid comment. Peck is spot on as Bowden, the family man, and need I even say Mitchum is perfection as the evil Max Cady.</fullReview>

But when he was released he constantly follows and occasionally interferes the layer and his family's private life. Peck's little daughter is in a giant danger as she is the most vulnerable.In its genre, this film's second half is my favourite, especially the part at night at the wooden house at the lake. That was the creepiest 20 minutes I have ever experienced.My judgement is an easy 10 OUT OF 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gregory Peck is again the ethical lawyer, with his family being menaced by a former convict who is now on the loose. Max Cady (Robert Mitchun) feels that he was wrongly imprisoned for eight years. He was guilty of several violent crimes against women, although his offenses are referred to by innuendo, due to film censors at this time.Several of the scenes, which we see in a noir film are noteworthy; the scene where Mitchum is at the bowling alley watching Lori Martin. Max Cady intends to torture the prosecutor (Peck) and his family. Just how far he may go is something which keeps the audience in suspense.The setting of South Carolina as a backdrop is also effective. The hanging moss and cypress trees, a canopy of intrigue. Lori Martin as the young daughter is terrorized as well.Robert Mitchum underplays the menacing character Max Cady. His rage and contempt for people is just simmering under the surface: one terrifying scene involves a woman he brings home from a bar, he says nothing, we know what he will do by the dark look on his face.This is required viewing for anyone who enjoys noir and suspense films. A must see. 9/10.</fullReview>

Bergen is the wholesome wife. The familiar cast also includes Balsam as a police chief and Savalas (with hair) as a PI. However, the film belongs to Mitchum and he has field day playing the cool, creepy ex-con who is relentless in his pursuit.

		<fullReview>This psycho-thriller based on John MacDonald novel titled ¨The executioners¨ concerns about Max Cady an ex-con excellently played by Robert Mitchum ,he accuses a Southern advocate,a magnificent Gregory Peck,for his eight years imprisoned and schemes a malevolent vengeance on his wife(Polly Bergen) and daughter(Lori Martin).Peck is helped by the chief Inspector(Martin Balsam) and he hires an astute detective(Telly Savallas)to watch him.Meanwhile Mitchum plays to cat and mouse with his family which is increasingly menaced.The film contains psychological characterization ,grisly triller,tense situations, and is pretty entertaining.It's brilliant,atmospheric and slickly developed,almost a masterpiece.Major asset are the continuous suspense and marvellous acting. Casting is frankly awesome with exceptional performances,especially by Robert Mitchum as a wacko with ominous purports. Musical score by the master Bernard Herrmann with a similar style from Hitchcock music films.Sensational black and white cinematography by Sam Leavitt.The motion picture is finely directed by J.Lee Thomson (Guns of Navarone,McKenna's gold),a good filmmaker,though in his final career, he only directed Charles Bronson vehicles(Ten to midnight,Newman law,St Ives).The film was remade by Martin Scorsese,an inferior remake with secondaries appearance by Mitchum,Peck and Martin Balsam. It's a must see for Mitchum and Peck fans.The film is one of the best thrillers from the 60s.Rating : Better than average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scary movie with little remorse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made all the way back in 1961 (says so in the ending credits), this classic thriller starred Gregory Peck as lawyer Sam Bowdon, and Robert Mithum as nasty ex-con Max Cady. Back in 1953, Sam help send Max to jail for the brutal assault of a young girl. Now, eight years later, Max is freed, and plans to harass and destroy the family of the man who sent him to the bucket.He targets Sam's teenage daughter, but there is nothing Sam can do to protect his family, as Max works around the law to stay out of trouble but yet continue harassing the family. He drops to his lowest when he kills the family dog, and bashes up a local woman to prove to Sam what he is capable of doing. Sam finally decides to move his family to the Cape Fear swamp, and hope to catch Max as he tries to get through to his wife Peggy and daughter Nancy.There is indeed quite a lot of suspense in this film. The scenes where young Nancy thinks she's being chased after Cady through her own school is terrifying. Although to me, her voice sounded like Minnie Mouse however, although she is very lovely like her mother, Peggy. But the real climax is when Nancy is trapped alone in a house with Cady after he had a go at Peggy on the houseboat... it's during scary times like this that you would expect even a quiet, dignified actor like Gregory Peck to suddenly barge into the scene and destroy this Cady for once and for all!It is well crafted, scary and undoubtedly post-noir. Peck was a little boring with his wooden character Sam, the goody goody of the film, whilst Mitchum is very good as the nasty, leering cigar smoker slithering around Peck's life like a snake. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wet Guns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read over several comments on this movie and I just wanted to say one thing to those of you who are unfamiliar with a particular subject. Wet Guns. Mostly all current guns and revolvers in particular are totally mechanical devices. So water would not affect them in the least unless they have been submerged for a considerable length of time where rust would form and that would take while , not the quick dip experienced in this movie. Also, most modern ammunition is sealed very well. Again the quick dip would probably not affect their function although they are more susceptible to being immersed than guns. Bullets are in the course of manufacture subjected to light oil and when guns are cleaned they are also lightly oiled, which would repel water. Personally I would not attack a person with a wet gun. The movies are the only place where wet weapons don't fire. Of course this does not refer to Westerns(with paper cartridges) and films that involve older firearms like flintlocks where open powder was used. The gun in Cape Fear looked like a fairly up to date 38 caliber. I also don't believe Peck would beat Mitchum in a fight- but the dynamic is interesting. The psychotic versus the head of the house fighting for his family. I was a cop, and I can tell that both are formidable opponents and greatly motivated. Perhaps on that factor alone the father would win.</fullReview>

Not intent to take the low road, the antagonist in this film uses the law in his favor and makes Peck break the law to protect his family. While the remake may be a scarier film for our times it does not diminish the action in this film.Try to see both films starting with this one. You may feel that this is the better film...since it was first and also consider the time in which it was made...it may have actually been scarier.

		<fullReview>This was a amazingly hold on to your seat thriller that the modern thrillersmodeled after IMHO. Great acting by Robert Mitchum (ex-con out get revengeon wholesome family) especially. Gregory Peck was supposed to be the topbilling actor in this chiller thriller (as prosecution lawyer), but Mitchum seemed take the cake his role while in prison bid his time studying law based when he got released was able to challenge the police first time they took him in for questioning. The best part is that fact that this was still B&amp;W without modern film making techniques more scary effects to the movie, like "Nightmare On ElmStreet," Scream," built their successes on. This 60's classic, relied more on actors skills to create characters depth and great music score made it morerealistic. The remake with the great Robert De Niro as ex-con psychotic really must of studied Mitchums role added more PASSION to the role. Both originaland remake stand on their own MERIT. One keeps in mine the older movies inmy opinion, were more limited as far as film making, yet JUST AS GRIPPING asremake. Remake since I seen first, 10x over more scary. One word sum up thisclassic is in the title, FEAR!!!! Telly Savalas also in this cast, not too familiar with rest of cast though good acting roles, nor J.Lee Thompson as director but did fine job with this classic. 9/10 I give it, don't miss the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great suspense classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"...Max Cady doesn't make idle threats."This is quite a remarkable film. Quite possibly one of the best thrillers I've seen, right up there with other great 1960's thriller classics like Psycho, Repulsion, Wait Until Dark, ect. I've seen on other comments of this movie people comparing this movie to its remake in the early 1990's. Well, I haven't seen that one yet, but I'm glad. I believe that it is good, most of the time, to watch the original before you see a remake. Can you imagine watching the remake of Psycho before seeing the original? How unfortunate that would be. I do plan on watching the remake, however, it sounds like it could be good. But as far as the original goes, it's excellent. My rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen and heard countless times that the remake has the better version, but the groundwork for the violence was already laid down long ago.The original was in an age of censorship. Don't get me wrong. DeNiro &amp; Scorcese get my accolades for GoodFellas, Casino, and a host of others, but they lose out to Mitchum on this one, hands down. NO competition.Consider, it's 1962 and Mitchum blurts out to Peck the daughter is looking every bit as "juicy" as the wife!Mitchum plays cat and mouse with Peck all through the movie. You're that close to screaming at Peck to get a backbone! I disagree with another comment that in the early 60's, the law was not "fine-tuned" enough to deal with a Cady. If you know how to proscecute properly, you could slow him down considerably.After watching this movie and noticing Peck's forays into Liberal politics (Bork), I nod in understanding how Bowden (Peck) looks so inept in handling Cady (Mitchum). This is even more true of Nolte.Mitchum plays not only a monster with delightful ease, he gives us an early picture of a very effective terrorist mindset. And that, more than anything, should give you the creeps!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Thriller of the 1960s!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never seen the remake, but when I saw the original with Peck and Mitchum - at the end of the movie, all I could say was: "Incredible!"Okey, for those who don't know the plot, I'll tell you. It goes like this:Max Cady [Robert Mitchum] is a ex-convict who had just been released from prison. After his release, he follows the very man who helped send him off to prison for the raping of a girl -- a shrewd, smart, and very happy lawyer named Sam Bowdon [Gregory Peck]. Bowdon is stopped by Cady after a case he was involved in, and Cady starts a rather menacing conversation with him, beganing with the words: "Hello, Consular; 'member me?"Later that night, Bowdon, who has forgotten his encounter with Cady, goes to a bowling alley with his beautiful, kind wife Peggy (Polly Bergan), and lovely, innocent, teenaged daughter Nancy (Lori Martin). He spots Cady there, again, and rings up Chief Marc Dutton (Martin Balsm) for help. But it appears that Cady can't be arrested, for he has learned about the Law while in prison, and won't be arrested for anything!First, he poisons the family dog Marilyn, rapes a whore to prove his "animal power" to the Bowdons, and then becomes interested in the sexually-unexperienced Nancy. The Bowdons move to a houseboat in Cape Fear River, but Cady tracks them down... what happened next? You'll have to see the film to find out!To me, it's the best thriller of the 1960s!! No thriller in that decade could have been better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nightmarish Mitchum One-Man Show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing I found truly impressive about the (slightly overrated) "The Night of the Hunter" was the supremely evil performance of Robert Mitchum? And he does it again here! Although "Cape Fear" definitely isn't a masterpiece in terms of scripting or concept originality, Mitchum almost single-handedly boosts up the overall quality level of the film with his mesmerizing performance. His legendary villainous character Max Cady is almost too despicable, disturbing and hateful to put into words. He's an intelligent and controlled psychopath, but also an immoral misogynist and pervert. The tension and anguish increases with 200% every single time he appears in a sequence and his charisma and evil ideas pretty much embody the deepest fears of every normal human being on this planet. Robert Mitchum truly was a terrific actor and he played villainous roles like no other actor ever could (and they probably didn't even dare to play the roles Mitchum did). The plot of "Cape Fear" is, as stated already, rather rudimentary and straightforward. Max Cady stalks and extracts vengeance on the honorable attorney Sam Bowden and his model family, as his testimony sentenced Cady to an 8 year prison sentence for assault. During his stay in jail, Cady didn't just develop a profound hatred against Sam Bowden; he also practiced law studies and thus always comes up with frustratingly intelligent ways to terrorize the Bowden family, yet without ever doing something illegal. And when Max Cady does commit a crime, like physically assailing a naive young girl, he makes sure that she's too petrified to testify against him. Cady's non-stop malfeasance and intimidating presence force Sam Bowden ? usually a firm believer in the juridical system ? to take matters into his own hand. The script of "Cape Fear" is adapted from a novel with the deliciously enticing title "The Executioners". I haven't read the book myself, but I imagine that author John D. MacDonald was more than satisfied with the transfer of his story to film, and particularly pleased with how his relentless main character became personified in the shape of Robert Mitchum. Of course, I cannot claim that the brilliance of "Cape Fear" entirely relies on Robert Mitchum exclusively? Although very simplistic, the plot remains captivating at all times equally thanks to the eerie Southern Bayou filming locations (you can practically feel the heat and smell the characters' sweat) and Bernard Herrmann's unsettling and pounding musical score. Director J. Lee Thompson, also infamous for nearly a dozen of brainless but excessively violent Charles Bronson action vehicles, delivers here what is unquestionably his most stylish and integer accomplishment. Gregory Peck is also outstanding, but sadly the roles of Polly Bergen (as the wife) and Lori Martin (as the daughter) are somewhat pushed to the background. I guess it wasn't yet the era for profound and forceful female protagonists. Their roles, as well as various other minor sub plots, are far more elaborated in the 1991 Martin Scorsese remake. "Cape Fear" is a definite suspense thriller must see classic and ? once again ? Robert Michum's performance is one that you're not likely to forget for as long as you live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mitchem's best performance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Mitchem as Max Cady gives one of his finest performances in the original Cape Fear. It is hard not to compare Mitchem's performance to that of De Niro in the remake. De Niro is good, but in comparison - Mitchem is far more menacing and threatening. Mitchem is incredibly handsome and at his physical peak in this film. Whilst our hero Sam (Gregory Peck) is dressed in dark colours, Cady is dressed mostly in white with a fedora pushed back off his face. Mitchem plays him with a curious mix of charm and menace. This is added to by the score - the typical thriller score filled with strings. However, frequently when Cady is on screen the music changes to upbeat jazz (for example, when Sam's daughter is in the car and spots Cady following her. Every performance from the girl Cady beats up to Sam's daughter is impeccable. Both Mitchem and Peck give quietly restrained performances which sets an atmosphere of high tension. And the cinematography of flat greys is amazing. This is a film where less is more - this should have been the template for the thriller genre. More thrillers like this please!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My introduction to CAPE FEAR was with the remake, which I saw in the theatre when it first came out. Finally caught up with the original and it's quite good, with a very intense performance from Robert Mitchum in particular. This could be the best-directed film I've seen from J. Lee Thompson as well, with a lot of eerie and unsettling moments. I thought the film felt a little dated, but I mean this only in the sense that we're so used to seeing so much more vivid mayhem these days. It's unusual for me to feel this way, as I'm mostly a fan of older movie-making styles... but here's a case where an earlier film didn't go as far as it possibly might have. I'm not very big on modernized remakes, but seeing this prompted me to rent the 1991 version to see how it compares now. It's been a long time since I saw it. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cape Fear Vs The Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the remake is considerably more graphic in it's violence, and DeNiro delivers his usual solid performance under Scoresese, (though perhaps tending somewhat toward overacting), I feel the major weak point is Nolte's performance as Bowden, he just doesn't come through with the authority of Peck (Nolte's character is too guilt-ridden and wimpy), thus the vital chemistry is missing between him and DeNiro; OTOH, Peck and Mitchum's character play vividly well off each other; two strong-willed personalities going head to head in a titantic struggle. Peck must be especially strong to counter two threats to his integrity and the safety of his family: that is, an internal threat - his own guilt, and an external one - Cady. Another weakness in characterization, but a somewhat interesting slant is Lewis' role of the daughter, she comes across as a saucy little tart who is simultaneously attracted and replused to the charming, but psychopathic Cady. However, Martin, as the fragile, innocent doe creates more dramatic impact through more contrast and vulnerability vis-a-vis Cady, thus more tension, terror and believeablity. To wit: the scene where Martin runs from her parents car and is pursued by Mitchum off the street, then she runs unwittingly right back into his arms, is one of the most terrifying scenes of the movie! While the remake has it's strong points and is a riveting movie at times, in the final analysis, the original "Cape Fear" gets my vote as the better of the two - a minor classic as it were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1962 Porn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For 2005, Cape Fear is an entertaining if dated crime drama/stalker flick that looks as old as it is. Yet in context, this movie must have been mesmerizing, horrifying, and almost pornographic for the innocent early 60's. The concept of a sadist ex-con with a grudge (Mitchum) stalking the June Cleaverish wife and Patty Duke-coiffed daughter of Gregory Peck (playing, well, a very Gregory Pecky trial lawyer) and having the Constitution protect him must have rattled Americans out in the suburbs and the hinterland.At no time did I really believe Peck and family were in danger (but it's 2005, right?). I did believe that I was watching a great, right to the edge of the the envelope performance by Robert Mitchum. When he lovingly smears egg on Polly Bergen's heaving bosom (now there's a fun phrase!), his improvisation with dairy products made me squirm with revulsion (and want to be in his shoes), which was exactly what Mitchum wanted the male viewer to feel--disgust and sexual excitement. It may be one of the best tiny pieces of acting I've ever seen--a perfect cross between intellect and porn.The great trouble with Cape Fear is its cheesy, unbelievable moments that increase in number and severity as the movie progresses. No lawyer with an above room temperature IQ would do some of the stupid things Peck does, there's no way police chief Martin Balsam would not arrest Peck for his stupidity, hookers don't talk in philosophy-major gobbledygook, wharf-hoods don't get their butts kicked by one guy, private investigators don't talk like psychoanalysts, women built like Polly Bergen show a little more than Harriet Nelson, and teenage girls can, in fact, be that stupid, but occasionally unclench their hair.Of course, all this is from the viewpoint of a guy who was four when this movie came out and does lame, wordy movie reviews on IMDb.There is something about this movie that I found very intriguing. It was directed by a very-experienced man named J. Lee Thompson (I think). His credits included everything from the awesome Guns of Navarone to those gawdawful B minus crimers with Charles Bronson, you know, the ones in the late 80's when Bronson was about 90 and had changed his toupee from stringy and believable to fluffy and ridiculous. Thompson was a journeyman director for hire, much like the man who should have been hired for this film--Don Siegel. Yet Siegel was better, and would have made this movie snap, crackle, and crunch as a whole, while still being a vehicle for Robert Mitchum's brilliance.With Siegel in mind, I thought of the whole Constitution as enemy theme and Cape Fear, I believe, is something of a great-uncle to Siegel's best artistic film, Dirty Harry. See this movie--and not the remake--and then the original Harry Callahan episode. They compliment each other--Mitchum's bad guy and Andy Robinson's Scorpio.Now, I wonder if my wife would like to scramble some eggs with me for dinner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ending was disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps in 1962 when this movie was released the penultimate fight between protagonist and antagonist wasn't the cliché it has since become. If so, I would give this movie a better review. But I have seen this fight so often in so many movies that it doesn't do anything for me anymore. It's similar to the fade-out finish in music. Both are stock finishes that are chosen because the creator has run dry of creativity. Having said that, I enjoyed everything else in this movie, particularly Robert Mitchum's performance as Max Cady. The way that Cady's true character is revealed were top-notch examples of writing and acting.For instance, when Cady implies to the bowling alley waitress that she might take money for sex. Nothing is overt, but the implication is clear.Or when Cady tells the lawyer that his daughter is getting to be almost as "juicy" as his wife.Or when Gregory Peck's character explains to his wife that Cady could rape their daughter. The word "rape" is never used, but the implication is clear.These subtle allusions were likely made necessary by censorship. Not that I'm a big fan of censorship, but there's no doubt that it forced filmmakers to be more creative than they otherwise would be.I only wish the makers of this particular movie had been more creative with the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Liberal Mugged by Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Max Cady, a convicted rapist, is released from jail after an eight-year sentence, he heads for a small town in Georgia. His aim is to get revenge on Sam Bowden, a local lawyer, whose evidence was responsible for his conviction. Cady's aim is not to attack Bowden immediately; rather, he plays a subtle game of cat-and-mouse, letting Bowden know that he is around and taunting him. Cady is clever enough not to make any direct threats, which would enable the police to arrest him. He uses only veiled innuendo, but Bowden is left in no doubt that Cady means harm not only to himself but also to his attractive wife Peggy and teenage daughter Nancy. Although Bowden is a close friend of Mark Dutton, the local police chief, the law seems unable to help; there is no power to arrest a man on mere suspicion alone. (There appear to have been no anti-stalking laws in the early sixties). Bowden is forced to take the law into his own hands; when an attempt to frighten Cady off by having him beaten up fails, he comes up with an elaborate scheme to lure Cady to his houseboat on an isolated stretch of the coast.The two strongest influences on this film are the work of Alfred Hitchcock and the "film noir" genre. Indeed, although some purists might disagree, this can be seen as one of the last films noirs with its stark black-and-white photography and sense of brooding tension. The influence of Hitchcock is unmistakable in some of the set-piece thriller moments- the scene where, in the dark, Peggy mistakes a hat and coat hanging on a peg for an intruder, the one where a terrified Nancy races through a deserted school thinking that Cady is following her and, most of all, the nail-biting finale on the houseboat in the lonely swamps. The film also has a spooky musical score by Hitchcock's favourite composer, Bernard Herrman.In one respect, however, the film is different from the average Hitchcock film. In Hitchcock's world, in numerous films from "The 39 Steps" to "Frenzy", when a man is suspected of villainy by the authorities he is almost always innocent. That is not the case here. In the context of another film, the scenes where Dutton has Cady repeatedly arrested on suspicion of various offences, none of which can be proved against him, to try and persuade him to leave town might be seen as unjustified police harassment of an innocent man. Here, however, Dutton's suspicions of Cady are so obviously justified that no liberal political message comes through.The politics of the film are, in fact, fairly conservative. Criminals are brutal psychopaths; civil rights lawyers like Cady's representative Dave Grafton are hypocritical shysters who earn their living by protecting the rights of criminals and ignoring those of the ordinary citizen. It has been said that a conservative is a liberal who has just been mugged (or "mugged by reality"), and that is the message we see in this film. Gregory Peck was one of the cinema's great liberals, both in the causes he supported away from the screen and in the roles he played on it. Shortly after "Cape Fear" he was to win an Oscar for his role as a liberal Southern lawyer in "To Kill a Mockingbird", and Bowden at first seems a similar character, giving voice to standard liberal opinions. He quickly realises, however, that in the light of Cady's threats liberalism is not enough and that he needs to resort to vigilante methods in order to protect his family. When, at the end of the film, he spares Cady's life, this is not an act of mercy but an act of revenge because he knows that Cady fears going back to jail more than he fears death.Peck never seems really convincing as Bowden; he is always too calm and rational to give the impression of a man so terrified that he will resort in self-defence to expedients that in other circumstances he would have recoiled from. The really great performance here is from Robert Mitchum as Cady. Mitchum could play likable heroes, but he could also make a great villain, and his Cady is even more frightening than the character he played in "Night of the Hunter". Nattily if casually dressed with a Panama hat and cigar, and seldom raising his voice, he nevertheless exudes menace. There are also good performances from Polly Bergen as Peggy and Martin Balsam as Dutton. I would agree with the director J Lee Thompson that Hayley Mills should have played Nancy- not because there is anything wrong with Lori Martin's performance but because Hayley was a highly promising child star who might have matured into a great adult star if she had had more challenging roles during her teens.The film was remade by Martin Scorsese in 1991. Although both versions have their good points, my view is that, on balance, Scorsese's film is one of the few sequels that excels its original. Although Mitchum here is every bit as good as de Niro is in the later film, Peck's Bowden is a more one-dimensional and less complex figure than Nick Nolte's interpretation of the role. By making Bowden much more morally ambiguous, Scorsese is able to go beyond the rather simple, black-and-white morality of Thompson's film and explore the underlying issues of justice and revenge in greater depth. Nevertheless, seen as a pure thriller rather than as an exploration of moral issues, the original has much to recommend it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's customary to bash remakes and hail the originals, especially in light of the creative stagnation that rules modern Hollywood, but Cape Fear is a case of the original being the inferior version. The 1962 film is far more simplistic, the family under threat is bland and Samuel Bowden is cleaner than clean. In Scorsese's film, Sam was Cady's lawyer and suppressed evidence, making the moral conundrum murkier, but in Thompson's film, Sam was a witness that helped get Cady convicted; his conscience is clean. Therefore the original is just a simplistic tale of good and evil. There's very little grey here.What dates the film the most is the family. They're almost like the Brady Bunch. They probably never have a single argument and they most likely spend their days baking cookies and going bowling. But while part of the fun is watching what sort of effect Cady's presence has on them, there are no internal frictions. They always remain true to one another. Compare this to the Scorsese film where Cady's presence brings out the inner doubt and resentment that exists amongst all families and you have a less interesting proposition.The child actress in the film, too, is rather lacklustre. She's certainly a lot more one-dimensional than Juliette Lewis' character, who's seduced by Cady. Plus the kid in this film looks weirdly like a miniature woman rather than a girl. She's a got a woman's haircut, she talks like a woman and she's got a face that looks older than her years. She looks like her mother's mini-me.Then there's Gregory Peck. Now I like Peck; he's a solid actor and he has an easy presence. Plus he always seems like a nice guy. But one thing that he isn't is exciting. The film always drags when he's on screen ? unlike the remake where Nolte is as interesting as Cady. And he's so unflappable that you never once question his decisions, his judgement or whether he's going to survive this. He's too comforting. You always know that everything is going to be okay.However, there is one important regard in which the original film exceeds the remake: Max Cady. Robert Mitchum's Max is more frightening and more convincing than DeNiro's. I always feel that DeNiro's Cady is like a hick Terminator. He's unstoppable and can survive being beaten about the head with lead pipes. Plus he can tie himself to the bottom of a car and suffer no ill effects. In essence, he's a cartoon villain ? no wonder The Simpsons went to town on the character. Mitchum's Cady, on the other hand, is more like a cruel drunk. He doesn't quote the Bible like DeNiro's Cady does and he doesn't have intellectual aspirations; he just quietly broods and bides his time. Plus he's more intimidating physically. Sure DeNiro built himself up and was covered in tattoos, but Mitchum has a more animalistic presence. He just locks onto his prey, puffs his ludicrously large chest and does what he has to do. He's a character you can believe in. It doesn't feel like he exists in some distant movie land.It's hard to say what Mitchum's best scene is, but if I had to choose, I'd go with the story he tells about his wife. It's more chilling than the explicit violence in Scorsese's film. He kidnaps his ex-wife, gets her to phone her husband and pretend that she's on a second honeymoon with Cady, 'occupies her time' for three days, makes her write dirty letters that he'll mail to the husband if she tells anyone what happened, then pumps her full of whiskey, strips her of her clothes and then gives her a 'fair chance to work her way home'. Ruthless. And then there's the scene where Mitchum leers at Sam's daughter. Despite the scene where DeNiro kisses Juliette Lewis and the ones later on with Jessica Lange, you always get the feeling that it's a means to an end; DeNiro's Cady seems to too psychotic to get any enjoyment out of sex. Mitchum, on the other hand, seems like he'd do it and enjoy it tremendously. I also love the scene where he breaks an egg over the chest of Peck's wife. He can snap her at any time.The film also makes some interesting points about the law. It's not there to protect you against what someone might do. It's only there to punish someone once they've committed a crime. Therefore, if someone has no regard for the law and the consequences, like Max Cady, they can do whatever they want ? the end is an old-fashioned battle for survival. However, Sam does try and bring some trumped up charges against Cady, but because Cady is reasonably intelligent, he's able to use the law to protect himself ? he's always careful not do anything illegal; or make it impossible to prove if he does. So even though this Max Cady has even less of a reason to be angry at Sam than the one in the remake, in a strange way I can't help but root for him. Peck's Sam is a little bit too smug and bit too comfortable, and the legal environment in which he works seems like a country club ? the law seems to be used as a tool against the uneducated. Consequently, because Max knows how to get around the trumped up charges and because he seems somehow more human ? anger is more of a human emotion than mere contentment ? I always end up wanting him to triumph. That's something that doesn't happen in the remake. In the remake I'm always on the side of the family. So although the original is an enjoyable film with a lot going for it, I still prefer Scorsese's version.</fullReview>

That includes some outdated aspects mainly in the hardly brisk and inventive Jack L. Thompson's directing. Gregory Peck is a perfect pick for the counselor's part (on the other hand Nick Nolte was a total miscast), not a great part ok but he is the right man. More important indeed is the part of the ex-convict: while de Niro would overact (as he does too often for a living, the IRS or something) Mitchum's fitting in with Max Cady's character is impressive. Same very good job as his part in Night of the Hunter: he makes it look easy.Now the problem with that character is he stands as the most interesting in the movie (the rest is only quiet/dull American family life) and it is difficult to switch from harassment and nonchalance to violence. The scene with the girl he picked up is a good one in this respect. Nevertheless the 'counselor' often looks ridiculous for he is more exasperated than truly entrapped as a real noir hero. His permanent contact with the police (and a too friendly Martin Basalm you'd like to send back to Mrs Bates') in addition with his follow-my-leader's advice stubbornness don't help to create tension.So... worth watching if only for Robert Mitchum. Then the end is rather tasteless (suspense in action scenes is not piece of cake) but not downright ridiculous as Scorcese's final shots in the studio pool definitely are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pure Evil of Robert Mitchum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lawyer (Gregory Peck)'s family is stalked by a man (Robert Mitchum) he once helped put in jail.This may be one of the greatest thrillers of all time. And why not? You have Mitchum, who is great at playing dark and evil characters. This one is by far his darkest and most evil. And then you have Gregory Peck, who is best known for playing upstanding citizens, most notably Atticus Finch. So seeing him as the hero is easy.And then you have a story that goes above and beyond. This was 1962, and movies were relatively tame by the standards of today (2015). But not this one. Threats of murder, blackmail, rape... this is a vicious movie that is legitimately scary, and not in the campy way that a lot of early thrillers now are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth it for Peck, Mitchum and the adorable Lori Martin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1962 version of "Cape Fear" is the same basic story as Martin Scorsese's 1991 remake with slight changes: Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) gets out of prison after over 8 years and proceeds to harass Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) and his family (Polly Bergen and Lori Martin) because Bowden was instrumental in Cady's conviction. Telly Savalas (with hair) appears as the private detective that Bowden hires.While I prefer the 1991 version because it's more modern and compelling, not to mention in color, this version is worthwhile if you like the stars and can handle the style of old black &amp; white movies. Peck is stalwart as the protagonist, as always.Mitchum plays Max Cady subtler than De Niro and he's just not as fascinating. De Niro's Cady steals the show and could've even been the protagonist if Scorsese had the gonads to take the movie in a completely different direction whereas Mitchum's Cady is mainly just annoying, until the last act, that is. As written and performed, De Niro's Cady has more dimension and mystique. In the first act he's almost the hero and you find yourself sorta rooting for him, at least until he turns decidedly diabolic. This isn't to say that Mitchum's Cady isn't effective; he's just outshined by De Niro's version.Barrie Chase plays a "party girl" that Cady (Mitchum) picks up at a bar. She's obviously infected by the "bad boy syndrome" in light of her statement to Cady (paraphrased): "I like you? (because) you're an animal ? coarse, lustful and barbaric." Isn't that just so true to life? One highlight of the film is petite Lori Martin as Bowden's adorable daughter, Nancy. She was 14 during filming and wholly precious. Her last film was the trashy 1968 biker flick "The Angry Breed" wherein she was 20. After that, she only did a few more TV gigs before bowing out of acting altogether.Whereas the 1991 film is drama/thriller that morphs into almost slasher horror, this version is decidedly a drama with thriller elements. There's nothing wrong with that, as long as ? like me ? you like dramas and are prepped for such a picture. Unfortunately, the film seems padded as many scenes are unnecessarily long and could've been cut in half, not to mention the black &amp; white photography limits its appeal.The film runs 105 minutes and was shot in Savannah, Georgia, and Ladd's Marina (near Stockton), CA.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Very Last of Film Noir?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was this the last film noir type of picture made in B/W? Surely movies have been made in B/W after 1962, but I can't think of anyone in particular this famous. Psycho, for instance, was released in 1960.Anyhow, this is a true gem, and there's nothing that I'd like to add to it, or remove.Robert Mitchum was magnificent in Cape Fear: indeed, he gave life to the odd, inscrutable character of Max Cady. Compare his Max Cady to Lee Marvin's Walker in Point Blank, another impeccable hard boiled 60s thriller (although in color). Marvin's protagonist doesn't really seem to possess any feelings other than Vengeance. Cady shows all kinds of emotion: anger, amusement, hate, self-pity, desire, perhaps even love (though I doubt that). The remake of 1991 is not my favorite, and I suspect that Scorsese simply wanted to cast DeNiro in yet a powerful role. In my opinion, DeNiro didn't make it as Mitchum had already been there. (I also tend to think of DeNiro fans as admirers of greasy Mafiosi clichés: in one scene in the 1991 version, DeNiro's Cady even tuned in some Italian opera while driving his automobile. Not exactly what Mitchum's Cady would have thought of doing...) Cape Fear of 1962 had a sub motive dealing with apparent shortcomings of the law, that even the ex convicts have rights, and so on. The same motive appears later in the Dirty Harry series. Cape Fear of 1991 blurred all this with religion, and much of the point with the setting, copied from the original, was lost. While Mitchum's Cady is believable as the shrewd legal book reading bum, DeNiro's Cady barely appears to be literate.Other reviewers on IMDb have commented on the Hitchcockian style of this thriller. Well, you can see that this was not directed by Hitchcock. No offense intended here, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tense, eery, yet exciting and stellar in cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not till the last minute did you actually know what the ending would be. It was that tense and the setting was fittingly eery. The capable Gregory Peck was, in this movie, a crux between the astute, calm, caring, respected small-town lawyer know as Atticus Finch ("To Kill A Mockingbird") and Lewt McCanles, the mean, spoiled son of a land baron in Texas ("Duel in The Sun"). In a few words, Robert Mitchum plays a man who recently has served a prison term for murder in Baltimore, and Peck, who plays the lawyer Sam Bowden, had helped by his testimony of what he saw in Baltimore one night put Mitchum in prison; now, Mitchum wants to avenge him for that. Sam Bowden is a low-keyed lawyer who is none-the-less a courageous man. Robert Mitchum as the mean dreg Cady is as mean as mean can be, caring nothing about Bowden and his family. Bowden's wife is played well by Polly Bergen, and Lori Martin showed great acting ability as the scared, stalked daughter of Bowden. Telly Savalas did a good turn as the private detective as well, and Martin Balsam makes a great contribution as the rough-cored but very concerned police friend of Bowden. The swamp in the movie strongly contributed to the eery feeling, and the Bernard Hermann music and occasionally-slow action made the movie tense. While it may not be among the most outstanding productions in which Mitchum and Peck played, it was another one of those I could see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch this thriller to see how good an actor --and how manly--Mitchum was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get it straight?the original CAPE FEAR is a daring, sleazy and exploitative suspense movie. Very good script, extraordinary photography, fine score, vintage cast and keen direction led to a thriller characterized by gusto and a flawless pace.Cady means perhaps that great defining role for daddy Mitchum, in a movie that is particularly well directed and where only Peck gives a 2nd hand performance?as if ?as if he was quite unsure about what Thompson, Bronson's future favorite director, exactly meant by this sulfurous suspense movie bordering exploitation; and on the contrary, Mitchum looks very at ease, as if he got fully what Peck perhaps feared to understood. Thompson surpassed himself doing a great job as a director?and the music ?, the signature note of threat and fear ?.Now did Thompson mean that the Bowden family was respectable and virtuous?or simply that they were straight unlikable stiffs? Basically, sort of like Stewart and Mrs. Day in Hitchcock's 2nd THE MAN WHO KNEW ?. Hitchcock sabotaged his characters in that '50s movie; why wouldn't Thompson pull the same trick in CAPE FEAR? Mitchum might of looked like a dog or whatever, the actor registers as a genius, one of the, of course, few; and what a torso, he looked great naked ?. Watch his scene with Mrs. Bowden?with that dashing good looks, Mitchum rivaled the younger Brando ?.As a Mitchum fan, CAPE FEAR holds for me, in terms of Mitchum's appeal, the same place that A STREETCAR ? holds for some others; in a way, it seems the peak of Mitchum's over?manly appeal, in an extremely functional, esthetically, movie.CAPE FEAR was an exploitation movie made by craftsmen; its remake is rubbish made by degenerates for degenerates.You can be scared to near?death by one of Mitchum's incredibly intelligently acted heavies, while mesmerized?and at most appalled by De Niro's, corresponding or not, heavies; what I meant was that De Niro's heavies appall you, don't scare you, while Mitchum was unequaled in the understated evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the remake of Cape Fear before I saw the original, to be honest, I wasn't even aware there was an original for a while, I just heard of it about a year ago and I finally came across it at the video store and just had to take a look at it. Martin's version was just so brilliant and horrifying, I was curious what the original must have been like and to be honest, I don't know if I could choose the better of the two, but I think both were just different interpretations of the story. I still loved Cape Fear the original, it was so beautifully made and so horrific.Max Cady has just been released from prison and he's out for revenge on his lawyer. The lawyer who had an opportunity to actually get Cady off the hook, but "counseler" felt guilty and made sure to put Cady away. But now Cady is not only after his lawyer, he's after his family as well and he will not stop until his revenge is complete, no matter what lengths he has to go through.The actor who played Cady was just so terrific, Gregory just captured Cady's insanity so perfectly and was so believable! The rape scene between him and Dianne, the hitch hiker, was so terrifying to watch! He was so intimidating, just his presence, man! What a performance! Please, please, watch this movie along with the remake, they are both terrific films and very scary! Cape Fear is one of those movies I will never forget.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At least it isn't gory...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of today's suspenseful movies, sadly, depend popularity and money on blood-soaked raging psychopaths swinging chainsaws and rocking beds. This movie, "Cape Fear", was made during the 60s -- the final decade of Classic Movies, which began right back into the early 1900s.Now what we have here is a lawyer named Sam Bowdon (GREGORY PECK) stalked by a ex-convict named Max Cady (ROBERT MITCHUM). Although we -- the audience -- know that this man is up to no-good as he stalks Bowdon's family, Cady is pinned on Bowdon's teenaged daughter, Nancy (LORI MARTIN), much to the dismay of Bowdon and wife Peggy (POLLY BERGAN)... ... actually, this movie is more about how Bowdon tries to prove Cady's guilt. Something a lawyer wouldn't mind watching... don't expect high-level scenes of action and suspense. However, this is a movie which tests your mind.For example, we see a bare-chested Cady surround a bed with his girlfriend Diane Taylor (BARRIE CHASE) before finally attacking then raping her (which we don't see). We don't know exactly what Cady did to her, but whatever it was, it left her bruised, disgusted with life, and above all -- broken.Bowdon doesn't want this to happen to his family, or to himself for that matter. So his worries get tense and he even has a fight or two with his family.At least it isn't gory...5/10 -- not bad. Highly recommended for those who want to learn more about the Law (like me. :))</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has its own merits.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I can now make my official comment about 1991's "Cape Fear", having seen the J. Lee Thompson version. I prefer the '91 version over the '61 version for a much different reason I prefer the '61 version over '91's. Are we confused?Let me explain. My thumb is up for Scorsese's version because of its authentic depiction of the family tormented by De Niro's Cady. They were a flesh and blood family with their trials and tribulations, while De Niro's character functioned as a horror movie monster. In Thompson's version; it was Robert Mitchum as Max Cady who was flesh and blood. Gregory Peck, Polly Bergen and Lori Martin functioned as more of a "Leave It to Beaver" type family than a real one. While Thompson's was more character driven (and yes, Mitchum was quite a character), Scorcese upped the tension more, because of the Bowden's dysfunction, thus making it far more effective.I will say one thing for Thompson's version. It was definetly ahead of its time as far as hinting the sex and rape. It's too bad, he never quite recovered after the slew of Charles Bronson pix that flooded the mid-to-late '80's. I would trash his one attempt at horror (Happy Birthday to Me), but it too was an early '80's precursor to "Scream". </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes, or films which were remade are a good experience by this fact alone. If you've seen both, you can watch to films in parallel, and the reflexive film of imagining how the second film was made, what were the re-makers thinking. This is how i watched this one. I've seen Scorcese's remake, before i saw this one, so from that moment i would never be able to watch this original isolated, where it stood on its own. I can only imagine.Yet, i thought what would Scorcese be thinking. I think his intention was no other than a matter of updating, and fulfilling the hinting that this original version opened. Everything was more graphical and visceral by 1991, of course, so Scorcese updated the violence, and showed what audiences were only prepared to be hinted at in 1960. But the big thing Scorcese did was to introduce the sexual tension between Max Cady and the daughter. Juliette Lewis really makes an impression. In this original we have the sexual lust by Mitchum's character, but it is one sided, a pure attraction of a filthy mind to a innocent child. And this is basically the point: in this old version everything is a matter of good-evil. It's a poorer approach (even the reasons for the vengeance are less dubious than the Scorcese's version). Well, even the actors are less flexible than what is required of a good modern actor. Peck and Mitchum were both artistically born to a cinema where "character" was something that was part of their public personalities as "stars" as well as of his characters. So their acting in itself is wooden, and very limited. They are there to show off their public characters. So for instance, if you take Mitchum's character, he is not trying to convince the audience of a certain kind of sophisticated meanness. Instead he is giving us a scent of bad roughness, while he tries to be himself: the rough seductive "man". Peck has his life more easy, we are supposed to like him so he just has to be himself.This is a film that lost the ambiguities and moral quests of the original film-noir, but which has not yet develop to a new stage, that includes modern acting (the Brando effect didn't apply to these fellows) and novel ways to build narrative. So to me, it sounds just outdated, and i don't connect to it.My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The generation gap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the comments made here, it becomes apparent that these two films have a lot to say about how film-making and audiences changed between the sixties, the end of an era, and the eighties, when sound editing and special effects had become as important as acting and photography. The original - a psychological thriller with mostly excellent acting. Mitchum understated and therefore so menacing. Shot in black and white. A lovely and unnerving score by Bernard Herrmann - the music itself worth the price of admission.The remake - loud and brutal, with the underlying psychology taking the back seat and the director relying on de Niros (over)acting and special effects.Don't misunderstand. I enjoyed them both! Scorsese is a very gifted director and de Niro one of the best actors of his generation. But the original is, to me, so clearly superior in important aspects (acting, photography, musical score...). You may say the difference is aesthetical. I think there is more to it than that. Many of those writing of their disappointment with the original here are probably younger people who saw the remake first, and were expecting something other than psychological subtlety and b/w photography. If generations can understand what they see differently, perhaps something is gained. Especially if the young can see what makes the original great, I think.I am 47, and yes, I thought "The Shining" was the greatest horror movie I had seen until there was a rubber doll in the bathtub.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I've recently seen this film's remake and enjoyed that very much, so I thought this one would be as good as that. Sadly, it is not. In here, Max Cady is a character that we don't even know why we should be afraid of; he doesn't appear to be sick, violent or cruel. Sometimes I felt like "ok, why are the filmmakers trying to scare when there's nothing to be scared of?". If I didn't see the remake first, I would think Cady was a good guy just pretending to be bad. 1991's version (thanks to Scorcese and De Niro) is thousand times better in character developing. Also, it's a shame that all the director do to make this film suspenseful is putting a tense background sound; there's no suspense other than that. Filmmakers sometimes seem to have made lazy scenes, such as the fight scenes which looked real amateurish to me. Remake is undoubtedly better, watch that instead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... let's kill all the lawyers'. If anyone connected with this production had this quote in mind during pre-production then full marks to them. It comes from Shakespeare's Henry VI and it's spoken by Jack Cade, a name not a million miles from Max Cady, who, in the shape of Robert Mitchum, is certainly interested in killing one lawyer (Gregory Peck). This is a beautifully crafted suspense movie which illustrates perfectly just how overrated Hitchcock is, delivering everything that Hitch delivered for a tenth the budget/acclaim. Selflessly and like the gentleman he clearly was off screen, Gregory Peck, who produced the film via his own Production company, opted for the far less showier role of lawyer Boden, leaving Robert Mitchum to dominate the picture without even trying. Though Peck himself would take on the occasional villain - memorably in The Boys From Brazil - his genuine 'niceness' tended to shine through in much the same way as did Jack Lemmon's whilst Mitchum was able to move effortlessly and fluidly from hero to villain and back again at will. I haven't seen the remake and have no desire to, the original is more than good enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cape fear (1962)is not as good as the remake (1991) but still provides us with a no holds barred performance which does tend to chill (in places)and grips the audience.Basically its still the same story apart from the fact the circumstances are different and places in the story have changed,. Not to mention the violence was toned down too. The characters still remain with the same names.Well as everybody knows it starts with Max Cady coming out of jail and going to avenge his former witness who put him in jail.Only in this original,the family are more stable and happy.In the remake,Sam Bowden was Max Cadys lawyer,but in this version Bowden was witness to Cady's crime. Instead of seducing the daughter (as in the remake),the daughter is chased through the school. Cape fear is a good B movie film noir which still proves to shock audiences and Robert Mitchum still pulls off a good performance as Max (obviously not as good as Robert De niro) and Gregory Peck is brilliant as Sam Bowden. I reccomend you see this movie after watching the remake (the ending is different too) and you will notice the difference. If your looking for classic performances with not too much violence see this one,I reccomend the remake if your looking for the frightening side of it. I rate 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They say you shouldn't make a remake unless there's something that needs improvement. The characters in the original were too black and white. The character complexities Scorsese added makes things a lot more interesting. A lawyer screwing over a client is more a reason to seek revenge than an innocent bystander witnessing a crime. Raping someone the lawyer is practically having an affair with is more of a game plan that raping some women that doesn't have anything to do with anyone. And the ending of the original! Give me a break. Peck is holding Mitchum at gun point. Mitchum asks him to shoot, and he says "No. I'm not going to shoot. I'll see you in prison forever". But yet he's still holding Mitchum at bay with the gun. If Mitchum wants to be shot, how could you keep him back by threatening him with the gun?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Scorsese version first, which scared the hell out of me. Then, after learning about the Mitchum and Peck cameos in the remake, I caught this and was very enthusiastic about it. It scared me, a little bit. Maybe that was because I already knew what was going to happen. But, to the discontent of other reviewers, I didn't find Mitchum scary at all. He seemed to me, like a redneck who was bent on revenge and relentlessly pursued Sam Bowden like a zombie. However, De Niro's villain is scarier, because he's smarter, and more of a monster than Mitchum. This is just my opinion. I know that there are many people who prefer the Mitchum version of "Cape Fear". But, the fear of the remake got to me more than the original film did, plus it was darker and nastier(the only aspect of the 1962 "Cape Fear" that was dated. Otherwise, it was very good, and very gripping! I would recommend it to people who want a good scare. But for people like me, who really liked the Scorsese version, you're in for something of a disappointment, I think.</fullReview>
