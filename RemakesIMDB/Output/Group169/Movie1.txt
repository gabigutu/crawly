		<shortDescription>Not About Gambling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a man who has given up hope on achieving his dreams and is trying to make his pain stop by engaging in self destructive behavior... his weapon of choice is gambling but he is not a gambler. He says so multiple times. I have read the many negative reviews of this movie and I think people are really just missing the point. He wants a real love and something real to do every day and if he achieve anything beyond mediocrity then he would rather be dead. People who can relate with that sentiment will love this movie but perhaps no one else. If you enjoy a movie that makes you think a little and go beyond what's on the surface. The movie is not about gambling... it is about finding inspiration and hope.</fullReview>

No it doesn't work with a girl who is half Wahlberg's age.Yes it's great to see John Goodman in a meaty role.

		<shortDescription>Complicated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Gambler was a difficult film to rate. It was a movie that not everyone is going to like because not everyone is going to relate to Mark Wahlberg's character. It was a hard movie to understand. After seeing this movie you will either love it or hate it. There is really no in between. You really had to connect with the main character and his personality, and that's not possible for everyone. I really enjoyed the film because i really connected with it, but that is not going to be the case for everyone. I would highly recommend seeing it just to take the chance of loving it. Just like the gambling theme of the movie, seeing the movie will be a gamble for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not At All What I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Gambler was not at all what I expected. Full disclosure - I was not (and still am not) familiar with the original film and the premise of it. I went in with basic ideas based off of the previews that I saw.The movie is slow, lacks character development, and is just...boring.Wahlberg's character wears on you quickly. How am I supposed to be interested in a character who goes through life so disinterested and not giving an f*** about anything? It would have been much more fitting for one of the "bad guys" to off him and put him out of his misery.And the "bad guys" in this movie could not be less intimidating. There's no dread/drama/anticipation when Jim goes to meet any of them. You just *know* that nothing is actually going to happen.That being said, the only aspect of this movie I enjoyed was John Goodman's character. As mentioned in another review, his "F*** You Money" monologue is brilliant. His character actually has some depth and good dialogue.Overall, I was very disappointed in this film. No character development, no suspense, no emotion. No thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The equivalent of watching interesting parts struggling to find something to work with that shows their importance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The seedy underworlds that are often associated with gambling and the mafia are worlds that loan themselves to film, for they breed certain characters, themes, and ideas that simply captivate, and provide audiences with ideas as to how a subculture operates. Having said that, it's a shame in the last few years, we've gotten a small, mediocre array of these films when the genre used to be dominated by the likes of people like Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino, and Robert De Niro, who knew how to create arresting films based off the mob. With Rupert Wyatt's The Gambler, a remake of the James Caan film of the same name coming at the end of the year following a recent trailer release like the film's release was an afterthought, we get another middling effort to showcase strong acting talent but mediocre-to-average screen writing as we watch a captivating idea be squandered by a bloated yet underdeveloped plot.Mark Wahlberg plays Jim Bennett, a literature professor and a gambling addict, who doesn't know the meaning of quitting when he is up. Bennett rolls away at his odds until he is completely out of money, losing whatever winnings he accumulated and then some. He is in debt to numerous loan sharks, one of which Neville Baraka (Michael K. Williams), who, along with a Korean loan shark, informs him he has seven days to pay back a $240,000 debt or else he is whacked. Jim looks toward Frank (John Goodman), a ruthless, but almost philosophical man, who proposes to loan him the money but fears of his ability, or lack thereof, to compensate him on his investment. Meanwhile, Jim tries to keep it together in the classroom, as he stands before a group of clearly disinterested men and women, who aren't in the classroom to learn anymore than he is in there to teach. However, he takes a liking to Amy (Brie Larson), one of his students who shows great potential in writing. When discussing the idea of following one's dreams as a writer in class, he informs the remainder of his students that, "if you're not a genius, don't even bother." Jim's thoughtless cynicism and complete disregard for his own life, without the merit or humor or any cogent philosophy or backstory, robs him of any ability to even be a tolerable anti-hero. He's a miserable character, with the only bonus of being played by Wahlberg, one of the finest leading actors working today, who communicates Jim's moroseness nicely throughout the film. Wahlberg is surrounded by other performers, who work equally well at matching his level of conviction, specifically Goodman, whose few scenes in the film amount to greatness in a predictable yet pleasant manner. Goodman delivers a great monologue about the luxury of having "f*** you money," which he estimates to be about $2.5 million. With that net worth, you don't need to take orders from anyone, and if anyone angers you, you can give them the old seven-letter phrase with great effect.Wahlberg and Goodman are great fun to watch because they've played these kind of wayward characters in prior films, so they know the landscape and the material is fresh in their heads. However, screenwriter William Monahan (who also wrote Scorsese's Departed) threatens to lose control of the project when he writes in multiple different characters and several subplots, not developing enough to reach the level where we care about them. We already have an unlikable main character, and we can't rely on much of the cast to feed our desire to find someone we can at least sympathize with, so all we have is Jim and some bookies-turned-philosophers when the screenplay calls for it to supply character interest. Even the love story Monahan tries to concoct doesn't work, and at that point, we are essentially watching a collection of an interesting parts struggling to find something to work with while masquerading in a backdrop of strong cinematography by Greig Fraser (who also did this year's Foxcatcher, along with Zero Dark Thirty) and some well-executed musical cues that emphasize rather than embellish key moments.The Gambler, as a whole, however, doesn't work because despite the high stakes and the large risk factor, we see the carelessness and the disinterest of our main character run so freely throughout the film, that we ask ourselves why we should care that this man is seven days away from a grisly demise. We can appreciate the actors, the way the setting is presented, and the music we're provided with to a certain degree, but when it comes time to dive into these characters, their motivations, and their will to live, they have very little, so why are we watching their lazy contentment with such a dour existence?Starring: Mark Wahlberg, John Goodman, Michael K. Williams, and Brie Larson. Directed by: Rupert Wyatt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wahlberg delivers a tour d? force performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Gambler tells the story of Jim Bennett, a college professor with a dangerous and self destructive addiction to gambling at underground casinos in the underbelly of Los Angeles. His addiction soon begins to effect his professional and personal life to severe and deadly consequences. The Gambler features great performances from Mark Wahlberg and Jessica Lange along with flashy and stylish direction from Rupert Wyatt. Much like the 1974 original, The Gambler is very much so a character study. We see Wahlberg's Jim Bennett in every scene, and see him make every bet, lose every hand and blow every dollar without shying away from Wahlberg. This is a new, transformed and extremely mature performance from Mark Wahlberg. He is in top form here, delivering a career best performance along with the physicality of a twig. It is certainly a better portrayal of a teacher than what we see in 2008's horrendous misfire The Happening. When we see Wahlberg in The Gambler he loses himself in long monologues that never once will make you question his validity in this part. The supporting cast features Brie Larson, Jessica Lange and John Goodman. Each give amazing performances, especially Goodman who steals some scenes from Wahlberg with colorful monologues filled with expletives and subtext that is classic William Monohan but it does grow tiring after awhile. The screenplay written by Oscar winner William Monohan is far from a perfect script but it is very interesting and keeps your attention. It doesn't pack the punch The Departed did, but it gets the job done. Rupert Wyatt proves that not only can he do a big budget action spectacle as Rise of the Planet of the Apes but he can also deliver hard hitting drama. My only issue was that Martin Scorsese is such a huge influence here in filmmaking style that you start to wonder what it would be like if Wyatt just stuck to his own style instead of trying to capture something that is clearly above his talent because it does backfire on multiple occasions especially during its Hollywood-fueled finale. For a film as dark as The Gambler, the ending just simply doesn't fit and feels more like a studio ending rather than something that would be true to the film and true to the original vibe of it all. Overall, The Gambler is a fitting remake that fails to capture the essence of the original but displays Mark Wahlberg in a career changing performance that shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than some reviews are saying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read few unfavourable reviews about The Gambler mostly saying the film is not gripping enough. I disagree. At no stage did i lose interest in what was going on and i thought the tension was palpable at times. A really good leading performance from Mark Wahlberg and it's good to see Michael Kenneth Williams ( Omar Little from The Wire ) in a big role. If i had to be picky i would say that the three people who Jim owed money to could have been a little bit more menacing and the ending is a little bit confusing ( or that could just be me ! ). Overall though an entertaining , enjoyable movie which also has a great soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first ever IMDb review, but I felt compelled to write it. I'm usually pretty partial to Wahlberg's movies, but this thing is just awful. I get what the movie is about, the self loathing and self destruction. The acting in this is just so flat, and boring and poorly directed. The script is ridiculously bad. Wahlberg seems to think blurting out his poorly written dialog as fast and as unintelligibly as possible equates to a convincing portrait of an academic. It doesn't. He seems to think that acting bored equates to the portrait of a deeply troubled self destructive man. It doesn't. Perhaps it improved dramatically after the hour mark, but I wouldn't know. For the first time in what must be 2 years, I gave up on a film. It was so terrible, not only did I fail to engage with any one of the characters or any aspect of the story at all, I was actively hating it! I could feel the movie literally vacuously and worthlessly sucking away my time like the most boring vampire that ever existed. Bad script, woeful acting, weak direction, poor cinematography, weak soundtrack. So yeah...um...I didn't like it much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How much money did Mark Walberg owe the mob to be forced into this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought I would see the day when Mark Walberg appeared in a bad movie. Of course the usual clueless eggheads and elitist wannabes had to give it rave reviews because, in their minds, some jittery screen effects made a boring, classless movie 'artsy.'The movie was boring, the dialog was inconsequential and dragged out, and there was no plot or theme. The characters, including the main character, were not developed at all and the romantic interest was basically a one night stand that at the end of the movie was made out to be Romeo and Juliet. By the end of the movie and the so called "surprise twist' I couldn't care less about whether Walberg's character won or lost, lived or died. The only redemption was the superb acting by Walberg and Goodman, but they didn't come anywhere close to saving this movie. It was simple boring and nonsensical. I'm glad that I saw this on 12/31/14, because if I had seen it a day later, then it would have ruined the New Year for me.Now I understand why people pirate movies. After getting their pockets picked by movies like this, it is only right that they would look to pick the pocket of Hollywood right back. Do yourself a favor and see any other movie. Even Plan 9 from Outer Space would be better than this dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond Ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dark 1974 movie "The Gambler", starring James Caan, I thought was the definitive film about compulsive gambling. Although this modern version gives credit to James Toback (writer of the 1974 movie), I'm sorry to say I found this film to be beyond ridiculous, with incredibly stilted and pretentious dialogue, as well as absurd characters and situations.I will say the acting, given to what they have to work with, is top notch with Mark Wahlberg leading the way as Jim Bennett, an associate professor of literature at a college. He comes from an extremely wealthy family, but is a totally obnoxious, insulting jerk, who seemingly has a "death wish" regarding his compulsive gambling.Michael Kenneth Williams is also excellent as Neville Baraka, a loan shark and gambler, while John Goodman gives his usual most solid performance as Frank, another loan shark and mobster. Poor Brie Larson, who has to play the role of Amy Phillips here. She's one of Jim's students, and apparently a genius of a writer, but the more she sees Jim destroying himself with his gambling she cluelessly becomes even more attracted to him. Good luck with that!! To me, this was quite the disappointment from two talented filmmakers, the director Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, The Escapist), and the writer William Monahan (The Departed).All in all, I'm sorry to say I found this movie to be far inferior to the 1970's classic, and a major disappointment for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been titled "The Idiot".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could have trained a mentally retarded monkey stoned on bath salts and suffering from dementia to play cards better than Marky Mark.Doubling every hand until he loses isn't strategy, It is stupidity. This movie could have been brilliant if the main protagonist would have shown some skill. It was laughable when Marky requested "Stake Me". I would much rather stake a four year old playing "Old Maid". Playing " Red or Black" on Roulette takes no skill and that is basically all our "Gambler" is capable of. As someone who has played thousands of hands of Blackjack, hundreds of hours of Craps and worked as a dealer I find the movie appalling. It is also lazy. How cool would it have been had he really played perfect basic strategy with 2-3 hands something like in "Rain Man" for a big win. How cool would a highly skilled player being depicted shooting craps surgically for a big win be? We will never know because that requires effort and having a mindless, sling blade, moron pissing away other people's money is easier. By the way is John Goodman even human? This movie is simply put a Travesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Dumbest movie I've ever seen in my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just wasted a good hour and half of my life. This movie sucks. Dumb gambler bets and loses. Then he decides to play Indian Poker for $50,000 and loses. One card for $50k. Then he decides to borrow more money just to bet like a dumb idiot and loses all. Then he decides to go mob to mob trying to borrow money to not pay back, but to gamble more and lose it all. Then he goes to see his mom who basically gives him all the money she has, which is enough to pay back everyone. Does he? Would I give it a 2 star rating if he did? No. He decides to go to some Indian casino and lose it all again. He keeps up his I don't give a F attitude. Then at the end, he miraculously pays it all back by borrowing a whole of money and then putting it all on black. Happy ending right?The character is someone who I was basically hoping to get killed so I can be put out of my misery. This was one of the worst movies I've seen with a dumb plot line, retarded character and frustrating development that goes nowhere other than frustrate-ville. I've never given a rating this low, but this one clearly deserves it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is a high stakes game. This is how to play it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday evening watched this movie and loved it, couldn't take my eyes off. This is not a gambling movie, this is a movie on pain. Existential pain. The character, Jim, played amazingly by Mark Wahlberg is the essence of it.Grown up in a rich family. Intelligent. Always been told he's the smartest &amp; talented person in the room. But deep inside he feels mediocrity. Be is bored to the hilt. He doesn't f***ing care about cars, money, his looks and even women anymore. This is a movie about feeling alive, taking risks in life, because without a risk you're a mediocre bum, you are essentially dead. And this is exactly how Jim is feeling. Everything he does is to escape that, his flamboyant teaching, his gambling, his f*** you mentality.Deep inside he feels he has to put it all on the line, everything, his family, all his money, his life even. Doing this is the only thing that can essentially set him free.He's s stubborn and cocky f*** knowing that his only release is giving everything up, be humiliated, be on the ground and that's the basis of becoming a new and free man.Coming down to the existential reason for self destruction, first we need to burn everything down, before me can build a new city on top of it.This is his escape from his addiction, his ego &amp; his depression. Life is a high stakes game.Perfectly done in a grim &amp; tense setting. Loved it, very inspiring. Thanks for making this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that I did ultimately like and recommend but it is a little generic and lacking the punch it was going for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Eventually a debt gets too big to pay." Jim Bennett (Wahlberg) is an English professor at a major college, as well as being a high stakes gambler. He isn't very good at either. When he falls into an insurmountable debt to a ruthless loan shark one life begins to bleed into the other and his life, and the lives of those around him, is in danger. Going in I thought this movie could go 1 of 2 ways. It could either be tense and good, or slow and boring. After watching it I would have to say it is more tense and good, but also nothing amazing. I did like this quite a bit and recommend this, but it just seems like they could have done so much more with this character. Another down side of this movie is that it is pretty much like every other movie about gambling. The best part of this movie is John Goodman, but he is so under used that it is a little upsetting. If he was in it more the movie would have been better. Overall, a movie that I did ultimately like and recommend but it is a little generic and lacking the punch it was going for. I give it a B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Down to the felt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was this really based on the script for 1974's The Gambler?I suspect that most people who see this version won't have seen the original, and although you could just judge this version on its merits, I can't help feeling an opportunity to make a film of real depth was lost along the way.James Toback's original story was about Axel Freed (James Caan), a university professor who gambles recklessly until he gets into debt with dangerous people. He adds to what can only be his deep sense of self-loathing when he borrows money from his loving family, gambles it away, then lowers his battered morals to their lowest ebb to save his life. The 1974 version ends with one of the most searing scenes in cinema, and is nothing short of a masterpiece.I can understand the filmmakers of the new version not wanting to simply remake the original (they changed all the names). However, in trying a new interpretation, they have missed key ingredients. By mixing the elements around, the film ends up deprived of tension despite a plethora of heavies who seem to have escaped from a "Batman" movie.Mark Wahlberg's character, Jim Bennett, seems far too knowing about what really drives him; Caan's Axel Freed didn't seem fully aware of his self-destructiveness until he looked at his slashed face in the mirror in the last scene; Jim Bennett telegraphs his problem to the nearest blackjack dealer from the start.Unsympathetic characters also undermine it. One of the most agonising things about the original was the way Axel let down the decent people who really cared about him: his mother, his grandfather and his girlfriend. Not so here. Bennett's mom played by Jessica Lange is scarier than the guys he owes money to; do we really care if he blows her 250K?Wahlberg's Bennett, who goes through the film as though his diet is seriously deficient in fibre, never really hits rock bottom; totally at odds with the original story.So many things made the 1974 version so effective, the inspired script and direction, James Caan's unique stillness, Lauren Hutton's stunning girlfriend, and Paul Sorvino as the only person who has an inkling about what makes Axel Freed tick. Even Jerry Fielding's score based on Mahler's "Titan" gave the film an ominous tone, which the compilation score for the new film doesn't come close to matching.Will this version stay in the memory of those who have only seen this one? I doubt it. It isn't the worst film you are likely to see, but it's too talky and surprisingly predictable. Unlike the 1974 version, this is one you would probably forget as soon as you leave the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be surprised but this movie is about gambling. But I'm sure real gambling isn't as boring as this movie ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I was playing for Mister Lee, and for that gentleman over there. I'm not actually a gambler."I don't think it'll be a total surprise if I'd say that "The Gambler" is about a gambling addiction. Enough movies were made that shed a light on this issue and eventually you expect while watching such a movie, that feeling will come over you that resembles that of the addict while he's trying to make a profit at the gambling table. That intense feeling in your abdomen when you are about to win a substantial amount of money, the tension, the relief and the gnawing anger when things aren't going as they should. And I didn't have that feeling at all while watching "The Gambler". In the end I looked at it in the same way as Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) : indifferent, without euphoria or disappointment, as if he was observing the game from another player. It seems as if he wasn't playing with his own money. There's no pounding thrill like in "Rounders" where Matt Damon is trying to regain his lost fortune during a poker game. Why the hell did they actually make this film when there's a successful (from what I've read) version from 1974 with James Caan?Jim Bennett is a university professor, a failed writer and a notorious gambler. But his gambling addiction became a sort of suicide mission. He owes a huge debt to the Korean owner of a well-known gambling house where extremely high bets are allowed, and a crafty African American moneylender. His personal attitude is the cause of him ending up in this situation. For Jim it's all or nothing. A disastrous attitude that causes his debts to grow considerably because the profits he usually makes in gambling are nil. Actually you can say they are non-existent. If there's one thing Jim particularly excels in, than it's losing. Ultimately, it seems like winning on its own is no longer important for him. Fortunately, it's not Russian roulette he plays, otherwise it would be a short film. The fact that he loses constantly, also ensures that this film actually isn't exciting or unpredictable. The rest of the film is filled with a series of dialogues that develop into debates about truth and success, laced with sarcasm and self-pity.The fact that Wahlberg is the key figure in this quite boring film, isn't exactly an asset. Let's just say that I'm not really an avid fan of Wahlberg. Frankly, I thought he wasn't that bad as actor in his earlier works such as in "The Perfect Storm" and "The Italian Job", but the last four movies I saw him act in, weren't exactly impressive. "Broken City" was a mediocre film crammed with all sorts of banalities. "Pain &amp; Gain" was painfully bad and "2 Guns" was somnolent. How innocent and timid he looks in the earlier films, the more pretentious and snobbish he is in these last three films. Notwithstanding that this perfectly fits the character he plays in "The Gambler", I thought he wasn't suitable for this role. I can't picture Wahlberg as an intellectual who teaches modern poetry and quotes Shakespeare and Robert Greene in a single sentence. I realized after a while that I know as much about Jim, as he knows about himself. Are you expecting an answer to the question why he maintains such a lifestyle ? I'm sure you will be disappointed.The only thing I enjoyed was the performance of John Goodman as Frank, who is sympathetic but at the same time shouldn't be underestimated. The conversation he has with Jim in the steam room where he shakes rhetorical questions and symbolic equations out of his sleeve, is a superb fragment and a pleasure to watch. In every role Goodman succeeds, no matter how small it is, to lift it to a higher level so it's forever engraved in your memory. I can't think of parts he played that sucked. A true top actor. And then there's Brie Larson and Amy, who according to Jim is a natural talent and can succeed in becoming a reputable writer. Not a distinct role (just like that of Jessica Lange) but the upcoming romance luckily remains superficial.Eventually I doubted whether Jim was a truly seasoned gambler or he's simply a selfish bastard feeding upon his mothers fortune, which he gambles away without blinking an eye and without even thinking about the consequences. A kind of world-weariness which made sure that it didn't matter to me at the end if the roulette ball landed on red or black. Maybe I would have preferred to see those gangsters ripping him apart in the end. Luckily I didn't bet on that ...More reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The gambler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked out at the 1/3 pole. Here is what I saw: Bad gambler who bets all his money on every hand. Then borrows more. Then repeats the bad gambling. Then teaches class where is flatters a student (I thought right away he was after some kitty cat) and even though I didn't stay to see if that happened, I read some other reviews and I was correct.Then he borrows more money so he can bet it all every had until he loses again. Boring.I've got to write a few more lines, so let me say that if you go to Las Vegas and don't particularly like to gamble but want to make one bet of say $100, don't choose Blackjack. Even if you know basic strategy, which makes the game almost even money, the reason you can even up the odds is by knowing when to split pairs and double down. Wahlberg never had any money to do that so the odds against him were huge. The writers avoided this complication by never dealing him a hand where he could have split pairs or should have doubled down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Walhberg as an actor, and I think he's a good actor. This role was a different step for him. I would not have imagined Mark as a one hit wonder novelist turned lit professor from a wealthy background who seems on the road to self destruction due to his gambling habit. He's pulling on his ability to drive a movie, and it works. It's good that Wahlberg's performance was great (despite being very out of content form what we'd expected from him). The movie in itself was not really that good. I felt it acted too much like a sitcom with all our problems being fixed and wrapped up in a thirty minute format (or in this case two hours). Mark Wahlberg made you believe in how real this guy's problems were only for the story itself to contradict that. Mark was not alone in carrying the movie as he also had help from the always great John Goodman, who could have used a lot more time in the film, and Micheal Williams who played a great antagonist to Mark's protagonist For the most part, the movie was humorous and charming all thinks to the acting chops of Markie Mark. I don't know if the academy will take notice, but we all should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wahlberg, Goodman, and Williams are solid and believable in their roles. Not a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Gambler is a poignant tale of a man who is in the grips of one of life's worst addictions. The Gambler is moving in several ways in that you find yourself feeling for the man's family and friends because they are dragged into his dark world as he struggles with a demon that has cost him everything. At the same time you are not only hoping that he will do the right thing and get out as he is given opportunities to do, but you are also fearing for the mans personal safety because he squanders opportunities to pay off an ever mounting debt to men that will stop at nothing to collect. Wahlberg plays the part of the gambler perfectly as do John Goodman and Michael Kenneth Williams as a couple of lone sharks who allow him to get deeper and deeper into the abyss of his addiction. The ending is comforting in knowing that he finally breaks free and will now be able to pursue a normal life with a new love that he has found. Unfortunately, counting on that one last big bet to get yourself out is seldom how it works in real life. The end is dramatic yes, but realistic no. The Gambler is a movie that is well worth watching, but it may hit home for many families who have a loved one who struggles with this terrible addiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gambler (2014): Dir: Rupert Wyatt / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, John Goodman, Brie Larson, Michael K. Williams, Jessica Lange: Film about the dangerous lifestyle where everything is at risk. Mark Wahlberg plays literature professor Jim Bennett whose gambling addiction is so bad that he borrows from one loan shark to pay off another. He owes money and his life has a time limit if he fails to pay up. Michael K. Williams plays one of the loan sharks whom he owes a debt and he threatens to harm a female student whom Bennett is involved if he doesn't pay up. He makes a proposition that involves one of Bennett's students who could go pro in basketball. John Goodman steals moments as another loan shark who loans him money but not without a severe warning. Bennett's addiction is so horrendous that even when he is loaned money, he ends up pissing it all away gambling. This is the case with his frustrated mother, played by Jessica Lange who reluctantly takes her son to the bank where she takes out a large sum of cash. She views her relationship with her son as dead, and worse yet, he doesn't seem moved by her actions. Brie Larson plays a bright literature student who engages with Bennett until they entangle romantically. Well written despite a repetitious structure where Bennett is seen in constant inner torture but freedom can be reached, and the third act wisely wraps this up in a clever manner. Theme addresses addiction, mainly to gambling and how far one's life can spiral out of control and into the depths of despair and gambling with the lives of those around us.

		<shortDescription>Jim Burnett Is Just Too Arrogant For His Own Good Which Makes Him Very Annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to Mark Wahlberg,The Gambler got the endorsement of the star of the 1974 original film,James Caan for the remake.Too bad that the 2014 isn't just good as the original.The story is centered on Jim Burnett,an English Literature professor by day and a gambler at night.He apparently has a gambling addiction caused him to owe more than $240,000 from an underground gambling ring and $50,000 from a loan shark.He was given 7 days to pay everything or he gets killed if he is unable to do so.The film focuses on his journey of paying up his gambling debts as well as the meeting Jim had with his students who remained in his class like Amy Phillips,a potential writing prodigy;Dexter,a talented tennis star, and Lamar Allen,who intends to become an NBA basketball player.Just like what I have said in the first paragraph,watching this film makes me feel like it is not up to par with the original.It begins with the main character,Jim Burnett.I felt that he is an annoying character that would turn off the viewers the same way that he did with majority of his students.I felt that he is just too arrogant for his own good and one would fail to empathize with him in his struggles in paying his debt and his gambling addiction.Also,the relationships he has formed with his students seems fabricated as one would find it difficult to form a sincere relationship with him especially with the way he acts as if the world owes him many things in life.Aside from that,the ending of the film is just faulty considering that there was basically no explanation for Burnett to move on from his gambling addiction.There is no clear transformation seen in him that would have have him leave gambling forever considering that he has not overcome his arrogance nor has he achieved a certain sense of humility. Too bad that Mark Wahlberg can simply be overbearing in portraying arrogant characters as shown in movies like this.</fullReview>

For me it was there and I thoroughly enjoyed it (as did my wife who insisted we watch it again a week later). I really enjoyed the brief table dialogues, one of my favorite succinct quotes being something along the lines of:Walhberg: (Pushes a 10k stack onto the blackjack table) Dealer: That is $10,000 dollars, are you sure... Walhberg: Are you a financial adviser or a dealer?Walhbergs character is pretty unique, and borders on unbelievable, but it very consistent and represents very real emotions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a complete mismatch. Mismatch in casting - why would anyone cast an action movie actor who used to play aggressive muscle blown characters as a professor in a psychological drama about self destruction/gambling. Wholberg acting is a complete disaster. Most of the time he looks bored (bored by his character not by his life as he supposed to) and sometimes angry - I actually had a feeling he will jump on someone at some points. It a mismatch in story telling which is toooo long (I haven't finished watching, hence the score of 1 - can't give more for a movie so in-engaging that I wasn't even willing to watch to the end). It's a mismatch in script - a pseudo intellectual (the first scene in a class room made me laugh), overwhelmed with redundant events and lacking any suspense. I guess I would have to finish this review addressing a question to director, writer and main actor of this movie, a question the main character of The Gambler is struggling with and which is supposed to be the leitmotiv in Gambler: Why would you do anything if you are not anywhere close to be doing it the best possible way there is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Loser Isn't Lovable Just Insufferable -- Worm of "Rounders" is Far More Compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found nothing redeeming, let alone compelling or interesting, in Mark Wahlberg's character Jim Bennett. Certainly, I don't believe audiences always have to "like" a character but they have to be interested in them enough to look forward to their behavior and what happens to them even if you'd never have coffee with them. Edward Norton has made a career of playing unlikeable characters, but they are always compelling, such as Worm, in a similar vein, from "Rounders". Not unlike Bennett, Worm is vain, selfish, and downright stupid, deciding to cheat at cards playing poker with a bunch of municipal cops. But something about Worm always made him fascinating. Worm had strange charm and charisma.In "The Gambler", not only is Bennett vane and selfish, he's also insufferable. When he's clearly ahead at the casino, he'll lay all his winnings on one gamble and then lose. And then he'll do the same thing at another table, constantly losing $1000's at a drop of a hat. His judgment is so bad he makes Worm of Rounders look like Albert Schweitzer! And he does so with not even a crack of a smile, just a perpetual frown. Worm, in his own weird way, is not only tolerable but compelling. Bennett is never so. And then we find a few scenes into the film, he's actually a literature professor. Then I thought, okay, he's a lousy gambler, but maybe he's an inspirational teacher. Wrong. He's just as insufferable as a teacher as he as a gambler. He chastises his students, telling them they have no chance in literature except one student, which he singles out. He tells the rest in fact that they're all losers. He makes Professor Kingsfield of "The Paper Chase" look like a kind-hearted softie. I started feeling like I wanted to avoid this character, and therefore the entire film.So when the main plot sets in regarding Bennett putting up is own life as collateral, I didn't care. I could have cared less what happens to Bennett. The plot device is somewhat similar to "Rounders", where Mike McDermott and Worm put their lives on the line to cough up $15,000 before midnight or they'll turn into pumpkins. As dislike-able a character as Worm is, he's still fun to watch and it's entertaining to see what Worm will do to get himself into more hot water yet again. However, I had no such feelings for Bennett. I started feeling like, yeah, maybe it'll be good for the poor university students if he bites the big one. They wouldn't have to endure his long scolding sessions in which people are either James Joyce's or failures, and maybe someone could be put in his place who actually teaches. Although there is a fine supporting performance by Jessica Lange, ultimately, I couldn't root for the gambler. I just didn't care what happened to him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The second Good Will Hunting", the first thought that came to my mind. I was wondering a long time, if there is any movie that represents the problems of intellectuals in contrast with society, but in this case, with a difference of the origins, but nevertheless with the same golden ending. A cherry on the top is just good job with cameras and Mark's adaptation to the character with Method acting. I nearly wanted to become that professor with suicidal inclinations and existentialism, spreading throughout a TV screen, making me to look deeply into personal problem of ones born into golden beds.Through the movie I never fully understood the character itself, why he was just betting till he lost everything, despite his great intellect and predictability. However in the communication with his mother I saw the reflection of social problems of ones with, at first sight, no problems. The movie which gives you, or show up a new, or different perception is the one, which deserves appreciation and respectability. This movie offers it in some way, but it depends only on the observer to take the gold from it, or to settle with average silver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read some reviews here I can see that we have mixed feelings about The Gambler. Some hate it, some love it. I thought it was an okay movie to watch once. I didn't think it was that boring like some want to make us believe. Mark Wahlberg plays a gambler that isn't very passionate about his life anymore. He just searches for somebody to live for, to give him some passion in his boring life. Due to his lack of passion for anything he creates big debts and he doesn't really care about it. Maybe the debt collectors should have been a bit more violent to make the movie more satisfying to some but to me it was okay. Michael Kenneth Williams gave us a good performance as well. John Goodman with a smaller role was also good in his typical way. I found the soundtrack of the movie really good. It just fitted really well with the story and ambiance.

		<shortDescription>A treatise on emptiness, yet not empty itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing to be said about The Gambler, it is this: its poster is about as indicative as can be. For those who have yet to see the film, gear up for plenty of close-ups of a sullen, recalcitrant Mark Wahlberg fuming silently at the camera, caught somewhere between wordless scream for help and smirk of feigned badassery. Whether or not you have the stomach for two hours of much of the same is a matter of personal preference, but The Gambler, while a necessarily corkscrew of repetitive dour scenarios, explores the nature of emptiness in life, it is far from empty itself.The film, in short, is not an easy watch. Wahlberg's Jim Bennett ? a moderately affluent and successful university English professor and novelist ? such a startlingly persistent downward spiral (he gambles, loses, racks up debt, borrows money from skeazy loan sharks, alienates the few other human beings willing to indulge him with their time, rinse and repeat) that it would seem a cautionary tale about gambling addiction, were it not clear that his true addiction is to maudlin self-punishment rather than the thrill of beating the odds. Almost more unsettling than the black hole of negativity he conjures is his lack of precisely articulated motivation behind it ? is this a mere case of 'poor little privileged rich boy' listlessness, or a deeper, existential lust for purpose in life (need I mention the film is a loose adaptation of the novel of the same title by Dostoyevsky)? It's enough to leave many prospective viewers wondering: what is the point? Why spend two hours with a fairly unlikeable character doing unlikeable things for little to no discernible purpose? A fair question. The answer is to not simply consume the film as a hip urban crime parable, despite the distinctly Michael Mann-esq aesthetic of murky ochre city lights at night director Rupert Wyatt concocts. Bennett is not meant to play is hip or cool, despite his half-hearted pretenses at such, skulking through shady "gambling establishments", eloquently insulting mob bouncers, sunglasses in tow, or lying on a desk, postulating on the frivolity at any attempts at artistry without a genius level of natural talent during his English 101 lectures. The key to character and film alike is to catch the glimmers of doubt twinkling behind the armour of nihilism ? this is not a man who truly cares about nothing, but desperately needs to believe he does. If James Caan's take on the character in the 1974 referent film of the same name was an exploration of unfounded libido, gambling with an almost carnal lust, Wahlberg's is a study of impotence, and the façade of 'I don't care about anything' that creeps up to hide it. 'Bad boy,' 'hipster,' 'tragic antihero,' selfish swipes at James Dean-era cool ? call it what you will, the film cautions, but be aware of how devastating the consequences can be to those trapped in such worldviews, as well as those audacious enough to care about them, here represented by Jessica Lange's bitterly devoted mother, and Brie Larson's enigmatically curious star student (both strong dramatic support here). Indeed, all the cast have tremendous fun spitting out William Monahan (of The Departed fame)'s acerbic script, especially the scene-stealing double-act of loan sharks, Michael Kenneth Williams and the infallibly charismatic John Goodman (now with added baldness and shirtlessness for your viewing pleasure!). Nonetheless, bypassed by the awards circuit as he was, the film is anchored by Wahlberg's deceptively nuanced and magnetic performance. Like Goodman and Williams, we never like Bennett, and really have no reason to keep supporting him, but we are consistently captivated by a bemused, almost perverse curiosity to see just how low he will drag himself. Wahlberg, to his credit, letting only fleeting trickles of a internal geyser of emotions past his mask of flatness, makes the ride a worthwhile one. By the end, we finally get the sense that the whole ordeal, rather than addictive behaviour, was a bizarre social experiment in re-igniting lust for life ? enough so that even the ambiguously upbeat ending rings strangely true in spite of its seeming artifice. The biggest gamble of all, as an audience member, is allowing yourself to see the film through, smirks and sunglasses and all. You just might not be sorry that you did. -7/10</fullReview>

His character is a scumbag in this film and you never like his character even though as the film goes on your meant to. John Goodman is a fantastic actor and he is the best thing in this film for the short time he is in this film. Brie Larson is in this film and she just feels really pointless in this film. The story is just way to convoluted and as I said you really don't care about the protagonist. The romance is really pointless and a real forced part of the film. The script is bad, with clunky dialogue and stupid situations. The style of the film is pretty generic and the pacing of the film is all over the place. Overall this is one of the worst films of 2015 and not worth seeing.</fullReview>

All I know is that James Caan was in the original as well as in this one (although his role in this one is pretty limited, still impactive though).There has been a lot of criticism of Mark Wahlberg, but it's the role he's playing. I have more problems with his Transformers "character" than with his character in this one. The role demands him to have a certain apathy. You will either be annoyed by that or relish in that.

		<fullReview>If you're looking for a good watch, that's well directed, with just the right amount of suspense, this is it. The Gambler pulls you in right from the beginning because the story doesn't take long to get going, and it doesn't slow down; it's paced very well. You're never left with a boring set of scenes that will make you stare at your watch. Wahlberg's serious yet sarcastic acting personality that we're all so used to definitely shines through here, but the entire film fits him like a glove, so no disappointments there. The film is also shot beautifully. Cinephiles can be unforgivingly picky when it comes to technical aspects, but The Gambler's cinematography is actually incredibly noteworthy. More often than not, films that have spot-on cinematography rely more on cinematic aesthetics than substance, lingering on pretentious; not so here. A good, straightforward story, with good, straightforward cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Gambler" is a losing proposition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a movie poster tells you all you need to know about a movie. The poster advertising "The Gambler" (R, 1:51) shows star Mark Wahlberg with an unhappy, couldn't-care-less look on his face. That's the expression he wears for 99% of the movie ? and it reflects his character's attitude perfectly. In the poster, he's standing in front of a plain gray background, as if there's nothing interesting behind this character. That's pretty accurate too. The poster also gives us the title (which lets us know that the movie is about one main character who gambles), and a tagline ? "The only way out is all in", basically telling us that the title character is in over his head, wants to get out and, at some point, will risk everything to accomplish that goal. Boom. Done. Seen the poster? You've seen the movie. I could just give the movie my grade right now, end this review and call it a night, but some of you may be interested in a little more detail and analysis of the film, so I'll give this movie the same treatment that I give all others that I review. Here you go? Wahlberg plays the title character, a high stakes gambler who claims he's not a gambler. Ah, but he is. He's a gambler by night and a college English professor by day. He's not very good at either job ? and he doesn't seem to care. He's surly and rude to everyone he encounters ? his students, dealers at the blackjack tables, people to whom he owes money and even his own mother (Jessica Lange). There seems to be no reason for his bad attitude. At least, the movie doesn't give us any. His family is wealthy and he's a published author whose intelligence landed him a teaching job in which he can alternately berate his students for not caring and offer them a very pessimistic world view with harsh advice to go with it. All he has to do is pass the All American basketball player (Anthony Kelley) in his class, resist the inexplicable advances of another of his students (Brie Larson)? oh, and pay back the $260,000 that he owes two different gangsters (Alvin Ing and Michael Kenneth Williams). Somehow he convinces them (and, later, John Goodman's character) and his mother to loan him even more money, which he inevitably gambles away rather than paying off his previous gambling debts. His lack of good judgment even ends up endangering the few people who at least marginally care about what happens to him.I'm not quite sure what this movie was trying to accomplish, because being entertaining doesn't seem like it was part of the plan. Jim doesn't care about anything or anyone, so why should the audience care about him or what happens to him? If the movie is trying to be a cautionary tale about gambling, it's a lesson that is delivered in a way to which few of us could relate, and is probably obvious enough not to have to be delivered at all. If the story was trying to treat us to an exciting and satisfying conclusion, it failed there too. Many movies released late in the year are mainly meant to showcase the talents of its cast, but, except for Goodman and Williams, everyone in this movie either overacts or underacts, including Wahlberg, who seems simply to be doing a more intelligent, more abrasive, more arrogant version of his character from "Boogie Nights" (1997). This movie's few moments of tension are lost in a sea of apathy ? both on the part of the characters and the audience. "The Gambler" is exactly what its movie poster tells you it is ? a clichéd, two-dimensional story of one thoroughly unpleasant man's struggle and nothing even remotely interesting beyond that. My advice is to see "The Color of Money" (1986), "Rounders" (1998), "21" (2008) or even "Runner Runner" (2013). Just don't risk your money on "The Gambler". It's a losing proposition. "D".</fullReview>

When really, all we have to do is turn to the person next to us and listen, ask them, how they are, and truly listen to what they have to say, then and only then, we see we are not alone, for we are all trying to make our way in this big yet small, lonely but complete, inner and outer simply but complex world of ours. This isn't all about gambling, writing, love, it is a journey into escapism for one who can't even remember what he is escaping from anymore. Thoughts control our actions, conditioned ideology shape our thinking, our primeval instincts class with our conditions and finally we take the shape and form of the thing we never wanted for ourselves in a bandy chain of habits which manifests in the real world as some frenetic, reflexive responsive chicken with his head cut off bereft of logic and reason that makes up the practical goals for our own unique intrinsic being, bereft of hope, aimless ghastly beastly dastard. Thus circumstanced in the wake of our maelstrom we selfishly take no prisoners, leaving behind a walloping scurf by dint of our newfound "disease"; to this I say, stop! Futile to attach to term this crude infantilized behavior - Drop and roll - roll next to someone who really needs a hand and help someone out, give them a sandwich or something I don't know... Just as absurd as this solution may be, is yet infinitely the irresponsible behavior of The Gambler, it is language of the absurd, but that is what makes it so interesting, where did this come from? The protagonist embodies the perfect fleshly vessel slated to have the perfect, pristine, life, inviolate to all the horrors which beset the less fortunate, yet he takes it upon himself sally forth and reverse his largess.

From the cinematography, to the acting, the music and more, there is an overall lack of desperation. It's as if everyone making the film has never experienced desperation or addiction of any sort, which I know can't be true. Even the music is inappropriate and sounds like someone randomly picked tunes from their favorite alternative rock radio station. The romantic subplot is mere fluff and also lacks grit from the casting to the photography and inappropriate music making me feel as if I was suddenly watching a romantic comedy. Why did this UCLA beach blonde love interest work in a underground Asian owned casino? Huh? Shouldn't she have been Asian? And what would a young college student even see in this loser? Some choices just made no sense and were out of date, out of context, and simply not the right tone. I would say even Mark Wahlberg was in over his head and the role was not the right fit for him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You really have to be invested in weather or not Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) makes it out okay to like this movie. Jim acts like a jerk sometimes so it does make it rather difficult to care about him, but at the end of the day, I still do so I liked the movie. It wasn't a masterpiece but I though it was all right. Jim is an English professor, who owes money to loan sharks so he borrows money from other loan sharks as well as his mother. When he starts a relationship with one of his students Amy Phillips (Brie Larson), she gets involved in this spiral too, making the stakes much higher for Jim. The acting is good from everyone all around. Wahlberg does a good job, but the best actor in the film is John Goodman who plays a loan shark named Frank. It's fun to see Goodman's performance. Can I recommend The Gambler? I guess I can put my bets on that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I advise many of you to get a pillow before watching this drivel. Next, prepare to believe what you about to see for the first 20 minutes as much as possible. Then have a mirror to observe your facial expressions if its really the movie or just the mood you happen to be in. Are you still up? Can you bear to listen to more meaningless thoughts spoken aloud by Mark Wahlberg? If so congratulations! Strangely enough I found myself able to sit throughout this movie the second round. Did I forget to mentioned I had guests over during the second viewing? We were busy chatting about family events and Donald Trump. To be fair, my guests are fans of Mark Wahlberg. So what did my guests thought of the movie, some of you folks might ask? In one word, shocking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for everyone, but worth seeing for Wahlberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with the reviewers who have stated this movie isn't for everyone. It's cynical and dark. But it's worth seeing for Walhberg's performance.As much as I like Wahlberg and thought he was excellent in movies like The Departed and Boogie Nights, I didn't think he had much range in terms of the characters he could play. This film proves that notion wrong. Entirely wrong.In this film he plays an emotionally damaged and self-destructive intellectual. He's riveting. There are some great, complex monologues in the picture. He delivers them effectively. It doesn't feel strained. He also delivers a lot of subtlety while conveying the emotional pain and frustration of Jim Bennett. And in numerous scenes, he's paired up with hugely talented people like John Goodman, Michael Kenneth Williams, and Jessica Lange, and he absolutely holds his own.Obviously, the massive weight loss he undertook for this role was a huge commitment. I'd say he equaled that physical commitment with his acting chops. It's a first rate performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Script, Bad Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie I can remember where I felt sorry for the loan sharks. Based on writer credits and history, this film attempts to remake the 1974 film of the same name that starred James Caan, Paul Sorvino, and Lauren Hutton. It doesn't work. Mark Wahlberg as a literature professor is a stretch. But the script gives him mostly pompous disconnected dreck lines for the entire movie, so as an actor he never stands a chance in this role. All three of the students whom he characterizes as geniuses are willingly amoral for him on the spur of the moment, not believable at all. Got to wonder if the writer of this bomb of a screenplay has a problem with other peoples' genius. I did enjoy John Goodman's performance, which reminded me some of his character in O Brother Where Art Thou.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very interesting movie, which is about money, of course</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched it last night and still thinking about it. It has resonated with me, simply because at the end of the day, everyone has financial worries/responsibilities and everybody gambles at some point in life; not only at casino settings.The way this guy perceives money is quite interesting and although it may look alien to most of us, it is this feeling exactly that keeps us gambling more (and watching the film, by the way ;)). It has some "fight club" glimpses, with the "bad" guys being overly smart and intelligent, rather the plain-old villains that get outsmarted in the end. Here, the scenarios played are simple and not in this particular order; lose-lose, win-lose, win-win; just like in life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happens when you make a movie based on Literature.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thoroughly pleased with this film for what it was. While some of the story arc may have been lacking, as a character study this film delivers leaps and bounds. Should one not have any background of existentialism, this film does admittedly become hard to reconcile. Viewing the film as an adequate portrayal of a gambling addict does leave a lot to be desired. When viewing the film as a depiction of the works of Satre, Dostoevsky, and Camus it changes the scope entirely. The inability for people to like the film based on Jim Bennett's qualities just adds to the films effectiveness. We can't accept the harsh reality that someone seemingly given everything still struggles with with the meaninglessness of existence. He found in gambling a way to ward off that pervasive feeling, that what he failed to find in literature or what society had proscribed. Whalberg gives a brilliant performance in an exceptional work of symbolism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of the 1974 movie with James Caan, worthwhile study in gambling addiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this on DVD from my public library. After seeing it and looking it up on IMDb I found that it is pretty much the same movie with different character names, but essentially the same story based on the same book. Of course after 40 years the amounts of money have gone way up!Mark Wahlberg is English professor Jim Bennett. As the movie begins we see him at the hospital bedside of a dying older man, we find out it is his grandfather. There is some sort of cryptic communication, seems Jim has become like his grandfather but we never really find out what that conversation meant.Outside the classroom Jim lives a darker life, he seems to be a pretty good gambler, but he has a giant flaw. He does not know when to quit. He may start with $10,000 and bet it all on a blackjack hand, win, then bet it all again. After a few times it is inevitable, he will lose it all, will it be $40,000 or $80,000 or $160,000? John Goodman has a good role, he is not a good man, would not hesitate to kill someone for failing to pay a big debt, but he gives Jim the speech - you gotta learn to put aside your winnings and build it up gradually. Then when you have a couple of $ Million you can invest it, live off the earnings, and live well. But Jim has a compulsion, he doesn't want part of it, he wants it all. His desire to win and win again overpowers his good sense to quit while he is ahead. There is no gambler alive who can win every hand of blackjack, so he is always on a path to going broke.The movie plays out well, it would be boring if all we ever saw was Jim borrowing money, losing it all, then trying to borrow more. But a girl, one of his students, gets involved. He may see something else to live for. The last half-hour or so gets more interesting as Jim wrangles a couple of deals to get him out of trouble, one involving a star athlete and arranging for a point-spread bet. I have not seen the 1974 version with Caan, I will if I get a chance. SPOILERS: As all of his large debts are reconciled after the basketball bets and the one large roulette bet on black, Jim thinks of the girl, and in a long sequence we see him begin to run, for a long distance, starting in the dark and finishing at daybreak. It was symbolic of his running from his addiction and setting his sights on a more normal life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie because i read the comments here on IMDb. I love to decide by myself about "uneven" matters and so I did. Surprised but the depth, I'm writing this review.No, this movie is NOT about a self-destructive man. It's not at all about a gambling problem either. I really don't understand how people can pick up the shallow side dish and translate it into a main course. Those people will probably don't understand what I'm writing here either. If you're blind, will it help if I give you a pair of very strong glasses?You'll need to look past the gambling to see the true meaning. This movie is deeper then it first seems but do give it a chance to present the feeling of importance, the importance of values, the value of freedom, the freedom of feeling and of course a very well put "fuck you".I gave it an 8/10 because of some lacking elements and a bit of bitter Hollywood mark (you'll know when it comes). Good job. Nice surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."The Gambler" (2014) is not the most memorable movie, but it's enjoyable while it lasts. Performances were good, writing was solid, but inconsistent. Directing was nice, at running time 1 h 50 min this movie drags a bit but not to much - it's a well made and watchable picture. The problem is that after it will over, you will quickly forget it as it doesn't told us a new or original story and it doesn't have strong "spine".Overall, "The Gambler" isn't about gambling, it's more of a character study. This movie is well made, but it isn't original and it won't have lasting appeal. It's worth watching if you have nothing else to watch, you will have a nice time, but after it will over, you will quickly forget this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True remake of a sleeper classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life events hit us hard. It's an almost too often told story, something horrible happens close to the protagonist and it's sets in motion a suicidal path which unveils the darker nature of the character and forces us to look at the darker nature of ourselves. Whether it be Looking For Mr. Goodbar, Leaving Las Vegas, or The Gambler; a story well told saves us as it brings us down. The trick is to portray that dark nature with absolute abandon and perfection of poor judgement and risky behavior. Such a portrayal is one of the hardest things to do on screen. Mark Walhberg took a big risk doing it, and he did it to perfection. As a straight artistic vessel this is not a great piece. The many talented actors playing alongside Wahlberg are mistreated, abused, and their talents underutilized. The sets and costumes were only OK, and there were many scenes in the movie that were hard to believe could happen in real life. Some examples of these are; walking into a bank and asking for $260,000 in cash, bank branches don't keep anywhere close to that much cash around anymore. If I were to be a party to fixing a sporting event, I probably would not show up to said event, for the first time ever, with visible recent lacerations on my face. And the choice to have the college student, love interest character drive around in a late 80s Yugo seemed like a bad one. I think trying to match the gritty nature of the original may have caused a partial development of a stylized world that was distracting. This also seemed to cheapen what was otherwise a very true unflinching look at this man's reality.There also seemed to be a scene by scene start stop attempt in the film. References made to characters well developed in the original, which made little sense in the context of the remake.Walhberg put so much in this film, and yet another stand out supporting role brought in by John Goodman, rivaling his role in Flight, that these can be overlooked.It took a lot of guts to remake such a challenging movie. Where it counted Walhberg and the film bring it home, and forty years from now, they'll be calling this the sleeper hit of 2015.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many of the previous reviewers, I greatly enjoyed Lange and Goodman in this movie. The rest of it was, in my opinion, tired and unimaginative. It was actually painful to watch at times, with no payoff. Using worn-out, negative stereotypes of Black and Asian people, for a film made in 2014, was really disappointing. With the talented cast, a much more entertaining film could have been made. *Spoiler* (of sorts) Did anyone else notice, in the end, the girlfriend (shown from the back, with her blonde hair catching the light) looked very much like the mother? Perhaps it was unintentional, but it was amusingly Freudian to my eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gritty Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Gambler is a movie that you will need to concentrate on as gambling man Bennett (Wahlberg) navigates in between a swirling mix of gangsters, students, and other characters. His mysterious character is slowly revealed, but always leaves us wondering about what motivates a person with everything to seemingly intentionally lose it. The cohesiveness of a varied mix of characters is well maintained as some of their lives become intertwined. Wahlberg's blunders are often so costly that that it is difficult to keep watching. Wahlberg's stark portrayal of a man who is willing to lose everything is well played. Often quiet, but sometimes passionate about things. In scenes where we see him quiet and expressionless, usually after one of his catastrophic and self destructive actions, one can't help to wonder what is going through his mind. Bit by bit some of that is revealed. The Gambler can be hard to watch, but in a way it's emblematic of his own struggles with himself, and also testament to the film's ability to invest us emotionally in the life of Jim Bennett.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is a college professor who has a huge gambling problem: he loses most of the time. He owes money to 3-loan sharks and always claims he doesn't have their money, but needs a stake to get back in the game to pay them back. This doesn't work often, but it's the only avenue he has to work everything out. We cringe as we see Jim go down the road to self-destruction and hope the best for him, but his comments belie any hope of redemption. When he wins (and we are talking big money usually at Black Jack), he puts it all back and brazenly tells the loan sharks he doesn't have their money, and has no hope of getting it for them. Of course, he gets beaten up often, and it looks like he welcomes that at times. Note the word "brazenly" as he is brazen to a fault as he doesn't cower before them. He's almost defiant. His student Amy (Brie Larson) seems to have him pegged: you are a perfect example of how a person who can start out with no problems, and then goes out to get all of them. Nothing seems to phase him. He is locked into gambling mode although he keeps saying he is not a gambler. He says he wants love and the happy life, but believes he has no talent to achieve any of that and continues to gamble.Notables: George Kennedy (yeah, I thought so too, but there he was), Jessica Lang (still good and going strong as Jim's mother, his rich mother), Andre Braugher, Richard Schiff, and John Goodman who we wished kept his shirt on. He was one of the loan sharks). When we see movies like this we believe and hope we will see a happy ending. Well, we were warned long ago to be careful what we wished for. I did like the way these loan sharks talked to Bennett and they sort of gave him the benefit of doubt probably because they know he CAN get their money if he would only comply and not put all the winnings back. Yeah, right. The acting all around is very good but this is not a cup of tea for everyone as we don't like watching a person self-destruct. Does this save itself? Sort of, we think. (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, very briefly when Jim goes to a strip bar. Langjuage: Yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to go middle ground on this one. I enjoyed the performances and it was watchable but I just didn't like the story or the lead. The John Goodman character said it best, who can feel anything but disgust for the main character. I get that he is unhappy, unfulfilled and suicidal but there is no real explanation as to why, other than silver spoon mouth disease. And he is not satisfied self-destructing on his own, so he brings his students in to his pity party. At least the story was fairly unpredictable although I was hoping for a nice twist to save it. Even if he killed himself in the end it would be better than his mad dash to the arms of one of his students. It is not likely that relationship will last any longer than him being free of debt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't gamble in what is an addictive watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever there was an anti gambling film, this is it. This film just shows what an addiction, gambling is, and what d..kheads they are. Why do people do it? For this gambler, Jim Bennett (Wahlberg in one of best ever performances) who bets big, and loses big (just see how big). The question here, posed in the movie, is why, the answer is for us audience to figure. I didn't know until later, that this was a remake. I never saw the original, but I was a bit p..sed to learn that, as Hollywood is now taking this just too far, with remakes, as though the think tank is losing it's volume. Jim is also a college professor, and of course, he falls in love with one of the students, a prized and pretty student (Brie Larson) who I must say looked hot at the start, who is seen working at this underground casino on the outskirts of the L.A freeway. The opening scene with the great George Kennedy on his death bed, with Wahlberg, says everything about son and grandfather relationship, but it would of been better with Kennedy playing the father. The movie doesn't wasn't you to know much about the characters, the mains are here and there, so we're more focused on Wahlberg. We feel Wahlberg's pain, but also feel anger at the character he is, and the suicidal path he's taking. Gambling is a terrible disease, and I urge people with this kind of addiction to see this, where it's ending there's beautiful light at the end of tunnel, played against a wonderful soundtrack. Other great performances are from a much more flabby Goodman (keep your shirt on please) as a loan shark, you don't wanna mess with. Lange, fantastic as usual, has still got it, playing as Wahlberg's mum, while Michael Kenneth Williams added some nice menace as a collector, with heart and a conscience, where you don't see many of these characters come with these. You can't overlook Wahlberg's performance, of Oscar status, or definitely worth of some acting accolades. This is one performance of his you gotta see, in a movie you gotta see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't go in expecting a crime thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it's heavily marketed as a crime thriller, it would be best to approach Rupert Wyatt's remake of 'The Gambler' as a character study. A study of at times a confusing and unlikable protagonist, but an engaging one nonetheless. Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg), the grandson of one of the richest men in California, is a failed writer/literature professor who gambles recklessly. It seems that he is deliberately trying to lose and propel himself deeper and deeper into debt. Perhaps this is a means of punishing himself for his failed dreams, or maybe he just gets a buzz from the risk involved. I've never counted myself as a huge Wahlberg fan, generally due to his constant portrayal of aggressive alpha-male types in action films, but I'm going to have to say that this is one of his best roles, up there with his performances in 'Boogie Nights' and 'The Departed'. The actor's radical weight loss, as well as his perpetually shabby and unhealthy state all contribute to the impression of a very emotionally troubled man, one who attempts to hide behind a confident exterior. He may not have been the best choice for the role, but he does do a very good job nonetheless. Even though they receive only about two to three scenes each, John Goodman and Jessica Lange give standout performances, as a somewhat sympathetic loan shark and Bennett's worried yet preoccupied mother, respectively. At times the screenplay doesn't clearly lay out why Bennett acts in such a self-destructive manner, thereby making him quite an alienating figure to the audience. We're really left with hints to piece together what comprises the professor's troubled psyche. He comes across as someone who has lost direction in his life, as a result embracing any sort of intense thrill he can get, as well as the suffering resulting from it. Through his interactions with other characters, it seems that he gradually gets some of that direction back. Though I haven't seen the original 1974 film starring James Caan (which I've heard is a far superior production), the contemporary remake I still found to be a worthwhile experience. Maybe people were expecting a more action-oriented crime film due to the casting of Wahlberg, or were just plain confused and put off by the somewhat unlikable nature of his character, but I was able to relate to him to a degree, and found the film's ending to be oddly uplifting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring film about the dangers of gambling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film opens with a clicking sound. This is merely the first of many good sounds in this film. The music is played realistically, as the characters in the film would really listen to it, before then turning it off. This happens at least three times in the film and it is very impressive. Some very good work here by Director Rupert Wyatt who previously directed 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' (2011), which restarted the Ape saga, in the modern era, with it's story of a drug making a super-smart ape. That film had lots of emotion and empathy for the audience as well as the film's apes and humans. By contrast, 'The Gambler' is not a film to get emotional about. The main characters are unpleasant and exhibit no empathy, and we exhibit none to them either.The opening scene of 'The Gambler' is a hospital death scene. This is followed by Mark Wahlberg, who plays the eponymous gambler, going to a casino where he is watched by a wide-eyed waitress.It is clear from these opening scenes, that the gambler, is in fact a compulsive gambler, an addict. This compulsive behaviour seems authentic, but perhaps not all the different bets made are though. An expert opinion from someone who has been involved in Gamblers Anonymous would be interesting regarding this. The film does show well the gambling, the mechanics and reality of it, as well as the dangers and follies of it. This is the heart of the film, as the gambler continues to gamble, gets into debt, and gets into trouble.The gambler is played well by Mark Wahlberg, who is also film producer. His character here is ambiguous, like the role he played in 'The Corrupter' (1999). It is certainly more subdued than his role in 'The Departed' (2006), though there are hints of some of that same wild hyper-active character.The gambler is in fact a literature professor. As a teacher he is not very good. Thus rather like Hugh Grant's character in the 2014 comedy 'The Rewrite'. Some critics say that he is a worse teacher but I found the two teachers to be roughly on a par. The best literature teacher of last year, in the Hitchcockian 'Love is the Perfect Crime', was also the worst as a man. By comparison Hugh Grant's and Mark Wahlenberg's professors are not truly bad people.In 'The Gambler', like in 'The Rewrite', there are some scenes of the professor at work, thus again like the other film we are introduced to some of his students, and again they play a part in the story. Brie Larson gives a tremendous performance, Emory Cohen in a smaller part is also good. However Anthony Kelley, making his film debut, is truly impressive. His, is one of the few fleshed out characters, that also seem believable.There is also good support from Jessica Lange. Another character who seems realistic, she is also the one with the most emotional scenes. John Goodman plays the shy Little Frank. He is clearly a part of the criminal milieu. Mr Goodman's character is not the fun drug-dealing character of 'The Flight' (2012). Rather, it is more like the sinister criminal he played in 'Death Sentence' (2007). Whilst carving out a new career in recent years with these more heavy roles, his earlier roots in comedy are not neglected either, as in his lighter roles in such films as 'Argo', or last year's 'The Monuments Men'. Frank's side-kick Big Ernie, is played by Domenick Lombardozzi. Although only a small part, again this is one of the very few believable characters in the film. Last year, Mr Lombardozzi gave a similarly convincing performance in 'God's Pocket'. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the 'The Gambler' is trying to figure out the actual mechanics and scenario for how Big Ernie got his nickname.The most unrealistic aspect to the film is in regard to the borrowing and lending of money. Addicts, especially gambling addicts, will run up debts and borrow money, but only if people are willing to lend them money. This is the main flaw of this film. The scenarios in the film are just not believable. No one would lend money in those situations.This film, and a previous one starring James Caan, are loosely based on a novella of the same name written by Fyodor Dostoevsky.Some technical aspects regarding borrowing and gambling:'Points' charged on borrowed money need to be paid every week until the entire debt is payed off.The winning hand, in the card game featured in the film, is 21, or the highest number under 21.'The Line' or 'The Spread' was invented to handicap sports games. You can bet that a team will get more or less of a margin in the points than they were expected to. A later innovation of the half point was introduced to avoid ties.The film does not delve heavily into the mechanics of gambling so no previous knowledge is required before seeing the film.Although boring and dull, the film is a good warning of the dangers of heavy gambling. 9/10.Near the end of the film is a very long scene, it is worth seeing in it's entirety, the actual final scene, itself short, follows it.</fullReview>

I give 10 out of 10 for this movie, I give a score of 1 out of 10 for the reviews posted thus far. I thought I just invented the word me-ism, but apparently it is already on Wikipedia so I accept I am also pretentious, who isn't. I want to thank Mark Wahlberg for entertaining me so thoroughly, a purely selfless endeavor on Mark's part, Mark if you want to invite me over to LA for drinks I am there bro. I will put my dancing boots on and my drinking hat on and am happy to occupy any one of the spare rooms in your mansion. I like to gamble, and as Nietzsche said man is somewhere between animal and superman, I think gambling is all about trying to escape from mediocrity and thank you Mark for reinforcing my philosophy. It is nice when your deepest, darkest thoughts are played out on screen in front of you. When internet trolls/Luddite's/and a new word I will invent right now which I would call analists, decide to post reviews, pause for a moment, and take time to appreciate the craft of a great guy like Mark who has made a sincere effort to entertain us in this particular case and has succeeded. Here is a word of advice to all of you sad little wannabes out there, watch a movie, enjoy it, and then say thank you to the people who made the film, it is what is commonly known as being a polite, civilized, decent human being. If you don't like the movie then go back to your horrible life and annoy your neighbor or your partner which is probably a 24 hour scenario for you, but do not share your sad little thoughts with the intelligent majority.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is full of risks and rewards, but these are often part of life's cycles. But for Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) it becomes a way of life as he enters the world of high risk gambling. All is well until he gets a bit over his head and reaches out for some financial loan shark help and even leans on his mother as he pushes his luck. This movie takes you to the seeder side of gambling and the balance between being on a winning streak and knowing when to walk away. Because no matter how lucky you think you might be, it is sure to end. Another dynamic is Bennett's love interest, who is also a student. For me the best part of the movie is the lesson from Frank (John Goodman). Frank is a loan shark but serves as a mentor of sort for this young hot shot. He reiterates that you always save your reserve because you want to come from a "F-U" position than simply holding on. This high stakes fast moving film is full of mischievous hijinks. Fun movie.

		<shortDescription>Great Film! But might go over your head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a truly fantastic film. Good enough to see twice in theaters (I never do this). I suspect the reason why so many people dislike the movie is because of how subtle and demanding it is on the concentration of the audience. This isn't a movie that you can tie half your brain behind your back and still know what's going on. I find it funny that our protagonist is a Literature professor. Now, not too many people LIKE actual literature. This movie is like that. A very "literary" type of film that deserves serious consideration. It's not Ninja Turtles or Terminator 6. It is a film that tells us something about human nature, about what it means to be alive, and needs to be approached the same way you might read "The Stranger" featured in the film or Shakespeare. Maybe boring to some, but deep and rewarding for those with the head for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE GAMBLER': Four Stars (Out of Five) Remake to the 1974 high-stakes crime drama flick, of the same name, starring James Caan. This film stars Mark Wahlberg as a lit professor with a secret, obsessive, gambling addiction. It was written by William Monahan, who also co-wrote 'THE DEPARTED', and directed by Rupert Wyatt, who also helmed 'RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES' (which is funny given the fact that Wahlberg also starred in Tim Burton's 2001 'PLANET OF THE APES' remake). The movie costars Brie Larson, John Goodman, Michael K. Williams and Jessica Lange. None of the characters are very likable (especially it's lead) but the film is beautifully shot and full of clever, witty dialogue.Wahlberg plays Jim Bennett; a literature professor with a second (hidden) life as a high-stakes gambler. He's recently gotten himself into some serious trouble with local gangsters, due to his gambling addiction and excessive accrued debt. While trying to pay back the dangerous criminals, he also tries out an intriguing relationship with one of his students (Larson). No matter how much danger he keeps putting himself into, and loved ones, he still can never stop gambling.The film is a lot like a serious drama flick about a self destructive alcoholic, or anyone with a dangerous addiction. It's extremely depressing, and frustrating, in how Wahlberg's Bennett character can't stop gambling; no matter how much damage it does to him or anyone close to him. For that reason I could never truly like Bennett but I did continue to root for him (of course). Although most of the characters in the movie are all pretty morally depraved, it is still a fast paced and impressively suspenseful film. Wahlberg is great in it, Larson is beautiful and stunning to watch, the dialogue is always fun, and interesting, and the visuals are consistently beautiful to look at (as well). It's almost always entertaining but definitely not a feel- good movie.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/zsvb7ypwxL4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Gambler" is what I could call an infuriating movie. There was practically nothing that I truly liked about this movie. Now, in general, I can see why people would enjoy this movie. When it finished in my theater, there was a man who actually started clapping when the credits began to roll. It can be assumed that from this reaction, he enjoyed the movie. As for me, when the credits rolled (as well as in many other points in this movie,) I threw my hands up in the air and said "What the hell?"The plot to this movie, overall, was sloppy and honestly pretty stupid. The movie centered itself around this one college professor who is also a gambling addict. He's suicidal, he's an asshole, and he is being loaned money from not one, but multiple loan sharks, which he then uses to gamble to try to pay it back, and ends up losing it. This is EASILY the more protagonist that I have ever seen in ANY movie. He screwed himself into a situation, keeps screwing himself further into the situation, and keeps going to try and eventually screw himself out of the conversation. Which is ridiculous. This guy went based on pure luck rather than planning out his strategy to gamble. Now normally, when people gamble, they tend to put a little money in, withhold most of what they have, and pile it on top of that, taking out money as they go along. 9 times out of 10 in this movie, the protagonist went in with a pile of money, turned it into the least amount of chips as possible, and then bets it all at one time. Now, he would get lucky and win, then his money would double. Now, rather than pulling 10,000 of his now 20,000 out, he bets it all again. He would do this, get up to about 80,000, continues to just bet it all, immediately gets screwed over and loses.Now if that is not bad enough, he is spending this entire movie trying to pay back his loan sharks. He gets ALL of the money to pay back, and then go into a casino, and gambles for hours until he loses every cent of it. I mean what the hell? Who in the right mind seriously does that? I couldn't like this protagonist because he was just a freaking idiot. The only time I did like was either when he was getting hit in the face, or when he was teaching (because he is an asshole to his students and it's hilarious.)Now, the creators of this movie obviously tried, and it shows. It just didn't work. They tried time and time again to throw in some form of tension. "OH! We will kill you if you don't get us our money!" Or "OH! Is he going to win this bet?" But honestly, I was never feeling any of this so called "tension" when I don't care what happens to the main character. I didn't care if the loan sharks broke every bone in his body. I didn't care if they killed his new girlfriend, which SPOILER, is one of his students.The only part of this movie that I can give credit to is the last loan shark that the protagonist goes to see in this movie. By the way! Another dumb idea. I can only picture the protagonist thinking to himself "Oh man! I am getting screwed by the mob! Let me go see ANOTHER mob boss to get me out of this situation!" Anyways, the last loan shark is no doubt the best, the funniest, and my favorite character in this movie. And I can give a little bit of credit because I can tell that they at least tried to make a good movie. It just didn't happen."The Gambler" in general, despite how much they tried, was not a good movie. It is something that I can see people enjoying, but honestly? It's not worth seeing at all. I can't recommend this movie to anyone. Don't bother spending money on this movie. Go see "The Imitation Game", that film is much better. Final Review Score: 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Character Centered Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be a delightful surprise. I hadn't heard much about this movie so I went in expecting it to be a sort of run-of-the- mill movie about gambling. This movie is really not about gambling, or at least not in the sense that you would think. This is definitely a movie I feel is one people will leave theaters with different opinions.Mark Wahlberg gives a great performance, maybe even the best he's ever given. I think he gave a lot to the role and created a character that should be disliked, and probably would be if played by other actors.Jessica Lange, John Goodman, Michael Kenneth Williams, Brie Larson, Anthony Kelley, and George Kennedy all give good performances as well, no matter how big or small of a part they had they gave their characters life.The direction was good and the script had some really great dialogue, but something was missing that I really could not give it five stars. Certain scenes could have been more tense, while others I feel could have been left out. Highly recommend to anybody who enjoys a good character study.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only real gamble in this film is if you should sit through the whole thing (either way you loose) 2014's 'The Gambler' sucks. It's a bad movie by definition. The plot is barely held together, bonds are made and destroyed without informing the audience on whether or not we should care, Wahlberg's character is impossible to follow and on top of all of that, it's boring.The main issue I have here is Mark Wahlberg's character. He's just impossible to like or feel bad for - especially since he's a hateful racist in real life who karma somewhere missed so he's living the good life. He'll say one thing then contradict himself in the next sentence. I know what your thinking, what if that's how he's supposed to act. Well, that's what I thought for a while but then the film makes it quite clear that his character does have his own rules and there is a type of mold he should fit. so that's frustrating. He's also a college English professor ... just because...All this is so unfortunate because the other characters in the film are great. They all seem to have their own rich stories and are genuinely interesting. Brie Larson's character however is also just as confusing and lazy as Wahlberg's.The film also misuses many simple transitional methods. Director Rupert Wyatt, for some reason, used these continuous time-laps steady shots instead of a simple montage. There is also a scene where we see Brie Larson walking while listening to music and the whole thing is edited seemingly at random and Brie herself seems confused and slightly handicapped.Jokes aside, this film could have been good. If Rupert Wyatt could have just pulled everything tighter and gave the characters more likable traits and continual beliefs, the film would have greatly improved. There was some good symbolism in the film and it's always nice seeing John Goodman (who makes a slight Big Lebowski reference).The ending is alright too (though a pretty complete rip off of Sideways (2004)).I honestly can't recommend this film. it's a confusing mess that thinks it has some profound messages but in reality bring nothing to the table.

		<shortDescription>Why Should I Care?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember years ago watching a movie called "Less than Zero" with a young Robert Downey Jr. He was a hopeless junkie from a wealthy family. His family disowned him and no matter how deep he got with his dealer he couldn't stop. It was a depressing movie. "The Gambler" is in the same vein.Mark Wahlberg plays the multi-layered, philosophical teacher/gambler, Jim Bennett. He's an excellent gambler, he just doesn't know when to quit. When Jim wasn't being a fast talking, existential associate professor he was being a fatalistic gambler with a debt.I suppose there could have been more drama if I actually cared about what happened to Jim. He was so flippant, careless and irresponsible with his behavior that it definitely bordered on suicidal. Should I care about a person who doesn't care about himself? I think a lot of us do. I guarantee there is someone we care more about their success than they do. It may be your kid, it may be your sibling, it may be your favorite ball player, or a character in a movie. We want them to live, we want them to thrive, we want them to be winners, even if they don't.If "The Gambler" made me think about anything it is: why do we care about people who don't care about themselves? Why would the city of San Francisco spend millions of dollars to suicide-proof the Golden Gate Bridge? Why do we make sure criminals don't arbitrarily enter a guilty plea? Why do we stress about our kids' grades more than they do? We want everyone to live and to live comfortably. "The Gambler" could not have cared less about his life, hence his horrible decisions--but others did and initially so did I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** Re-make of the James Caan 1974 film of the same name based on the Fydodor Dostoyevsky classic "The Gambler" has to do with a man completely out of control who destroys himself as well as those around him in his compulsive gambling habit. Played by an Nazi concentration camp survivor looking Mark Wallberg who lost as much as 60 pounds for the part the "Gambler" collage English professor Jim Bennett is first seen talking to his soon to be departed Grandpa Ed, George Kennedy, as he's lying on his deathbed waiting for the end to come. Jim is told by Grandpa Ed that he has nothing to give him to help Jim out in his money problems since he-it seems to run in the family- himself is flat broke. Jim now concentrates on local loan sharks to help him out in his gambling adventures who despite having second thought about landing him cash end up giving him over 200 thousand dollar that he blows almost over night in a number of local gambling dens! It's when Jim hits rock bottom that he goes on his hands and knees to to see his mom Mrs. Roberta, Jessica Lange, for much needed cash, to pay off his loan sharks, who ends up giving the helpless gambler her entire life savings of $250,000.00 to keep him from ending up dead. While all this is happening Jim strikes up a relationship with one of his students Amy Phillips, Brie Larson, buttering her up in thinking she's the next Walt Whitman and helping her out in her school work. This doesn't last that long in Amy soon finding out that Jim is a total degenerate who's only interested in blowing every cent he has at the nearest casino. With his life now on the line to pay back his lenders Jim goes even lower by getting the collage star basketball player Lamar Allen, Anthony Kelley, to shave points in the big upcoming champion basketball championship final so the mob he's into can by betting against the spread get their money that they lent him back.Mark Wahlberg as Jim Bennett did his best in almost starving himself to death for the part to show that as a compulsive gambler with all the hundreds of thousands that went through his fingers he didn't even bother to have enough cash to buy himself a square meal. Bire Larson &amp; Jessica Lnage the two women, Amy &amp; Roberta, in Bill's miserable life brought out how unfeeling he was even for those who went out of their way to help him out in overcoming his wild and mindless gambling pursuits. The ending was much like the one in the 1974 version with Jim making his big score but had him try to get his both act and life together not like he did over and over in the film destroy it. By him not trying to get himself killed, like James Caan, in a seedy whorehouse by a hooker's pimp that he refuses to pay for her services. It's in that case where the new version of the "Gambler" was better then in the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like " The idiot"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously let me explain by writing the title as "The Idiot". The Gambler as the title of this really for me just doesn't work, Mark Wahlberg does give a good performance it was the writing of this film that gets to me. It starts out great, yes he gambles in an underground game put up in a mansion for sale which looks like Malibu California, but he's gambling in the same establishment that he owes $240,000 too. Now who lets a man walk in and gamble when they know he owes this amount of debt, not me. The film goes on he has to payback his debt and another $50,000 that he borrowed yo try and win back what he just lost. Now he is up to something like $180,000 but then he decides to put it all on black, he loses. Of coarse he had to lose because where would the film go if he had won, but the normal person takes $50,000 out of the stack you just won on blackjack to pay the man back, then go ahead and gamble on the rest. The film goes on with a 7 day window that he has to pay back this debt, eventually John Goodman gets involved and lends him the money, but before that his mother comes to him and gives him the money that he owes. Now in our world we don't have a bail out mother that if we lose a quarter of a million dollars she will be there to fix our problem, all is well. That's where this film gets it wrong, they should have written that she gives him say, $50,000 a decent amount that you could gamble on hoping to double if not triple it. But no, the writing is just weirdly off in this film, he gets the money and instead of paying it back he goes to an Indian casino and blows it all on blackjack?! Really? That's what you guys wrote Mark Wahlbergs character to do? Wow. Maybe I'm confused I don't know. Through out the film he's being harassed for the initial $50,000 that he borrowed in the first place, he keeps threatening Walhbergs character but no real threat was ever felt, maybe in the swimming pool scene you should have seen his college student/love interest maybe tied up, or a video he has to watch showing her while she's sleeping, something that would make you feel for Mark's character that yes, he has to gamble and win to get this debt paid back. This movie lacks on a lot of levels, I do enjoy gambling, I love movies. Just not this one.</fullReview>

Addiction, whether it's alcohol, drugs or gambling, can be a disapproving, cold subject with judgments being made on the person abusing them. Jim knows full well he's addict. Wahlberg's a convincing gambler, but less so as the vibrant English teacher with enough corn to harvest. Jim ambles on, infuriating the wrong people, especially those closest to him. Brie Larson carries the expands the story somewhat with her incomprehensible liking for Jim, but others, including mob bosses John Goodman and Michael Kenneth Williams, talk the talk but don't walk the walk. There's room for Jim to play bad guy and none whatsoever for redemption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsatisfying drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not (yet) seen the original 1974 movie this remake is based on, though I'm sure it's a lot better, which brings up the question as to why Hollywood likes to remake good movies instead of remaking movies that had good ideas but bad executions. Anyway, I found this remake to be somewhat unsatisfying. It has some good things on its edges - John Goodman gives a very good performance as a mobster, for one thing - but its core (mainly with the title figure) is simply inadequate. The title figure is extremely hard to pin down. I didn't really see why we in the audience should be interested in this character. It's not that he's an unlikable guy; he is, but he seems so disinterested in his dire predicament that it's hard to feel anything for this guy, whether it's sympathy or interest in seeing where he's headed to. Also, I think the filmmakers made a mistake casting Mark Wahlberg in the title role. While Wahlberg has been okay in other movies, he isn't believable playing someone who is really *obsessed* with a major vice. (And it's also hard to believe him as a college professor.) I will admit that the movie isn't really boring despite its flaws and a nearly two hour running time, but more likely than not you'll somewhat regret betting on this movie to entertain or enlighten you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Storyline seemed like it was going round and round in circles. 5/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I was really looking forward to this film because I'm usually a fan of Mark Wahlberg's work but I found it quite frustrating because the storyline kept on going round and round in circles. Its about a English teacher whose addicted to gambling and has a self destructive nature. He keeps on borrowing money from gangsters to pay for his addiction and when he finally gets the money from his wealthy money to pay back them back, he ends up gambling it all away again. With the killers on his tail and a 7 day dead line, his self destructive mannerisms gets him deeper in trouble with the gangsters which leads to an intense showdown once the clock stops ticking. I really didn't have any sympathy for the main character because he had loads of chances to help himself. I understand that he has an addiction which is tough to overcome but his overall attitude was awful. He didn't care who he hurt along the way and by the end of the film, it really didn't feel like he turned himself around to become a better person. The acting isn't bad from the whole cast and I was impressed with Wahlberg's scenes as a teacher but I was expecting more from the film. Personally, if I was one of the gangsters, I would have killed him just for his bad attitude but it was obvious that they all felt sympathy for him. Anyway, it's a watchable movie which does have some intense moments but it isn't anything amazing. Watchable!Round-Up: After starring in the big budget Transformers, 2 Guns and Pain and Gain, it seems like Mark Wahlberg took this movie on because he wanted a much smaller scaled movie which didn't involve any action. You can see that he has lost a lot of weight for the role so he obviously took the character seriously. With Ted 2 and the Billion Dollar Man in the pipeline, I don't that this film will hurt his reputation and I'm sure that it's his name which brought the audiences to the cinema but he won't be remembered for it. Actors like John Goodman, Michael Kennett Williams and Jessica Lange were great additions to the cast but there not really in the film that much. The director, Rupert Wyatt, who also directed Rise of the Planet of the Apes, has only directed a couple of major movies in his career so I'm surprised that he was chosen to make this movie. He didn't do a bad job with this project because he wanted to keep it close to the original which starred James Caan but the main character seemed more like a spoilt brat than a guy battling with an addiction.Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $40millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/thrillers about a self destructive gambler who owes gangsters thousands of dollars. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylish thriller filled with unlikeable people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With stylish direction by proved performer Rupert Wyatt and with the exciting prospect of Marky Mark reteaming with his Departed scribe William Monahan, this remake of the low key 1974 James Caan starring film of the same name should've been a sleeper hit and a film brimming with energy and smarts, but sadly what seemed like a sure bet is something more akin to a watchable 100 minutes of film that's filled to the brim with a bunch of unlikeable and un-relatable group of characters.The Gambler clearly had ambitions of grandeur and it's release window last year suggested that many involved in the project saw sneaky award nominations coming its way, whether for Wahlberg's somewhat stripped back performance (even though his trademark run still makes an epic last dash appearance), John Goodman's walrus like supporting turn or for Monahan's bitting and expletive riddled script. These awards were never to eventuate and while Wyatt continues on his hot directional streak following on from his great debut The Escapist and his fantastic blockbuster Rise of the Planet of the Apes, he struggles to make us feel for the often downright nasty inhabitants of his cash bag strewn morality tale.It will be hard for viewers to not thoroughly dislike Wahlberg's well off literature professor Jim Bennett and his continued bad decisions; watching Jim is like watching a slow motion train wreck and his often prone to more emotional wailing than your average Dashboard Confessional groupie. It's not to say Wahlberg's performance is bad, his actually quite good but Jim is just a guy we don't feel for as we should as he is without doubt, his own worst enemy. Another fatal flaw to the film that is detrimental to it becoming anything more than OK is a wasted support cast that gives long servers John Goodman and Jessica Lange little to do and future star Brie Larson is laboured with the films worst role as student Amy.Saved by its good direction, this is a well filmed and sharply edited movie that's also the recipient of a strong last act. The Gambler is a solid, if unspectacular remake that floats by on a strong concept that never eventuates into what it so easily could've become. For fans of Wahlberg this will become a new favourite and for the rest of us, a fine way to spend a weeknight with a highly forgettable yet easy on the eyes thriller.3 zip bagged wads of cash out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to get to theater to see this movie. Now I am glad I didn't. The premise is great. The story line could have been engaging... but the writing was terrible. It seems Professor Jim Bennett was talking about this screen play when he tells all of his students they will never be great writers. The script tries to be deep and smart... but misses badly on both counts. Most of the characters have a scene or two where they are given a quasi monologue. They attempt to enlighten us about the meaning of life or the lack thereof... from their perspective. Each speech falls flat. The characters remind me of an overweight construction worker guy at a baseball game sitting in the cheap seats... spilling his beer, hot dog in his mouth and mustard on his shirt trying to explain the intricacies of the U.S. Tax code. It is possible he is right... but he sounds weird and he is trying too hard to appear bright. This movie fails miserably on most counts. Sorry Marky Mark. I am usually a fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't say I was overly impressed with "The Gambler" but I definitely won't say I was completely bored with it either. It's a fairly decent film but not one I picture myself watching ever again.I like the symbolism the film has with the idea that the character of Jim Bennett being in over his head with his gambling addiction and debt, albeit the symbolism is pretty right-on-the-nose and not so subtle?but still, it's okay and something I dug about the film. Additionally, the story is decent and the drama is engaging enough. Finally, the cast is filled with very talented performers and all of them are doing great. The only problem I had with the film was it lacked that certain something that could really grab me and force me to pay attention and be on the edge of my seat. Overall, the film is interesting and mildly entertaining but it's just not as good as it probably could have been for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gambler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Gambler is the remake of an homonym 1974 cult film, starred by James Caan in one of his most acclaimed performances. However, I haven't seen that film, so I could watch The Gambler (2014) without comparing it to the original version; but I assume it was good enough in order to reach that "cult" status. Sure, there are also some horrible cult films, but well... let's give it the benefit of the doubt. Why am I talking so much about a 1974 film I haven't seen? Because, frankly, I don't have much to say about The Gambler (2014). I found it one of those insipid and mediocre films which don't manage to leave any impression on the audience, making it an absolutely forgettable experience. Well, the only thing I might end up remembering about it is the "reggae" version of the song Time, my favorite cut of the legendary album The Dark Side of the Moon. Let's see... a cult film I haven't seen, dinosaur rock... What else can I use in order to fill in this review? The weather? It was quite pleasant, something which made me think that I could have been outdoors doing something more entertaining than watching this uninteresting film. Nevertheless, the actors from The Gambler (2014) made a good work in their roles; Mark Wahlberg brings a credible and enthusiastic performance in the leading character, and he's well complemented by John Goodman, Michael Kenneth Williams, Alvin Ing and Brie Larson. On the other hand, director Rupert Wyatt (making quite a big step back after the excellent Rise of the Planet of the Apes) didn't bring any energy or personality to the film, something which exacerbates the bland screenplay. I remember having once listened a reggae version of the song Stairway to Heaven; there might be a niche of "covers rasta" I should investigate. I'm not a fan of that kind of music, but I like to occasionally find a different variation of a consecrated classic. Anyway, the fact I have to say so much about that and so little about The Gambler (2014) speaks by itself...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gambler, is a remake of the 1974 film of the same name. This film is about a college professor who has a profound addiction to gambling. This was directed by Rupert Wyatt who also did Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes &amp; a very overlooked film called The Escapist. This is Rupert's junior film and I would say that he must of lost his touch that made his previous films so noteworthy and good. Mark Wahlberg's character presents himself as a self-indulged douche at times but at some moments throughout, he starts to become a decent human being and becomes more decent to watch. Although Mark Wahlberg did do a superb job as his character, I thought that John Goodman &amp; Michael Kenneth Williams both did fantastic jobs as the guys that Mark owed money too. I do think that John Goodman was completely misused in this because he did great in the first few minutes you see him in and I was excited to see more of him but I was surely let down because you only see him once again in the second half and then about twenty minutes towards the end of the film. There was this love connection between Mark and Brie Larson's characters that I felt was forced and very tiresome and uninteresting that made it feel very unnecessary and useless. Some of the only sturdy parts of the film I sort of liked was when he was teaching at the college, Mark's dialogue during those scenes were very complex and outspoken, he made his character more of a smart professor and yet very abnormal as well. The script I would say did have a few minor problems and did deserve to have a second glance at before filming. Story Wise, the story did start to go onto a ruff patch because of its few slow paced scenes and uninteresting character development that felt useless and didn't have no need to put into this film. The epidemic with the gambling was passable for the storyline even though they never explain why Marks character even gets into such a addiction like this because in the film, he comes from such a high society family that seem to help him most of the time he gets into some sort of debt. The ending could of come off as a great one but it seemed too rushed that made our patience as the audience all for nothing but don't get me wrong, it was a fine ending but it seemed liked the writers couldn't really think up a more fun ending to the film. Overall, this film really had potential and could of been a interesting one but because of lousy writing, it didn't really succeed in the end but it did manage to bring strong performances from a great cast. I guess you would say that the cards did play right for me in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dark as The Gambler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is a literature professor with a severe gambling addiction caused by his view of the world as either having it all or having nothing. He ends up owing to Lee (Alvin Ing), the proprietor of an underground gambling ring, and another to Neville Baraka (Michael K. Williams), a loan shark. Lee gives Bennett seven days to pay off his debts or be murdered. During one of his classes, he identifies student Amy Phillips (Brie Larson) as a potential writing prodigy, points out Dexter (Emory Cohen) as a genius tennis star, and confronts Lamar Allen (Anthony Kelley), a student who does not pay attention in class and intends to become an NBA basketball player.For a film as dark as The Gambler, the ending just simply doesn't fit and feels more like a studio ending rather than something that would be true to the film and true to the original vibe of it all.Overall, The Gambler is a fitting remake that fails to capture the essence of the originalbut displays Mark Wahlberg in a career changing performance that shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

A must see, if you like smart mouth hustlers, high stakes gambling ,sneaky schemes, real life depression and taking chances. Great acting performances by all involved. Well polished film that will keep your attention. There are many films about gambling, money, etc...but only a few stick out and are remembered. You will remember this film. John Goodman plays a excellent boss role that suits him well. Mark does his usual awesome performance. There is the rich white guy, rich black guy, and rich Asian guy that all play vital parts to the film. Good dialogue with moments that raise real life questions and get's you to think about your life. grab your popcorn and your snacks. I doubt anyone will dislike this movie. I'll be waiting for a sequel. Part 2 please!!!! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very slick, but also very human movie. Mark Wahlberg does an excellent job of portraying an on-the-ropes history professor, who also happens to have a serious addiction. I liked the fact that not a single shot was fired, and yet, you felt his anxiety, pain and fear (and hopelessness) throughout. Hightly recommended. Somehow, music and cinematography blended together to give the movie kind of a timelessness to it. It was modern, with mobile phones and all, but had a 60's or 70's feel to it, and that is a compliment in my book. A smart film that focuses on the characters, not on explosions and shots. Now IMDb is just being obtuse, wants me to fill out 10 lines, but I have nothing more to say. Just see the movie already!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was left 'wanting' for a sense of impact, the punchline or a twist. I was hoping for a bit of a Number Sleven situation with how the movie opened and the talk he had with his grandfather, I thought a long, winding, intricate plan was unfolding. But in the end, he pays off his debt, swears off money, and gets the girl. Sounds like every other movie and it didn't even 'get me' with a twist or impact.I gave it a 7 for the fact that the movie, music and camera work was all very well done (this is for sure NOT something they just slapped together) but it still feels like something they didn't really push for either. Again though, all the actors/actresses did a great job... it just wasn't a very amazing or incredible movie worth the 2hr run-time. I would probably not recommend it and overall did not feel it was worth 2hrs of my life.If you want a good movie along these lines try the Oceans 11-13 or Lucky Number Sleven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Average Hand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based upon a short novel by Fyodor Dosoyevsky this is a remake of an earlier film from 1974 of the same name . I haven't seen the original but does contain an absolutely gripping tagline of "For $10,000 they break your arms. For $20,000 they break your legs. Axel Freed owes $44,000" . If that tagline doesn't hook you in then may be you just don't like movies . On top of that I see the 1974 version has an average user rating of 7.2 , The 1970s was a highpoint of American cinema where morally dubious flawed people behind the camera were making movies revolving around dubious flawed fictional characters . This remake barely made a ripple at the box office when it was released at the end of last year and has a fairly low rating and after seeing it then it's not too easy to see why Rupert Wyatt is an adequate director but nothing I've seen from it suggests he's anything more than that . The screenplay is written by William Monahan and this should get a few alarm bells ringing . Much of his work is composed of merely adapting from a vastly superior source and any embellishment he adds to the story is inferior compared to the original work . He also fails to disguise the source . You watch a film with Monahan appearing in the credits and there's some good bits in it ? Well give the credit to the original source material . You watch a film with Monahan appearing in the credits and there's bad bits in it ? Well you all know who to blame . Monahan could defend myself by saying he's not Akiva Goldman and he would be correct but I could equally defend myself by saying no matter what evil deeds I do I'm not on a par with Hitler . A strawman argument . Since this film sources a film that is based on a story by Dosoyevsky there's lots of existentialism spoken about . If you like this praise be to a 19th Century Russian writer . The protagonist finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place due to his own self destructive actions ? Hey that's sounds like many American films from the1970s . To be fair the cast do their best with the material on offer and rise above the film's flaws but THE GAMBLER doesn't deal the audience a winning hand which is a pity</fullReview>

Well i gotta say it's a good idea for a movie but the trailer was a bit of false advertisement :P it was full excitement, action and Boom but in reality well not that much :\ just a guy teasing his many lenders ..The story of "Lamar" was a key connected story so it was okay but the story of "Amy Phillips" was vague or let's say unnecessary.The last 30 minutes got really interesting thou,, it attracted me good. the plot takes unexpected turn ... and things starts to unveil itself .. one of the last scene when he said "i play for those two gentlemen, i'm not actually a gambler" was kind worth watching the whole one hour 40 minutes ;)So overall it's an Okay movie ... not WOW but still got perspective and purposeful idea so 5 is a good rating:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When it's good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film definitely has a lot of positives and a lot of thought went into the production value and acting and there's even a message which most films don't bother with these days.The problem is that although the message is a good one, this is still entertainment and the way it's put across doesn't always work. Here's why:The title of the film is a red herring (I'll stop there to avoid spoilers). It's infuriating when someone creates problems for themselves when other people would sacrifice a limb to be in their shoes. I actually think the film is quite irresponsible with regards to the gambling. The role of the love interest was extremely bare and something I'd expect from a film ten or twenty years ago.What raises the film above its flaws however, is that just at the point where you're about to throw things at your TV/laptop because you can "not" believe what this guy is about to do "yet again", we're given some insight into "Jim's" (Wahlberg) frame of mind and for a split second, his actions do make some sense.The message gets a bit confused after that because his speech made me think that self destruction was the theme and that's something a lot of people can relate to. Although the message was being hammered home in quite a heavy handed way, I thought it was a good theme to explore but then "Frank" (Goodman) gives his little speech and suddenly, the message becomes something else entirely. So which is it? "self destruction" or "f*ck you"? Maybe it's both or maybe they were always one and the same.The music is excellent, the editing is sharp and Mark Wahlberg is witty as always, although the rebel teacher attitude does wear thin at times. The Gambler felt more like a slow, character driven film than a flashy, action-packed Ocean's Eleven (2001). I'd liken it to a more introspective Rounders (1998).I didn't like the ending. This has nothing to do with the quality or "fittingness" of the ending as it was shot really well and made sense, just that it was such a "nothing" ending. I had to remind myself that the reason nothing felt resolved was that there was no conflict in the first place. Not really. And you'll understand that once you've seen the film.Overall, it was enjoyable. It had a witty script and a lot of great acting from actors I really like and the message, for the most part, was interesting.6.6/10</fullReview>

If he can't have it all, he'll be darned if he wastes any passing moment denying himself that illusion.I think that this is an important film, and it speaks to the times more than we might give it credit for. It's the story of a man who realized his worth when and only when he quite literally puts his life at stake..But for what gain? He gets to know what it means to be alive for the first time in his life. Its a noble self sacrificing act disguised as something else in a hedonistic and self serving world so completely portrayed by the actors and so completely realized by the director.To the nahsayers, this is a great movie, and its slapping you across the face - But I'm not expecting a reaction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it is possible-a cerebral gangster movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We saw this very interesting movie some hours ago; I followed the story most of the way but I lost him when Jim Bennett, the main character, has an "oh so trendy lecture/talk" with his university English class. I think that he was trying to draw parallels between prose writing and a person's personal affliction. This interpretation may be totally wrong but the rest of the film didn't challenge me as much as this small part. Pay attention to this university scene as well as the many references back to it through the remainder of the film.The movie is not hugely bloody but there are some small bits that will make one cringe; however, there are no car chases or automatic weapon use so for action lovers buy another ticket. The two dominant gangs are the Korean-American guys from around the junction of Vermont and Santa Monica and abutting this area is the African-American area of South Central Los Angeles; the close shot of the old art deco theatre gives you a perfect location key for the greater neighbourhood. The area in general is a "no-go" area for Anglos unless you are, in Bennett's case looking to pay off a considerable loan or borrow a considerable amount of money.Diane and I both thought the movie was better than the press gave it credit. We particularly enjoyed the role that Goodman played and yes he seems always to play variations of the same character but he plays those roles so well he must be in the running for any such role that becomes available. The role that Jessica Lange played was of award quality. Mark Walberg cannot be forgotten because he carried the movie and I thought that his performance was of great quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is a literature professor at a university: he also owes a quarter of a million dollars in gambling debts, and we can see that is gambling is reckless. Over a period we see him get involved with gambling lenders and debt enforcement individuals, his wealthy mother, and several students, one of whom may lead to his salvation.I'm not too sure how I feel about this film. There are some very good performances, particularly from Jessica Lange (a very credible mix of hard, angry and distraught), and Wahlberg is no slouch, either (he has some hideous speeches to learn for the lecture room sequences which, for me, were the most entertaining part of the film). I liked the under-used Brie Larson who has an air about her of being a plain girl who can suddenly appear strikingly pretty.The plot has a moderate amount of movement in it, but not much story, and I never really got to grips with Bennett's character. Wahlberg performed him well, but I never really understood why or how he had become the man he was, with what a self-destructive streak which never got displayed other than in his gambling or its consequences, when the rest of his life appeared to be very positive. I ended up feeling "so what?" without any explanation as to why I should care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walhberg Gambles and Loses Everything to 'That Prince of F**king Darkness, Gangster, Uncle'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES's Rupert Wyatt shows viewers a glimpse into the havoc of an entitled and self-indulgent whiner hell-bent on self-destruction in his latest film THE GAMBLER that stars Mark Wahlberg in the lead role.Rebooted from James Toback's original 1974 film starring James Caan, Wyatt's direction and William Monahan's screenplay are decidedly different from their predecessors: not only in comparable terms (the protagonist is still a gambling addicted literature professor and disgraced scion of a wealthy family) but in terms of its move from the seedy dens and skinning dives of NYC to the veneered denizen of LA and from Toback's existentialist bravado to Monahan's lackadaisical je ne sais quoi.But what really sets Wyatt's film apart is the opening sequence catalyst that removes protagonist Jim Bennett's (Wahlberg) moral compass and beloved relative, which propels him towards a self-destructive, downward spiral.Behind the apathy and veiled glasses, nothing matters anymore in Bennett's world. Not his university tenure, his critically acclaimed novel from 1997, nor his material possessions. Not even the quarter of a million dollars he owes to a number of dangerous characters including underground casino owner Mr Lee (Alvin Ing), loan shark Neville Baraka (Michael Kenneth Williams) and a money lender called Frank (played superbly on screen by an almost entirely topless John Goodman). As his student/love interest, Brie Larson (Amy Phillips) points out, Bennett is 'the perfect example of how a person can start off with no problems whatsoever and then go out of their way to make sure they have all of them'.As a part-time cocktail waitress at the Korean-run casino, Brie has witnessed first hand, Bennett's destructiveness as he wins then loses heavily on the Blackjack and Roulette tables (an homage to Dostoyevsky's tomes The Gambler and Notes From Underground). And despite his mounting predicament with each flip of a Blackjack card and drop of the Roulette ball, one can't help but empathise with this unrepentant anti-hero in denial of his addiction.Framed within a ticking clock (Bennett has seven days to procure the funds to pay off his debts), Wyatt manages to keep the Peter to pay Paul action going with smack downs from his superior supporting cast including Bennett's gorgon of a mother Roberta (Jessica Lange), 'don't f**k with me' gangster Neville, 'let me be your uncle' Frank, and 'that prince of f**king darkness' Mr Lee. The fluidity in which Goodman interprets and delivers Monahan's intellective dialogue is like listening to Yo Yo Ma play on Petunia or Davidov.Perhaps that's why audiences are exposed to Wyatt's cliché ending of Wahlberg running through the streets of LA to his lady love ? he's still trying to measure up to the superb performances and believability of his cast mates. Don't get me wrong ? Wahlberg does a great job as the disinherited snob on a death wish ? I just see TED's John Bennett trying to be professor Jim Bennett more. And perhaps, right there, is the irony of it all and we completely missed it.Beautifully shot by ZERO DARK THIRTY's Greig Fraser, THE GAMBLER is a visceral experience worth watching for the photography work alone and despite the sad reality that Bennett really isn't in any real danger of coming to an end. Sad that.You can read more from at my twitter handle or at The Hollywood News.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Gambler" is fueled by great performances from the entire cast, memorable visuals, and a terrific soundtrack. However, this comes at the cost of having an uneven storyline and underdeveloped characters.Going into the movie, I was expecting a thriller with comedic elements. Though I was not too far off, the film juggled these different genres not too effortlessly. One scene would be dramatic, the next would be comedic, the one after would be romantic, and so forth. The result is a film that does not really know what it is trying to be, and neither does the audience.Mark Wahlberg disappears in his role as Jim, in fact the entire cast gives splendid performances. Sadly the characters they play are generally too vague. Their goals are not unclear, and their relationships are unclearer. The romantic subplot between Mark's character and Brie Larson's is never really developed, or necessary for that regard.Overall, expect an average film that appeals most to the eyes and ears, but not the hearts of moviegoers. You won't care too much for the characters, but the plot is engrossing enough to yield your attention for the duration of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good entertaining flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has the potential to become a cult classic. Mark Wahlberg plays Jim Bennett, a gambling addict who ends up owing and borrowing money from shady people you certainly don't want to be owing money to.It's when Bennett interacts with loan shark Frank (Played by John Goodman) where the films dialogue really peaks. But overall the dialogue is done pretty well. There's a few exceptions where 2 scenes in particular didn't seem to fit as well as they could have and this is where i had to knock off a few stars. I can't blame the actors for this as it wasn't them doing a bad job. The problem was probably both editing and writing, i really wish they had spent a bit more time polishing those up.Overall the movie is unpredictable enough to keep it interesting which is huge to me this day and age, nothing worse then going to watch something and you see everything coming a mile away. I strongly recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gambler tells the story of a depressed university professor that owes a great deal of money to dangerous people to feed what seems to be a gambling addiction. Some viewers will not at all like this movie because they won't at all identify with or have any empathy for the main character in the movie. The movie does not spell it all out for the viewer. This is not an action movie. If you are looking for action, you will be disappointed. It is a dialogue driven movie that is likely to bore some viewers. I identified with the main character in a way, but even I can not deny its faults. Some of the let us call them "mobsters" are comically bad. There is not much going on plot wise and there is very little pay off to this movie. Your ability to enjoy this movie is almost entirely dependent on you caring and having empathy for Mark Wahlberg's character. If you have a low empathy quotient or you just have not been there, you will find yourself simply bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie, but only if you pay attention and listen to the various messages in the film. I think the negative reviewers were expecting an action jackson type movie and failed to understand the premise. It is one of those thinker type movies, along the lines of Interstellar. Not everyones cup of tea, but I loved it. Mark Wahlberg is one of those actors that you can't take your eyes off on screen. The only funny thing was I kept looking at Jessica Lange as the characters she plays in American Horror Story Lol. I recommend this movie to those that like Mark Wahlberg and like to have their brains exercised during the movie. Two thumbs up for sure. Also I laugh at the person who wrote they would have rather gone to see the Disney flick In the Woods rather than this movie, kind of opposite ends of the spectrum isn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wahlberg's middling performance holds it back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is a English professor and a high stakes gambler. He's gambling recklessly after his grandfather's death. He owes $240k and Lee wants it in 7 days. He takes out another $50k from loan shark Neville Baraka (Michael K. Williams) and loses it all. He takes an interest in his student Amy Phillips (Brie Larson) who works at the underground casino. His mother Roberta (Jessica Lange) refuses to give him more money at first. Star basketball player Lamar doesn't pay attention in class. He tries to a loan from gangster Frank (John Goodman).I'm somewhat mixed on Wahlberg's performance. The material gives him lots of meaty opportunity to shine. Instead, he can only give a middling performance. It's not bad by any means. The first classroom scene has some electricity but it's all in the writing. He has a range that he struggles to expand on. There are some better performances in the movie and Lange is the chief among them. The problem is that she's acting against a wall in Wahlberg. He's not giving enough back. Brie Larson shows some interesting sides. It's commendable that Wahlberg is trying and maybe someday he can put in a worthy performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a decent remake, but this gambling thriller could have used a bit more suspense for me to go all in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director of 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' (Rupert Wyatt) and the writer of 'The Departed' (William Monahan) thought it was time to remake the 1974 film 'The Gambler' that starred James Caan and Paul Sorvino. It's not a terrible remake by any means, but the lack of character development and its struggle to keep the tension throughout the entire picture will have you a little less satisfied from when you first start watching the film. While there are enough similarities and homages to the original movie are present here, this new remake starring Mark Wahlberg, Jessica Lange, Brie Larson, and John Goodman can stand on its own.As the film starts with a great deal of suspense and intrigue, the tension doesn't keep going up, but instead drops off like a steep roller-coaster, right through the climax of the film. It's unfortunate, because we've seen these gambling thrillers keep the momentum coming. Wahlberg plays Jim Bennett, a literature professor who is excellent at his job. When Bennett is done teaching, you can almost always find him in an underground casino, betting big and winning big. It's clear that addiction and money run all aspects of Bennett's life, but fortunately for him, he is fairly lucky a good amount of the time.Well, that is until he is not so lucky and ends up owing a quarter of a million to the guy who runs the underground gambling ring, as well as thousands of dollars to a couple of loan sharks, one of which is played by John Goodman. Bennet's mother (Jessica Lange) bails him out for the last time and gives him the money to pay off all his debts, but Bennett being Bennett cannot control his addiction, and ends up betting it all, which doesn't have a good outcome. Given a week to pay off all the debts or lose his life, Bennett enlists the help in a couple of students to throw sports games and cheat at gambling to help save his life.This sounds like a good setup and I feel like somewhere down the line there was a better script, but perhaps some studio executives stepped in to tone the film down from what it truly could have been. Whalberg does a good job as Bennett, as we can see his struggle with his gambling addiction, but that's really much it for this character. There is no attention paid to his teaching career or even his taboo relationship with one of his students, other than to seem to fill time in the movie. It's all addiction and gambling to this character. The rest can be said for the rest of the characters in the film, who really have only one trait and no deep meaning. Sure, Goodman steals the scene in the few moments he has, but it's nothing compared to his previous work.Perhaps the best performance here is that of Jessica Lange who has just about had it with her son and his degenerate gambling problem. Every time she is on screen, she just owns it. Michael Kenneth Williams shows up from time to time, but his character is never really given any time to shine. All of this leads up to a fairly bland and predictable ending that sizzles out instead of hitting hard with a bang. It's a decent remake, but this gambling thriller could have used a bit more suspense for me to go all in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances but weak plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Gambler" has many strong elements, but lacks a strong through line and moral. The performances are strong, particularly among supporting characters, especially Jessica Lange as the mother and John Goodman as a loan shark. Wahlberg gives an interesting performance as a professor and when interacting with the supporting cast, but seems curiously detached when he gambles, as if he expects to lose and is eager to be done with it. Jason Statham was much more interesting and credible as a compulsive degenerate gambler in "Wild Card" and might have done an equally credible job here in the well-written scenes with supporting players. A movie titled "The Gambler" has what Blake Snyder would have termed a strong promise of the premise. The title suggests a familiar storyline and creates strong preconceptions among the audience. We expect a story about a compulsive gambler whose luck has run out, who finds himself impossibly in debt to distinctly unpleasant people and forced to lay his life on the line in a desperate attempt at redemption, and somehow either experiences an epiphany that frees him from the bonds of his compulsions or succumbs to some tragic fate. This is basically the plot of the movie, but it lacks punch for lack of a better term. One character refuses to help again, but then does and makes it clear that the ability to help has not been substantially depleted. Threats are made, but always in a very civil tone. One can't imagine anybody will amputate fingers with secateurs. Professional risks are taken, but there seems to be no danger of consequences. Ethics are violated, but not really and only in a way that jeopardizes a future that doesn't really exist. This movie fails to provide insight into the compulsion that drives the character. He is obviously affected by the death of his father and has nothing but contempt for his mother. Both relationships seem to shape his character, but we don't understand quite how or why. We, as well as other characters, see his self-loathing and suspect that he subconsciously wants to lose in order to punish himself, but it's not clear how this changes. He is also affected by a taboo romance, but most of the relationship is off-screen and we aren't given enough to understand his fascination with her or hers with him or how it impacts his choices. It would be nice if this relationship seemed more of a gamble. For a film that cries out to be a morality tale, it seems odd that there is not a strong moral. The final resolution relies on a deus ex machina roll of the dice which is made irrelevant to humanity in general as it is built upon the character's unique circumstances and ability to exploit certain relationships. It also depends on a character accepting a substantial bet placed with essentially his own money by somebody who can't hope to pay if he loses. The movie has a catchy tagline in "The only way out is all in," but when it comes to placing the bet, we don't feel that the character is going all in or has any hope of getting out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Small Slight Bet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rupert Wyatt is a talented Director, behind the great 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. Likewise Mark Wahlberg has incredible dramatic range ? well in 'The Departed' that is. Therefore, it only makes sense to team them up. Do the duo work well? Well slightly, but nothing more, nothing less. 'The Gambler' is not a bad film or a poorly constructed one either. It entertains in the moment but is easily forgettable afterwards and therein lies its main problem. While interesting it is far from gripping viewing.But, a good deal works well you just feel slightly cheated as if you won a Grand at Blackjack and lost half of it the next week betting the wrong way. So you have fun while it lasts, just when you reach the home stretch you begin to question was it really worth it? This will depend on what you define to be a gripping thriller, if it does not take much for your heart rate to rocket then you will have a blast. For those of us who have seen David Fincher's filmography you will be left wanting much more, I know I am.'The Gambler' concerns Jim Bennett a College Professor and avid gambler who must get the money he owes back to the right people after placing a huge bet and losing, he only has seven days to pay them back and the clock is constantly ticking. He is played with gusto by Mark Wahlberg who manages to redeem himself from the latest horrid, ongoing slaughter of the 'Transformers' series. He has never had a keen eye for great scripts, but his work here does him solid justice and therefore I can forgive him.Wahlberg shows layers of emotion and precise detail to his character. What lets him down though is the script and that is incredibly odd. The dialogue is polished, never feels forced or out of place and is always consistent, as well as witty, funny and fast paced. It is so strange then that little to no thought was actually given to character motivation and development. The film poses many challenging questions and abruptly drops them at the roll of a dice. We are left on the edge of our seats waiting. Then we stop. We are given no answers. Why is Bennett addicted to gambling? What compelled him to become a College Professor? Why does he lead a double life? I cannot tell you and neither can the screenwriter. Which is an awful shame. The motivation is thrown out of the window. You also cannot help but feel that no one has changed throughout the film. Apart from Brie Larson's College Student, but she is always engaging so maybe that is just her personality shining through.The film itself looks heavily stylised, this is a conscious decision to reflect the glamour and attraction that Casinos pose. It is truly fantastic. For one thing you cannot fault the art direction. Each day starts out the same. We are told how many days are remaining and a track plays. This is far from a risky choice, but it is very entertaining to be sure. It gives the whole film a sense of familiarity, which in turn reflects the persona of Bennett who feels that every day is the same old, same old.Truth be told 'The Gambler' becomes far too pretentious and preachy for its own good. Take into account the cringe worthy scene at College. The stereotypical black student with charm but a short attention span talks to the Professor. It becomes shallow and silly. Is it too much to ask from a film from 2014 to not contain such vile stereotypes? I think not. The talk that ensues is as cheesy as they can come and is sorely something that 'The Gambler' could have done without.When it comes down to it, I can recommend 'The Gambler', I would advise however to proceed with caution. Place low bets to sustain a sense of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-The Gambler, a 2014 remake of a 1974 film of the same name, stars Mark Wahlberg, a college professor and gambling addict who finds himself owing 260 million dollars to two different dangerous guys.-As a remake I did not care for the original, so I liked this one a little bit more.-The story is cliché and predictable.-The pace is good, but it has its slow points.-The acting is pretty good. I though Marky Mark pulled off one of his best performances, along with John Goodman and one of his best performances.-The characters are mostly predictable, but I really liked the depth and personal struggle Marky Mark's character had. It made the ending very worthwhile.-The music was fitting. There was not a lot of score that went into it, but I liked when it was there.-I thought the editing in the film was noticeably good.-As a remake there were not a lot of differences. I did like this version better.-The Gambler is rated-R for some language, which was neither heavy nor light.-So The Gambler was good, but not great. It featured good acting and editing in a predictable remake, but I would probably still say The Gambler is worth buying in a $5 bin and worth a good 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theme? Character development?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My words will be more harsh than my star rating, as I actually loved this film- recognizing that it will probably only achieve cult classic status. I am also a sucker for gambling movies.But here it is: This movie lacks a theme. At times, it approaches what appears to be a theme of sorts, then backs out, seemingly intentionally to establish the fact that the protagonist is an "empty" character. That's right, what I'm saying is that this film fails to establish a theme so that it can intentionally under-develop a character. I'm not sure how that sits with me. I guess you could argue that "gamblers are empty people" is a potential theme, but that's not good enough for me.It appears as though John Goodman's character is there to establish a theme of "f you." But if Mark Wahlberg wanted to develop that theme, he would have told Chalkie "f you" and bet on the kid to win by more than 8 points.And there's a potential solution for this problem. Mark Wahlberg's lectures as a college professor are bizarre and often disconnected to the plot and "theme." Why wasn't he lecturing about "f you" or about "believing in yourself" or about being a "tragic hero." If he would have stuck to one of those lines of thought, it would have helped to establish the poorly connected theme. Maybe the basketball kid would have learned a lesson from Marky Mark and not "thown the game." And Marky Mark would have rolled up a stake from three different sources and bet with the kid and paid everyone off. Just a thought. And not a perfect thought, but sure is better than a completely disconnected storyline- for the sake of proving that Marky Mark is a vacant lot.Maybe the "all or nothing" theme they started developing could have been further developed....or the "stop hiding your talent" theme that was clearly violated with the kid winning by only 7 points.And holy cow. Can you fail to develop a romantic relationship any further? Her role is the story is even unclear.And what kind of happy ending ends with someone 1/4 million dollars in debt to his mom, without an M1, and no Omega watch on his wrist.So maybe I have it all wrong. Maybe this is one of those artsy films that tries to play with the conventions of storytelling. Well...at least I acknowledge that that exists in film and that I don't really see an intentional playing with the conventions as beneficial in this case.But I did love it. There were some real gems in the dialogue and enough wtf moments to keep me tuned in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see with great philosophical elements for any guy who is currently "Lost in Translation"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, to all the people giving it bad reviews, please study Mark Wahlberg movies a little and him as well. The man is a great human being who can actually admire someone else and he is also an honest individual who plays honest people. The movie does not try to make you feel better, you might actually feel jealous of the main character. You can not be happy without taking risks. The movie teaches many things and if it leaves you feeling angry or empty it is because you are missing those things too or because you are afraid to take a risk etc. It is a very philosophical movie- and with a very particular reality, uncomfortable reality for many people, previously brought up in No Pain No Gain. Mark Wahlberg simply participated in another great movie that brings out reality in USA with a great humanist feeling to it. He might not be the best actor, but this movie has a lot to say. If you think a little especially about what to do with your life you will learn a lot form this movie. You might learn that you are a miserable man or that if you continue the way you live you might never be happy and yes many people are better than you, find what you are good at and try to make your life good rather than trying to be something that you do not believe you can achieve. If you are special you know it. We need more people making movies like that so we can live in a society of 21st century that knows what life is and what reality is, and that is truly free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After his grandpa dies, Jim Bennett goes straight to a Mr. Lee's illegal casino. He plays a few hands of blackjack, winning at first, but ends up owing Lee and a gangster Baraka big time. Both men give him exactly one week to come up with the money. Jim continues his days as an English professor. A student, Amy, is one of the brightest in class but she happens to be waiting tables at Lee's casino and she saw Jim went broke. Jim goes to his wealthy mother to ask for money, who rejects him knowing his gambling addiction. He goes to a loan shark Frank, who agrees to loans him the money but at a later time. Jim talks with a student Lamar, a rising star basketball athlete and finds out that Lamar has been hiding n injury. His mother confronts him about the gangsters spying her house. She gives him the money when Jim tells her the truth about the debt. But instead Jim takes the money and lose it at blackjack while taking Amy out. As time is nearly out, Baraka forces Jim to reveal Lamar's contact info so he can personally force him to to fix the next game. Jim gives Baraka a wrong number and gets beaten for it, but Jim says he will tell Lamar about the game fixing. Jim then acts he lets go of everything, giving his car to a complete stranger and quitting his job. He takes Frank's money and goes to Lamar's game. Lamar does as Jim asked him to so Jim wins big, with which he repays Baraka. He calls Frank telling him to meet him at Lee's casino. He makes an 'double-or-nothing all-in' betting the black numbers in a roulette. The bet pays off and he surrenders the money split two parts to Lee and Frank.It's kind of strange for Mark Wahlberg to be taking on this kind of movie for the story is so foggy. The base of where the story starts off doesn't really give an interesting point, thus I waited for something interesting to turn the table around. That waiting took the most part of this movie's almost two-hour duration, and sadly when it came, t was nothing more than a predictable outcome of an ending.The movie really wasted a lot of its two-hour build. It created potential side plots which never get explored adequately, like the thing with Dexter for example. The man only showed up for maybe two scenes. The thing with Amy is adequately explored, but it doesn't close properly, leaving a gaping plot hole. Besides that, there are so many wasted in frame time, such as when Jim walks from the entrance to the guard at the Korean casino near the end of the movie, or when he's watching his mother play tennis. The dialog also seems like it's there just to state the obvious, as the plot is mostly fairly predictable whenever Jim speaks two or three lines.Again I say I'm surprised about this movie, that it actually made it to the bx office top ten, even for just one week end. I'm sure it was Wahlberg's reputation that fueled people's curiosity. And they must've been as disappointed as I am now about this movie. The thriller aspect doesn't really sink in, especially since the music used doesn't really incite any suspense. The crime part also doesn't leave a lasting impression, since it only depicts a gambling addict who goes for broke almost every time after he wins a bet.The acting overall.. seriously I do choose not to speak about the acting overall if I can. Only Mark Wahlberg's performance that stands out. Even that performance feels like a sin to Mark's persona built from all his previous roles of tough guys. Brie Larson really needs to work out more on her expressions. Her face stays flat the whole movie. John Goodman's presence adds something interesting in this movie, but even he gets under-utilized.A recommendation is surely a definite no from me. Never bother to see it at the movies. Let it be just me who suffer the waiting hoping for something interesting with nothing really came up at the end. A score of 4 out of 10 is from me for this movie.</fullReview>

But here's the thing, that movie is all over the place. Some strange character and relationship build up that never really go anywhere, leave you a taste of a rushed out the door script/movie. Some way too nice gangsters, up to the point that it was getting harder to feel danger.

		<shortDescription>Low Stakes, Low Payout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. Even though I could hardly keep my eyes open 20 minutes into it. In the first 10 minutes of the movie, Bennet (Wahlberg) starts gambling in a secret casino. He is quite aggressive and just lets it all ride. It is clear that he owes money to people, does not gamble responsibly, and then borrows money from more. There is a clear pattern that is visible, and I wondered how this would be resolved or what other kind of questionable decisions would he have to make before he saw the error of his ways. Unfortunately, I didn't really care. There was not really any tension, build-up, or empathy present in many scenes. Yes the stakes are high for Bennet, but I didn't really care, and he didn't really seem like he did either. Then it cuts to Bennet as a strange literary teacher. Instead of teaching about literature, he chants soliloquies to build up certain class mates. His morale and ethics as a teacher and a person are in question, but once again, it's kind of weird and I found myself not caring at all. The whole professor part of the film felt unauthentic. Frank (Goodman) was the only decent part of the movie, but he wasn't in it for but five minutes, so it's not a reason to watch the movie. While I did not demand a refund, it certainly didn't cross my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The screenplay is clever in its pessimism, frankness, and wittiness, allowing characters to impart logic rarely spoken in film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Jonathan Bennett passes away, he leaves behind only his concerns for his grandson, James (Mark Wahlberg), who doesn't appear to possess a basic adaptability to hardship and discontent. The same night, James heads to a ritzy underground gambling parlor to play some high-stakes blackjack. He's not exactly good at the game, nor is he particularly lucky ? but he knows how to quickly make enemies. In short time, he owes $240,000 to the house, run by a Korean kingpin, and another $50,000 (plus interest) to the gangster Neville Baraka (Michael K. Williams). And he has just seven days to pay it all back.In an attempt to manufacture suspense, the title "7 Days" flashes onto the screen, followed by a regular interval countdown, supplemented by pop music and flippant behavior toward what should be a very dire situation. As if compelled by a sickness or disease, James continues to traverse a road of self-destruction and indifference, even when his mother (Jessica Lange) and a student he falls in love with (Brie Larson as Amy) get caught up in the path for potential sadistic retaliation. As he selfishly drags his friends and family down into the underworld of gambling addiction and merciless bookies, he's never given a chance at true redemption. In fact, many of the things he does to alter his financial detriments are so despicable and careless that many viewers will feel apathetic to the tortures he'd surely undergo at the hands of aggravated lenders ? if this were a more realistic environment. Oddly, the tone is rather lighthearted, never presenting seriousness for his quandaries, despite the apparent dangers of owing huge sums of money to ruthless thugs. John Goodman as Little Frankie, who delivers many of the best lines, is supposed to be the most unconscionably vile brute of the bunch, yet he's portrayed as something of a playfully condescending uncle. Outside of his extracurricular addiction, James is an associate professor, teaching English courses with unorthodox methods and blunt philosophies on skills and pursuits. "If you're not a genius, don't bother," he instructs his students, as he firmly believes that extraordinary talent manifests randomly, without lineage, wealth, or education serving as contributing factors. The screenplay is clever in its pessimism, frankness, and wittiness, allowing characters to impart logic rarely spoken in film. The cynical outlook and straightforward convictions might be the only redeeming ideals of a man so morally corrupt and mentally weak as to remain suicidally unresponsive to emotional and physical stimuli.Regardless of the amusing commentary on mediocrity and happiness or the existential approach to victory and starting over, Bennett is wholly unsympathetic. Why Amy throws herself at him is never explained. And as the picture builds to what promises to be a thrilling conclusion (placing all the momentum on a final twist or shock), it fails to acknowledge James' worth or reformation. During the seconds that matter most, he still relies entirely on luck, not intelligence (there's no rousing "Ocean's Eleven" type of heist to be found here). Ultimately, it's an examination of unmanageable addiction and the largely alienating effects this particular one imparts ? the kind infrequently touched upon by mainstream cinema. That there is some satisfaction in the parting shots is definitely an uncommon feat for a character study about an antihero of such excruciatingly ineffectual scruples - but it's too little too late. Based on the screenplay by James Toback (for the 1974 film starring James Caan), "The Gambler" is a strange choice of adaptation for Oscar-winning William Monahan, who previously penned "Kingdom of Heaven (2005)," "The Departed" (2006), and "Edge of Darkness" (2010).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best since The Departed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've liked Mark Wahlberg since his best of the outstanding cast performance in "The Departed". Since then he's mostly been in slo-mo-strutting-away-from-an-explosion action flicks which haven't employed his abilities effectively at all. For me this puts him back up on that level and then some. His scenes in the college auditorium are exquisite.I'd stayed away from this since the trailers made it appear to be just another depressing, soul-wrecking examination of self-destructive introspection. But it was a surprise. Those clichés were not adhered to, and it isn't predictable at all--all of which will probably keep it from garnering any significant awards. The direction it was going had me in the dark right up until the absolute end where either of the two main possibilities each had their further quirky possible trajectories. Goodman is excellent standing in for Jabba the Hutt, though I worry he won't be with us much longer. They have me wondering if they had his already significant bulk in a fat suit.Tied for best of the year IMHO with "Nightcrawler"; and with "American Sniper" yet to go. Definitely the first year in quite a while to be dominated by male actors. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crapshoot?. emphasis on Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They turned a masterpiece into a pile of excrement. Seriously, this is one of the worst movies of the year. What made the original so fascinating was that James Caan's character was so hopeful about winning, that his losses seemed more tragic to witness. Here, Mark Whalberg plays the character as a depressed schmuck with a death wish. His existence in the movie is pure torture to the audience. The writing is pure garbage, shocking, because it's from the desk of William Monahan. Even more shocking, this film was helmed by Rupert Wyatt of "Rise of the Planet of the Apes". John Goodman is the only thing that prevented this from being a walk-out for me. It just goes to show you how many talented people it takes to make a horrible movie like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film because I've never seen Mark Wahlberg in a lousy movie-until now.To say the film is a disappointment is an understatement. Perhaps the worst film I've seen in a decade. The plot was as lame as it gets in that I found myself not caring one iota about what happened to the character being played by MW. I mean the dude gets 260K from his MOM to pay off a gambling debt and then proceeds to blow it at the craps table. That was it for me. Some moves are just not forgivable. Especially since he had been given the 260K from his mother who looked like she was at least 70 years old. Why did they make this film? The film 'The Big Lebowski' was a better film than this to watch and that film was no great shakes. It was the cinematic equivalent of eating a cardboard sandwich. And MW's character sucked at being a teacher-spouting hyperbole as if it were pearls of wisdom-for example-people who criticize Shakespeare do it because they are "jealous of genius." The fact that 'The Immortal Bard' stole many of his ideas from the 13th century work entitled The Decameron by Italian literary pioneer Giovanni Boccaccio apparently has no meaning whosoever.It just shows to go ya that you can take the thug out of the ghetto but you can't take the ghetto out of the thug. MW take a break- buy an island-do anything else, just don't make anymore awful movies like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A succinct performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Wahlberg is very impressive as a college professor of hobbled literary talent moonlighting as high stakes gambler. His MO is "I'm all in." And this is true of both his professorial as well as his gambling persona's. His classroom manner is as derisive as Robin Williams, in Dead Poets Society, was upbeat, an interesting contrast in teaching methods.His character, Jim Bennett, walks, and sometimes runs, a fine line between suicidal and self-preservation tendencies. It's often hard to tell where his focus lies. Going up against a troika of mob money men who will feed you cash 'til you crash, he's constantly on the edge of being rubbed out.Can his student/maybe protégé, Amy Phillips (Brie Larson), provide enough spark to motivate him towards self-preservation. Will his basketball prodigy student help pull him out of the clutches of his need to gamble? There's plenty of well written existential musings along the way which make this a film well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Little Movie Who Couldn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all remember the classic children's story of "The Little Engine Who Could" about the train that kept telling itself "I think I can, I think I can", and he eventually was able to make it up the hill. "The Gambler" is a lot like "The Little Engine Who Could". It's a movie that obviously set out to be an Oscar contender: it was a remake of a classic film and a classic novel; it starred Mark Wahlberg, one of the best actors in Hollywood these days; it had a terrific supporting cast, including John Goodman and Jessica Lange; and the movie was released in December of 2014, the time that Oscar contenders tend to be released if they want to get the Academy's attention. It's obvious that all who were involved in this film tried really hard.But, unlike "The Little Engine Who Could", "The Gambler" could not.I'm writing this review one day after the 2014 Oscar nominations were announced, so I have the benefit of hindsight in making that statement. Still, having seen the movie in the theater just a few days ago, it's obvious that this was a film that wasn't really going anywhere in spite of a good effort.I should note that I have not seen the 1974 James Caan version of this film, nor have I read the Dosteovsky novel on which it is based, so I can't comment on its faithfulness to its source material. What I can say is that in spite of good efforts on the part of the actors involved, the script for this movie did itself a huge disservice by being a bit too artsy at places. The film is an odd blend of a neo-noir style story with a curious style. It would have been best served to be a straight forward narrative without too much in the way of artistic inventiveness in how the story was being told, but in the end we got too much Coen Brothers directorial influence and not enough "Chinatown". One might also question the film standard that the movie was captured in, as the movie had a very bright, crisp quality that made it look and feel like a sitcom rather than a gritty, mature themed film about a man who is in serious trouble with loan sharks. It was like reading a copy of "The Godfather" that had been printed in Comic Sans font. That aesthetic vibe caries into the overall tone of the film, as it comes across as almost humorous, despite the attempt at being more serious and deep. The final product is a bit of a mess, with the movie begging to take your attention in too many different ways. It's an attempt at both a gritty novel, a love story, and a witty humor show. It never really gels into any of the above.In spite of all this, if you go into the movie with a generous attitude, it's certainly not the worst film ever made. It suffers from its setbacks--one scene features Wahlberg running the equivalent of a marathon without breaking a sweat, which was demonstrative of the cumulative problems of the script. And yet, if you approach the film without hopes of it being Oscar worthy but instead of it just simply being a creative two hour diversion, then you may find yourself enjoying the film overall. In spite of my criticisms, I've still rated the movie slightly favorably, giving it 6/10 stars.Still, it's a pity that this movie tried so hard and has little to show for its effort. I read on the trivia page here that Wahlberg shed 61 pounds for this role and spent a great amount of time researching college literature professors mannerisms. That's a valiant effort on behalf of a great actor. But in the end, it's not enough to get this train up the hills of Hollywood to where it wanted to be.</fullReview>

This was original and well crafted, immensely watchable. Marky Mark did a fine job, as did Greig Fraser in shooting it, and for a clearly bigger budget, over-marketed film I think it was well worth the entrance fee.And I managed to write all that without mentioning the soundtrack. Jon Brion of Punch- Drunk Love fame has composed a compelling score while an all round strong choice of music.

		<shortDescription>The Gambler / The Douchebag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently reviewed The Loft, which I didn't enjoy as the main characters were so despicable. The Gambler is similar in vein. Within 10 minutes of watching this movie, I was thinking, I think this guy is a hopeless loser, and I hope he just gets offed, and put out of his misery. He plays Blackjack, and within minutes wins $200,000, the amount he owes to the Korean/Chinese boss of the Casino, does he pay off the debt, and just leave $50,000 owing to a gangster ? No !!!!! He goes straight to the Roulette table and gambles everything on black. I've had a gambling problem in the past, but even I couldn't watch this film to it's conclusion. He treats people with contempt, his students, his mother, gangsters, etc, etc, and yet somehow everyone gives him a second chance, etc, etc. He is meant to be highly educated, yet acts like he has an IQ of 80. Another thumbs down for Hollywood. When will they learn, that painting a lead character/s with absolute no redeeming features means the viewer eventually couldn't care what happens in the movie !!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Really Wanted To Love It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to watching this movie and I was expecting something like a darker version of '21'.So, my issues with the movie are...The relationship between Wahlberg and Brie Larsson I just didn't buy into at all for one minute. The chemistry wasn't there, the dialogue wasn't there and I just didn't care about their relationship.Wahlberg is OK in the movie, but the way that his character just goes through the film not caring about his debt and not caring if he lives or dies really does rub off on the audience. I just found myself not bothered about what happened to him. The debt collectors are really unintimidating. The film had a real chance to build some suspense and terror by choosing very imposing and overbearing characters, but chose to run with a caricature Korean man who has his nails done, and Neville, a guy who's less intimidating than a harnessed child.The actor that goes against the grain and who I really enjoyed was John Goodman. He didn't get enough screen time in my opinion. But, what he did get, he was very good. Some of his speeches are brilliant and he is the one character that works well with Wahlberg. Jessica Lange as Wahlberg's mother is also worth an honourable mention.All of this adds up to a film that you just don't really invest in. There are scenes that remind you of how good this film could have been. In particular the Goodman/Wahlberg exchanges. But, there is far too much generic dialogue and paper thin character development to allow these scenes to shine through and take charge of the movie.</fullReview>

I had high expectations for this movie.For some reason I could not wrap my head around what made the main character tick.Hence, it's difficult to judge whether Mark Wahlberg did a good job or not.I'm tempted to say Jim Bennett (Wahlberg's role) was a very smart, very spoiled rich kid gone rebel without a cause as he matured.I hate to say this but I don't recommend the movie unless you're a die hard Wahlberg and Goodman fan.Then again he seems to do his maturing in the latter scenes of the movie; and that was too predictable for my enjoyment.You'd swear Bennett has a gambling problem, but that would be a understatement, only shadowed by what appeared to be a death wish.The loan sharks, all three of them are not very credible for me. Even John Goodman's 'Frank' tip the scales in the unrealistic, but I still like the actor (who doesn't).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gambler is about aimless as its central character and a big 'ol SKIP</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Gambler is one of those movies I wish was never made, but at least I can sleep soundly knowing that next to no one will see it anyway.There is no reason The Gambler should be as bad a film as it is ? the writers and director involved have all experienced success with well made films and the actors are top notched and the glimmer of a thriller is present.And yet, The Gambler stumbles immediately and then falls miraculously for 111 minutes. With a screenplay by William Monahan, screenwriter of The Departed, and director Rupert Wyatt, no novice or stranger to studio films, manage to produce an incredibly underwhelming and sleep inducing film that exploits the con-man crime genre with the grace of a rhinoceros.Mark Wahlberg plays Jim Bennett, a silver spooned punk turned Lit professor, who carelessly gambles himself nearly a quarter million in debt. Loan sharks a plenty come a calling to collect, and Bennett haphazardly continues to try his luck putting those around him in jeopardy.When a film is loosely about gambling addiction masked as a suspenseful thriller, the audience wants the afflicted to have a heart of gold, not be an unconcerned ass, the latter being the character-type for Jim Bennett. He is not charming or entertaining and his role nor the events that unfold are near captivating enough to hold an entire film. There is no greater meaning or implication for the character except that of a cocky addict.The Gambler should have been successful enough as a thriller ? central character in debt up to his eyeballs has to pay off an impossibly large debt by an implausible deadline. The premise is there and yet the film drags on because Monahan unnecessarily forces the viewer on a wild goose chase to pointless end. Perhaps he thought if the film seemed complicated that people would not realize it was a hopeless mess.As a film, The Gambler is about as aimless as its central character, and it shows no greater purpose other than bulking up and filling in the gaps of the filmographies of those involved.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but not much fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself a bit of a gambler. Nothing like the bloke in this film of course but I enjoy a bit of poker a few times a week. Gambling movies of recent times, like 2008's '21', have mostly shown the subject to be a fun experience. 'The Gambler' takes a different route showing it in a dark light where things have really become a problem and lives are being ruined. This makes for a pretty grim watch to be perfectly honestly.Mark Wahlberg was the main selling point going in for me on this one. His work in recent years has been of a pretty high standard and his name on the bill usually equals a quality film. He had lost a lot of weight for the role and apparently did a lot of research, so I knew he was taking things seriously. I wouldn't say all the hard work paid off unfortunately as I felt this was one of the weaker performances in his career. It's possible to play a depressed man with a serious problem and still make him slightly likable but Wahlberg didn't manage to pull this off and his character just ends up tanking every scene in the movie. John Goodman was the stand out for me. In the few scenes he has he steals the spotlight and is captivating to watch.Bit of a miss overall for me. I never felt like I cared about the lead character and when a movie fails to even achieve that you know there's going to be issues all over the show. The script was incredibly lifeless and had almost zero memorable scenes or quotes. The direction felt lazy at times (with the countdown of days being a prime example) and sloppy at others. Wahlberg never sold me and even the film's poster seems incredibly basic and uninspired. It's watchable nonetheless but don't go in expecting a bundle of fun by any means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whalberg has really matured as an actor, so I'll see anything with him. That being said, I wasn't all that interested in this movie. Gambling isn't really my thing and I've never been into it. My friend dragged me to this movie! I had a choice between this movie and The new Hobbit film! I chose this. I will say that this movie was at least interesting. It's a riveting look at the dangers of gambling. I also thought it was a decent character study as well. Mark Whalberg is up to the task, giving a fantastic performance. I did feel his character was unsympathetic and empty, but Mark still gave a wonderful performance. If you're able to ignore that his character is shallow, you should be able to enjoy his performance. He has a great supporting cast around him. Goodman, Lange, Larson, all do well in their roles. My biggest complaint about this movie is that it's far too cold to fully enjoy. There wasn't one person that I "truly" liked in this movie. As great as Whalberg was, I had no sympathy for him. There is nobody to really root for. The ending was completely unsatisfying and I left the theater a bit disillusioned. It's thought-provoking, well-acted, engaging (at times) , but a bit of a mess overall. It's certainly worth a watch, just make sure you wait until the DVD/Blu- ray release. 5.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GAMBLER (2014) *** Mark Wahlberg, Jessica Lange, John Goodman, Brie Larson, Michael Kenneth Williams, Emory Cohen, Anthony Kelley, George Kennedy, Andre Brougher, Richard Schiff, Leland Orser. Brash remake of the 1974 cult-classic starring James Caan, this time with Wahlberg as a degenerate gambling associate professor of literature (ok yeah, that's the hard part to swallow), who has a week to pay back his debts or face certain death. While the existential underpinnings are more abruptly showing on the surface (the character's self-loathing is like a blanket) the screenplay by William Monahan crackles with snark and sharp wit largely abetted by a showcase turn by Goodman as a bald, foreboding loan shark with much insight of the powers that be in the universe and Lange as Wahlberg's long-suffering mother with her own philosophy of life. Director Rupert Wyatt keeps things moving with economy and skill. Worth the efforts by all and all in indeed.</fullReview>

The only thing that keep this movie a float is the acting of the main stars Wahlberg, John Goodman, and the young Brie Larson. Other then the acting the film is pretty bland and dry and leaves you laughing at some of the lines of dialogue in the movie.The movies also tries to be too many things at once, and while trying to be everything, it doesn't land to even be something. The movie holds the cliché problem of a rich guy wants his money back from someone who borrowed it.The movie is also very boring. There are a couple of gambling scenes in the movie that wren't even that suspenseful. The movie also tries to be artsy, which just leaves you asking why the filmmakers added that one desert scene in the movie, it was pointless. The somewhat love story in the film is also very confusing.Without the acting chops given to the viewers by the actors, you won't be missing anything by not seeing this movie.</fullReview>

That being said I was expecting some cool Drama, maybe some twists, and for sure at least one gun being fired. Not some sad baby Mark Wahlberg sulking in money problems because he basically just wants to. Despite all that negative it was still a bit entertaining to watch, especially every scene with John Goodman. Then it ends with a really inspirational scene (sarcasm, this scene was absolutely stupid) of Mark Wahlberg going on an all night run while smiling and looking relieved to some uplifting music because he just paid all his debts. Which was blind luck, the movie would have been way better if the roulette table landed on red so John Goodman was forced to kill Wahlberg and his entire family. Seriously if he died I wouldn't have felt bad for him. You made the bed, sleep in it. I would not recommend this movie seriously, sarcastically I might.</fullReview>

Didn't see that coming!!!" they're were mostly like "Eh... I know that would happen..." It wasn't even that very sad and even the ending really wasn't that sad either.Honestly, this is the most boring I have ever seen since Antz. I actually even saw someone left the movie right before it was even over.I should have seen Into the woods instead.If you are looking for a better movie with a very deep feeling, watch Interstellar that movie is way much better than this boring crap!</fullReview>

A lot of laconic acting coupled with forced "teacher dynamics". I guess I haven't been in college recently, because his professor character is atrocious.He's a gambler, yet we don't see anything to indicate history, addiction, etc. He plays blackjack, and in the opening scene we are expected to experience the roller coaster that is his life in 6 hands? Nope.He's issues with his mom. And while Jessica Lange kills it, she can't prop up the fill-in lead singer of Steel Dragon.Another bright spot is Omar from "The Wire". Michael K. Williams actually demonstrates acting ability and character immersion...maybe he should have been the lead.I just realized I've spend way too long on a movie I was about to walk out of. Here's the short version: The main character is a Lit Teacher so he can have soliloquies to demonstrate depth. That device doesn't work. The main character is a "loser" gambler who keeps chasing and making poor decisions to draw in the audience to his plight. That doesn't work. The main character ruins relationships in a quest for the "rush of winning"--which we never actually see. And in the end, when it of course ends favorable for our hero (OK, I guess that's a "spoiler"), the main character demonstrates hubris and altruism by, literally, walking away...and then running for hours (without sweating a drop, btw) to see the only person he cares about--His Elizabeth Shue, 'Leaving Las Vegas' wannabe, student who is the only person who "gets him". Yeeech! OK, I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2.</fullReview>

This is an excellent film that has more to it that meets the eye. The foreshadowing and the characters were great. Im still thinking about the story told in this film its that good. Mark put on one of best performances ever and with a great supporting cast I believe the movie deserves a Oscar nod. The music was nothing short of perfect and I'm a firm believer that music in a movie is the most important thing, so I don't say that very often, The music coincides with the footage wonderfully and it takes you along for the ride. There's so much symbolism in the movie a lot of people won't get and thats the beauty of it. The only thing I can say bad about it is the development and establishment of the characters. For simple minded people they are not going to understand who the characters are but I totally understand. Overall this was a quality flick I recommend for all people (not children) to see, enjoy , and look up and learn the symbolism in certain scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Audience Gambles and loses by sitting through this POS.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A really terrible script, poor direction and awful soundtrack. Good performances by Wahlberg, Lange and Goodman ALMOST make up for this - the worst movie of 2014; particularly Lange and Goodman. They were better than the script. When the lights went up after the movie the whole audience was questioning why they made this movie.I was really, really surprised how bad the script was for this POS. Overly wordy - at times non-sensical. It seemed like a film someone made in College - except it had some major stars in it. Someone must have bankrolled this.My only guess is that (like his character) M. Wahlberg owed someone in Hollywood a lot of money and this was his way of paying it back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mark Wahlberg is Stupendous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1974 film by the same name, 'The Gambler' is a so-so fare, that is lifted by a Stupendous Performance by Mark Wahlberg. His portrayal of a literature professor with a severe gambling addiction, deserves an ovation. He's the biggest merit of the film, without a shed of doubt! 'The Gambler' Synopsis: Lit professor and gambler Jim Bennett's debt causes him to borrow money from his mother and a loan shark. Further complicating his situation is his relationship with one of his students. Will Bennett risk his life for a second chance?'The Gambler' isn't well-paced or strongly written. I was gripped in parts, but bored otherwise. William Monahan's Adapted Screenplay is a letdown. Seriously, despite adapting such a loved film, why is the Writing Material so lazily done? However, some clever dialogue deserve a mention. Rupert Wyatt's Direction is passable. Cinematography &amp; Editing are standard. Performance-Wise: Wahlberg is the life of 'The Gambler'. His physical transformation as well as his dramatic performance, deserve the highest number of praises. Wahlberg is at his best, after a hiatus. Among the supporting cast, John Goodman is simply brilliant. Jessica Lange is wasted. Brie Larson lacks a meaty role, hence, she doesn't leave a mark. On the whole, 'The Gambler' stumbles, but Wahlberg is at a high!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining in its own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With only seven days to pay off his Gambling debts a narcissistic lecturer finds himself in hot water and running out of time.Based on Fyodor Dostoevsky novella and James Toback's the Gambler, director Rupert Wyatt's offering is a well-paced and a wonderfully shot piece of drama entertainment in its own right. It's tension builds as the days countdown for the debut to get paid back which is complemented by the music and downtown Los Angeles on location setting. In her limited screen time Jessica Lange gives a meaty performance as Mark Wahlberg's character's mother, Roberta. Both John Goodman and Michael K. Williams are exceptional as the loan sharks. Brie Larson is great as Amy but her student character and Jim Bennett never really feel connected enough to emphasise the danger they are in. The dialogue is profanity laced, in-keeping with the environment and the world in which Mark Wahlberg's Jim Bennett resides. Wahlberg is perfectly cast, reliably superb as the sharp unlikeable venomous literature professor. With snappy dialogue and timed mannerisms he achieves a believable performance. That said, under the cool pretence and intense pressure on the backdrop of impending doom at times he feels a little too fearless. William Monahan's dialogue rolls of Wahlberg's Jim tongue as he searches for redemption. Still as he plays it out more than adequately you can't help but feel for his characters sensibility.It's not an easy watch given the unsavoury main character but just like the character's plight it isn't meant to be. Recommend for that reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gambler Left Me Out In the Cold...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately I was quite disappointed by this film. The subject-matter and trailers had intrigued me. I found it impossible to connect emotionally with the one-dimensional main character Jim, as played by Mark Wahlberg. He is a heavy-duty gambling addict throughout the film, but at no time do we get any insight into how he might have gotten that way. I found that Wahlberg's character, as well as the three main dark characters to whom he owes money, were almost comic book cut-outs from some sort of graphic novel. No depth to them; no convincing gravitas - somehow one-dimensional.I also found that the writing was marginal at best, with a lot of dialog that just didn't seem natural or authentic. Strange details too; such as the main character, who is an associate professor of English at a fictitious college, always seems to be wearing a tailored suit. And do associate professors of English at no-name colleges actually earn $150K to $200K per year as the script alleges? The female romantic interest in the film seems redundant and almost artificially injected into the story. Any chemistry between she and gambler Jim is tepid at best and doesn't ring true. Finally, the "typical Hollywood ending" of this film was so predictable as to be laughable.Bottom line: Although I went to see "The Gambler" with an open mind and high hopes, in the end I felt cheated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gambler: Dirk Diggler Strikes Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Gambler could have been a great film about a melancholy literature professor who only finds solace for his uncanny existential broodings in compulsive reckless gambling. But then someone had the bright idea of casting Marky Mark Wahlberg as the Lead, perhaps Wahlberg himself. To be sure, there have been some roles where he was perfectly cast and delivered magnificently, and to this day still most notably as the vacuous young pornographer Dirk Giggler in Boogie Nights. Twenty years on he's still trying to de-Dirk-Digglerize his acting range. This was his big chance.Unfortunately, he didn't make the grade. So we're at the end of act one-COLLEGE CLASSROOM-DAY: So far we've learned that our protagonist is not only a reckless gambler-with zero game strategy apart from "I'm all in"- who just blew the two hundred and something grand on black Jack he had borrowed from some hard boiled roughs, Korean and black respectively. We're about to discover he's also a rather shallow professor of literature who excels at melodramatic existential drivel. while I'm not sure as to what levels of Buffonish stupidity our modern day literature professors have stooped to in order to keep students entertained to bankroll the American corporate educational system, Wahlberg's quasi inspired hyperbolic speech to his students still seemed to me like a Ben Stilleresque anticlimactica. Maybe it was a class about existentialism for idiots. And the young beautiful Amy Phillips (Brie Larson) that the disillusioned professor deems as a prodigal genius, does not strike the audience as in any way better than average apart from the fact that she sports nerdy glasses and tells us that she learned how to read when she was two years old. But then again most of the other kids in that college class appear to be borderline illiterate?So maybe she is a genius after all. And of course our dear protagonist needs a love interest: and what better match for our lachrymose professor than a coed blonde. Warning-perhaps this is a bit of an spoiler but you will discover that the rest of Brie Larson's contribution to the movie is merely ornamental and she does little more than give Jim Bennett (Wahlberg) a ride to the Casino and sleep with him (that goes without saying). But of course that will be reason enough for Wahlberg's Forest Gumpish marathon to his sweetheart's doorstep at the end of the movie, giving an audience friendly twist ending to an otherwise dark progression of events. There are some supporting roles that deserve mention. Jessica Lange playing Wahlberg's Iron mother outshines the rest of the ensemble with an asymmetrically superior performance. Perhaps someone had better whisper in her ear that she was in a mediocre movie. John Goodman knew exactly what was up, so he called it in with another Cohen brother's performance. (Invoking the Dude's Friend Walter)this time in the guise of a tough Gangster Loan Shark, Goodman warns us about what he will do to people who try to screw him up the back end. The other gangsters Alvin Ing and Michael Kenneth Williams seemed more charming than threatening largely because they weren't sure what genre of movie they were in: Who's in charge here the screenwriter,Director? Nevertheless they were entertaining. Anthony Kelly carries his role as the college Basketball star struggling with a grade point average,uneventfully.If you have a couple of hours to burn The Gambler is not a bad way to pass the time, especially if you're tired of over produced movies with exhausting camera work and choppy editing. Rupert Wyatt did well to temper it's stylization. If we were back in 1974 when the original The Gambler came out, when Hollywood was spewing great films a dime a dozen I would have rated this movie a 3. But since there isn't many a good film out there these days I'll give it a passing 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible script!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that jumps out about this movie is the writing... The writing is trash, clichéd, tired, it completely misses the mark on any semblance of reality. Not only are the characters tired stereotypes, the theme is a cliché all the way down the to predictable "happy" ending. The film lacks any heart whatsoever... It would all together be easily forgettable if it were not for the boarder line offensive material displayed. It is almost as if you want to punch Hollywood in the face and scream "really this is how you view me? You think i am this stupid?" You don't need to see this movie don't waste your time, go out go somewhere else live your life the fullest and let my mistake serve as your example. Please don't got... If you do they will just make a part 2 and the world is a better place without any parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a gripping film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film's trailer called my name, in a way. Therefore I went to see this movie last night and I can officially say I'm a "quitter", since I ended up walking out after the film's first hour. It's not something I do but the lack technical mastery this movie was missing was unbelievable. At first, I thought I was going to see Mark Wahlberg delivering a great and memorable masterpiece, but as time passed my hopes felt betrayed, mainly due to the lack of emotions in every aspect from Jim Bennett. Also, his way of treating everyone the exact same way was also something that bummed me out. Since when do you treat every one in life a same way without differencing each person. I can understand that that's how the character is, yet I believe there's a more richer way to execute this role. The way Mark felt throughout the movie is the way we did too.The storyline was also predictable, and the character of the student he's into should've been more developed. A good way to describe this film would be: BLUNT.This really caught me by surprise since I follow and admire much of Mr. Wahlberg's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so horrible that it would be more entertaining to count the wrinkles on my balls. Marky Mark is a terrible gambler, to the extent it is making me angry. This is the film in short:Marky mark looses a lot of money. Marky mark gets more money- Marky mark looses a lot of money. Marky mark meets girl and mafia, and has money to get out of trouble. Marky mark looses a lot of money again. Marky mark gets girl and gets away from mafia...To see this is not to enjoy a movie, the correct world would be "suffering".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. "I'm all in!" That's a gambling phrase of which even the most risk-averse amongst us recognizes. When Blackjack addict Jim Bennett (played by Mark Wahlberg) goes all in, which he does every time, it's more proof that he is "the kind of guy that likes to lose" ? a description offered by one of the mobsters and loan sharks who lend him money.Director Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, 2011) and screenwriter William Monahan (The Departed) deliver a remake of the very cool 1974 film of the same title starring James Caan and written by James Toback. Wahlberg is spot on as the self-destructive gambler who, rather than live for the thrill of winning, seems intent on pushing the envelope of misery and turmoil. His character manages to go seriously in debt to the Koreans who run the underground gambling establishments, as well as ruthless gangster Michael Kenneth Williams ("Boardwalk Empire"), and a philosophical mobster (a bald John Goodman) doing his best Jabba the Hut impersonation. These are three guys most of us would avoid at all costs.Unfortunately, it's a bit more challenging to accept Wahlberg as the rebellious writing prodigy with a privileged background, who articulates in a motor-mouthed rapid-fire onslaught of derisive observations meant to prove how he so despises mediocrity. It's obvious Wahlberg is "all in" for this role, but it's difficult not to compare to the more nuanced performance of Caan forty years ago.Brie Larson (so great in Short Term 12) plays the bright student in Wahlberg's class, but her role is so limited we are left to only imagine the heights of her talent. Anthony Kelley plays Lamar, a college basketball player ripe for Wahlberg's world, and Andre Braugher has a blink-and-you'll-miss-it scene as the college dean. Richard Schiff offers up some comic relief as a pawn broker making Wahlberg's misery just a tad worse. The great George Kennedy plays Wahlberg's dying grandfather in the film's opening scene, and he is the first to provide warning on the mess his grandson has created.Jessica Lange does a wonderful job as Wahlberg's estranged mother who is filled with both scorn and sadness at the state of her son, and offers up one last bag of cash in an attempt to allow him to begin anew. The support work is strong across the board, but it's Goodman who stands out, both with dialogue and a physical presence that deserves some type of award for personal courage and lack of inhibition. His monologue on "F.U. money" is worth the price of admission, though you may request a refund after seeing him shirtless in the sauna.There is a distinctive style to the film, though at times it comes across as a Scorcese wannabe. From a soundtrack perspective, the diversity of music ranges from classical to folk to big band, with some of the lyrics acting as commentary on the story. The film is pretty entertaining as you watch, but leaves an emptiness once it's over. With so much that works, it's a shame it all disappears so quickly ? just like money on a Blackjack table.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No reason needed..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe the greatest gambling action the main character took was gambling with his own life, that's how it seemed like with a story line so different than any other gambling movie I've ever seen. The movie focuses on the motives behind any gambler actually starting a life long habit of taking chances, motives that are a little bit blurred, maybe for the money or success or both (or none). The definition of gambling is "Taking risky action in the hope of a desired result" the character of Jim Bennett (Wahlberg) didn't feel that society needs mediocre level anymore, he felt like genius should be recognized, and "genius" was what he gambled for..A fairly enjoyable movie with a well built main character. Some solid acting of course, I for one love the soundtrack played throughout the movie and of course enjoyed watching the John Goodman!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had many of the components for a great film but was missing the emotional investment between the viewer and Bennett</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had both its pros and its cons. This film's cinematography was nicely done with beautifully lit and composed scenes. The soundtrack also paired very nicely with the story and kept the flow of the movie moving nicely. Finally, the witty dialogue was also a nice asset to the film, but not enough to carry the whole story on its shoulders. As for Marks character,he can be perceived differently for each viewer. I found it hard to root for him throughout the film, partially because of his careless actions and also the fact that there was no initial set up to draw a connection between him and the viewer. Perhaps this is what the director was aiming for, a disconnect between the viewer and the character but if so, there should have been some resolution by the end when (SPOILER) Bennet essentially gambled his life. I didn't feel that emotionally invested in Bennet to care if he won or lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Gambler", starring Mark Wahlberg-Lone Survivor, Planet of the Apes_2001; Brie Larson-21 Jump Street, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World; John Goodman-The Monuments Men, Argo and Jessica Lange-American Horror Story_tv, Tootsie.This is a remake of a 1974 movie of the same name. Why another remake? I guess remakes are the 'hot' thing to do nowadays but I don't remember the original movie being that great-Oh, maybe that's it! The new audiences are unfamiliar with the original and this is new to them. FYI: it was just announced that Mark Wahlberg is going to play Steve Austin in the Six Billion Dollar Man in 2016, which I guess they had to up the monetary value from million to billion for inflation. Anyway, Mark plays a college literature professor that happens to have a gambling problem. He is smart, he has even written novels, but when it comes to gambling, it's something else. He will usually win at first and then just keep on playing until he is deep in debt. Jessica plays his rich mother that is getting tired of bailing him out of debt and cuts him off, financially. Brie is a student in Mark's class that gets involved with Mark on a more personal note and John is one of the lucky people that Mark owes money to. It's not a bad movie, just sort of bland. The acting is descent with plenty of good actors but I have to ask again, why remake it? It's rated "R" for language, violence and sexual situations-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 51 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I would not rent it, either. If you want to see it, then wait until it comes to cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Mark Wahlberg ... script and movie sucked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked out on it.Playing professional poker on the side and having yet to meet such an individual as portrayed in the film, it wasn't realistic to me. I watched for less than 45 minutes, walked out to the customer service desk and got a re-admit pass. I'll probably watch American Sniper with it.This all being said, Mark Wahlberg is a fantastic actor, just got stuck with a rotten script and an unrealistic plot.After watching the 2nd borrowing attempt to get a loan to cover his debts I'm reminded of cardinal rules that I follow: Never play a game you don't understand and never play with money you can't afford to lose. All the people I know with few exceptions play by these rules. And the exceptions are all still living so my guess is they play with money they can afford to lose. :) Mark should not have accepted this film. However, his acting is great in it. The supporting roles are convincing even if I've never seen any such types. Since there are high-stakes places, speak-easy's if you will, there may well be such real things that happen. If that's the case, I'm wrong.Lone Survivor, Shooter, Invincible and many others are FANTASTIC. Mark is one of the finest contemporary actors. I can't wait for his next film.</fullReview>
