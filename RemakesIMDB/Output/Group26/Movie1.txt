		<shortDescription>A Pre-War Treasure: The Casbah as Imagined by a Decaying Eurocentrism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Algiers" is director John Cromwell's remake of the French film, "Pepe Le Moko" which appeared only a year earlier. The Gallic flick starred Jean Gabin, then and now one of the truly great actors to emerge from that country. So Cromwell took a risk giving the lead role of jewel thief Pepe to young actor Charles Boyer. The risk paid off - and continues to do so as this fascinating prewar movie is readily available on budget-priced DVD.Pepe is wanted in metropolitan France for stealing jewelry but not, apparently, for any crimes of violence. He's hunkered down in Algiers's famous "casbah," the native quarter whose name is evocative of mystery and, of course, sensuality. Pepe seems to be a sort of Great White Crime Boss in the native quarter where locals both protect and respect him. It's never clear how he ascended to that height.Pepe has a beautiful lover, Ines, played by the truly gorgeous Sigrid Gurie. Legend has it that "Algiers" was to be the vehicle to propel this Scandanavian actress to wide fame but in reality her film career was rather short. The winner in this case, besides Boyer, was newcomer Hedy Lamar whose role as Gaby is central to Pepe's loss of control over his small world and, eventually, of himself.Gaby arrives in Algiers engaged to a fat, vulgar borderline-loathsome older man who clearly regards her as a trophy bought and paid for. Why she needed this creep isn't clear. What is clear is her falling in love with Pepe who abandons the devoted and clinging Ines for this right-off-the-boat hothouse beauty.A Parisian police official is in Algiers (Algeria, a French colony for those who don't know history) determined to collar Pepe. His forays into the casbah meet with no success and quiet derision from both the locals and some of the French police who understand that the casbah is honeycombed with escape routes and populated with folks eager to thwart the gendarmerie. A very interesting character is Inspector Slimane, Joseph Calleia. Amused by the foolish antics of his superior, Slimane knows the casbah and in his own way is determined to bring Pepe to justice. His mission isn't kept from Pepe and the two have a cordial relationship with the cop telling the crook that eventually he will be the cause of his own downfall.Sarcastic, witty and observant, Slimane is an arresting character (pun intended). It's not clear if he's a native gone over to the police or a Frenchman who has jumped the reservation and found a more comfortable life straddling two cultures. There's something almost Russian in his outlook and words."Algiers" ends with a famous scene that while not at the level of the closing moments of "Casablanca" nonetheless rightfully shares pride of place with that all-time great movie.Boyer is powerful in a role in which, through circumstances he could have controlled but didn't, he slides into a mortal abyss.A must-see movie for anyone interested in prewar films that reflect an actually racist view of non-European life at once almost ridiculous but at the same time dramatically engaging.And let's not forget yesterday's lunacies: Cromwell, a director with many films under his belt, was blacklisted through most of the 50s and his career never rebounded from that extra-legal punishment for non-crimes.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Gabin Have Been Better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tragic account of Pepe Le Moko having been filmed in France the year before with Jean Gabin as the star must have really impressed producer Walter Wanger. It's not often that a remake is made only a year later.Jean Gabin who has been compared to Humphrey Bogart certainly would have brought a different style of Pepe Le Moko. But this film did wonders for Charles Boyer in establishing him among the first rank of American film stars.His Pepe is suave, cunning, and deadly. Unfortunately while hanging out in the forbidden section of French Algiers known as the Casbah, Pepe has sort of built his own prison in that section. He cannot leave because the French police will grab him and a whole bunch of countries are getting in line with the French Foreign office to deport to face a slew of crimes. But in the Casbah he's untouchable as the visiting French prefect Paul Harvey finds out. Joseph Calleia as Inspector Slimane knows the only way to capture him is to lure him out of his shelter. And the bait for that walks in with a visiting tourist from Paris played by Hedy Lamarr.Hedy Lamarr was under contract to MGM having been brought over by Louis B. Mayer after her scandalous nude scene in the Austrian film Ecstacy. But MGM couldn't find anything for her to do, so she stayed idle drawing her weekly paycheck while a suitable property was found.Boyer met Lamarr at a party according to The Films of Hedy Lamarr Citadel Press Series book and was taken with her. He told Walter Wanger and Wanger worked out a deal with Mayer that they could have Lamarr if Boyer did an MGM film. The one he did was Conquest with Greta Garbo. Seems to have worked out all around.There's a lot of debate as to how good an actress Lamarr was. And in the right circumstances she could give a decent performance. The right circumstances was definitely Algiers where Boyer knew that the woman who could stir him from his safety net had to be one extraordinarily beautiful woman. No one ever questioned that about Lamarr. Algiers launched her career for American audiences with a blowout performance.Charles Boyer was nominated for Best Actor as Pepe, but lost to Spencer Tracy in Boys Town. And Gene Lockhart as the treacherous Regis got a nod for Best Supporting Actor, but he was beaten out by Walter Brennan in Kentucky.What's even more extraordinary is that Director John Cromwell did a magnificent job in capturing the mood and ambiance of Algiers. A few establishing newsreel shots and great sets and you would think this was done on location.There was a third film version of Pepe Le Moko's story with Casbah starring Tony Martin. It was a musical version that fell short of establishing Martin as a big screen draw, but the songs were some of his best selling records.Still though Boyer does a fabulous job as Pepe, though I would some day like to see Jean Gabin's version for comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The jewel thief of the Casbah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imitation is the best form of flattery. For audiences that haven't seen the far superior, "Pepe le Moko", directed by Julien Duvivier, this version, will have to suffice. "Algiers" follows its French model in ways that it's just not a remake, it's a copy of the other film.Fortunately for John Cromwell, a fine director, he got a tremendously appealing performance by Charles Boyer, a suave actor who embodied the famous jewel thief of that notorious district of Algiers. This film was also made better thanks to the magic camera work by James Wong Howe, one of the best men in the business, as proved by his long and distinguished career behind the scenes. Henri LaBarthe's novel was adapted for this American version by John Howard Lawson, with James Cain's helping with additional dialog."Algiers" is not without its own merits. Thanks to the talented cast that came together for the making of this film, it has gained the status of a classic. Charles Boyer was perfect as Pepe, a man whose life centers around the mysterious citadel where all kinds of unsavory characters live. Hedy Lamarr, one of the most beautiful faces in the movies, makes a good appearance as Gaby, the woman who steals Pepe's heart. Gaby and Pepe have a common ground as they reminisce of Paris, a city both love.The other triumph of "Algiers" was the way the supporting players made this story much better, as it seems impossible to visualize other people cast for the key minor parts. Sigrid Gurie, is a mysterious Ines, the woman in love with Pepe. In her love, she doesn't stop to take into consideration what her actions will do to her lover. Gene Lockhart, a magnificent character actor, is phenomenal in his take of Regis, the schemer of the Casbah. Joseph Calleia, is perfectly sly as Inspector Slimane, a man with the patience of a saint, who must humor Pepe and his gang and who is powerless inside the Casbah. Stanley Fields makes a loyal Carlos, Pepe's trusted companion. Johnny Downs is seen as Pierrot and Leonid Kinskey, another character actor who worked extensively in that period of the American cinema, is excellent as L'arbi.For those who haven't seen the original Duvivier film, try getting the wonderful DVD to see the great Jean Gabin in one of his best roles. The copy shown by TCM recently, seemed somewhat faded. We don't know if it has been remastered yet, but obviously, James Wong Howe's work ought to be seen in all its magnificence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a stunning film on many different levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Algiers is stunning film on many different levels that carries an unusual originality for the time period. The romantic chemistry between Hedy Lamarr(Gaby) Charles Boyer(Pepe)is perhaps one of the movie's most fascinating and unusual aspects. But what really makes things shine is the brilliant black and white cinematography of James Wong Howe.There are also many different one liners and camera shots in this film that have become famous over the years and it's fun just looking for things that you've heard or seen before. I'm not sure how much Warner Brother's cartoons based their stinky skunk (Pepe le Pew) on Charles Boyer's character Pepe le Moko but there has be some correlation.Anyway, Algiers is a grand piece of entertainment well worth the watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clouded by intrigue, aglow with ill-starred romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film countless times on tv, usually in the 1 a.m. time slot. Am always fascinated by it somehow. There's such an authentic atmosphere of the locale, very suspicious characters, intrigue and suspense both indoors and on the streets.The suave Charles Boyer (as Pepe, the thief) certainly grips one's attention while he becomes more mired in the plot as it unfolds. Hedy Lamarr lights up the screen with her glowing beauty, one forgets she's supposed to be acting, but is that important? Of course not. I can't imagine the story having her engaged to marry an elderly wide-girthed fellow; my goodness, for her anything's better than that! There's a youngish Leonid Kinskey also appearing as a supporting actor, along with reliable Alan Hale (formerly Robin Hood's buddy, more or less) and Gene Lockhart, whom I've never seen in such a serious role as this one. It's a movie that stands the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>murky, but grand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard of this movie, and when I finally had a chance to view it, I was hooked. I actually thought I was in Algiers and the casbah. When I first saw Hedy Lamarr make her entrance, I was hooked again. What a vision of beauty. I could see now when fans talk about legendary beauties of Hollywood, she is most mentioned. Charles Boyer was great as Pepe La Moko, and so was Gene Lochart as the informer. To me, the ending was most tragic, and I will never forget the fading ship sailing away and Hedy's vision, never to see her lover again. No wonder its a classic. They don't make movies like these anymore, the pity of it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back in the Casbah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was made just one year after Duvivier's classic ,which even Godard (Godard!)mentioned in his "Pierrot LE Fou".Although I hate God'Art about as much as I love Duvivier,I must admit that a film that can transcend the New Wavelet's contempt possesses something magic a la "Casablanca" .I was skeptical about the lead:aristocratic Charles Boyer replacing plebeian Gabin?I was wrong :Boyer,who began his career in France after all ,was up to scratch.And I 'd go as far as to write that Hedy Lamarr is much more attractive than Mireille Balin in the original.All that remains is faithful like a dog: except for the scene when an old singer (Frehel) bursting into tears when she hears one of her old recordings,all the important sequences were kept.Cromwell's directing is efficient ,although it never recaptures the intensity (and the director's pessimism) of its model ,is a good film one can recommend to people who cannot get "Pepe Le Moko" .Objections: the scene of Pierrot 's letter and the punishment of the informer is much too long and lacks suspense.Biggest gaffe is this ditty ("C'est La Vie" ) which Boyer sings and which seems out of a musical :in what is primarily a film noir,it's thoroughly incongruous.Many of the great lines of the French classic can be heard ,notably the famous "I'm an informer,I'm not a hypocrite",and the Boyer/Lamarr pairing displays a special chemistry .The black and white makes a good use of shadows and lights.If all the remakes were made with care like this one.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A study in cultural translation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Algiers just a few days after its French original, Pepe le Moko, which doesn't do Algiers a lot of favors. So, before writing this review, I read the 20+ ones already posted here, mostly from viewers who had not seen Pepe le Moko first, to see how they reacted to Algiers without knowing the French original. Most of them liked it a lot.While I wouldn't go that far - despite a few of the comments, I found this movie not even close to Casablanca - I did find it enjoyable for certain things, if not for others.While I like Charles Boyer in certain movies (Gaslight, primarily), in this film he is radically inferior to his French predecessor, Jean Gabin. Gabin is very believable as a thief and member of the underworld; it is hard to imagine Boyer surviving there 10 minutes. Gabin could be rough and charming; Boyer is "suave", but there is no dark underside to it.Hedy Lamarr is indeed beautiful, and sometimes gets to do some acting here. She never overacts (as Boyer and some of the others do), so she is always fun to watch.The best acting, however, is in the character roles, some of which are in no way inferior to the original. Gene Lockart's death screen is well acted and magnificently staged; it is one of the best moments in the movie. Joseph Calleia is very good as the police agent throughout.Still, the best thing in this movie, for me, was the lighting and camera work. Often atmospheric, some of the shots are very strikingly composed. The next time I watch this movie, it would be tempting to do so with the sound off for most of it - though not when Vincent Scotto's music is playing. It is haunting and very evocative; another of the best features of the film.My only complaint about this movie is the end, which some previous reviewers liked. (Here comes the spoiler.) In the original, Jean Gabin commits suicide when he realizes he can't have Gaby; it is a chilling scene very well done. In the American remake Boyer gets shot while running to the ship; it makes him much more of a victim without control of his destiny, and in that sense was a real aggravation after having seen how it "could have been done." Other changes in the movie are interesting examples of cultural differences: in the French original, Gaby is the well-paid mistress of the wealthy overweight Frenchman; there is no question of marriage between them. In the American remake, they are engaged, and while there is no suggestion either loves the other, the relationship would have been seen as less immoral. In the same sense, the low-life is the French Casbah is much more clearly low: prostitution, etc. That is all glossed over in the American remake.So, a movie worth watching, especially for the lighting, the camera work, and some of the direction, as well as the acting of some of the subordinates. Watch this movie first, and then Pepe le Moko, and you will enjoy it more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lamarr's first American film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, Charles Boyer never said, "Take me to the Casbah." That is just as false as "Play it again, Sam," a line from a film that will come to mind when watching this one.Boyer (Conquest, Fanny, Gaslight) picked up his second Oscar nomination for this film. He plays a jewel thief that has found a haven in the Casbah in French Algiers. He has a hot girlfriend in Sigrid Gurie, but he sees Hedy Lamarr and it is all over. he falls head over heels and spends languid afternoon reminiscing about a Paris that he can never see again.Director John Cromwell, who had his career ruined by McCarthy fascist in the 50s, did a very good job of presenting the excitement of the Casbah and the attempts by the French police to trap Boyer. He was ably assisted by the sets decorated by Alexander Toluboff (Stagecoach, Vogues of 1938) and the cinematography of James Wong Howe (The Rose Tattoo, Hud), who along with Toluboff received an Oscar nomination for this film, the first of ten in his career.Just like Kong, it wasn't man, but beauty killed the beast. In this case, the beauty of Hedy Lamarr proved to be the death of Boyer in an ending that will again remind one of Casablanca.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique and Captivating Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*********************MILD SPOILERS*************************************I like this movie. Algiers has an exotic and mysterious air about it. There is also a message about yearning for love and how it makes us crazy. This movie portrays glimmers of hope and then there is desperation and sadness and loss. Pepe Le Moko and the beautiful tourist (Hedy Lamarr) struggle with the choices they've made in life and wonder if they could find happiness together. Dare they risk it? You can sense them wrestling with their thoughts and emotions. Shall they simply exist or attempt to find happiness together? What about the other people in their lives they will affect?Charles Boyer is terrific as Pepe Le Moko, a criminal hiding in the Casbah, where he and others live in their own strange world. He isn't portrayed as perfect, and he has a cruel side to his nature. Sigrid Gurie and Hedy Lamarr are stunning in their roles. These beautiful women are captivating, and Hedy Lamarr says more with her eyes than words could ever express.The lead characters aren't alone in revealing fascinating glimpses of human nature. Joesph Calleia shows ever increasing cunning and snakelike patience as he waits for the right time and opportunity to capture Pepe Le Moko. Gene Lockhart is a tour de force as a treacherous scoundrel who wants to turn Pepe Le Moko in for a reward. Johnny Downs is instantly lovable as the protege that Pepe cares for like a kid brother. The fascinating characters in the Casbah are too numerous too mention. And despite all of the tragedy, this movie is somehow bittersweet. Another strong suit of this movie is the music. It's wonderful. I could listen to the score by itself, but why do that when it enhances the movie so beautifully?What a treat to discover this old movie from 1938. My rating is 92/100. Worth buying. Unfortunately, the DVD copy I have has obviously had some of the edges of the film cropped off to make it fit the TV screen. It was well worth buying despite this, just to be able to watch this fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never heard of this film before, but have heard the famous line from it, "Let me take you to the Casbah." When I saw this at a video store I bought it (it was $2.00!!). Pepe Le Moto, I mean come on. This has got to be a really over the top one. With nothing to do, I watched it that night.WOW!! What a film. I will go on to say that it is almost as good as Casablanca! Though it is not about the war, being made in 1938. The acting, sets, lighting, and most important, the script. I didn't experence one dull moment. In the beginning you got to learn about the characters and then it moved like crazy. The acting was superb and I can not believe that it did not win any oscars, though it did receive 4 nominations (including best actor-Boyer and best supporting actor-Lockart).With only one other comment here, I guess no one else has seen this classic either. You simply must watch this when you get the chance!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's not to like about this movie? The line "Take Me to the Casbah" is quite timeless... I think I probably first heard it from Bugs Bunny. Well, this is the movie that explains the line (i.e. Movie Trivia for Dummies). There is some great footage (which I do not know for sure, but would bet is actual) from "the Casbah" section of Algiers...Fascinating. There is also the great Charles Boyer as Pepe. He's suave, debonair, fabulously foreign, and also a complete louse ala his mistress, Ines. I just hate that all of the most fabulous movie stars are dead!! Consider also Pepe's "new" love interest, played by Hedy Lamarr. Good grief! She is gorgeous on par with Rita Hayworth in "Gilda." She's very posh, but likes slumming it, too. You can't help but root for this couple to beat the odds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Atmospheric Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though "Algiers" is not so well-remembered today, it's not hard to see why it was quite popular in its time. It's a good atmospheric drama that makes you feel as if you were part of the story, and it also has a good cast and interesting characters. The story is told well, and most of the time it moves at a good pace.The atmosphere of the 'Casbah' is set up nicely from the beginning. The opening scene, as the police discuss how they might catch the notorious Pepe Le Moko, is very efficient in describing the city and its peculiarities, and it is a good prologue to the story that follows. As it progresses, there are a lot of interesting details with some good photography that bring everything to life. Boyer and Lamarr are pretty good as the leads, although the supporting cast and characters are least as important to making everything work. It has several fine character actors such as Gene Lockhart, Alan Hale, Joseph Calleia, and Paul Harvey, who all play interesting roles.Aside from a couple of slow spots and perhaps a few minor signs of age, this is an entertaining drama that is well worth tracking down for anyone who enjoys classic cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really well done film that documents the true nature of the Casbah . A ghetto section of Algiers it was home to many peoples and religions , the most common theme was as a hideout for illegal activity and a haven for fugitives from justice somewhere in the world .The atmosphere is well done as a rather dank and dusty centuries old maze of connecting modules one leading to the other where only natives have a chance of navigating their way through .Pepe le Moko (Charles Boyer) is a fugitive from France jewel thief who longs to be home , Sigrid Gurie his shadow who does anything for his love .And Hedy Lamarr as the beauty who swoops in and steals Pepe's heart and good sense .A very entertaining film to watch .

		<shortDescription>They Had A Date With Fate In Ze Casbah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cromwell's ALGIERS is basically a shot-by-shot English language remake of the French film PEPE LE MOKO (1937). This is not to say it is an unworthy remake- quite the contrary. With the smoldering Charles Boyer (nominated for Best Actor) as the French-born criminal hiding out in the depths of the Casbah, and the stunningly beautiful Hedy Lamarr as the engaged French tourist who he falls for, ALGIERS is extremely worthwhile viewing. Cromwell's capable and creative direction, impressive production and set detailing and the smoky black-and-white atmosphere photographed by stalwart James Wong Howe all make ALGIERS a fine film. It obviously influenced Curtiz's much-lauded CASABLANCA with it's depiction of the crowded, bustling exotic Casbah.The film hangs on the premise of career criminal Boyer allowing himself to fall for a woman, placing him in danger as he dares to venture out of the confining, yet safe, Casbah in a moment of passionate madness. Lamarr, in supreme close-up represents everything that the homesick Boyer longs for. His initial interest in her is for her jewelery, yet in a series of stunning, stunning shots he instead focuses on Hedy's tantalizing mouth instead of the sparkling jewels dripping off her wrists. Cromwell films the romance in forbidden snatches, with Boyer and Lamarr heating up the screen in their roles. In the film's most erotic moments Boyer, endlessly reminded of his longed-for homeland by Lamarr, likens the sound of her heartbeat to a subway train and the smell of her dark hair to the underground.Boyer becomes an intensely tragic figure as the film progresses, with his final scene (the film's finest) extremely memorable and oft-imitated. Boyer, lured out of "ze Casbah" by his passion, finds a sad, departing (endlessly beautiful) Lamarr staring out at the Moroccan shoreline from her ship. Boyer, handcuffed, screams out her name, running towards her, rattling on the gates that bar him. He is shot and killed, yet in the end is "free". Wonderfully presented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine drama. Hedy Lamarr's American film debut!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Algiers. Charles Boyer's Pepe le Moko is very entertaining. The movie is good visually, particularly the inside of the Casbah and the wharf. And this was Hedy Lamarr's first American film appearance. This role was largely decorative and didn't require her to act much. Because of this, her acting abilities have been wrongly doubted right from the beginning. Not even the many great performances she gave in later films completely extirpated this myth. I believe this was because her incredible beauty blinded people to her good acting in those films and the fact some of those films are utterly forgettable to anyone not a die-hard Lamarr fan. It's too bad she turned down Gaslight a few years later. It would have been great to see her paired with Boyer for a second time. And when this was made, Ingrid Bergman had only recently taken the role in Casablanca that I wish could have been Hedy's. I steadfastly believe both Casablanca and Gaslight would have been better with Hedy. I know that's a bold statement, but I would much rather watch Hedy than Ingrid any day! Of the Algiers supporting cast, two did go on to make other films with Hedy: Gene Lockhart was in The Strange Woman and Joseph Calleia was in The Conspirators, Warner's Casablanca follow-up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come Wiz Me to Zee Casbah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boyer doesn't actually say that, of course -- in fact, he never LEAVES the Casbah, so how could he -- but it's the general idea. I'm told this independently-produced Hollywood classic is almost a shot-for-shot remake of Duvivier's "Pepe Le Moko," from the previous year; I've never seen that one, but it's hard to believe Duvivier could have matched John Cromwell's fabulous production design, combining skillful backlot compositions with second-unit location projections, or the moody James Wong Howe photography, with the sweeping tracking shots capturing life in every corner.The story may be no more than standard romantic hokum, but whether the filmmakers intended it or not, the movie has a wonderful existential melancholy, with Boyer's heavy eyelids viewing the world impassively, accepting his fate unquestioningly. Add to that a fine rogue's gallery of character actors (especially nice work from Gene Lockhart and Alan Hale), and you have brilliant Hollywood escapism. The judicious, sparing use of music (unusual in those Max Steiner days of underline-everything-with-a-melody) adds to the atmosphere. And it matters not a whit that Hedy Lamarr is not much of an actress here, or that every plot turn is utterly predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful performances by Lamarr and Boyer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie well worth watching. The interaction between the leads, Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr, is nothing short of beautiful.Other people have described the plot, the setting, and the great photography, so I will skip that. Some have written here that Algiers compares well to "Casablanca." I can't agree with that. This movie doesn't have the heroism, the larger than life situation, the love triangle. For that reason, I can't rate it more than 8 (while I rate Casablanca a 10+).As has also been noted here, Algiers is a remake of the French movie "Pepe Le Moko". I have not seen that movie. I'm sure I will someday. Some people have written that the French movie is better, and that the lead actor there, Gabin, is more believable as a gangster. That may well be true; I will not argue it. It doesn't matter. Boyer is excellent here. His personna is completely believable to me, and, frankly, I don't much care how closely he matches authentic French gangsters. No wonder so may female movie fans fell in love with him! The movie is made even more appealing by the secondary characters. Gene Lockart's informer is well acted. Joseph Calleia does a great job as the "native" detective who has easy access to the Casbah. Sigrid Gurie is great as the jealous courtesan. Alan Hale Sr. is great as the witty erudite criminal. The rough fellow who always says "OK" was fun. I also enjoyed the slim bodyguard dressed in white who never said anything; not sure which actor this is.If there is a flaw, it is maybe an overall dearth of intensity. Maybe this is a question of evolving movie-making style, a difference of eras. I think we expect criminals these days to show a lot of anger, to hear a lot of nasty snarling dialogue. You aren't going to hear that in this movie.And frankly I don't care because this is not a crime drama, it's a tragic love story. Which brings us to the main reason to see this movie. Hedy Lamarr. What can I say? "Wow" is hardly sufficient. "Holy @#!&amp;%" doesn't help much. Of all the beautiful actresses there have been, of all the kinds of beauty -- cute, girl-next-door, classic, sultry, innocent, exotic, hot, mysterious, haughty, bombshell, va-va-voom, ethereal -- Hedy Lamarr had the best. No she didn't have the sexiest body; she was actually a little thin. She wasn't the oh-so-appealing cute type like Meg Ryan, or the sexy bombshell like Marilyn Monroe, or the exotic Greta Garbo. This is pure human female beauty. And it's not just some portrait or statue. She speaks, she smiles, she moves. There are at least three scenes of conversations with Charles Boyer that I just can't watch often enough. By direction or not, she slightly underacts. It's been said that she really wasn't that good at acting. Could be; again, who cares? She communicates plenty to me.So applaud it for the plot, the photography, the great secondary characters, the wonderful Charles Boyer. And drink a toast to Hedy Lamarr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly innovative love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ALGIERS is about a man who is trapped meeting a woman who is likewise trapped. They are perfect together, but their love is not going to get anywhere. For he is a convict on the run from a long prison sentence - hiding in a disreputable "colorful" section of the city of Algiers in (what was then) France's North African "departments" - but is now the city in Algeria. Pepi Le Moko is only safe in the "Casbah", because, although a respected police detective like Inspector Simane is tolerated few others are. But Pepi dreams of his homeland. He misses France, specifically his native Paris. But it is impossible to return without facing serious criminal penalties. He meets Gabrielle ("Gaby") who is a tourist with her best friend and their two fiancés. Both fiancés are substantial men (Gaby's is M. Giraux - a fat, unsympathetic type who knows what he wants and will pay for it). But her background was as a worker in the basement of a department store - marriage will free her from that. But she will be tied to her fat husband.The two find in each other more than a heavenly spark. Both remind each other of a happier world: that of Paris where both grew up (ironically in nearby neighborhoods). They really discover each other talking about Metro stations in Paris' subway. And both realize that with each other they might be free again. But can they get together? It is a marvelous film. Pepi does have a girl (Ines) who is trying to awaken in him her own passions, but finds first she is battling his desire to return to France, and then he is pursuing Gaby. There are also the members of Pepi's gang, who are his eyes into the goings on in the city outside his sanctuary. And there are dangers in the sanctuary: traitors like Regis who can be deadly in their activities.In the end we are never bored by this film. It was (with MAYERLING) the film that introduced Charles Boyer to movie audiences as a great film lover (and here a sad one). It was also the film that re-enforced stardom on Hedy Lamar after ECSTASY. Sigried Lurie's Ines is intensely tragic, and Gene Lockhart properly sleazy as Regis (and his final scene very satisfactory to the audience). As the disagreeable Gireaux, Robert Grieg showed a vicious cynicism his butlers in film comedies rarely showed.But best, in some ways, is Joseph Calleia as the Inspector. Normally playing villains and sleaze-balls, Calleia had a chance here to be on the side of the law, and also to show a sympathetic understanding of Boyer's Pepe. He can tell that the man is hurting for his homeland, and while he is willing to use this to get him out of the Casbah he does respect Pepe's feelings. In the end he regrets his pursuit's conclusion. A very satisfactory conclusion to the film though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Satisfying, exotic American version of the French film "Pepe Le Moko" (which, I've heard, was distributed here in the U.S. under its French title, which means Pepe the Pimp, unbeknowest to the censors). Boyer leads the right star performance and Lamarr gets her ingenue role as the girl he loves but can't see outside of the Casbah. When the police try to arrest Pepe in the Casbah, he quickly disappears and they receive no cooperation from the locals. To lure him out of that district's confines, the cops set up a trap using the unknowing Lamarr as bait. their sad, brief romance ends, presumably, with his incarceration. Similar in plot, but not in tone, to contemporary "gangster" flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pepe le Moko (French) inspired Algiers which inspired Casablanca. The latter has the better story but Algiers is a better film. Such a great romance. Such adult dialogue. Such marvelous acting. Made at a time when European culture was the marvel of the world...and you can see why. To modern sensibilities the treatment of "natives" seems racist but people of the time were more honest, less politically correct. Victors thought they were superior and europeans had been victors for centuries. Some of the minor characters are mere caricatures and fail to achieve authenticity but that's forgivable considering how good everything else is. A theme from the score was used in a modern film - Gladiator I think. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable can tell me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film (and the man) which was the inspiration for my favorite Looney Tunes character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is the film (and the man) which was the inspiration for my favorite Looney Tunes character Pepe Le Pew. This film starring Charles Boyer, Sigrid Gurie, and Hedy Lamarr. The Walter Wanger production was a remake of the successful 1937 French film Pépé le Moko, which derived its plot from the Henri La Barthe novel of the same name. John Howard Lawson wrote the screenplay. Though admittedly, I had never read the novel or seen the French film. The movie was a sensation because it was the first Hollywood film starring Hedy Lamarr whose stunning beauty became the main feature for moviegoers. The story is like in the original French film (and novel), about a beautiful rich girl Gabrielle (Gaby) ,who is on holiday in Algiers with her fiancé, and meets and falls in love with the notorious jewel thief Pepe le Moko, has for two years lived in, and virtually ruled, the mazelike, impenetrable Casbah, the "native quarter" of Algiers. I had heard of the film and I just had see this film. So I had taped on TCM and I watched it and I love it. And you know that song that was played (and sung) in the film "C'est la vie" it's kind of catchy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Ever Wondered Why Casablanca Is A Classic . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ALGIERS is just like Casablanca -- only slower, sleazier, sadder.I realize this movie came first, but it's like every single ingredient was copied -- and improved on -- by the team of screenwriters who hammered together CASABLANCA a few years later.1.) Cynical, Shady Hero. Check. Except that Pepe LeMoko is just a crook. There's no hint of courage or self-sacrifice in his past. Also he sings a love song while polishing his shoes. I wanted to shove him right off the balcony! 2.) Innocent, High-Class Heroine. Check. Except that Gabrielle in ALGIERS isn't really innocent. She's not truly in love with a distinguished freedom fighter, she's marrying a fat, disgusting slob for money. But at least she looks good in diamonds and jewels! 3.) Corrupt, Lovable Police Inspector Who Secretly Admires the Hero. Check. Except Claude Rains in CASABLANCA plays his part like he's having the time of his life -- like it's FUN to be a corrupt cop. And you sense how much he loves Rick, even when Rick is pointing a gun straight at his heart. ("That is my least vulnerable spot.") The guy in ALGIERS is okay, but he looks so sad and depressed all the time. It's almost like he knows how the movie is going to end! 4.) Slutty Bad Girl Who Clings To The Hero. Check. Except in ALGIERS the local girl who's crazy about Pepe is actually tougher, braver, classier, and more loyal than the heroine! And that kind of shoots the main love story right in the foot, don't you think? 5.) A Colorful Supporting Cast Made Up Of The Usual Suspects. Check. Except that Pepe's gang are all wildly miscast (Alan "Little John" Hale as a sleazy Middle Eastern merchant? I bet the Sheriff of Nottingham thought that one up!) And then there's Stanley Fields (still looking for the Island of Dr. Moreau) and a couple of random guys. These people are just, well, creepy. Oh, and watch when they torture the stool pigeon to death for about TEN MINUTES! Great stuff, if you're watching a Cagney movie, but this is a love story. Isn't it? Isn't it? 6.) Bittersweet Tragic Ending Where Our Hero Doesn't Get The Girl. Check. Except that running after an ocean liner just looks stupid. Watching a plane take off is classy. I don't know if anyone even realized just how funny it was when Pepe was bolting down the dock screaming like a banshee -- and then gibbering like an idiot. And what were Pepe's last words? Here's looking at you, kid? We'll always have Paris? No, I think Pepe was saying, let's get it right next time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smoky encounter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While John Cromwell's Hollywood remake of Julien Duvivier's 'Pepe le Moko' from the year before is evidently the lesser film, still it has its share of artistic success. Cameraman James Wong Howe establishes a shifty, exotically attractive and morally uncertain milieu out of the casbah, the sordid urban jungle that is a city unto itself in the center of Algiers.This is where the outcasts live, from all over the world, criminals, prostitutes, go-getters. French jewel thief Pepe lives here too, in exile but surrounded by good, loyal friends of every ethnic persuasion. Here he makes quick escapes over the rooftops and everybody protects him. The police has futile dreams of luring him out of the casbah where they can get to him, and maybe a visiting Parisian siren can be of help? Cromwell's version is very faithful to the original French film, and in every instance that I could think of is it inferior. But Howe's refined cinematography, the lighting and, most of all, Charles Boyer all make this a worthwhile watching experience. He is suave and magnetic, his accent intoxicating, and the scenes between him and the sultry Hedy Lamarr are cinema history, their meeting in the sleazy club where long, lingering closeups show the way he impresses himself on her, and this is one extremely sexy, even smoky encounter.So, watch it, and then do yourself the favor of looking up Julien Duvivier's film, a vastly better one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pepe le Moko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Algiers is not a classic, it is a perversion of the wonderful original Pepe le Moko, directed by Duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming Pepe, Jean Gabin. If you want to fully experience the Casbah and the characters in Algiers, I recommend you don't even watch this movie and see Pepe le Moko instead, for it is much more elaborate, more beautifully filmed, the lines are not clichéd and the characters adhere much more to reality. Furthermore, the ending is so dramatic and key to Pepe's character that you'll find the Algiers version intolerable. Although Algiers does an almost excellent job mimicking each scene, the acting falls short as does the credibility of the characters. Plus, the wardrobe is truly breath-taking in all scenes, particularly Pepe's in the last scene and Gaby's (at all times) but also when she's on the boat. Frankly, Algiers is cheap as far as imitations go.</fullReview>

With the darkness almost of a film noire movie, you can almost smell the exotic spices undoubtedly wafting down the cramped streets of Algiers' worst neighborhoods as the incredibly taught action plays out.

In a chance meeting, he meets the Hedy LaMarr character, a young, beautifully vibrant woman who reminds him of his days past and of his current situation hiding out in the Casbah.Sigrid Gurie is Ines, her evil-looking eyes tells you her intentions. If she can't have Pepe, no one else will either.There are fine supporting performances by Joseph Calleia as a sinister looking detective and Gene Lockhart, as a traitor who pays the ultimate price for his treachery.Those Boyer never uttered those famous words, "Come to the Casbah," go anyway to enjoy this well done film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great visuals, great setting, awkward writing, and some uneven acting...a mixed bag!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Algiers (1938)Take the teaming alleys of the old town of Algiers in North Africa, cramped and multi-national, filled with intentional mystery, and you have the basis of a great movie. A great, exciting, unique, visually gorgeous one.And it delivers on some of those scores. But why is it also a bit clumsy and forced all he way through? Two main reasons, I think. First, some of the secondary characters are comic caricatures (like Gene Lockhart), and as if to confirm this, they are given some silly lines as well. Second, the direction, under John Cromwell, which is clumsy and patchwork. Some of the most ordinary lines are delivered with avoidable awkwardness. I don't think Charles Boyer is a very convincing Arab kingpin, nor is the chief policeman from Paris a bit believable. All of this stacks the movie against its terrific setting.The highlight might actually be the simplest to understand--the photography by the great cameraman James Wong Howe. Right behind, but most accounts, is the presence of Hedy Lamarr as a kind of sophisticated femme fatale, bejeweled and bewitching. At least from the point of view of Boyer, who at one point is transfixed by her bracelet, her pearls, and her smile, in that order. The sure sign of a doomed man.The drama does become more intense, and both the police pressure and the crossed lovers percolate a bit. Boyer remains perplexing as the leading man, as if always aware he's the leading man more intent on being charming (in that 1930s French way) than playing the part of a supposed boss. And just wait for the scene where he breaks into song and everyone comes around to listen. Good thing the photography never relents--you can watch the movie for the visuals alone.I'm not sure what gives this movie its reputation, but I'll throw up a red flag against it. The exotic local, the mix of nationalities, the odd assortment of actors, and the central romance might make seem to presage Casablanca (in those ways) but the comparison ends there. Don't be discouraged by the first twenty minutes, which is the weakest part. By the end the mood has changed enough to work.If you're wondering, this is a low budget production from Walter Wanger, a year before he produced John Ford's "Stagecoach." And the filming occurred in Algiers itself, which is part of the interest. Give it whirl. Try to find a sharper version than the lousy one Netflix streams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Performance By Boyer In An Otherwise Weak Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pepe le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout Europe, and to stay free he holes himself up in the Casbah, a mysterious part of Algiers where even the police are reluctant to go, until a senior officer is sent from Paris to capture le Moko once and for all. For le Moko, although the Casbah allows him to remain out of police custody, it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time - a place he can't leave, because the moment he does, he knows he'll be arrested.Boyer's performance was good, and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. He captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time. The movie itself, unfortunately, was quite a letdown. A number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent, of which I'll mention two. First was the idea that the police wouldn't enter the Casbah. That was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the Casbah fairly regularly. So, neither the suggestion by Commissioner Janvier that the police wouldn't enter, nor the statement by Inspector Slimane (also a decent performance by Joseph Calleia) that they could get into the Casbah but not out seemed to make much sense. I also found it difficult to believe that le Moko - hardened criminal mastermind that he was - could be so quickly swept off his feet by Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the Casbah to find her, essentially giving himself up. I understand the irony of the final few scenes, of course, as Pepe leaves the freedom of his prison (the Casbah) only to find real freedom in his capture (because he's shot and killed by the police.) I just found it impossible to believe that someone like le Moko would fall into such a trap.This is worth watching for Boyer, and to a lesser extent Calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3/10</fullReview>

I'm glad I saw it for Boyer's performance which is quite well sustained. He is truly a cad. He is truly a prisoner. Because of his success as a jewel thief, he can never leave the Casbah. The police play a waiting game. It's that old respect thing where he becomes the object of their searches and always manages to get away; his legend is greater than his being. However, it always gets us in the end, doesn't it? There are some nice performances and I always like films set in those desert cultures of the thirties and forties.

However, that's is only a legend and he never said that in this film. This is the remake of a french mov (they say the original is the best) about Pepe Le Moko, the famous french robber hunted by the police, is brilliantly played by Charles Boyer. He has such a deep, velvet voice that I like to imitate! Hedy Lamarr is exoticly beautiful, and she matches very well with Boyer as lovers. However, I feel that the romance is not very plausible, we don't feel passion as in Casablanca, for instance. The supporting cast has a young and capable Joseph Calleia as the inspector of rotten Casbah and Gene Lockhart giving a fine but dated performance as a double-crosser. Oscar nominations for Boyer, Lockhart, Art Direction and cinematography.</fullReview>

So, I am left to wonder why people would want to see this Hollywood version when they could just watch the earlier film instead? This is especially true in the early part of the film when lousy stock footage is used to represent the streets of the Casbah in Algiers in the American film, but the French one looked like it was filmed on location. About the only other major way the films differ are at the end. In the French film, he commits suicide in a VERY unconvincing manner, but in the American version he is killed. I must say that the ending of ALGIERS was a lot better, but aside from that my nod goes to PEPE LE MOKO. Neither film are great, but very watchable and very stylish in the way they portray this slick master criminal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pepe le Moko Comes Out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Casbah is accurately described under the opening credits as a neighborhood of Algiers that was built on a series of marine terraces and stops at the sea. It really was a seedy and fetid maze of dwellings that provided a home for criminals. In the Algerian War fought by the French, it was a hiding place for the nationalist rebels. I conducted a thorough investigation of the area by reading the first paragraph of the Wikipedia entry.The police have been trying to nab the notorious criminal, Pepe le Moko (Charles Boyer). However, he has many friends who warn him when the police are coming, and there is a labyrinth of hidden passageways and tunnels that make it extremely difficult. An investigator comes down from Paris to kick some local butt.He's met by frustrated local cops who explain the situation to him. The most memorable of the policiers is the smiling, philosophical, slightly oily Joseph Calleia. He's irresistible. The head honcho from Paris leads a police squad into the Casbah and Pepe and his friends run them ragged. Of course, if Pepe should ever stroll out of the Casbah, he's yesterday's news. Boyer knows he can't come out, and it fills his heart with melancholy because he yearns to go back to Paris. Ah, Paris -- La Place Blanche, La Gare du Nord, Les Filles de Joie, La Bourdaloue.Enter a wealthy tourist, Hedy Lamarr, who sports a perfectly elliptical face with a vertical axis, and who drips with the jewelry that catches Boyer's eye. Her real name, of course, isn't Hedy Lammar. Nobody is named Hedy Lamarr. Don't kid yourself about that. She was born into a royal Austrian family and named Prinzessen Brynhyldr von Speck und Brodt. Please, it doesn't make her less appealing.Among the denizens of the Casbah we can glimpse Leonid Kinsky. He was one of two of Hollywood's resident comic young Russians, the other being Mischa Auer. Vladimir Sokolov was Hollywood's ancient, mystic Russian -- the only one. He had a busy career.It's an interesting film, not gripping, and a bit stagy, but generally well executed. The musical score is strictly pedestrian but the photography and direction are quite good. There's a spooky scene involving the deliberate murder of the pudgy trembling traitor, Gene Lockhart, done to the overloud tune of a rickety piano. At the opposite end of the scale, a chipper song by Boyer, "C'est La Vie," threatens to turn the romantic drama into a musical comedy. It's painful to watch. The large supporting cast does well by their roles. Boyer is smooth and French, but it's hard to believe at this point in time that the ladies swooned with such abandon over Boyer and his accent. His resonant baritone was imitated by impressionists for years afterward. "Come Wiz Me...." Boyer has a serious problem, though. He has a native girl friend, Sigrid Gurie, who adores him but whom he shoves around and tells to shut up all the time. Well, we all know that Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Pepe should never have left the Casbah to intercept the woman of his dreams at the boat dock, at least not with Sigrid Gurie knowing about it.The ending is a sea of bathos though, in a sense, Boyer does finally escape from the Casbah.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He was safe as long as he stayed in the Casbah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Algiers (1938) was directed by John Cromwell. It stars Charles Boyer as Pepe le Moko, a famed Parisian jewel thief, who now lives in the Casbah with his gang. He's safe in the native quarter, because it's full of alleys and passageways, and the population admires and protects him.Pepe has a lover, Ines, played by the lovely Sigrid Gurie. A police inspector, Slimane, considers Pepe his friend. However, as he tells Pepe, he'll arrest him some day.The situation is stable until a beautiful young French woman named Gaby, played by Hedy Lamarr, enters the Casbah and Pepe's life. Gaby is a kept woman, and is soon to be a rich man's trophy wife. She is beautiful as only Lamarr could be beautiful.We know Pepe will fall in love with her, and we know he will leave Ines for Gaby, but we don't know what will happen after that. (Well, we sort of know, but we're not supposed to know.)Boyer and Lamarr are ideal for their parts. However, I was equally impressed by Joseph Calleia as Slimane. He is a man who lives in both worlds--the Casbah and the police headquarters. He fits in in both worlds, but he's not fully trusted in either one.In the 21st Century, this movie is definitely dated. For example, it was completed at a time when the fact that one of the gangsters beats his wife is taken as a matter of course. (Some things have improved in the last 75 years.)However, as melodrama, Algiers is definitely a success. Boyer and Lamarr have the right chemistry, and the plot, if predictable, will still hold your attention.We saw the movie on DVD, where it worked very well. If you can't find it in a revival theater, see it on the small screen. You'll enjoy the film and you'll be glad you watched it.P.S. Boyer never says, "Come with me to the Casbah." In fact, Pepe is tired of the Casbah, and would rather be in Paris. Still, the quotation has a life of its own, and gives us a sense of how popular the film must have been in its day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>psychologically deep, visually unfocused drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Wanger released this classic drama in 1938 as a remake of a play earlier made into a film. Is the Casbah a geographic location you can find on a map, an uncontrollable twist of fate often used in other pieces of fiction or a state of mind you create from your own failings? The film brilliantly portrays this dilemma through superlative performances by Hedy Lamarr, Sigrid Gurie and Charles Boyer leading a first class Hollywood cast who keep you fascinated every moment. The plot sketch is one told before and told again about a retired jewel thief, convinced he has found a safe haven to live out his golden years, understands, only down the road, his own physical needs, some brilliant detective work and some enemies he has made along the way conspire against it. The negatives are low budget sets and lighting. Balancing it are ever fascinating plot twists, memorable dialogue and the lures of Hedy Lamarr's apparent first film contracted in the US and the first look for Americans at the native quarter of Algiers in Algeria. Once Boyer and Lamarr knock it out of the park in the bracelet dialogue scene, the film is in high gear keeping you fascinated every moment and even overwhelmed at the denouement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's a free man to do when he really isn't free? That's Charles Boyer's plight in "Algiers", the classic romantic tale of a jewel thief forced to reside inside inside the notorious "Casbah", a mysteriously large den of iniquity in Morocco's sea-side city of Algiers. And it is not a pretty one. Sure, he has a large group of supporters to hide him inside the hidden, twisted alleys, but he's trapped otherwise, subject to being arrested if he leaves. This entrapment is slowly causing him to loose his mind. But even though the love of the pretty but poor Sigrid Gurie, he falls under the spell of a sophisticated beauty, played by Hedy Lamarr in her American film debut, in spite of the fact that it was simply her jewels that he was originally after.This was undoubtedly Boyer's most famous role, and it is easy to see why. He is extremely handsome, charming, yet complex. He even gets to sing in one brief moment, ironic considering the film was remade as a musical, "Casbah", ten years later. Gurie and Lamarr are beautiful but get only a few moments to shine, mostly in exotic close-ups. As he usually did, Gene Reynolds plays a rat, here an informer who pays dearly for his betrayal in a chilling sequence that won him an Oscar Nomination. Joseph Calleia is equally as memorable as the sympathetic police officer who befriends Boyer inside the Casbah but will be forced to arrest him should he step outside it. There is a brilliant chase sequence between the police and Boyer's gang (which includes Alan Hale Sr.).It should be noted that as this film has fallen into the public domain, good prints are rare, and some have major sound and picture drop-out. I took this into consideration when watching it, knowing full well that when a genius like James Wong Howe is your director of photography, it can't possibly be anything but a masterpiece to watch. Superb direction and wonderful artistic detail are other pluses. And for those who feel the need to confirm the presence of the oft-quoted line, "Take Me to the Casbah", don't waste your time. It's not there. But watch the film anyway for classic movie-making at its technical and artistic best, as well as a leading man deserving of a higher place in the list of Hollywood legends. The ending is a heart-breaker, up there with the classic tearjerker "One Way Passage" for irony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The exotic locale and mysterious characters invite the inevitable comparison to "Casablanca", though my reading of other reviews on this board would suggest that the more appropriate comparison to Bogart's film would be the French original, "Pepe le Moko". Since I haven't seen that one (at least yet), I'll have to confine my comments strictly to "Algiers".To my mind, the picture doesn't approach the all around sense of romantic intrigue offered by Bogey and Bergman, but in the interest of full disclosure, "Casablanca" is my favorite film of all time, so one could say I have some bias. Leonid Kinskey is but the thinnest of threads between the pictures, having appeared in both, and it's interesting how similar his mannerisms and affectations are here even though he's portraying an Arab. The film probably could have used more signature character types like Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Claude Rains, because even though Pepe's goons seemed a rugged bunch, they just didn't appear charismatic enough for the Casbah, 'a melting pot for all the sins of the Earth'. I guess since I've seen Alan Hale and Gene Lockhart in so many other pictures, I couldn't shake the idea that they were just terribly miscast here.As for the ladies, Hedy Lamarr always succeeds in creating romantic tension in her films, but for my money (at least in this picture), Pepe needed to have his head examined for turning his back on Sigrid Gurie's Ines. I'm pretty sure 'smokin' hot' was never used to describe an actress in the Thirties, but it's the 2010's now, and that's how I see it. I get the whole business about Pepe feeling trapped for two years in the Casbah, and feeling lucky enough to make a break for it, but it didn't seem so bad that Ines was around to offer a shoulder and whatever else to ease the boredom.Anyway, I'll be putting in my request at the local library for a copy of "Pepe le Moko" to compare and contrast as other reviewers have done. On balance though, "Algiers" has it's merits as an intriguing story with an exotic flair. Given the finale, one is led to consider that if Mister Rick and Ilsa Lund would always have Paris, the story of Pepe and Gaby leads one to ask what might have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Casbah, a melting pot for all the sins of the world'. This definition of one of Algiers' quarters, given in the movie, could apply to Antioch, Alexandria or Constantinople at the height of their power, the great antique and medieval capitals of the corruption, Molochs of the criminality and excesses.I liked ALGIERS, this short treatise of underworld violence and vices, this endearing and feverish lowbrow exotic fantasy, I have found it to be appealing and exciting and, on its level, well?made.As a treatise of fancy sociology thought of in the most trite clichés, ALGIERS, a fruit of the mellow '30s (made in '38), glamorizes amply, in a heightened tone and unsubtle, unpretentious style of film-making, an exotic place, in a manner common in the era's flicks, exalting or exhaling vast projections of what the Tyr, Sidon, Sodom, Jerusalem, Antioch and Alexandria were thought/ supposed to have been in the legendary past, metropolis of pleasure, vice and corruption, the rule of the violence and base passions?part of those blessed ('38?well, on the brink of the war ?) times' dream of adventure, here in the popular, lowbrow version; with ALGIERS we take a step into Casbah, the labyrinthine quarter where Pépé rules. ALGIERS is appealing kitsch, it doesn't address the heart, but the taste for an exciting show; labeled as the American remake of a French movie, it boasts a very chic French leading man, the famous and understandably respected Boyer (still _watchable, as a soft?spoken oldster, in a '60s melodrama like BAREFOOT IN THE PARK), here as a tough guy?Pépé, a mastermind of the underworld.As Pépé, Boyer replaces Gabin; but he reminds of Bogart.ALGIERS is a work of popular glamorization and almanac wisdom; Casbah is glamorized, Pépé is glamorized. There are things to be admired in this flick. It has gusto and energy. I liked the movie's score. The cinematography might surprise by its quality and atmosphere.One thing in this movie is subtle, though?Boyer's persona, Boyer does a venomous, a bit charming and insidious Pépé; he looks like the upgraded, boosted and cleaner version of Bogart. Or was it Bogart who looked like a lousy, dirty Boyer?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading several of the comments on this one my immediate reaction was they've got to be kidding; to give them a break it appears that most of them hadn't seen the great Duvivier movie Pepe Le Moko which was released the previous year. We tend to think of Hollywood retreads of French Classics as something comparatively new but they were at it seventy years ago and they've yet to equal let alone eclipse even one French original. Adding insult to injury the credits nowhere mention that this in fact is virtually a scene-for-scene, shot-for-shot remake with the odd minor change here and there - like the ending. The only thing that Charles Boyer and Jean Gabin had in common was that both were French; Gabin was, at times, a cross between Bogie and Cagney whilst Boyer is a cross between a second-rate baritone and Narcissus. Okay, it's well shot and some of the support is out of the right bottle but all of that applies to the original plus, of course, the definitive Pepe in Gabin. Like the man said, if it ain't broke ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A case study of terminal priapism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A period set piece steeped in overacting, ALGIERS is entertaining but not reflective. The lawless squalor in the Casbah is glorified. It wallows in mawkish sentiment: A recently arrived tourist, lovely Gaby, goes slumming with her wealthy companions in the Casbah. And whom should she meet but expatriate jewel thief Pepe, well acted by Charles Boyer.At first he just wants to seduce and rob her. Then, "amor vincit omnia." Beguiled by her charms, he leaves the Casbah and falls into the hands of waiting Inspector Slimane.Then he really wigs out. He's mortally wounded in a suicidal attempt to escape. 'As the sun pulls away from the shore and his ship sinks slowly in the west,' he is seen lying on the quay, bug- eyed and barely able to raise his head as he desperately cries out his last words, GAABEEE! GAABEEE!As our unfortunate Pepe's life ebbs, the ever practical Gaabbee has already put him in the dead file as she watches the shoreline recede and then leaves the deck to join her corpulent husband and his hangers-on (It's the money, dummy!).A standout was Inspector Slimane. He was a likable, methodical, just version of Inspector Javert, another famed French lawman. In contrast, the inept, bureaucratic Commissioner Janvier, had a simple version of police science: "I prefer guns." A worthy endorsement of French colonialism, too.Many of these older films illustrate how poorly women were treated in the days when the air was clean and sex was dirty. I am pleased that we have made at least some progress. Poor Ines was not treated well by our Gallic rooster. He broke her heart. Though she was a bit tarnished and tawdry, I really liked her - maybe I just like unhappy, self-destructive women. I did not like Pepe - he was arrogant and swaggering. And not particularly happy, eh? Taking it out on anyone within reach, he reduced his gang members to sniveling sycophants. There was only one wheel spinning around in his Casbah. Guess who? Inspector Slimane was genuinely fond of him but was unswerving in his pursuit of justice. Maybe Pepe was really a nice guy who just needed some counseling.GAABEEE! GAABEEE! may have set a precedent: In A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, Marlon Brando, lachrymose at the bottom of the stairs, bellows HEYYY STELLAAH! It is said that this was Brando's ad lib. Director Elia Kazan liked it, as do almost all of us, and it was made part of the script. At any rate, a man bellowing out the name of his love in desperation does heighten the drama if it's overdone, right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atmosphere and droll dialog don't redeem this overrated classic. Boyer is a French thief hiding in the Casbah of Algiers while the police try to figure out how to get him out. Meanwhile, he falls for Lamarr and tries to find a way to escape. The film is slow to get started and never really goes anywhere. Reminiscent of Casablanca in some ways, it's completely lacking any larger theme than the wanted man seducing a good woman. It's all talk-talk-talk, with endless scenes of Boyer swaggering among his idiot cohorts and Boyer wooing Lamarr in the shadows. Personally, I didn't care for Boyer's character for a minute, so the tension was utterly nonexistent.Stock 1930s character actors stumble thru the mushy plot as Boyer's henchmen--guys who clearly do not belong in Algiers. Sigrid Gurie is the wildly-overacting jealous girlfriend of Boyer. His brazen womanizing in front of her doesn't bode well for any future he might have with Lamarr.Especially bad is a long sequence in which an underling comes to tell Boyer how another henchman was captured. It sounds exciting... too bad we didn't see it for ourselves. The ending is completely anticlimactic and seems to be remarkable only because it is not a Hollywood happy ending; that doesn't stop it from being sappy.</fullReview>
