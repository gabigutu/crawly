		<shortDescription>Film noir from the French, before they invented the phrase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pepe Le Moko" is an early film noir, coming several decades before the French themselves invented the term to explain atmospheric American crime films. And it is one of the best, a film ranking right up there with the work of Melville, Becker, and other top post war directors.This is being billed in the US now as a sort of lost film. Actually, it wasn't lost. Hollywood simply bought the rights and kept it off American movie screens so it could release its own remake of it in 1938, retitled "Algiers." That wasn't a half bad film, made enjoyable for the most part because it was a very off-beat story, had great atmosphere and featured the breathtakingly beautiful Hedy Lamarr in the role of Gaby.At first, when looking at this French original, you wonder why it seems so familiar. Then you realize that the Hollywood version is almost a shot for shot remake, copying almost everything. Everything, that is, but the performance of Jean Gabin.Hollywood's version, which stared Charles Boyer, always seemed a little contrived, primarily because Boyer was just not very convincing as the tough Paris gangster who pulls a bank heist and flees to Algiers, where he takes up permanent residence in the Arab quarter, the Casbah. Boyer just didn't seem like the gangster type.Gabin, who had played rough characters before and would go on to play many others, is perfect as the smart, charismatic, but sometimes brutal Pepe.It is ironic that the French, so in love with gangster films that they copied American cops and robbers films of the 30s, actually made one of their own in that era that wound up being copied by the Americans.This one is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the greatest gangster film of all time, Duvivier brings to the silver screen a gripping tale of love, passion, friendship and loyalty, as Pépé le Moko (Jean Gabin) reclusively hides in the seedy, underground of the Casbah quarters of Algiers. Elusive and dangerous, Pépé is considered one of France's most wanted at-large criminals. However, upon meeting a beautiful "parisienne", Gaby Gould (Mireille Balin), Pépé discovers that his heart is in Paris. Willing to risk his life and freedom to pursue his new love, Pépé takes to the streets of Algiers to find Gaby.An enlightening look at French Algeria in the early 20th-century, Pépé le Moko is a cultural and historical masterpiece as much as it is a classic film. Examining the diversity of the inhabitants of the Casbah and exploring its architectural layout, this film provides for an extremely interesting postcolonial, anthropological, even Freudian (architectural) reading.The friendship that develops between Inspector Slimane (Lucas Gridoux), a native Algerian investigator sent to capture the fugitive, and Pépé adds an element of perplexity, as the inspector is caught in a crux of friendship and loyalty and his duty to the state.What ensues is a heartwrenching scene between the disconsolate gangster pursuing his beloved Gaby while being pursued by his inspector friend and the French Algerian police. One of the greatest endings in the history of film, Duvivier exposes the sovereignty of the heart, even the heart of a brazen criminal.Duvivier's best effort and the greatest gangster film ever, this film ranks in my top ten of all-time. To truly understand Humphrey Bogart, Edward Robinson, Robert Mitchum and Al Pacino, one must first discover Jean Gabin, the archetype gangster for the crime genre. Duvivier's masterpiece is a film that all lovers of cinema simply must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Everyone in the world has two fatherlands: his own and Paris".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pepe Le Moko" (1937) directed by Julien Duvivier - is a wonderful movie with the great performance from very young Jean Gabin. It just happened that I've seen several movies with him in the older age where he is serious, not very talkative man with the head full of grey hair and I like him in the later movies, too but it was so much fun to see him as Pepe - young, charming, dangerous, smart, brutal, irresistible, and so much in love with Paris that he'd lost forever. As much as I enjoyed the film as an early noir and crime, I think it is about the longing for home, about the nostalgia and as such it is even more interesting, deeper, poignant that just a noir. The celebrated film director Max Ophüls, who knew a lot about nostalgia and immigration said about Paris, "It offered the shining wet boulevards under the street lights, breakfast in Monmartre with cognac in your glass, coffee and lukewarm brioche, gigolos and prostitutes at night. Everyone in the world has two fatherlands: his own and Paris." I could not help thinking of his words when I watched the film. There is one scene that almost reduced me to tears - a middle-aged former chanteuse plays one of her records on a gramophone and sings along with her voice that has not changed at all even if she looks nothing like the picture on the wall from the days of her youth. The time may play very nasty jokes with a woman - she may get fat or skinny, lose her teeth and hair but her voice will stay as strong or tender, ringing or melodious as it was in the long gone days that stay forever in her memory. She sings about Paris and there are tears on her eyes and the scene simply can't leave any viewer indifferent. There is another scene - between Pepe and Gaby the girl from Paris with whom Pepe falls in love (Mireille Balin). They talk about Paris remembering different places which are dear to both of them, and in the end, they both named La Place Blanche where they both belong and not in Algiers's Casbah where Pepe is safe and he rules the world of criminals but can't forget the sound of Metro in Paris. When Pepe wants to tell Gaby that he loves her, he tells her that she reminds him of Metro in Paris... I have not even mentioned how masterfully the film was shot by Julien Duvivier and how well it was acted, how fast it movies, and there are so many wonderful scenes that I have not mentioned...Great, great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Casbah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julien Duvivier was one of the best French film directors of all times. He was a pioneer and an innovator of the cinema. His legacy is a rich one, producing films that were imitated, but never equaled by other men. Take "Pepe le Moko" is 1937 film that was remade by Hollywood twice, with mediocre results. One wonders how can, an original and pace setting work of art, be redone by people that had not the sense of style, nor the brilliancy of Julien Duvivier?Duvivier took the production to Algiers with magnificent results. Working with the brilliant cinematographers, Marc Fossark and Jules Kruger, Duvivier captures the essence, vibrancy and mysteriousness of Algiers with emphasis in the Casbah quarter, which comes alive with the magical light his camera men got out of that closed quarter and that beautiful city by the sea.The idea of having Pepe living in that maze of streets and houses that communicate through the roofs gives the film a claustrophobic feeling because our main character cannot leave this area without risking being arrested as soon as the police catch up with him. Pepe is a man that endears himself to the people in the Casbah. Together with his gang, he appears to thrive in this milieu.Pepe is loved by the faithful Ines. She is a loyal woman who will do anything to protect Pepe and the rest of his cronies. Pepe, on the other hand, might be in the Casbah, but his heart is in Paris. That is evident when Gaby, the gorgeous kept woman, is separated from her party while at the Casbah, only to be rescued by Pepe, who soon discovers he has a lot in common with her. In fact, in a lovely sequence both Pepe and Gaby start naming favorite places in Paris. Place Blance, they discover is their kind of place. How true!Pepe is a hunted man. This man, who has been able to elude being caught, makes a fatal mistake upon learning Gaby and her friends will be sailing for France. He manages to buy a ticket, but the police are on his trail and it's only a matter of time they'll get him. The final sequence of Pepe watching the ship pull away from the port is one of the saddest moments in the movie because this gangster's past interferes with the sudden passion he feels for a woman that will never be his.Jean Gabin, what a charismatic actor he was! His Pepe is at times a fun man, a criminal, a lover, an escapee from the justice, and a fantastic actor that registers each phase of the character with conviction. M. Gabin was perhaps one of the best film actors of the French cinema; with Pepe, he clearly shows why he was an actor that could do nothing wrong. Pepe was one of his biggest creations for the screen.The beautiful Mireille Balin is seen as Gaby, the woman who conquers Pepe's heart. They have a lot in common. Her unusual situation gets in her way and her love for Pepe will not be possible. Line Noro plays Ines, the woman who adores Pepe, but she realizes she can't have him. Also in the cast Fernand Charpin, Gabro, Lucas Giroux, Gilbert Gil give good performances for M. Duvivier.The film is a classic of the period. Julien Duvivier was at the top of his craft, as he clearly proves with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest French director?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some will say Renoir.Some will say Carné.Some will say Clouzot.Some will say..yuk ..Godard..I will say Duvivier.His career spans half a century,from the silent era to the sixties,full of detours and retreats.But when he broke through -and his epiphanies were many and various, (there are masterpieces all along his career;never until the very end he produced anything mediocre)he made brilliant films.But those precious years just before WW2 were justly looked upon as the best French cinema that had ever been.And Duvivier was among the creme de la creme ,producing during this golden era a chef-d'oeuvre a year (la belle equipe:1936;la fin du jour:1939).But 1937 was Duvivier's year:he made not one but two classics :"un carnet de bal" and "Pepe le Moko" both rated four stars by Leonard Maltin."Pepe le Moko" 's screenplay is so simple it's a wonder Duvivier could make such a masterwork from such a script.More than the story itself,it's the atmosphere which matters ,and a bevy of colorful characters surrounding the hero,played by the director's favorite actor Jean Gabin :one often forgets that it's Duvivier who launched Gabin,the most famous French star of the era (and maybe of all time)in such works as "la bandera" (1935)and "la belle equipe" (1936)."Pepe " takes place in Algiers ,in some kind of ghetto" la casbah" .the hero is a gangster who reigns in this underground world ,but we soon discover he is actually a prisoner:a cop,like a spider on its web, is waiting for him to leave his refuge to arrest him.Duvivier's camera work is dazzling ,using panoramic shots which depicts la casbah as a maze ;when Pepe finally leaves the place ,the background behind him becomes blurred ,then merges with the sea,the gate of freedom.More than a gangster story ,it's a tale of nostalgia.Pepe falls in love with a woman (Mireille Balin) "from the outside world" while talking with her about different places in Paris,ending with la place blanche where they both belong.There 's the harrowing sequence where a has-been chanteuse (Frehel) plays one of her records on a gramophone ,thinks of her glorious past,and sings the chorus with her youth's voice as her tears fall down.There are also exciting film noir sequences:the informer (Charpin) ,more and more terrified ,as the room fills with men ready to kill him;his death against a player piano ;Pepe behind the gates in the harbor.All the final scenes had probably a strong influence on Carol Reed's "odd man out" (1947)Remade as "Algiers" by John Cromwell(1938) ,Charles Boyer taking on Gabin's part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not so surprising that this film originally bore the working title of "Les Nuits Blanches", as it certainly shares more than a passing resemblance to Dostoevsky's timeless tale and Visconti's mesmeric adaptation. "Pepe Le Moko" is, more than anything else, a love story, though it functions more as a commentary on the dynamics and nature of love than an exultation in its virtues. Like Dostoevsky's hapless dreamers, Duvivier's characters are in love with phantoms, incorporeal fantasies that they project onto canvas of flesh. Naturally, idealism and reality are hopelessly estranged, and efforts of reconciliation can only precipitate frustration and tragedy.Pepe le Moko is a tormented fugitive and exile, liege lord of a vice-ridden, sweltering microcosm and crown fool. Like the swaggering, stolid gangsters of Jean-Pierre Melville, Pepe is a victim of himself, prisoner of arbitrary codes of masculinity and honor. His hauteur are undermined by the minuteness of his empire, itself infested with conspirators eager to sell him to the police. His "freedom" itself is pathetic enough to be risible, venturing outside the insular sanctuary and he is fair game for the police. Clinging doggedly to whatever semblance of liberty he has left, Pepe acts out a tragic comedy within the confines of his circumscribed universe, his roles of Don Juan and Capone underscored by pathos and ennui.When a flighty Parisienne catches a glimpse of the fabled kingpin, she becomes instantly infatuated with his imperious manner, seeing him and the bloodthirsty world he represents as salvation from her stuffy bourgeois existence. In Aeschylean fashion, neither Pepe nor said femme fatale love one another, they merely love effigies, ideals. The female is Pepe's solitary conduit to his beloved Paris and the only confidante for his crippling homesickness. His indifference to her extravagant jewelry reveals the absolute arbitrariness of his criminal pursuits, a mere pretext for action in such boring climes. Yet, the viewer is acutely aware that the Paris Pepe longs for no longer exists, if it is represented by the addle-brained, vacuous Sybarites that his lover surrounds herself with. The mere fact that a Parisienne would exalt him as her liberator should itself alert him to the folly of his reveries. Sustained by his illusions, Pepe withdraws further from reality. Everything about Jean Gabin's character makes me want to cry- his fragile stoicism, his crestfallenness, his obsessive delusion, his self-destructiveness.There are some who would take issue with the implicit ethnocentrism in the "Casbah" imagery. Note that this was an adaptation of a novel written in the midst of fervent pro-colonial sentiment, and that, in Duvivier's hands, the Casbah becomes mythic, poetic, allegorical. The impenetrable veils of smoke are almost Cocteau-esquire, giving the film the sensuous richness of Scheheradze's chambers. At the same time, the mists accent Pepe's self-deception- his entire persona is fictive, as are his illusions of freedom and escape. The sequence of Pepe's fevered sprint toward the harbor may be maligned nowadays for its visual sloppiness, but I think it's absolutely marvelous, masterfully capturing Pepe's childlike impetuousness. As Pepe courses onward, the surrounding Casbah gradually blurs around him, the juxtaposition of back/foreground indicating his flight from one fantasy into another, as well as highlighting the sheer depth of his delusory monomania and tunnel-visioned myopia. As psychology transformed into image, this one works.Beyond everything, Pepe Le Moko is a deeply cynical film, its slightly jaundiced perspective on human nature reminding one of Clouzot, Hitchcock and Joseph Conrad. The entire film is a tight lattice of interwoven self-interests- look at the Parisienne's corpulent, autocratic husband, the obsence, oleaginous Regis and the servile, serpentine Slimane for some fine examples of the vile characters on display. Even the character who loves deeply and truly, the forbearing Ines, would rather betray Pepe than be estranged from him...a commentary on the covetous, self-serving nature of love, perhaps?I haven't seen any other Duvivier films, but he doesn't seem to be the humanist that Becker and Renoir are, and I can appreciate him all the more for that. Like Becker, he seems to have been largely misunderstood and under-appreciated in his time, at least on these shores, and the interview appended on the Criterion disk suggest that he was a retiring and modest sort, never garrulous about his art (and hesitant to even think of it as art, which it assuredly is). What a film this is....a terrific achievement. I love the golden age of French cinema, and this affirms and reinforces that affection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 30's, in Algeria, the charming Parisian gangster Pépé le Moko (Jean Gabin) rules in the district of Casbah. Surrounded and protected by the women and his gang, he is unattainable by the French and Algerian police forces, but also he has been imprisoned in the area for two years. The police unsuccessfully try to bring Pépé le Moko to the center of Algiers to capture him, and he misses his former life in Paris and Marseilles. The astute and ambiguous Algerian inspector Slimane (Lucas Gridoux) promises to arrest Pépé le Moko the day he leaves Casbah. When Pépé meets the French Gaby Gould (Mireille Balin), she represents everything he misses in his life, and he has a crush on her, bringing a fatal jealousy in his mate, In?s (Line Noro)."Pépé le Moko" is a great film-noir, with a good romance and excellent locations. The screenplay is very well developed, showing clearly the maze where Pépé is trapped, and explaining each character very well. Jean Gabin has an excellent performance in the role of a seductive criminal; Mireille Balin is extremely elegant, wearing beautiful costumes; and Lucas Gridoux is perfect in the role of the smart inspector Slimane. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "O Demônio da Algéria" ("The Demon of Algeria")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gang of thieves hide out above Algiers in the Arab section of the city, the Casbah, in "Pepe le Moko," a 1937 film - an homage to the U.S. gangster movie - that is often credited as the inspiration for the film noir craze that swept U.S. cinema. In order to draw attention to the American version, "Algiers," producer Walter Wanger tried to destroy all copies, subsequently buying the rights to keep it off the screen. But you can't keep a good movie down.Pepe le Moko (Jean Gabin) is wanted by the police, so if he leaves the crowded and maze-like Casbah to go into town, they will nail him. There is an inspector who keeps an eye on Pepe, Inspector Slimane. Pepe and the inspector have become friends, but Pepe knows Slimane is just waiting for him to make his move. When Pepe meets the exotic and bejeweled Gaby, a situation presents itself where he might risk his freedom.Pepe is the great French actor Jean Gabin, a marvelous-looking, rugged actor with tremendous magnetism. It's no wonder Marlene Dietrich chased him all over the world. Gabin's Pepe is the forerunner of the Bogart persona - he's a confident, handsome man, dismissive of women and has the ability to be both funny and cruel. He lives with his devoted girlfriend, Ines, and is surrounded by his motley mob who are familiar with the seedier side of life.There are some brilliant moments and great performances in this film, which is rich in atmosphere and interesting faces. The French star Mireille Balin, whose real-life story is more bizarre than any fiction, is Gaby, a kept woman who enchants le Moko as they talk about their great love for Paris, most especially, Place Blanche. Line Noro is Ines, doomed to love and lose Pepe, and Frehel is Tania, a friend. In one of the best scenes in the film, Tania reminisces about her youth and sings along with her own recording. A wonderful artist. The entire cast is marvelous. The director, Julien Duvivier, orchestrates the proceedings with tremendous style and tension, capturing the heat, the light and the sounds of the Casbah.Often imitated - by "The Third Man," "Odd Man Out," "Casablanca," "The Time Of Your Life," "To Have And Have Not," "The Wages of Fear," -- and let's not forget Pepe le Pew - "Pepe le Moko" and Jean Gabin's Pepe stand on their own as hallmarks in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French film-noir before film-noir even existed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The term film-noir didn't got handled until the '40's but this term would also really apply to this movie. It features all of the film-noir ingredients with its story as well as its atmosphere.The movie isn't as smooth or expensive and good looking as an American movie but otherwise there is not much wrong with it. It features a typical crime story in which a Parisian gangster hides in Algeria. Combined with this get the usual factors such as romance and a tough main character, who of course also shows his humane side. It has a solid story that is typical for the genre and therefore for the regular genre viewer won't feature many surprises in it but it's for them also nice and interesting to see how this typical film-noir ingredients all got handled in a '30's, before the film-noir got even really truly invented.But because the movie isn't American this of course also means that this movie is a 'different' one to watch. It features often some more interesting camera-angles and style of editing. It makes some of the sequences really great to look at. It also has a good and pleasant pace and is skillfully being directed by Julien Duvivier.It's also a movie that got greatly carried by its principal actor Jean Gabin. He plays his character in the right way for the movie. He's a criminal but you still like him. It's a great character played by a great actor. Not all of the supporting actors are just as good however and act in a more typical kind of '30's over-the-top acting style, though the movie does feature some more great characters.The movie got for some part shot in Algeria itself but some sequence are also sometimes painfully obvious studio-work. It's the foremost reason why the movie at times has a sort of cheap and less smooth look over it. The movie did became a success though and even managed to get an American release. This success inspired Hollywood to make one year later an American remake of this movie, called "Algiers", starring French born actor Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr.A real fine late '30's French crime drama, which really can be seen as an early film-noir.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pepe le Moko is a tragic figure -- his criminality has made him godfather of the Casbah but happiness eludes him because the instant he leaves he'll be nabbed by the cops.Powerful as he is, Pepe has no friend -- not the gypsy woman (well acted) who believes she loves him, nor the police inspector with whom he engages in homo-erotic repartee. Informers are snuffed out in the Casbah with impunity but they are in ever-replenishing supply.The ambiance of the Casbah is a character in itself here -- one of great allure and mystery. The bedazzling kept woman for whom Pepe lusts is less a love object than an irresistible reminder of the world he has lost.Jean Gabin's Pepe is a masterpiece of sexual appeal, savoir faire, and brilliance. Just when we think that love has befuddled him, we see that Pepe has outfoxed us again.He does manage to escape -- but how he does so ends this film on a shockingly unexpected yet triumphant note.</fullReview>

It is also one of many great crime films of the thirties that is sadly overlooked in many critics top 100 lists.Through it's lush sense of location and character Duvivier builds up a sweaty, exotic and complex picture of the underworld life of the Kasbah and the vast panorama of engagingly seedy characters especially Pepe le Moko, played with such effortlessly charismatic ease by Jean Gabin. But it is the rich claustrophobic atmosphere and the relentless pressure of the police that powers this film along to it's elegantly tragic conclusion.

		<fullReview>You can tell when a movie is trying to impose an attitude on you, but it just doesn't take. We are obviously supposed to regard Pépé as a charming rogue, but I thought he was rude and inconsiderate. We are supposed to feel sorry for In?s, who truly loves him, but it is hard to care about a woman who will allow a man to treat her like dirt.We are supposed to believe that Pépé and Gaby truly love each other, but I could not begin to swallow that one. Though Pépé appears to be about thirty years old, and supposedly has had his way with countless women, yet we are asked to believe he would fall madly in love with Gaby at first sight, acting as if he had the emotional maturity of an adolescent half his age. And she is a hard boiled, gold-digging mistress of an older man, so true love at first sight does not suit her very well either.We are not supposed to like Slimane, but I kept pulling for him to catch Pépé and put him in prison as he deserves. But nothing so mundane. When Pépé realizes he cannot have the woman he loves, he carves himself up with a knife. Oh well, at least the bad guy died in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jean Gabin An Unlikely Hero In The Casbah: Great Visual Storytelling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazing surprise unfolded with my first viewing of Pepe Le Moko, an amazingly atmospheric tale of a man willingly trapped by the labyrinth that is the Casbah, an attractive criminal with a flair for smart dress and a personal code that makes him a legend on the streets.There is a reason that Marlene Dietrich claimed that Jean Gabin was the only man she truly loved, and it's evident here; he's not conventionally handsome, but his honesty and intelligence shine through, and Duvivier sets up so many memorable set pieces one must return to the film again to wholly experience them: in one, a cowardly traitor falls against a player piano setting off a giddy tune while he is stalked by a dying gang member barely able to focus his gun; in another--well, experience them for yourself! This is not a conventional thriller top heavy with special effects, but a subtle examination of character taunted by the promise of a romantic future. It's a potent reminder of how important character can be in a significant story, how much more effective a good story than computer-generated effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rarity wanted by so many</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you think of film noir, your thoughts are most likely to be around American movies. Moreover, if you are more knowledgeable of old cinema and you hear of the Casbah criminal, it most probably makes you think of ALGIERS (1938) with Charles Boyer. But...it appears that a true classic concerning the theme had been a bit earlier. PEPE LE MOKO from 1937: a French film noir made before WWII, directed by one of the greatest directors of the time, Julien Duvivier, with such talented cast like Jean Gabin, Mireille Balin, Gilbert Gil and Lucas Gridoux. The film was quite popular in Europe before WWII but later, a lot of people simply forgot it. However, nowadays, surprising as it may seem, PEPE LE MOKO is a pure rarity, a very interesting work that memorably combines action, charm, great performances, marvelous shots and unforgettable scenes. Yes, PEPE LE MOKO has become even more powerful after these 7 decades when film noir fails to reflect its most precious aspects, like good action, thrill and content.Jean Gabin is excellent in the lead. He portrays the most wanted gangster, a charming thief hiding in the maze like section of Algiers, the Casbah, where everybody look for him but nobody can capture him. It is Pepe Le Moko on whose funeral there would be three thousand widows lamenting but who, at last, finds the love of his life. That love, however, can never be fulfilled... Jean depicts this man extremely well. I think that he was really a great actor and I will look for his other movies. Considering other performances, Milleine Balin is very convincing as lustful exotic Gaby worn in jewels, a beauty as if from a thousand and one nights who reminds Pepe of the Parisian underground. Lucas Gridoux as Inspector Slimane also does a fine job showing his character's indefatigable desire to capture Pepe and ways of investigation galore. Action is another flawless aspect of the movie. It is managed so well and so flexibly that the viewer never gets bored. All the time, something is happening and captivates a person who has at last decided to see this film. It is, perhaps, unusual for such old movies to keep viewer's attention, but indeed accurate to say it about Duvivier's film - action of PEPE LE MOKO has already stood a test of time with marvelous results.Memorable moments are something much to talk about. First, I will never forget the presentation of the Casbah - narrow streets of peculiar names, maze like group of buildings, different nationalities, various girls of various size... Authentic locations of Algiers section provides this moment (as well as most part of the movie) with exceptional atmosphere. Another key moment is close the end when an elderly lady Tania (Frehel), aiming to improve her mood, puts on a song on a gramophone, a song she once used to sing on stage, and starts to sing along with her recorded voice. The voice is the same, after all these years, but, this time, her eyes are full of tears... Finally, the third brilliant moment is when Pepe talks to Gaby about Paris - a wonderful moment of cinematography, lightning lingering on their nostalgic faces as they enumerate the places of Paris. Here, great thanks to Marc Fossard! And this technical aspect is something I'd like to discuss in more details (if you don't mind such a long review).Whenever I consider such old films, I usually focus on camera movement. Memorably invented by F.W.Murnau in his masterpiece THE LAST LAUGH (1924), it was the most creative aspect of most movies from the late 1920s and the 1930s. PEPE LE MOKO can boast a true masterwork in this case. Camera lingers on important aspects of the scenes and, consequently, while watching the movie, you really know what it's going at. Everything is strictly planned, patterned (paradoxically many films have primarily forgotten about it nowadays). Consider, for instance, a brilliant technical moment when Pepe leaves the Casbah: this unforgettable focus on his footsteps, then his face, his head and the changing background from the streets to the sea.PEPE LE MOKO is a very fine movie that should not be forgotten, a classic of film noir with great cast and an amazing exemplification of good technical job. Well worth seeking out! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pepe le Moko is the best french film i've seen (and i've seen many) before WWII. The only one who can compete with it is Guitry. The characters and their relations are wonderful. Worth a pagnol Book. And moreover, the actors are the best who could get at those times The images are "sublime". People who like and are interested in the french colonies would have a wonderful insight of it. Truly interesting to see how colonies was perceived before it ends. Sadely, you've got to be know french quite well to appreciate it. Even tough, you've got to see it. It contains valuable ideas and tricks to make a wonderful movies.

		<fullReview>Deciding to watch over 100 French films over the next few months,one of the main goals that I set was to track down as many titles from auteur film maker Julien Duvivier.Looking on Amazon UK for Duvivier flicks that have officially come out on DVD,I spotted a work credited as the "first ever" Film Noir!,which led to me excitingly getting ready to meet Pépé le Moko. The plot:Constantly moving in order to stop the police catching him,gangster Pépé le Moko decides to go into hiding in the overcrowded Casbah quarter of Algiers. Whilst being aware of Moko's continuing his operations,police officer Slimane finds that he is unable to smoke Moko out of the city.Uncovering details that over the 2 years he has been hidden in the city that the no-nonsense Moko has fallen for Gaby,which leads to Slimane drawing up a plan with the hope of finally meeting Moko.View on the film:Overcrowding the streets of Casbah,co-writer/(along with Henri La Barthe/ Jacques Constant and Henri Jeanson) director Julien Duvivier closely works with editor Marguerite Beaugé to present a dusty,smoking hot Film Noir city,where rough edits give the title a documentary grit. Making Moko king of the city, Duvivier looks across Moko's kingdom with highly stylised tracking shots pulling up all of the Film Noir loners and dead beats littering the city.Striking the screen with harsh shots of violence, Duvivier cooks up a scorching hot Film Noir atmosphere,as Moko's dream romance is rubbed with dirt that sets Moko sailing into Duvivier's major theme of a sun-lit Noir hell.Giving Moko a short-hand knowledge on how to speak to everyone in their adaptation of co-writer Barthe's novel,the screenplay by Constant/Jensen/Barthe and Duvivier jam packs the movie a cracking Film Noir dialogue which superbly balances Moko's awareness that he is the most powerful and smartest guy in the room,with a heated unease of the rug being pulled from Moko's feet. Falling for Gabby,the writers brilliantly pull the romance out of the melodrama and into the Noir fire via keeping Slimane and rival gangsters constantly looking for a moment of weakness over the loved up shoulders.Looking remarkably fresh faced,Jean Gabin gives an incredible performance as Moko,who allows Gabin to show a burning Film Noir gravitas be sliced into Moko's doomed face,which is joined by an infectious youthful exuberance blinding Moko from the ship of destruction on the horizon. Joined by a cute Mireille Balin as Gabby, Lucas Gridoux gives a marvellous performance as Slimane,thanks to Gridoux biting down on Slimane's determination to locate the target,as Moko,Gabby and Slimane step into the "first ever" Film Noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French Gangsters... pre-Melville</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wanted gangster is both king and prisoner of the Casbah. He is protected from arrest by his friends, but is torn by his desire for freedom outside. A visiting Parisian beauty may just tempt his fate.English author Graham Greene in a review of the film stated "One of the most exciting and moving films I can remember seeing... Raises the thriller to a poetic level!" According to a BBC documentary, it served as inspiration for Greene's acclaimed novel "The Third Man". This would be quite interesting. "Pepe" is seen as a precursor to film noir, but in my opinion "Third Man" is one of the greatest films of all time... if this film was a direct influence, it deserves to be studied by more film lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The *real* Algiers movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pépé le Moko (1937) is a French movie directed by Julien Duvivier.Jean Gabin plays Pépé le Moko, a Parisian gangster and jewel thief who is pursued by the police. He lives in Algiers' Casbah, where he's safe as long as he doesn't try to leave. He has a beautiful girlfriend In?s, played by Line Norp, and loyal gang members. The Casbah is his protection, but it's also his prison. The excellent actor Lucas Gridoux plays Police Inspector Slimane, who actually likes Pépé, but who tells Pépé that one day he will have to arrest him. That will happen when Pépé leaves the Casbah. (He's honest in this--that's his plan. He knows it, and Pépé knows it.)Into this situation comes Mireile Balin as Gaby, a beautiful young French woman who is the mistress of a much older man. It's love at first sight between Pépé and Gaby. Of course, she can't stay in the Casbah, and he can't leave it. That's the point around which the plot pivots.I enjoyed watching this film. Even though the movie is almost 70 years old, it doesn't have a dated feel to it. (Like "Casablanca," it's timeless.) It's worth seeing on its own merits, but also for an interesting look at film history. Just a year later, a U.S. version was produced, with Charles Boyer as Pépé and Hedy Lamarr as Gaby. Except for the leads, all the actors in the U.S. version look like the actors in the French version. (I had to check the IMDb cast listings to make sure they weren't actually the same people.) The U.S. version copies the French original scene for scene, and probably frame by frame. I don't know if this kind of duplication was--or is--legal, but I found it pathetic. The good news is that IMDb reviewers weren't fooled by the copy. Pépé le Moko has an excellent rating of 7.7, while Algiers has a mediocre 6.9. I saw the film on DVD, where it worked well. If you can see it on the large screen, all the better. If you haven't seen either version, see the French film first. "Pépé le Moko" is the real thing. "Algiers" is interesting as well, but it's really just a lesser imitation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pépé Le Moko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This French film was one I found listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I saw later that the critics gave it five stars out of five, so I hoped it was one I agree deserves that recommendation. Basically notorious French gangster Pépé Le Moko (Jean Gabin) is a Parisian criminal on the run from the metropolitan police, and to escape them he has been hiding in and ruling the Casbah quarter of Algiers, where the local police cannot makes attempts to capture him, being surrounded by his gang and the women. Inspector Slimane (Lucas Gridoux) has plans to lure Pépé out of his refuge, and he sees his opportunity when he finds out the gangster is in love with the gorgeous mistress of a rich businessman, Parisian tourist Gaby Gould (Mireille Balin), and after two years of hiding he misses his freedom. To go ahead with this Slimane tricks Gaby into believing that Pépé has been killed, she was going to join him in the Casbah, therefore she returns to her rich lover, so Pépé finds out she is leaving Algiers he leaves his refuge, and that is when he is arrested. Also starring Line Noro as In?s, Gabriel Gabrio as Carlos, Fernand Charpin as Régis, Saturnin Fabre as Grandfather, Gilbert Gil as Pierrot and Roger Legris as Max. The story of a gangster making himself untouchable but then wanting to return to normality after falling in love makes for an interesting watch, I admit I could keep up with absolutely everything going on, perhaps because of the subtitles, but I can see most of the reasons why this inspired many classics later, particularly Casablance, so it is certainly a most watchable romantic melodrama. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charismatic gangster hides out in a French-Arabic multi-ethnic demi-monde that is the Casbah, while cops and double-crossers vie to snare him.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Employing dozens of shots and montages to bring to eye each of the words in a riveting description that describes the multi-ethnic demi-monde that is the "Casbah" (a sea-side teeming hill of French-Arab settlements) this film opens its eminently charming folds. A team of policemen, in another expertly filmed scene which follows the first one,, discuss the man they want to catch -Pepe Le Moko who's hiding out in the above-described warren. I watched this 1937 French film with the help of excellent English subtitles provided by the Criterion collection, and realized that even in the 1930s, the French could outclass Hollywood.Pepe (an effortlessly confident Jean Gabin), it quickly becomes clear, is an enigmatic criminal, wanted for a litany of transgressions. The camera when it first shows him tricks us into looking at someone lesser but we soon realize this is not the (anti)-hero. The lens eventually displays him holding a pearl in the oyster of his hand, clad fully in suit and tie, his light eyes flashing like the said gem. Pepe floats in a sea of relentlessly wonderful dialog both within and around, hounded by treachery, and drawn magnetically to shifting romance and serious complications. He never loses that sartorial armor of suit and tie- it's with him whether he is firing a gun,cradling a dying brother, holding a lady in his arms, or coolly snacking on a kebab off the streets.The picture is also a great example of why black and white cinematography is such a strongly atmospheric device - color would robbed this film's terrain of much of its uniqueness. Henri La Barthe's novel and Henri Jeanson's terrific dialogs help to fuel the drama, romance and intrigue surrounding the hero. He appears to be in early middle-age, has been hiding out in the Casbah for two years, is rapidly growing sick of its medieval confines ("I'm like England,my future is on the waves") and actively angles for new love ("home is wherever he finds a woman","when he is dead there will be three thousand widows at his funeral").Even under duress Pepe separates the wheat from the chaff and proceeds to hatch a really neat plan. His dialog from earlier in the story, regarding the ladies, then comes to mind - "I give them my body,but I keep my head". That is no doubt a good plan but it is not a perfect one. The heart is still in the body.For full review and other cinema analysis, you may visit http://www.upnworld.com/movie/view/id/12/title/Pepe+Le+Moko+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I know, a trite headline. Apart from the fact that I don't know much French, isn't it uncanny how many tales, fiction and non, have a woman at the heart of matters? So it is with Pepe Le Moko, another poor slob caught in a love affair which costs him dearly. And to think he was the toast of The Casbah, a local hero with all the money and women and friendship he could ask for.Director Duvuvier paints a vivid picture of the sprawling slum that is the Casbah, teeming with humanity and activity, a place that has become a prison - in an abstract sense - for Pepe. The movie sets a fast pace, with barely time to catch your breath as the tension builds towards a climax both anticipated and disheartening - as so often happens, we root for this appealing criminal, hoping the outcome will be different than we expect.Some have said that the film is a 'film noir' prototype, and I agree, even though the genre didn't start until a few years later. If we include it, it is one of the best - the website description of crime/drama/romance lends a mundane feel and doesn't do it justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Duvivier's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pepe Le Moko stands out as Duvivier's masterpiece and sets the measure for all film noir to follow. The director makes excellent use of the Moroccan locations, having improved exponentially since making Cinq Gentlemen Maudits in the same location a few years early.Excellent use is made of light and shadow, most notably in the film's final shot in which Pepe gazes through a fence at the departing ship. The shadows cast here look like prison bars, with the freedom represented by the boat receding further into the distance every second.Gabin is in fine form as the emotionally volatile Pepe who has entrapped himself in Casbah by his crimes. Morocco is very much presented as an alien other here right from the opening scenes, in which criminals and police play games against an exotic backdrop. Aerial shots establish the city as a rabbit warren in which the hunted quarry hides, unable to ever return to France yet reminded of his homeland at every turn.Symbolically, Pepe has become so evil that he can no longer return to civilisation: he has traded his human dignity to hide amongst the lice and fleas in a far corner of the French Empire filled with treacherous characters. He longs to return to home but cannot even go openly into the main city area of Casbah; through his actions, he is no longer fit for civilisation.The contrast between violence and farce that was to become a hallmark of future French gangster films is established here in the murder of the traitor to the whimsical sounds of a player-piano.Humour is also found in the scene in which Gabin unexpectedly treats us to his musical talents, with the townspeople joining in.Musical is also used to extremely good effect in the scene of the older woman singing along to a recording of herself in a youth a song of longing for those who have left Mother France.Ultimately, this is an essential piece of French cinema that explores the theme of estrangement, even self-inflicted estrangement, from one's homeland and set the stage for all of the film noir that was to follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just seen this for the first time properly - last time was 40 years ago but I was too young and put off by what I then perceived to be its excessive wordiness. I wish now I'd persevered then with the subtitles!Damned elusive French gangster with a heart of almost gold Pepe played by Jean Gabin is holed up in the tightly knit lice infested insalubrious Casbah in Algiers, with various police machinations ongoing to lure him from his relative safety into a civilised jail. He's surrounded by an odd and sinister assortment of fellow hoods, coppers and their informers, and especially 2 women who of course eventually unwittingly bring him (literally) to his knees. This was chunky Gabin's film from start to end ? imho no one else could bring such honesty, pathos and even glamour to this role. Not being an expert on male beauty I've always been surprised and impressed by him - how could such a clunky looking rocky slab be so photogenic and the epitome of style and sartorial elegance no matter what he wore for whatever role? My daughter blames it on his innate Gallic charm. Don't miss the iconic shots of him and Mireille Balin after their day of passion and Gabin's subsequent musical outbreak to the denizens amusement. The frank plot moves logically and swiftly with not a second wasted, the photography is usually brilliant and the film reeks of proto film noir atmosphere.It has its faults (for example the occasional hurried snatches of intense nostalgia by characters for the past or Paris doesn't ring the bell for me) but this is a classic film, almost essential viewing even for people who aren't film historians, students or snobs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cooped up in the Casbah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is true what they say, that this is an early French film noir, before the term film noir was even invented. Jean Gabin is mesmerizing as the charismatic gangster Pépé, who has been holed up in the Casbah of Algiers for two years and unable to get out because only there can he successfully evade the police raids by leaping over the rooftops. The intensity of his stares is well captured on camera by director Julien Duvivier, who worked with Gabin so many times and knew him so well. The film was made on location in Algiers, Algeria being then a French colony. The film is thus marvellously exotic and evocative of the Casbah, more so than the later film which was also set in the Casbah, BATTLE OF ALGIERS (1966). Not that the Casbah is in any way flattered by this film, as the characters are continually cursing its lice and its filth. This film was remade in English the following year as ALGIERS (1938), with Charles Boyer as the gangster and Hedy Lamarr as the femme fatale Gaby. Then it was remade again in English as CASBAH (1948) with Tony Martin as the gangster. We can thus chart a steady progression of decline in quality, starting with the original and ending with the second, and rather faint, carbon copy, all based on the same novel by Henri Le Barthe. In this original version, the 28 year-old Mireille Balin plays the femme fatale character Gaby with sizzling intensity. (The story of what happened to Balin in her private life is deeply disturbing, and those who wish to know about it should read her bio on the database.) When Balin and Gabin look at each other 'in that way', we witness en electron in collision with a positron. In?s, the gypsy girl who loves Gabin, is played by Line Noro, who despite her Italian name was French, born in Lorraine. She is continually distraught over the restless 'cabin fever' which is driving Gabin mad with frustration, cooped up as he has been for so long. But when he meets Balin by chance, he is driven even wilder, this time with uncontrollable lust. But that lust represents freedom. He and Balin begin discussing districts and particular streets of Paris and work themselves up into a frenzy of memory for the city they love, and from which they have both been exiled for their different reasons. These scenes remind one of the scenes in Clouzot's film THE WAGES OF FEAR (1953), in which Yves Montand, another French exile in the middle of nowhere, reminisces with one of the other characters in the film about his favourite street near Place St. Michel. If you take French people away from Paris for too long, they quickly become maudlin and go to pieces. And Paris, perhaps more than any other large city in the world, is defined by its particular locations, its specific streets, to those who love it. Nowhere so much as in Paris is the charm of each separate spot so alluring. As Gabin and Balin (strange how similar their surnames were!) work themselves up into a lather of memories of Paris, the unattainable Balin, who is staying in a hotel outside the Casbah, comes to represent for Gabin the equally unattainable Paris, and the impossibility of freedom to roam, so that like a caged panther he strides with manic desperation back and forth, back and forth, as his gypsy gal sees clearly that his doom is coming. And his doom means the end of everything for her, unless she can somehow prevent it. Gabin snaps, bringing on a cascade of dramatic events. This is an excellent film, but not a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far Superior to "Algiers" -- Which Was Itself a Very Fine Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grim, shocking, realistic, yet undeniably romantic, Pepe le Moko has justly been hailed as one of the ten best films produced in France in the 1930s. The leads, Gabin and Balin, contrive to be both realistic yet poetic, aided by skillful direction, atmospheric photography and a haunting music score. Anyone who views this film first and then watches the Hollywood remake will notice how slavishly director John Cromwell duplicates both Julien Duvivier's camera angles and frame arrangements. And why not? In most cases, Duvivier's inventiveness was impossible to equal, let alone surpass. And as for the performances, with one or two exceptions?Boyer is the equal of Gabin, but his interpretation is geared to his far more romantic (in both senses of that word) screen personality?the originals outclass their imitators. Hedy Lamarr, alas, does not stand up to the wonderfully exotic but earthy Mireille Balin. It seems at odds with her screen image, but I feel Hedy brings a guileless innocence to the role, which is certainly interesting (and she looks great) but is not what the part demands. Cromwell has coached her to actually play against the script rather than with it, no doubt partly to assuage the Hollywood censor. In addition to the stars of the French version, three portraits really stand out in the support cast: Charpin as the venal informer, Lucas Gridoux as the sly, ostensibly friendly inspector, and Frehél as the overweight but still optimistic has-been. I love her nostalgic little song (just one of a few really memorable moments which are completely missing from the Hollywood movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homebound soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Depending on your definition this is or isn't film noir, and the space inbetween explains how malleable is the term. The story has some of the elements, a hardened crook, cops on his trail, a certain karmic inescapability that is not fate, a seductive woman who is used to lure him out, a downbeat finale where the universe is not beaten.But it is important to distinguish, at least as far as the film noir debate goes, that the desired woman is not the femme fatale, and the one who actually serves as her is a heartbroken girlfriend, a traditional dramatic trope.Still so far as the karmic aspect is concerned, this is deeply noirish. Our man is holed up in the one place where police cannot find him, the Casbah of Algiers, we're taken on a tour of a place that looks very much like this man's soul, and does so throughout the film, so at once wild and sweet, teeming in the narrow streets and crowded tenements with impulsive life, love, betrayal. When he is gloomy, the whole place feels seedy and dangerous. When he's happy and singing from his balcony, the whole place erupts in cheers and song, from one sunny terrace to the next, all of them overlooking the sea promising freedom.This is karmic and not fate, not some arbitrary decree from the gods, because the prison is of his making and he's only there because his actions have brought him. He survives in the one place he has carved for himself, it is no mysterious coincidence then that he is there, in the sense that the place is very much like him.This is no idle talk either. I spent my student years in a small Aegean island of 25k people that looks exactly like the Casbah, more precisely the modern Casbah in its state of neglect. These seaside citadels are more or less the same throughout the Mediterranean, a lot of jumbled architecture without clean pattern, and were built this way to confound invaders from sea, usually saracen pirates. They were built for Pepe's purpose, that is to conceal and prevent access. In our case the invaders are French, colonists. The Casbah would soon serve as the cornerstone of Algerian liberation.There is a woman that is from there and does for him what the place does, nurtures him with wild-eyed passion, but of course he yearns for home. Another woman mirrors home, the fresh, elegant girl from Paris, he looks into her eyes and sees boulevards and cafes, the Place Blanche.You need to see this just for the finale. The claustrophobic sense of place is so pervading that when we finally step out into the harbor for the last hope of escape and our eye finally opens up, you can practically smell freedom in the sprays of sea water in the air.It is magic. He sails away on the image promising home, leaving his body behind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Blame it on the Casbah."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pepe le Moko (Jean Gabin) is something of a celebrity in the Algerian Casbah he calls home. The locals do what they can to protect Pepe and keep the police off his trail in hopes of winning his favor. But how long can Pepe remain hidden in the maze-like Casbah? The French police have a plan to use one of his best friends to lure Pepe out of the Casbah and place him under arrest. Complicating matters is a Parisian woman visiting Algiers that Pepe finds himself smitten with. She's different from what he's come to know in Algeria. She makes him dream and long for days of freedom outside the Casbah walls.To begin with, to anyone who recommended Pepe le Moko ? a big fat thanks. It's a great movie that I probably would have never even heard of had it not been for some of the good people at IMDb. As a budding fan of film noir, I was hooked from the minute the movie began. The plot kept my interest throughout. Never did it seem slow. I've only seen Jean Gabin in one other movie (Touchez pas au grisbi), but I'm quickly discovering what a talented actor he was. His Pepe is a very believable character. He plays Pepe with style, feeling, and, when called for, viciousness. Director Julien Duvivier uses the twisted roads and alleyways of the Casbah to create a one of kind setting for his film. I've actually been in a place like this during a visit to Tangiers, and the Casbah in Pepe le Moko gave me that same feeling of a place you would easily get lost in.In many ways, Pepe le Moko is ahead of its time. First, I honestly had no idea that something so seemingly American as film noir could be traced to 1930s French cinema. Many of the American films of the next two decades can surely be traced to Pepe le Moko. Second, much of the subject matter in the film is certainly something an American movie of the 30s would never touch or discuss so openly. Themes of sex and adultery wouldn't be commonplace in American cinema for years to come. And finally, some of the film techniques used by Duvivier give the film the look of something made years later. The camera has a fluidity and style I don't associate with the 30s when so much of what was being made still relied on the old "plant and shoot" technique of the silent era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>gangster flicks meet colonialism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the significances of Julien Duvivier's "Pepe le Moko" is that Charles Boyer's character from the American remake inspired Pepe Le Pew. But there is definitely more to understand about the movie than that.An important point about this tale of a French gangster (Jean Gabin) hiding from the police in the Algiers casbah, is its status as a pivot. Gangster flicks had become a staple of American cinema in the 1930s, and so France made this film in response. But then this movie influenced film noir. It may have been the original film noir. Also noteworthy is the role of Europe's view of its colonies. Most popular media promoted stereotypical - usually negative - images of non-white peoples. Early in this movie, they note that the casbah is the home of several different ethnic groups (yet they don't mention Arabs). While the movie doesn't necessarily say anything positive about non-white peoples, it doesn't attack them.No matter what the movie says specifically about any group, it remains a formidable piece of cinema history, with its use of poetic realism. The labyrinthine streets of the casbah are like a character on their own. I definitely recommend it. Also starring Line Noro and Mireille Balin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pépé le Moko(Jean Gabin), an elusive gangster(with a special gift as a master thief)hides out from the French authorities in the labyrinthine Algerian Casbah. The citizens within this place assist their local celebrity because he represents that anti-authoritarian way of life against the government outside their city walls. A paid informer within the city, Régis(Fernand Charpin), has concocted the perfect plan to draw Pépé out of the city by using the gangster's best friend, Pierrot(Gilbert Gil)as bait. By using a fake note stating Pierrot's mother was sick just out of the city, he will be cornered by police and arrested. That plan doesn't exactly go as planned because Pépé doesn't leave the Casbah and Pierrot returns badly wounded(..eventually dying). Killing Régis doesn't take away the agony of losing a brother(their relationship modeled that of family)and the only true thing that helps bring Pépé out of his sadness is a growing love affair with a Parisian nicknamed Gaby(Mireille Balin). Unfortunately, he has no further use for Algerian In?s(Line Noro)who loves him dearly. Pépé even tells her that he has been bored in their relationship for some time describing tying her to the very Casbah for which he wishes to escape. This triangle will certainly open a possibility for Pépé's downfall. Yearning for Paris, Gaby represents a "different landscape" for Pépé who just wishes to escape Casbah's cage he's boxed in.This is a quintessential french noir and Gabin is the European actor who represents a symbol of the stylish gangster films from this golden age of crime film. As he often does, Gabin plays his gangster as cool, dashing, charming &amp; mysterious only conveying to us little elements a bit at a time. He IS the film and it's style matches how he plays Pépé. But, as many noir have always tended to operate, Pépé is a crook and must be denied true love. A man with past mistakes(..and, let's not kid ourselves, Pépé had made many in his long life of crime)will certainly reap what he sows. It's interesting to note that the man who eventually traps Pépé is the smallish, yet cunning, Inspector Slimane(Lucas Gridoux)..a cop who knows Pépé's exact locations, chats it up with the criminal, but faces off with him saying that he will be the one to catch him. He's the very man who schemes the perfect plan to nab the gangster by using the man's bounding love against him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pepe Le Moko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film very well shot, particularly the opening introduction of the Casbah, with each shot representing the well thought out narration. However, the particular theme of the film that interested me was the role of women in the film. Having been made in the 30's, there is of course a varying degree of sexism, which we see throughout the film. Despite the fact the protagonist is a gangster, we still see a shocking display of behaviour towards women, but in a subtle light. There are various conversations between the men on the subject of women, and how they should be beaten and kept in their place. The most shocking part of this is the way they talk about it in the presence of the women. Pepe le Moko uses his partner like a piece of rubbish, and does with her as he likes, not caring how she feels. In conclusion, his character portrays a sly and cool gangster, but with his frustration at times, he can lose it, and our respect lessens for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wealth of cinematic connections, and cultural and historical conclusions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is widely reported that Graham Greene, usually bitingly severe when it came to film criticism, was almost lost in praise for Pepe Le Moko. This is very interesting, as he effectively wrote and screen-adapted his own even more brilliant version a decade or so later, in the form of the incomparable The Third Man (1949). Jean Gabin's Pepe's effective imprisonment in the Kasbah becomes Orson Welles' Harry Lime's own condemnation to haunt only the Russian sector and the sewers of Vienna, where the Russians can use him and the British cannot reach him. And Mireille Balin's Gaby becomes Alida Valli's Anna, respectively the direct and indirect causes for the downfall of the anti-heroes whom they love. And the sly but ruthless inspector Slimane becomes the relentless Major Calloway. And the shadows and camera-work are in spirit transported from one film to the other, as are the little poignant moments like the child on the Kasbah lane, who becomes the little boy with the ball. Another classic with strong connections to Pepe Le Moko is The Wages of Fear (1953), with Yves Montand again a Frenchman for whom Paris is the universe, trapped this time by penury in a South American backwater that he hates, with death again in the last scene providing an alternative release from such bondage. And the unorthodox, opportunist and patient tactics of inspector Slimane recall the equally ruthless brooding intensity of Major Ali Tufan in Topkapi (1964) - both lawmen getting their European men. There is a much wider lesson in this, and never more so than at this time of Western capitulation in Iraq. These films, like also the brilliant Oeil Pour Oeil (An Eye For An Eye, 1957), are typical of a very long tradition by film-makers of keenly recognising the fact that the Islamic world generally made a very bad foe, and a very good grave, for Westerners. The imperial British in Afghanistan and Rudyard Kipling as their troubadour understood exactly as much, too. They may fight opportunistically and they may fight suicidally, but in the end their overwhelming asset is that they fight at home, against displaced Westerners who are as uncomprehending as they are repelled in such alien lands. And the result is always the same, extendable by analogy to Viet Nam and other wars. Films such as all the above may be fiction, but their greatness lies in their profound observation and perspective on life and the real world. Perhaps every new government in Washington, Canberra and elsewhere should be sat down to such great examples of the cinematic art, on the off chance that they might have enough perspicacity to detect in them some of the fundamental truths that they seem to have missed via other means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Nearly a Classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films you think you might have seen before simply because of the huge influence it has had on so many films and filmmakers since its release in 1937 ? everything from Casablanca to Pepe le Pew pays heavy homage to the characters and atmosphere that make such an impression in this film which, as another reviewer points out, made use of noir techniques long before the genre had been identified.Jean Gabin plays the title character, a charismatic gangster and legend amongst the eclectic mix of inhabitants of the Casbah in Algiers, where, thanks to their help, he has evaded capture by the police for two years. Pepe is not a free man, however: the Casbah is just as much a prison to him as an orthodox cell would be, because he knows that he faces arrest the moment he steps outside his sanctuary. Tired of his fiery gypsy lover (Line Noro), Pepe is growing increasingly restless when the beautiful Gaby Gould (Mireille Balin) steps into his life.Pepe le Moko possesses all the fatalistic darkness of a noir movie while steeping itself in the romanticism of the environment and of the plight of its central character. As Pepe, Jean Gabin plays perhaps his defining role, a potent irresistible force tormented by his desire to return to his homeland and increasingly contemptuous of the place that has protected him for more so long. Director Julien Duvivier paints a vivid picture of the claustrophobic Casbah, filled with narrow winding streets, crowded markets and smoky bars populated by a host of diverse and intriguing characters, all of whom simmer beneath the oppressive African heat. Henri la Berthe's screenplay, from his own novel, never judges our hero, and portrays him as a complex multi-layered man with his own sense of honour.The story takes second place to the characters throughout, and the film is filled with memorable moments that offer an insight into thoughts and feelings that often remain unspoken between them ? the scene in which Pepe grasps Gould's hand, for instance, and the camera lingers on her face to capture the almost imperceptible change of expression. The scene in which a former beauty sings along to a recording of her younger self, a lament to the lost people of Paris, also hits the spot and creates a sense of empathy for her and Pepe, both of whom are disenfranchised from a past they have no hope of ever recapturing.Should a classic movie be flawless in every respect? If so, then Pepe le Moko just misses the mark for a couple of reasons: Duvivier filmed in authentic Algiers locations, so it's a little surprising to see the use of glaringly obvious backdrops that distract attention away from what the viewer should be watching, and that classic ending seems to lose some of its undeniable power when Pepe produces the knife from his sleeve. I wonder how much more tragic it might have been had he been forced to live with the memory of what he could have had ? and has lost forever?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gift Of The Gabin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With films of this vintage and this level of acclaim the trick is to watch them as they must have been seen at the time before they became either clichéd, imitated, parodied or all three, and in doing so attempt to spot/respond to what was seen as innovative but seems perhaps dated seventy years on. Apart from the two Hollywood remakes - Algiers, with Charles Boyer, who at least was French, and Hedy Lamarr, who wasn't, and the risible Casbah with Tony Martin and, wait for it, Marta Toren (who she?) there were the semi-rip, sorry, spin-offs featuring men, unable to return, for one reason or another, to their own countries; best known, of course, is Casablanca, but Clark Gable had a stab at it in Soldier Of Fortune and, just in case we didn't get it he had a recording of traffic sounds in Chicago to remind him of such wholesome delights as Al Capone and St Valentine's Day. But it was Jean Gabin, in films since 1928 who had scored heavily in La Bandera and La Belle Equipe, who started the whole thing off. Seeing it now one is surprised at how it's been pillaged. At one point Ines (Line Noto) his gypsy girlfriend catches him moping for his home and says 'forget Paris', fifty years on that became the title of a Billy Crystal movie; Ines again says to Pepe 'you are what you are' which Jerry Herman twisted around to 'I Am What I Am' in La Cage aux folles. Julian Duvivier used his camera well to convey the claustrophobia of the casbah and if the final shot - Pepe clinging to and then slowly slipping down the railings that bar him from the ship taking his love, Gaby (Mireille Balin) back to Paris and later stolen by Carol Reed for the last shot of 'Odd Man Out'- seems a tad heavy on the symbolism it probably seemed anything but in 1937. With support on the order of Saturnin Fabre (Le Grand-pere) and Marcel Dalio in a 'bit' the film gets classy acting. Gabin, of course, was made to play Pepe and with master of dialogue Henri Jeanson putting the words in everyone's mouth the film remains highly watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful period piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great item to watch and see how the French Colony of Algeria was a rather exotic suburb of Paris. The scenery is great and the acting is quite exciting. Two things to watch for: one is the JG on Pepe's shirt standing for "Jean Gabin" rather than Pepe!! Another is the few enchanting moments to hear Frehel herself singing an extract of her songs. She played the role of Tania - a fat blowsy mounain of flesh that alas poor Frehel had become. This was quite poignant to see. Get yourself a CD of her chansons and you will see how wonderful she was. The idea of "Come wiz me to de casbah, ma cherie!" as parodied by countless comedians of the 1950's is clear when you see this great film. So, get a copy of this masterpiece and dim the lights - take your popcorn and enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but no masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1937 France, thief Pepe Le Moko (Jean Gabin) is hiding out in the city's notorious Casbah district. One step out of it and he'll be sent to jail. He falls in love with a high class woman, Gaby (Mireille Balin) but he must leave the Casbah to be with her...and the police are closing in.This is a good movie...at times a great one, but not the masterpiece I've heard it is. It drags at times and some of the subtitles read pretty stupidly. Also there's some truly ugly sexism on display. But, it's well directed by Julien Duvivier and Gabin was one hell of an actor. He's handsome, intelligent and full of charisma. In one great sequence, he's so happy that he's literally singing and you see how it affects everyone around him. Also Balin is beyond beautiful and Lucas Gridoux (as a sleazy detective) and Gilbert Gil are very good. And the ending is shattering and very moving.So...it's a very good French film.It's just been reissued in a beautiful new print (as of August 2002)...try to catch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gabin was excellent but the plot had a few too many clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very stylish film that I did enjoy, but not nearly as much as I thought. While considered a classic, Gabin's excellent performance and the movie's overall style was not enough to help it overcome one glaring cliché. You see, Pepe Le Moko is supposed to be the coolest and smartest thief in the Casbah, but time and again late in the film he just acts stupidly. Think about it--Le Moko has successfully avoided capture for years and is just too cool for words BUT in this film, he falls hard for a woman he barely even knows--leading to his ultimate downfall. You know, the silly old "love at first sight" cliché that they use in films when they want a quick and cheap plot device. Also, while the ending is really neat to watch, killing yourself that easily and quickly with a small pocket knife is ridiculous and ill-conceived. Without these, the film might have merited an 8 or 9. As it is, the film just seems like a great example of a film that ALMOST hits its mark. Still, the film is overall a bit better than its American remake, ALGIERS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does he love the girl... or her jewels?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An exotic and tragic tale of dashing Pepe Le Moko and how his weakness for women inevitably costs him more than he ever expected. Pepe is trapped in a hazy, crowded den of international thieves known only as 'The Casbah' when he meets Gaby, the jewelry-laden mistress of an older man. She reminds him of Paris, and all the sophistication and beauty of that city he hasn't seen in years. After their introduction, Pepe can only think of the elegant young land with the twinkling diamonds, and he neglects his gypsy girlfriend Inez. Her constant jealousy pushes the story into darker territory.Certainly distant cousins of the fatalistic American film noir, it's also a perfect example of the movement now called "Poetic Realism", in the same category as Le Jour Se Leve or La Grand Illusion. Jean Gabin does an excellent job as the dour and trapped Pepe, but then again, he's always excellent. The film drags here in there, caught up on its story points, but the lush visuals are usually enough to keep the viewer's attention. May not be appreciated with one viewing! I already want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK - NOT Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pépé le Moko is a good picture, all right, but it is certainly not a great one, primarily because the story is told without much tension or credibility. How is Pépé characterized as a 'gangster?' He is a small timer. His cronies are just oddballs without much impact in the movie. None of these guys seem to have anything to do. Pépé is kind of a wimp, I'm afraid, whose suspicious indecision is fatal. The 'beauty' from Paris is not very attractive. However, she has some nice jewelry which the small time hood (Pépé) covets. There was no 'magic' between Pépé and Gaby (the 'beauty'). Sparkless. I enjoyed the pacing of the picture and Jean Gabin's valiant attempt to make Pépé as interesting as possible. I'm not sure he had much to work with. It's too bad Marcel Dalio had such a small role...he worked so well with Gabin in "The Grand Illusion."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have a sort of "secret society" of film, TV and design people that meets every other week to watch under-appreciated films here in the Hollywood Hills. We just screened "Pepe Le Moko" last week and everyone was floored ... this is a masterpiece of the French gangster genre and it's effect on other films, most notably "Casablanca' which came out just five years later, is major. I loved the claustrophobic staging within the Casbah and Gabin's bad-ass attitude. This one's a classic.</fullReview>

They had obviously restored some scenes and leaving us with the original voices and subtitles. This is so much better.But still it is a nice movie. Especially the Kasbah was great, having been in Algiers some years ago, I can tell. Must have been an even greater experience in the 30s. Jean Gabin was great. He is better known for his roles as an aged guy like the two "Maigret" movies, "Le chat" alongside Simone Signoret etc. Nice movie. Left an impression. 8/10 Macaulay J. Connor</fullReview>
