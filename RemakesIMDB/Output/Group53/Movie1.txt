		<shortDescription>AMAZING PREDICTION OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Laughlin has an uncanny ability to predict future events. His movie BILLY JACK foretold the way action movies would go (ie. RAMBO, STEVEN SEIGAL, CHUCK NORRIS, etc.) In this particular installment of the Billy Jack Saga,the emphasis is on Washington and the way the special interest groups and power brokers have corrupted our government. It's really a prophetic film, in light of the present day situation on Capitol Hill. There is an eerie fortelling of the Vince Foster espisode.BILLY JACK GOES TO WASHINGTON is a re-make of the Jimmy Stewart classic MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, except using nuclear reactors as the hub of the plot. Tom Laughlin, as the character Billy Jack, really has a chance to prove his acting skills in this one; there is more depth of character in his performance of the lead role. The sets were very intricate and the production values a lot higher than the previous espisodes. Plus, there is an excellent supporting cast: Delores Taylor (Laughlin's real life wife), E G Marsall, Sam Wanamaker, Luci Arnez, and Peter Donat. This is a definat must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting turn of events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film in the late '70s at a preview in Oak Brook, Illinois. The movie was pretty well-received and even I was surprised that Billy Jack was a better fit in the old Jimmy Stewart role than I had expected. It wasn't great, but serviceable, and certainly better than THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK. The film, as mentioned here, was never released, but has come out on DVD. Interested in seeing it again after all these years, I picked it up and was shocked. Normally DVDs have Director's Cut-type things -- more footage, deleted scenes, etc.. In this case Laughlin had cut the crap out of the film. Long scenes that helped the flow of the film and made it less --well, "Billy Jack-ish" had been cut. If Laughlin had used the cut I saw nearly thirty years ago, the film would still have worked. Instead it has become a mess. Come on, Tom, give us the original print.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible Remake of A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say I have always been a Billy Jack fan. I had seen the other movies several times, but never this one until now. The story followed Mr. Smith so closely that you can't help but make comparisons throughout. Tom Laughlin was an adequate actor, he and his wife were always the best actors in any of the other movies. But he is no Jimmy Stewart. And even the addition of other skilled actors (Pat O'Brien and E.G. Marshall most notably) could not save this movie. Add some sloppy editing and this movie was at times painful to watch. If you want to enjoy this story line, get Mr Smith goes to Washington. If you want to see a good Billy Jack movie get, The Trial of Billy Jack. But stay away from this trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good, but nearly as terrible as I'd assumed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did I just wake up on some bizarro world?! How else could you explain anyone giving this film a 10 or even scores of 9 and 8? Other than to provide unintended laughs, I just can't see the Billy Jack films as capable of earning anything close to these very respectable scores--even this one, which is probably the best in the series.This film starts on a very, very poor note. Instead of storytelling, there is a long exposition by Pat O'Brien as he explains much of the setting for the film--and it's way too much! This long diatribe about the evils of nuclear weapons and nuclear power just seemed like sloppy film making-- like a political speech instead of a proper prologue. In addition, why not have the characters talk about this in the film itself? Having this prologue just seemed like they forgot to film these scenes and instead chose to sum it all up this way!As for the rest of the film, it sure showed a lot of hubris for director/actor Tom Laughlin to consider remaking the Jimmy Stewart-Frank Capra classic film (currently #101 on IMDb's top 250). In this version, however, instead of appointing Jefferson Smith to the Senate (a beloved icon of children across America), the powers that be decide to appoint a man with a long history of manslaughter and possibly justifiable homicides!! I certainly remember Mr. Jack dispensing a lot of mayhem in his previous films THE BORN LOSERS, BILLY JACK and THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK! Apparently the grafters do not remember nor do they read the newspapers, and so they decided to appoint an ex-con who is famous for fighting "the man". That sure makes sense!! What's next--appointing a member of the Manson family or a rabid dog or a tomato?! What was likable about this silly film? Well, it was finally nice to see Delores Taylor (Laughlin's wife and co-star in the Jack films) stop being the perennial victim. Finally, after three films, Billy apparently finally taught her martial arts and she, as well as Billy, deliver some well-earned butt-kickings in one scene! This actually was well done and helped the film tremendously. Also, while the film stuck VERY close to the original material (too close if you ask me), the basic story, no matter how bastardized, is still very good--so good that Laughlin couldn't help produce a reasonably entertaining film--provided you turn off your brain and don't think too much about putting Billy Jack in this locale. Plus you gotta admit that Laughlin sure seemed sincere--and infused the film with some nice energy late in the film--and not in the form of butt-kickings (I half expected him to do this on the Senate floor)! This section of the film was, at times, too intense, but at least it was NOT an exact copy of Jimmy Stewart.However, despite some good intentions, the premise of Billy Jack taking on and winning against the evil special interest groups is silly--and also way too idealistic--and probably will result in a few laughs. While not a terrible film, it pales in comparison to the Capra film and occasionally sinks into ridiculousness. Apparently audiences felt pretty much the way I did, as this film never even made it past preview audiences and so it never received a normal theatrical release--though the film was definitely better than THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK (which made "The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time" book). Luckily for lovers of the bizarre and bad films (like me), BILLY JACK GOES TO WASHINGTON was finally released on DVD some time back.By the way, because the film was never released until recently, this might explain the poorly executed edits and choppy transitions. Too often, scenes VERY abruptly change and the cuts just aren't made well. In addition, the sound track was too loud and too often dominated the film. Otherwise, Laughlin's direction actually was a bit better than usual...which still isn't saying all that much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can't Keep A Good Story Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this thinking it was going to be another fun Billy Jack movie (i.e. strong on social message but inarticulate enough and just enough over the top to be a good camp experience). Shortly into watching this I realized I was watching a remake of Mr. Smith Goes To Washington and I immediately fell in line with the story's passion. Thankfully, this film knows where its passion lies, because it stayed clear of the romantic angle between Mr. Smith and his aide. It does throw in a scene for those who want to see BJ literally kick ass but that could have and should have been left on the cutting room floor. Obviously fans of kick ass movies are going to feel cheated that they rented a talky, socially conscious movie with only one fight scene. And fans of movies with a social conscience are going to cringe at a scene that looks like it was lifted from Mannix (BJ looks cool doing his fight stuff on the reservation, but against big city thugs? Uh?). The film does still work as camp for all of its 70s appeal. But it has another appeal that is sadly still relevant today. The media IS almost entirely owned by conglomerates, campaigns cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and there is now a brand of corruption that even BJ could never have foreseen: voting machines with no record of accountability. Democracy is definitely in its last vestiges. We do have CSPAN to record filibusters today, but we have no Mr. Smiths or Mr. Jacks with the ability to make it to the senate in the first place. One can however feel rejuvenated by the "We The People" message the film conveys and be glad that there are films like this and 'Mr. Smith' that have recorded these sentiments for posterity. The film is pretty hokey in its genre modus operandi, but its values make it an American classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of the 1939 Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only differences between this film and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington are to update it from 1939 to 1977 and to fit it into the context of the Billy Jack character. Even some of the names are the same. Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of Mr. Smith is a classic. This remake doesn't come close to living up to the original. If you're a Billy Jack fan it's worth a watch. If you're not a Billy Jack fan watch Jimmy Stewart in the original instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>watch the billy jack "franchise" crash and burn....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... which assumes there was a franchise to start with. Arguably, there was. In 1967, Laughlin produced Born Losers a film so obscure, even at the time, that if you wanted to see you had to -- not making this up -- find the nearest drive-in, and even at that date the drive-in was starting to fade into history. This was followed by his hit Billy Jack (sic) where the iconic tale of the soft-spoken ex-Vietnam vet who espouses peace, BUT WHOSE FEET BECOME DEADLY WEAPONS WHEN HIS SHOES ARE OFF, really caught fire. Actors? What actors? Laughlin cast his wife in the main supporting role (a performance so subdued that critics, who did not know the lady, could not tell if she was acting or simply running lines) and grabbed warm bodies off the street (so it seemed) for every other part. (Nonetheless the one scene in Billy Jack where Laughlin points to the bully's face and tells precisely where he is about to kick him, and how nothing can stop it, will live on in film history, it's brilliant). The success of BJ led to The Trial of Billy Jack which to be fair was at least as good as the preceding film, though not much better. Then Laughlin, never comfy in the role of producer or deal maker, disappeared amid rumours that he was having trouble getting financing for Billy Jack Goes to Washington. Six years after BJ, this film appeared and then promptly disappeared. It never saw a proper theatrical release but is available on DVD. The word terrible is not appropriate. You need to develop an entirely new adjective, perhaps a cross between terrible and wretched, to describe this film. The charming amateur acting so obvious in the first three is completely inappropriate in a film that is demonstrating the hubris of remaking a Jimmy Stewart role. The "bad guys" over-act and chew up the furniture, but only those tables and chairs which the "good guys" have not already gnawed on. There is an EXTREMELY MISGUIDED attempt to insert into the film the trademark "Billy Jack" brand of violence. But this takes place deep into the film, and thankfully most viewers are asleep or in a coma by this point, and are spared the horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Skipping through the sat channels the other night I stumbled across this movie and thought I might give it a look. Having seen the original Billy Jack a few years back I figured it might be worth a few laughs if it was anything like the original. To my surprise it was much better then the first film. It had some decent scripting and Laughlin is not that bad an actor, especially when working with a seasoned veteran like E.G. Marshall. Despite a somewhat contrived plot the movie did get it's point across showing the corruption in Washington and how one man can make a difference. The movie is no Mr. Smith goes to Washington, but then Laughlin is no Jimmy Stewart and for that matter Jimmy is no Billy Jack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The Best Of The Billy Jack Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was fourth and last of the Billy Jack Era however, this picture never made it to the theaters for any length of time. This picture was shown in Los Angeles as a sneak preview on April 16 1977. The next night the picture was again a sneak peak at the Admiral Theatre in Omaha Nebraska. Tom Laughlin resumes his role as Billy Jack and Delores Taylor resumes her role as Jean Roberts. While sitting in prison from the third film a Senator suddenly dies which leaves an open spot in the Senate. After the Senator death, it's revealed that he was conducting an investigation into the nuclear power industry, the remaining senator and the state governor must decide on a person who will play along with their shady deals and not cause any problems. Therefore, they decide to get Billy out of prison and give him the vacant sit. They figure by giving Billy the seat he won't give them enough trouble because he won't no anything. Billy is pardoned, released and nominated, after which he begins his duties. He soon notices that things aren't right, and starts trying to find out just what are going on. I didn't know this until I saw it in a magazine. Tom Laughlin and Delores Taylor were married. At the end of the movie, the couple kept the mailbags that were use in the Senate part of the shooting. The couple uses them on ski trips for there skis and equipment. The bags were confiscated by airport officials when they protested that the bags were property of the U.S. Mail. When this film was being shot, the Senate Scene had to be recreated because the film crew was denied asset to the real Senate Chamber. As filming progressed, Laughlin found it increasingly difficult to film in Washington, D.C. They were wrongly accused of desecrating gravesites in Arlington Cemetery. Even though it was the last of the four films, it wasn't the best. I will give this film 7 weasel stars an also will say the second and the third films were the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confronting the Corporate Socialists...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title clearly suggests, BILLY JACK GOES TO WASHINGTON is a remake of the Jimmy Stewart film- only with a bit more kick... The prostitution of the Constitution is beautifully summed up at one point when one of the thugs working for one of the politicians who has auctioned off his seat to the highest bidder says, "Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered." Although Laughlin seems a bit TOO laid back in the early scenes, looking like he's about to nod off at a presidential debate, he DOES eventually get to doff his boots and kick some ***. (In an odd little scene near the end of the movie, Dolores Taylor congratulates Billy Jack for not "taking his boots off" during the course of events. It's an odd observation because not only does HE take off his boots to kick some ***, but SHE does, too- literally.) The message Laughlin's trying to get across- about the built-in uncertainties of using nuclear power- are still valid today (look at GE's Fukushima meltdown, if nothing else). Billy Jack has always been the Patron Saint of Lost Causes, which is one of the things that makes the character so enduring: we're ALWAYS going to be at the mercy of the 1%; but at least Laughlin stood up and said something that most of the spineless cowards in Hollywood wouldn't DARE. As for the movie, Billy Jack does his on-the-level best, but Bernie Sanders (or Jimmy Stewart) he ain't: he literally collapses during his filibuster and has to be rushed to the hospital (where it's touch-and-go for a while). Laughlin's Passion Play still resonates, and his AIM was always right on target. Greg Palast would've been proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting period piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Washington, D.C. native who saw this film when it was first released (and, contrary to some other comments, it WAS released in DC, playing in several area theaters), I was interested to see how Laughlin would portray the city and its political institutions. Surprisingly, he did so very well. The debt to Jimmy Stewart is obvious throughout but, having said this, his film reflected the political temper of the city in the late 1960's-early 1970's very well indeed. The dialog was not brilliant or sparkling, but there were some good lines: "Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered," is one I remember, referring to bribes and corruption. No matter what one's political views are, this is a film that can be viewed as escapist entertainment and, now from a vantage of several decades, with some nostalgia as well. Worth a rental, definitely, and better if seen with someone who lived through the era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Billy Jack Franchise Pursues the Wrong Idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember, as a kid, running into a bit of advance promotion on "Billy Jack Goes to Washington" in one of my teen magazines and readying myself for its release. It never came to my town, though it did surface elsewhere and quickly died; for myself, I would have to wait something like 23 years to see it, and then on a gray market VHS video version which did contain the complete film. It is an almost fully literal remake of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" made in full cooperation with Frank Capra, with Laughlin in his Billy Jack character taking the place of James Stewart. The budget on this project was miserly compared to what was needed, and it consists mainly of long and medium distance master shots in long takes; it isn't visually very interesting and cannot help but be boring. The excellent cast plays the property professionally, but invariably the piece comes off like a sub-TV Movie of the Week affair, and way too long. I haven't seen the re-edited version for DVD, but I would think that reducing the film's length would reduce comprehension of the story as well. Nevertheless, it is to be preferred over the bathetic and ridiculous "The Trial of Billy Jack," which can be seen as reflecting the screeching halt of the 60s counterculture; "Billy Jack Goes to Washington" may likewise reflect their attempt as reintegration into the system, but that's a bit of a stretch. The 70s were not the 30s; with the Watergate matter, Americans -- for the first time -- tasted widespread contempt of the full U.S. government including the executive branch. The Laughlins failed to take advantage of that, retelling the 1930s tale as it was, with little embellishment or updating. The Billy Jack character was a significant cultural component to the era in which he thrived; it's a shame that, past a certain point, the Laughlins were unable to find the right venue for Billy Jack to continue in, having lost sight of his pioneering martial arts appeal and his roots in the Western. If they needed to remake a classic, it should have been something like "The Tin Star."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film Billy Jack is appointed a Senator, and despite all that we've seen in the past films where he raves against the Government, he goes to Washington and discovers that politicians are crooked.(?????) There is only one real action scene where Jean is being accosted by some knife wielding black dudes and Billy shows up just in time to kick the crap out of them. Apparently Jean has had a miraculous recovery from her gunshot wounds in the previous film as she also removes her boots and helps by leaping through the air to land a wicked kick to one of her aggressors. Billy does do a lot of yelling in the Senate chambers, and finally passes out to the relief of the viewer, me. There are some notable actors in here: Sam Wanamaker, E.G. Marshal, and Luci Anaz; but even they can't save this film. All four of the Billy Jack films, the first two very good, seem to have a disjointed story line. It was as if Tom Laughlin couldn't keep it all straight. Too bad as there was a lot of potential in this film that was never realized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankfully, This Is The Last Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laughlin was a man who's success granted him the ability to continue forward. It doesn't appear to be that way, and now he's gone off into the limbo of obscurity - I will have to agree that this may have been the film to end Billy Jack entirely. I will have to say we should be thankful. The series as a whole might as well have just been the hippie man's version of what would be this generation's "Left Behind" films with Kirk Cameron... strange, silly, force-fed, and filled with unrealistic portrayals of the people we know and share this world with.The third film in the Billy Jack trilogy is, as you may have guessed it, a remake - if one could so be inclined to call it that - of the Jimmy Stewart film 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'. the catch of course, is that our barefoot soldier of peace is in the place of Mr. Smith. Surprisingly, he actually has his shoes on this time and does very little of 'boots-to-faces' than the previous films; rather, he decides to let his speeches do the butt-kicking.I don't consider this film a remake of a classic and more like one man's quest to take a classic and spin it 'his' way. If the fates had their way we might've gotten something from John Denver, but sadly Laughlin won the bid to take the directorial bid to make this film and it shows. I think the only generous compliment I can really give is that he at least tried to give me, the viewer, a decent adaptation of Washington and the Senate at best. Stuff like that is hard to pull without the right amount of people and the permission to do so, but I learned that since he did not have that, he does an admirable effort to recreate it all.Unfortunately that's really all I can say that is kind about this film. This is, of course, coming from someone who noticed that a considerable bulk of the reviews for this film absolutely -do not- discuss the film... and instead litter their reviews about how Laughlin was a "prophet", that "he can see the future" about "communist" and "socialist" America. Given that this is a movie review site and critical analysis, even if one is just the casual observer, should reviews like that even be allowed? Are we watching the same movie? The cast only changes slightly from before in that his wife (her acting has not improved), and Lucille Ball's daughter Lucy is probably the only one of note who stands out (granted that she will forever be in her mother's shadow). I can only imagine how, in a different world, we might've been able to get an Oscar-award winner out of John Denver's possible version... instead, that did not come to be, and we have this obscure directorial mess.As in my previous review, I don't think I had to have been born in the 60's and 70's to have 'understood' this film. Those decades were a time of confusion and soul-searching, dangerous habits and questionable decisions, of which sadly 'Billy Jack' falls prey into. Rather than give us insight it makes accusations that hardly seem believable, if at all, with facts twisted around to stress a point that makes little to no sense. Perhaps if the generation spent less time 'tripping out' and flying "high", this could've been the better of the trilogy... but I'd hardly call this one a 'Return of the Jedi'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Laughlin returned once again as both director and star of this film, both the fourth(and last) Billy Jack film, and a remake of "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington". After one of his state senator's dies, Billy is chosen by the governor and surviving other Senator(played by E.G. Marshall) to replace him(!) For some reason, they think fiercely independent Billy will follow the party line(huh?) while attracting younger voters(Perhaps!) Of course, as soon as Billy gets wind of the political corruption in his state, he goes into Martial Arts fighting, then filibustering mode... Well-intentioned but misguided film tries to shoehorn Billy into Jimmy Stewart's Mr. Smith role(and costar Delores Taylor as Jean, his adviser of sorts). Even updated, this falls flat. Barely released, though there was a planned fifth and final film in this series that was never finished, which is a pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Former convicted criminal from the first Billy Jack movie and focal point of a riot where a few dozen people were killed now gets an appointment to the US Senate via Governor Richard Gauthier. Only in the movies.Tom Laughlin felt that Jimmy Stewart's character of Jefferson Smith was a proper vehicle for the expression of his ideas and so Billy Jack Goes To Washington was born. The 30s classic is given a reworking and Jefferson Smith's national boys camp is now coed and to be modeled on the Indian reservation school where Delores Taylor mentored the kids. But now instead of a dam, a nuclear power plant is to be built and in Washington style the appropriation is once again hidden in a bill. And if you've seen Mr. Smith Goes To Washington you know pretty much what happens here. Whole chunks of dialog from the original is lifted into this film.Another idea that had me reeling though was included, that being a national initiative that the young folks who Billy Jack is an icon want. An idea from our country's Progressive Era unearthed and better that it should have stayed buried. This film itself gives all the arguments against it, low voter turnout, special interests getting the best media campaign money can buy from Madison Avenue. George W. Bush would have grooved on a national referendum on same sex marriage for instance during the 2004 presidential campaign. In fact I'm willing to bet that Laughlin and Taylor are rethinking that one today. Billy Jack Goes To Washington is a bad idea of misplaced populism.</fullReview>

I had to force myself to watch all of the movie as the terrible acting became humorous the more I watched it. I can't believe the owners of "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington" let such a bunch of amateurs do a remake of such a great movie that had professional/talented actors. I should have known how bad the movie was going to be as I thought the original "Billy Jack" movie was also terrible due to the amateur acting.

		<fullReview>Billy Jack Goes to Washington (1977) was the last film in the Billy Jackseries. Unlike the other films where the political posturing was kept in check, Tom Laughlin goes full tilt boogie into the subject. In this virtual remake of the classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Billy Jack isappointed the vacant senatorial seat after receiving a full pardon from theGovernor. Why did they give this man a political platform I'll never know. But they did and he tries to do his best to let the whole nation know thathe's the last and only honest man in Washington D.C.Why do we watch Billy Jack movies. Most of you will answer because hekicks butt and takes names. But the latter films focus more on his "acting" and the metaphysical being of one's self. If you watch Billy Jack for thesereasons raise your hand. That's what I thought.For die-hard Billy Jack fans, others beware!Recommended.</fullReview>
