		<fullReview>James Stewart and Frank Capra. One needn't know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film. Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a na?ve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft. Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies. He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony, but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) millions. When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington, he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children's camp. When he tries to stop the project, Taylor's political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft. This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate, where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.This film is wonderful in so many ways. The story is a classic struggle between good and evil. In typical Capra style, the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. If there is one clear message in Capra's films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope. He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity, and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds. I was dismayed to see a comment, obviously from a young viewer of this film, that said that the characters weren't realistic because no one used profanity. This is a sad testimonial to our culture, when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule. Stewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington, with its monuments and history. The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don't compromise their principles to hold on to power. Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.Jean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics, but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smith's noble homespun philosophies. Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator, who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency. He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out, and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.This film is a national treasure. It is in my top 50 list of all time. The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today. A 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It works in a way no other movie could, THERE IS PROOF</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I must admit that this is one of my top five favorite films. There is a warmth, idealism, and kinda simple feeling of hope, that makes one believe that things will work out in the end. Capra knew exactly what he wanted, and it shines. Jimmy Stewart, in the role of his life, makes us believe, what we know is almost impossible in todays crass world.Claude Rains is incredible as Senator Smith's evil mentor. Jean Arthur, as his confidant, plays the part so well,that we just want her to save the day.The final scene, where the filibuster is taking place, is among the greatest ever made.BUT THE PROOF, YOU ASK?In the early 80s, I showed this film, over three days, to a group of 15 year old inner city teenagers. I taught Political Science in a very difficult school in Chicago. It was a new class, and not all of the "best" students took it.I decided to show this film at the end of the year, just to see how long I could keep the students attention. I didn't expect much. Fifteen is a very tough age to keep any kind of attention span, and it was at the end of the day, 2:30 -3:15 pm. which made things worse. As the film began, there was rustling in the seats, boredom, that famous oh what a waste of time look...Mind you, this is 43 year old film, about a white Senator, in those "old" days, and being shown to a totally Afro-American crowd of 15 year olds, late in the day, (over a three day period, which meant the students would have to wait till the next day to see what was going on. ..By the end of the third day, Capra had worked his magic, and the entire class was spellbound by this film. They were there till the very end, and you could see how much they enjoyed seeing a film, that they wouldn't have looked at in a thousand years..Comments were wonderful. Any film that could accomplish this, more than 40 years after its conception, to a crowd that one would believe would have no interest deserves to be truly called a "great film."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Required viewing for anyone elected or appointed for public office.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the beginning of the art form, movies have generally fallen into two categories: the realistic, and the fantastic (fantasy-based). There are some that point out that the films of Frank Capra unduly fall into the latter, that they are completely far-fetched and fastened in their own time, and even invented a pejorative term "Capra-esque" to describe any non-cynical, heartwarming picture that has a message. His great films, like It Happened One Night, It's a Wonderful Life, and of course, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, however, are not fixed in a single era, but all eras, the truest definition of a classic. And considering it was released among true powerhouses in 1939, a year as important to movies as 1998 was to baseball, its ideals, story, and general excellence shine as bright today as it did over 60 years ago.A Senator from an unnamed, middle America state dies and a new one must be appointed by Governor Hubert Hopper, a puppet whose strings are held by newspaper magnate Jim Taylor. They need to find one that would be easily controlled by the now-senior Senator Joseph Paine (played brilliantly by Claude Rains), so a bill allowing a building of a dam near land by the Willett Creek owned by Taylor can pass in the Senate. After his initial choice is rejected by Taylor, and Taylor's handpicked man is shot down by the public, the governor chooses Jefferson Smith, played to perfection by James Stewart, a boy scout leader and local hero who is both wholly idealistic in his patriotism for America but naive and blind to the actual process. After he gets embarrassed by the local print media, Mr. Smith begins to learn the harsh realities of DC. Paine, Smith's boyhood hero, takes him under his wing and suggests that Smith try to create a bill. Smith agrees, and with his assistant, Clarissa Saunders (played by Jean Arthur), they create a bill to create a campground for boys from all over the country to learn about each other and the civic process, much to the initial dissuasion by Saunders. Smith then wants to choose a site near the Willett Creek, the same site where the dam is to be built and when his superiors and true string-pullers find that out, major complications ensue.Although the basic premise is David vs. Goliath, the story is wholly originally and was probably one of the earliest pictures to suggest the government as corrupt. The characters are played excellently by all principal actors, with Mr. Smith you root for whole-heartedly, Mr. Taylor you root against for his sheer arrogance and greed, and Mr. Paine, who you pity as you see a man who lost his initial zest to serve the public and is now a jaded shell of his former self. A great performance was given by Harry Carey, Sr., who plays the Vice President/President of the Senate for comic relief. The lines where completely believable and the parts of Smith's final filibuster that were shown give the most impact. There is a beautifully shot scene with images of the monuments and sights of Washington with several national anthems synchronized as the score. The climax is as tension-packed as drama can get, and while the ending may seem rather sudden, and everything isn't completely or neatly resolved, it works perfectly and ends the movie on a happy note.Obviously, few if any people elected to public office has the moral character, conviction, and general good heartedness of Jefferson Smith, and I doubt whether the government would be better if it was. The movie showed an ideal, a supposed "lost cause" of truth in government. And although it is next to impossible for Capra and the eternal good guy Jimmy Stewart to ever fully change the world of politics with just a motion picture, at least it shows that maybe once in a great while, being the good guy has its definite rewards. If (using the same analogy of the 1998 baseball season) The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind were the Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa of 1939 moviemaking, then this would be like Cal Ripken voluntarily ending his Iron Man Streak, something done with full class and the highest respect in mind, and that elevates an ideal of being the good guy and sticking to your dedication brings the greatest of riches. This picture is flawless in all respects and a true classic, with thought-provoking ideas, wit, a little bit of platonic romance, and an excellent cinematography and score, and deserves the rank as a 10 out of 10. And in giving this rating, either I'm damn right or I'm crazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Want to Get Your View Across? Why Not Filibuster?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The media and those in Washington, D.C. cringed in 1939 when Frank Capra (Oscar-nominated for directing) come out with "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington". Capra, fresh off amazing successes like "Lady for a Day", "It Happened One Night", "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", "Lost Horizon" and "You Can't Take It With You", used his power to slap some bigwigs in the face with a powerful medium---the motion picture. The result was an immediate backlash by publications and politicians, but cheers from critics and the audience. As with society, the critics and the masses won out as the movie is a masterpiece in every way. A U.S. Senate vacancy leads to a dilemma. Who should be put in office? Everyone believes the apparently naive and gullible James Stewart (Oscar-nominated) is the logical choice because he will be easy to manipulate and he won't rock the boat. Stewart, the leader of the Boy Rangers (a local camp association for youngsters), gets blind-sided by many high-ranking officials who have alterior motives (Oscar nominees Harry Carey and Claude Rains in particular) when his idea for a national boys' camp goes by the wayside. Thus the only thing left for Stewart is to beat those in charge by beating them at their own game---creating a filibuster (a never-ending governmental argument for his cause). Stewart is solid as always here and the supporters (love interest/reporter Jean Arthur and drunk newspaper man Thomas Mitchell included with the aforementioned players) are all terrific throughout. The Oscar-winning screenplay is deceptively intelligent and Capra just had the uncanny ability to mix comedy, drama and interpersonal characterizations together to make consistently wonderful American film experiences. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a wonderful film about a man Jeff Smith (James Stewart) who believes that children are the future and should be able to enjoy the outdoors, while taking in knowledge of their great Country. When a senator dies in Smith's state, the governor is forced into an awkward position of electing the new senator. While the governor is sitting down to dinner, his young children propose the idea of Jeff Smith who is head of the Boy Rangers and prints a weekly newspaper for the local children. Mr. Smith is elected into office in the funniest way, a coin toss. When Mr. Smith arrives in Washington with his colleague Mr. Pain, (Claude Rains) he is amazed by all the greatness that Washington possesses. After being sworn into the Senate Mr. Smith comes up with idea to propose a Bill that would let boys come together and enjoy the wilderness, and the perfect spot would be in his home town next to a creek. What he doesn't know is that his colleague Mr. Pain has his own plans with that same land. The film then releases the full fury of what corrupt politicians can do to a truthful man.The plot of the film will grab the viewer within the first five minutes and will not let go until the astonishing end. Even though this type of thing is implausible it's still very funny and unique in its own way.The acting was superb! James Stewart will always represent the good guy trying to make his way through life in an honorable way. Claude Rains character was perfect for him, a good man gone bad by the power of politics. Jean Arthur's character was something that isn't normally seen in the movies. She played an ambitious woman trying to get to the top without anyone's help, but is still the great old fashioned woman she was born to be. James Stewart and Jean Arthur were very charismatic together. There could not have been a better pair. The lighting in the film was great in two scenes when Mr. Smith is at the Washington memorial the light shines on sentences of the constitution that added a lot to the emotion of the character and helped set the tone for the scene. This is a classic film that should be recognized and cherished forever. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a great film for the whole family, the film is not only captivating and genuine but there is also a moral in the story. Definitely a ten out of ten, and should be part of your home video library. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra &amp; Stewart Make It Work Very Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra and James Stewart were nearly unsurpassed at the task of taking the kind of story that is optimistic but that borders on being trite, and making it into a satisfying, worthwhile movie. In "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington", they accomplish this with a little help from Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, and Edward Arnold. It's not quite on the level of "It's a Wonderful Life", but it is as good as almost anything else of its kind.Stewart's performance is important right from the beginning - hardly anyone else could have been believable as the earnest unknown who suddenly becomes an important political figure. Even his wide-eyed appreciation for what he sees in Washington comes across believably. As the story gets more complicated and his character is developed further, Stewart is even better.The secondary characters are also important, because the story itself is a rather stylized, though still worthwhile, statement about politics. The characters are more believable than are many of the plot developments. Rains contributes a lot as Stewart's troubled colleague, and Jean Arthur is a natural for this kind of role. Arnold plays his devious character well. Capra holds it all together with his craftsmanship, keeping the story on track and getting the most out of the situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Smith is as good as it's legend. Sometimes I'm disappointed when a universally acclaimed movie isn't as enjoyable as I thought it would be. But here, that is not the case. James Stewart is deservedly remembered most for this role. That's saying a lot given his impressive body of work. This is also Frank Capra's signature film along with Mr. Deeds. The idealism of Jefferson Smith might feel a bit anachronisitc today but, and I know this is a cliché, the world could use more people with his values. The supporting cast is also spot on. Jean Arthur plays the same type as she did in Mr. Deeds and Claude Rains is terrific as the mentor who betrays Smith. Strongly recommended, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is awesome! No complaints here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is not as well known of a movie as it should be. It is a very good movie that is very interesting and a very good way to learn how some things involving the Senate work. This reviewer absolutely loved this movie and wishes she could run out and buy it right now. It definitely grabs the audience's attention and keeps it there. While watching this movie, this reviewer was laughing, smiling, getting really, really angry, learning, and even getting a little teary-eyed. How can a movie that brings out all those different emotions in someone not be great, or even spectacular! `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is definitely one of the best movies ever made despite the fact that it is mostly about politics! It's still interesting!While watching this movie, the audience might be thinking that the acting isn't half bad and is actually quite realistic. They would be right too! All of the acting is really very good and it draws the audience in and keeps them in. This movie was so close to not having one single cheesy line or unbelievable acting job that it's really a shame that it did. At the very end of the movie Saunders, played by , stands up from her seat in the balcony and yells `Stop Jeff! Stop!' and then falls to the floor. The line and the way says it is very, very cheesy and something the audience might find themselves laughing at. That line is just about the only time in the entire movie where the acting was lacking. James Stewart was, of course, phenomenal. He is a very good actor and one that should be remembered for a very long time. He's awesome!The only other not so great thing about `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is the ending. It's a happy ending but, well, it just ends. It's an abrupt ending. It ends so abruptly that the audience isn't even expecting it to end when it does. It has one of those endings where the audience knows a bunch of things that will be happening, they just aren't shown happening. This reviewer doesn't really care for those kind, it is much better when you get to see the things carried out. Although the ending could have been better `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is still an awesome movie and the ending doesn't take away from that at all!This movie is so great that every person in the world should be able to see it because it is definitely worth the time it takes to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>drifts in and out of comedy and sincerity with the greatest of ease</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a lot of fun watching Mr. Smith Goes to Washington in a class where the professor noted how this was the sort of film that was of historical importance while not taking itself too seriously. And I think that's the way Frank Capra wanted it, in a sense. Perhaps in the time of 1939 America this film was seen as being of merit to the American Government's due (though according to the trivia, it was denounced at showing corruption and even banned for showing how democracy "works"). But the director is also wanting to make an entertaining movie, of the kind of Hollywood appeal that brings 8-to-80 years olds in attendance. What had me interested throughout, particularly in that climactic, rousing twenty-minute sequence in the Senate with Jimmy Stewart's constant, un-faltering filibuster, is how it really is a patriotic kind of bravura to be shown on the screen. Here is how it SHOULD be done, to an extreme perhaps, in getting things done in government. But at the same time, Capra keeps it entirely watchable with that group of kids up on the balcony, keeping the audience laughing and smiling all the way through the great lines that Stewart says. "Great principles don't get lost once they come to light. They're right here; you just have to see them again!" This is a kind of talent that I'm sure few other filmmakers at the time, or even after, could have pulled off.The rest of the film isn't just Stewart's struggle to be heard as a young, new-in-town senator. It's also a witty, more often than not true look of how government tends to really work as opposed to how it should. Basically, the core of the story is the fish-out-of-water type, where Stewart's Jefferson Smith (one of his better Hollywood performances), leader of the Boy Rangers is called to be the senator of his state. He has a childhood hero in town in the form of a senior senator (Claude Rains, terrific as always). And there's even a woman (Jean Arthur) in the mix that's growing an interest in him, at first dubious. But despite the corruption that is almost thrust upon smith by Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold, as skilled a character actor as could be asked for), Smith fights it all the way to his final filibuster, which includes a reading from the Constitution, in-and-out cheers from the Boy Rangers, and general guffaws from the other senators. In other words, it's really much in that pure spirit of Frank Capra that 'Mr. Smith' is working in, and even at its cheesiest and sometimes most-dated moments, it's a very successful picture for what it wants to do. It's really an equal-opportunity kind of film about people in politics that should be able decades later to appeal to both the hopeful and the cynical, and it works as good as it does a comedy as it does a piece to show in history of film or American government course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra-corn but very watchable with some great performances...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's knack for getting the best out of JAMES STEWART and JEAN ARTHUR is demonstrated here with both stars giving superb performances. Ironically, Stewart would not win the Oscar for this role but was awarded one the following year for a lesser role in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY.As a bumbling, naive senator who is a lamb thrown to the wolves in Washington, D.C., Stewart does a fabulous job--although there are moments when his bumbling awkwardness looks a bit staged. Jean Arthur is a natural for the role of the wise secretary who at first scorns his innocent ways but soon comes to realize he's the real thing.All of the supporting players are excellent--especially CLAUDE RAINS as a mentor to Stewart who finally has a conscience about deceiving him, and Harry Carey (the western actor) as the man with the gavel who soon realizes that Stewart is not to be underestimated. His reaction shots, grinning and sometimes stifling a grin, say more than words. He and Rains both deserved their supporting role nominations.But, as usual in a Capra film, you have to be willing to forgive some obvious plot contrivances or overall schmaltz. The ending (when it finally comes after some excessive length in running time) is rather abrupt as though the director suddenly realized he'd gone overtime on the story. And some of the sentimentality (such as the scene where Arthur joins him at the Lincoln Memorial where she knew she'd find him), is hard to swallow until you remind yourself that--hey, this is Capra-corn. Nevertheless, despite some flaws, it's the kind of comedy-drama about Washington, D.C. that only a director like Capra could make. And the replica of the Senate is amazingly detailed, as are all the interiors which were shot on a soundstage at Columbia. It's also a nice lesson in how the Senate works, how bills have to go through committees, the rules of behavior, filibustering, etc. It will leave you with a warm glow--somewhat like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE in that respect.Summing up: It's Stewart's show all the way. He's at his peak here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit absurd, but still enjoyable and relevant today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," a U.S. senator suddenly passes away, and Mr. Smith is tapped to fill the position. Unbeknownst to the honest, decent Smith, he is intended merely to be a puppet of the powerful forces that already control the state's governor and its other Congressmen. Smith collides head-on with these forces and must fight to save himself and his values from destruction in the public arena."Mr. Smith," directed by Frank Capra, is not meant to be very realistic. The basic plot and characters of Mr. Smith are borderline ridiculous. Smith goes beyond naive, to the point of appearing ignorant and lacking in common sense at times. He seems to have the civics education of a 2nd-grader. Everything in the movie is exaggerated to the extremes.Capra's D.C. is likewise a caricature. The U.S. Senate is a united front of entrenched cronyism. They move as one nonpartisan mass, always supporting each other in their mutual corruption. The media is easily herded into line, an interpretation that probably strikes closer to truth, although that system today has been undermined by the Internet.Still, if the true Washington is not quite as fraudulent as Copra's version, there's no doubt that it is probably perceived that way by many Americans today. The film touches upon real issues that affect modern politics. It's amazing how relevant certain lines and scenes remain after all these years, perhaps more so today.What did bug me about the film was its shamelessly idealistic view of small-town American heroes like Mr. Smith. Like a Bruckenheimer movie where Billy boy and Jim Bob from the ranch save the planet, "Mr. Smith" sometimes comes off as a self-congratulatory pat on the back to the common man. It rails against the elitism and special interest of Washington, a popular sentiment today.This might not bother me so much except that this country is just coming off an extended experiment of putting a "commoner" in a government seat of critical importance and things didn't turn out so hot. As nasty, cold, and dirty as it may seem to place a compromising politician into DC, that may be preferable to putting an "oh shucks, well, golly gee, I dunno" kinda guy into a position of major responsibility.This country has a low tolerance for corruption. It has an even lower tolerance of incompetence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Smith learns about politics the hard way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a wonderful film. What an exaggerated, corny, fantastic, beautifully acted, exciting, wonderful film."Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" is a classic for good reason. It reinforces qualities that many of us have lost along the way: idealism, strong, unshakable belief, never quitting, honesty, and commitment. Today, patriotism and "American values" have taken on another connotation. They have become the property of the right wing. But there isn't anything wrong with the kind of patriotism and American values expressed by Jefferson Smith, which are different from what is being expressed today.Is anyone today as idealistic as Mr. Smith was when he first came to Washington? Can one really win against a powerful force like the Taylor machine? As one who was involved in a legal case where the other side had all the clout and all the money, I sadly have to answer that I don't think so. In the real world, as Court TV has taught us, things don't work that way. Is anyone as corrupt as Senator Paine and Jim Taylor? Sadly, I'd have to say probably. Would they ruin anyone who got in their way? Yes. Have they? Definitely."Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" is a fantasy, but it's a fantasy that uplifts us and reminds us of what we could be and, like Jean Arthur says in the film, maybe being jaded isn't such a good idea all the time.James Stewart had the role of a lifetime, and he was perfect. Homespun, intelligent, boyishly good-looking, his career and tremendous popularity even today speak for themselves. His filibuster scenes are incredible, passionate, and strong. We were lucky we had him as long as we did. There will never be another. Jean Arthur was fabulous in her role as a streetwise assistant who finds something to believe in. Claude Rains, as the unlikable, weak Senator Paine, gives a powerful performance. The bad guys - and Capra always makes sure they're real bad - were all great. As for Harry Carey, the sympathetic speaker, you want to hug him. A fantastic job.Frank Capra knew how to make movies. The pace is swift, the story strong, and the scenes tense and exciting. One gets caught up in the world he fashions. A shame it isn't real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Smith-Where are You? Do We Need You Today? ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Stewart was simply magnificent in this memorable classic of a dedicated young politician who is appointed to the senate following the death of his state's senator.. He wants to do what is best for his constituents. He soon learns that in Washington this is not to be the case. Corruption, patronage et al are alive and well and functioning.Edward Arnold, in a supporting role, is fabulous as the old style political boss. The Stewart character represents what we need as leaders to run this great nation of ours. Some real scene stealing is done by Claude Rains as the other state's senator who has become corrupt. His temperament is perfect for the part. His seething by guilt and his denunciation of his fellow senator shows depth in acting. His outburst at the end of the film is totally memorable. He claims that he has compromised to get what he wants. How far from the truth this really is! Jean Arthur, as the secretary in the know, is truly fabulous as well. Newspapers can learn from this film. They should. Censorship still exists in 2006.Remember that great filibuster scene? Stewart acted his heart out. Though he lost the coveted Oscar here, the Academy rewarded him the following year for the comedy "The Philadelphia Story."This film should be a definite pre-requisite for students in political science classes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idealism vs. "the machine"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme of one man being able to combat the ways of a long-established system is not a new one. In fact, man versus machine is one of the oldest forms of conflict in cinema, but this is a different kind of "machine," this "Taylor Machine." When a young, naive, and idealistic man by the name of Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is placed, as a pawn, in the United States Senate, he is honored and humbled by the job set out before him. He sees it as an opportunity to provide a service for his country, and, even more so, his people. In Jefferson Smith, we see everything that is good and wholesome in America. One man who wishes for nothing more than an improvement upon a country that he already cherishes. He intends to do everything he can to fulfill his duty as a newly appointed Senator. However, the people that put him there were not nearly as patriotic in their intentions. Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) and Senator Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains) have conspired to put Smith in office in hopes that he will simply sit there and keep quiet while they pass a bill that will profit Taylor. Smith's dream of building a national boy's camp is shattered by Taylor's scheme to build a dam in the same area. The powerful Jim Taylor is forced to pull some strings in order to discredit the young senator so that his dam can be built. The Taylor Machine frames Smith, accusing him of fraud. Shamed, Smith is ready to leave Washington behind when his assistant, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur) inspires him to fight for his ideals just as his forefathers had. Smith returns to congress, armed with a new strategy to accomplish his goal.James Stewart gives one of his finest performances as Jefferson Smith, the young, passionately patriotic Senator confronting corruption in the government he holds so dear. Jean Arthur's performance as Clarissa Saunders is strong, while Claude Rains is forced to counter Stewart's inspired intensity (a feat that I feel he accomplishes). The filibuster scene is one of the highlights of the film, and one of the more memorable sequences in American cinema. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a wonderful movie, not just because of James Stewart's relentless performance, but because it has quite a bit to say. It is a statement declaring that ideals are stronger than the pages they are printed on, and that it is our ideals and the spirit through which we see them realized that allows one man to topple "the machine."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Besides a brilliantly written story, and brilliant acting by James Stewart, there is one element of this movie that can't be overlooked: Jean Arthur's acting.With her voice and facial expressions, she pulls you through the storyline. The movie may be about Mr. Smith (Stewart), but much of it is seen through Saunder's (Arthur's) eyes. When she falls in love with Smith, we can't help but do it too.This is Capra's opus, and contains not one, but two of the best acting performances I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Patriotic, stirring, uplifting, absolutely mesmerizing? Here are just a few words that can be used to describe Frank Capra's brilliant 1939 film, 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.' Bringing together a stellar cast of both fresh and seasoned actors, Capra manages to reach into each of our chests, and wrench almost painfully at our heartstrings.Jefferson Smith (James Stewart, 'It's A Wonderful Life'), is a young, enthusiastic patriot who resides in an unnamed American state, but is known throughout it (most especially by the young boys of the region) as an unsung hero. Head of the Boy Rangers, Smith has a love of his country and of nature, once quenching a potentially devastating forest fire single-handedly. After the unexpected death of a current Senator, Governor Hubert Hopper (Guy Kibbee) is forced to choose a replacement. Whilst his corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), urges him to appoint a handpicked stooge, Hopper surprisingly decides to follow the confident advice of his own children, awarding the job to Smith.Smith arrives in Washington, excited and idealistic, no doubt modestly considering himself to be unsuitable for such a prestigious position. He is proud to accompany the other current state Senator, Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains, 'Notorious'), a highly-esteemed man who was once great friends with Smith's father. Unbeknownst to Smith, however, Paine had long ago abandoned his political ideals, seduced by the promise of power and political longevity to make "certain compromises." Whilst Smith works tirelessly to submit a bill regarding the creation of a national boy's camp at Willet Creek, which he hopes will teach a new generation the value of freedom and liberty, the devious Paine schemes to dam that same locality, an act that will serve nobody but the power-hungry Jim Taylor. When Paine's cynical secretary, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), informs Smith of these plans, he determinedly attempts to speak his mind, only to be quashed by the almighty "Taylor Machine."Frank Capra, who had previously supplied Columbia Pictures Corporation with two Academy Award Best Picture winners ('It Happened One Night,' 1934 and 'You Can't Take It With You,' 1938), once again proved his undeniable genius, something he would continue to do throughout his film-making career. One often-cited example involves the romantically-awkward Smith's second encounter with Paine's beautiful daughter, Susan (Astrid Allwyn). Rather than focusing on faces, as would be the typical style for such a scene, Capra keeps the camera firmly on Smith's hat, as he restlessly shuffles it between his fingers, frequently dropping it to the floor and stooping to reclaim it. This shot tells us more about Smith than any facial close-up ever could!Finally, James Stewart is unquestionably brilliant as the young, idealistic Smith, in one of his first critically recognised roles. The look of absolute awe and wonderment on his face upon first witnessing the Capitol Dome appears truly genuine, despite the fact that Stewart was merely acting against a projection. For his highly memorable filibuster speech at the climax of the film, Stewart dried out his throat with bicarbonate of soda to make himself sound hoarse, an act that could potentially have destroyed his later ability to speak. As we witness Jefferson Smith, ragged and exhausted, determinedly continuing to shout hoarsely at the Senate members, we immediately understand that his voice is reaching much, much further. He is not just shouting at the Senate, but he is shouting at the people; he is shouting at his country; he is shouting at us. And we are right there alongside him, quietly urging him along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. (may be spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that I just saw this movie very recently and approached it as a typical teenager would in this day and age. But I forgot how much I love Jimmy Stewart in "It's a Wonderful Life" (one of my all time favorites) and how much I love Frank Capra. Well, obviously I ended up falling in love with this movie, too. Of course, it's not a typical movie like we'd see in theaters today. I'm not sure why people rate it based on that. Old movies should be treated with more respect! They didn't have the technology that we did now, and the most advance things they could do were corny montages. :) Really, I found a lot of things funny in this movie that shouldn't have been. (but I tend to laugh more than anything; life is just better that way) The boys in the entire movie were hilarious. They were just...so strange. And for some reason, it was okay for angry politicians to ram their huge truck into the boys' car. And it was okay for Jimmy-boy to run around the streets punching people. But in the end, I believe those parts made the movie more enjoyable!The music, the acting, the directing..it was all top notch in my opinion. Well, the music was a bit too patriotic at times, but that was very appropriate. Jean Arthur was very cute and played her role quite well. And, for some reason, I fell in love with Claude Rains voice..which means I fell in love with his character. I had to convince myself that there was some good in him, and I was right. The story was just fine. (a lot better than a lot of movies around today! oy!) We went over the corniness...and the plot may have been a bit predictable, but I really wanted it to end well. Good needs to defeat evil in the end. And sure, the ending may seem a bit abrupt, but what can they say after that? All is well! A very good movie. I'd recommend it to ANYONE..you might just be surprised. (hey, can you believe it? I really hate history and I enjoyed this movie!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without question James Stewart's finest performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big lover of all things Capra, especially from the thirties, when his story-lines tended to be on the side of the underdog fighting desperately in David and Goliath situations.With a plot that runs parallel to Mr Deeds Goes To Town we are once again faced with a decent, upstanding human being being placed in a fish out of water situation and coming to terms with the fact that the new world he is surrounded by is corrupt and rotten to the core.In this instance it is the U.S. Senate which seems to house it's share of rotten apples and James Stewart's role as Senator Jefferson Smith is to take on the politically corrupt machine and destroy it.With the help of his secretary, Saunders played by the wonderfully attractive and heart meltingly gorgeous Jean Arther, they set about using the American political system in the good way it was intended in the same way the kingpins had been using it for their own ends.Even though I am not American myself, the patriotic message this film delivers still touches me and I can say without reservation that should I have had the American flag with me when I first saw this film, I would have been waving it higher and with more vigour than anyone else. I am proud to be an Englishman but with films around like this promoting all the great things about the U.S.A and the freedom it represents, I suppose a Yank would have been my next choice.Claude Rains is wonderful (again) as the corrupt but guilt ridden Senator Joseph Paine, who, in order to protect the political machine from which he benefits, is forced to denounce Smith as a crook, destroying our hero's morale. After all Senator Paine was like a father figure to the young patriot and was the closest friend of his late father.One of my favourite parts of the film are the scenes featuring the great Harry Carey as the senate President, who despite his obvious job criteria of staying neutral, seems to encourage and favour Smith at every opportunity. At the end of the movie when Senator Smith is faced with almost certain defeat, the encouraging smile given by Carey is for me the most tear inducing moment in the film.An all round feel-good movie, which leaves us all safe and happy in the knowledge that there is always someone decent enough to take up the sword against evil, and who is prepared to fight to the very extremes of their endurance to see that good will prevail.Makes us wish there were more Senator Smith's in the world today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pride and disgust in a cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSIt's hard to really talk about this film without sentiment getting in the way. Nowadays far too many films are time based. If it's old we like it because it's a "classic" and if it's new we like it because it's recent and a "modern classic". So when I first put this on, I admit I wasn't expecting too much. People had raved about it and said how good it was, but ultimately I had this strong feeling it would be over-rated and adored simply for being old. How wrong I was.In "Mr Smith Goes To Washington", Jimmy Stewart puts in one of the most amazing acting performances you are likely to ever see. People rave about him in Capra's other masterpiece ("It's A Wonderful Life"), but in that film he is nothing compared to the performance he provides in this one. Stewart plays Jefferson Smith, naive country boy who comes to Washington with an ideology of a democratic system of liberty and freedom where every man would look out for each other. Instead he faces a corrupt Government in which his ideology falls flat.This film moved me, which I confess isn't hard for any truly good film to do, but it moved me in a way different to usual. "Mr Smith Goes To Washington" brought intense sweating as it played out, it brought nerves, it felt desperation for Jimmy Stewart to succeed, it even brought a sense of pride. I'm not American, I never have been, and it's very rare for me to even consider wanting to visit the place, yet alone be American. This film made me passionate about America though. As I watched this film, past the slightly slow start, and through to the tense finale, I found myself feeling a sense of Pride in the American Institution of Freedom. It made me want to stand up, shout hooray for America and sing the Star Spangled Banner. Not many films can do this, especially not to me. It's weird since for a film so built on Liberty, it feels almost two years too early. At the time this film was released most of Europe was entering the Second World War, but America wasn't involved yet. This film was (and is) wonderful propaganda for America and if Capra planned it as such, did he know America would enter the war?In my summary, I commented that I also felt disgust in this movie. It's not hard to see why when you watch really. As well as the previously mentioned intense pride, the corruption of the Government and the obsession with a few men earning money brings disgust. It hits home especially since events in the world over recent years imply that nothing has changed. I hope this isn't true. I hope that we truly do have liberty and freedom in the Western world, somehow though, this would feel naive."Mr Smith Goes To Washington" is a cinematic masterpiece. Jimmy Stewart is breathtaking, as are his supporting cast (Harry Carey in particular appeals) and with Frank Capra behind the camera, you know your into a treat. If you watch one film in the year, ignore any modern Blockbusters, watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American culture at its purest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic piece of American popular culture, flawlessly made, one that pushes all the right emotional buttons at the right moment without being manipulative. Jimmy Stewart's innocence and idealism are not portrayed as something unusual or freakish for us to stare at, but as the natural condition of every American not warped and twisted by greed and love of power. In that sense, the hero is entirely at home in the movie, though an outsider in Washington; we feel that through Jefferson Smith, we are experiencing the real America. Stewart is wonderful from starry-eyed beginning to exhausted, verge-of-a-breakdown end; he is a hero we can whole-heartedly cheer for. Claude Rains is superb as the fallen "silver knight" Joe Paine; it is clear throughout that we are looking at the ruins of a great man, and we share his humiliation when we see him in the degrading company of the triumphant press tycoon. Though the ending has been faulted for being too sudden, I find it very powerful.Although I am not an American, I always get choked up during the famous montage section of patriotic historical landmarks that Smith visits on his first day in Washington. The nobility of the images combined with the stirring music produces a very moving experience. This is a wonderful movie, and despite its period enthusiasm, it is not at all sentimental, if one employs the definition of sentimentality as "loving something more than God does". I believe its enthusiasm and zeal are on the side of things like truth, honesty, and goodwill - things that everyone, including God, would join in loving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is no wonder director Frank Capra has inspired the likes of Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese and many other filmmakers who depict everyday hypocrisy in some of their work. MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON oozes with patriotism and idealism, with corruption around the borders. Jimmy Stewart does not "belong" in Washington, but the incredulous "Jefferson Smith" will not accept the limits put on freedom, hence Stewart's greatest performance. This is Capra's most idealistic work, a film he seemed to prepare for the upcoming test the United States would be put to in just two years in World War II. Modern day viewers will no doubt see the dated elements in Capra's presentation of our country's mores. I felt awe and a new sense of patriotism in the montage of images from D.C. that I wish I could still completely believe in. Time has told us we can't. "Jeff Smith" would be crushed in today's political climate, but it is a beautiful thing to see this David and Goliath fight take place in the form of a Senatorial filibuster.Capra's direction is so forward and compelling in showing the once bright-eyed Mr. Smith's realization of what he is up against. Even in the 1930's, there were "political machines" led by mobsters or businessmen. Stewart is the best at showing emotion through his facial gestures. His weepy breakdown in he and Capra's equally brilliant ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE is similar to Mr. Smith's 23 hour filibuster. He is everyman and isn't that who we wish was passing and signing bills in this country? Jean Arthur is sweet as "Saunders", the hard-nosed, yet sympathetic heroine who helps Smith in his plight. You can see immediately when she falls in love with Smith in a wonderfully filmed scene where Smith promotes his ideals for the youth of America. The classical Hollywood close-up is utilized to show her love through happy tears.As in most Capra flicks, the supporting cast is colorful and right to create a slightly comedic and heavily dramatic atmosphere. You can only imagine how the U.S. government viewed this picture back in the day. Capra was a maverick who clearly put country and hope first on his list of artistic priorities. The happenings we see in a film like MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON can only happen in Hollywood films, which is why the system and its classics have endured for so long. Here is a movie that they should show in the "Capital Dome" on a daily basis to the fatcats who sit in office today. "Jefferson Smith" is pure fiction but absolutely possible if only earnestness and honesty were practiced in Washington now. Elements of this great film are all over movies like JFK, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, or BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY. To sound overly enthusiastic, take this movie and hold it up in front of you and take in its important message.RATING: 10 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the most important political movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I could choose one movie, more than any other, which was not only brilliant, but highly significant, it would be this one. We live an an age when cynicism about politics is rife, when people who get involved to change things for the better are more often than not dismissed as naive; this is a film which everyone who is cynical towards politics should see. It doesn't hide the fact that there is corruption in politics, but it does say quite clearly that there is a point and a value to standing up to it.As movie quotes go, Jean Arthur's words to Jeff Smith deserve to be remembered: "Your friend Mr. Lincoln had his Taylors and Paines. So did every other man whoever tried to lift his thought up off the ground. Odds against 'em didn't stop those men. They were fools that way. All the good that ever came into this world came from fools with faith like that." This is a movie which can teach a very valuable lesson, particularly those who despair of modern politics. There is a way forward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Critics and box office success. Why do I have a problem?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's fans give Capra high marks for his film making. He was a great Director. But Capra's detractors said he was known for his "corn" rather than art. If truth is art, then Capra fails, not to entertain, but as a truth teller. Capra is one of the first "message" directors. In this movie, he goes against the Washington establishment, political hacks and powers behind the throne. The sad fact is that nothing has changed because human nature has not changed. Capra creates the Character of Jefferson Smith, played by Jimmy Stewart in an great performance. The supporting cast performs as well under the direction of Capra. Whether Capra or the writers are to blame is not known, but the Smith character is a caricature of a real person. And because he is not real and the story is not reality. If this movie was considered a comedy, so be it, but critics have had 60 plus years to consider this movie as a significant comment on good versus evil. Stewart's character is chosen by a shallow Governor to fill a US Senate seat and his choice is not "the best candidate" for the job. Nothing unbelievable in that, , but Smith's character is stretched beyond belief. To become a US Senator, you must be at least 30 years old. Smith is introduced as someone with the maturity of a 15 year old. With no wife, no girl friend; he acts like a 15 year old when introduced to mature women. Taking a tour of Washington leaving his homing pigeons to the care of others, is also the behavior of an adolescent. Capra wants us to believe that adolescence is synonymous with honesty. It is not. Nor was his striking journalists who portrayed him as a dope.Somehow this idealistic character takes on the corruption of the world in the form of a junior Senator and conquers all. And discovers love and gets the girl in the end. If you like vintage syrup, this movie is right for you. Just remember, its just a movie, and in real life, the bad guys usually win.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern politics have taken it's dream from it but it is still a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the passing of his stooge senator, Senator Paine and his businessman bosses need a new patsy to help get a bill through congress. When their party man is rejected they select the all-American Jefferson Smith, reasoning that he will be too overawed and just do what he is told. At first Smith does just that, but then his plans to build a boy's camp on the site of the dam Paine is pushing through congress, makes him realise that Paine is pushing a bill through for the benefit of Taylor's business. A new boy with high ideals of democracy at this level, Smith takes action, but can he overcome the crooked political system that is controlled by Taylor?Apparently when this was first made it was accused of being anti-American in it's depiction of congressmen as anything except honest, God fearing men of the people. Nowadays it is more likely to be the case that the depiction of only ONE politician as `in bed with business' or `remote from the people' makes it look like a fantasy. But it is a fantasy ? an ode to the American Dream. Smith is an honest lad who is picked for Congress, holds to it's ideals with a childlike wonder and overcomes anything that is `un-American'. As a story it works well in a sappy type of way. For me there was a little too much awe and wonder at the American system but I suppose it comes with the territory. The actual political games are enjoyable if a little simplified, and the final 20-odd minute filibuster is enjoyable despite not quite ending with the punch I was hoping for.Stewart plays his idealistic American boy well and his wide eyed wonder never fails to work. Jean Arthur is good as the `tough city girl won over by his honesty and charm' and her sassy way helps liven some of the duller spells. Rains and Arnold are good in their roles as politician and businessman who bought the vote. The whole cast do well but it is Stewart who sets the tone with his awe and wonder ? good, but maybe could have been toned down a little to reduce the sentimentality that comes up every time he reads the bill of rights.Overall this is a good film. Typical fantasy stuff from Capra but heart warming in a way. It probably suffers little bit because it is hard to accept that politicians are basically good peoples. Where `it's a wonderful life' was uplifting because it was about human nature, this didn't have the same impact because I don't believe that politicians are like Smith in anyway (watching Bush and Blair stampeding through the UN with total disregard for democracy took some of the shine off this movie). Still a good movie though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How politicians don't work for democracy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, the legendary Jimmy Stewart plays the naive, and somewhat gullible Mr. Smith who is invited to become a senator by politicians corrupted by self-seeking businessmen, who they perceive is rife for manipulation. As such Stewart's character is a representation of Joe Public, and how politicians manipulate the average voter's views for political gain and moreover the corrupt businessmen (and women) who want to use their clout to pull strings, which promotes their power, and exacerbates their egos. In order to emphasise this the accomplished director Frank Capra needs to contrive sympathy for the highly emotive issue of 'children's welfare' in the form of a boys' camp, here proposed by Senitor Smith. When this is juxtaposed with hard, and emotionally depleted business profit then there is no contest; the children's welfare comes before corporate gain. Arguably, the methods by which corporate gain is achieved, - in this case via corruption - is diluted by Capra's emotive motive of using children's welfare as a tool by which to direct opinion. Nevertheless, it is corporate gain via corrupt methods which tinges the philosophical ideology of existentialism. To explain further, existentialism is concerned with the idea of 'the self'. In other words placing 'the self' at the centre of the universe. As such, 'the self' becomes empowered. In some circumstances this 'self' has the potential to become a self-seeking force. In this film, that self-seeking force is the businessman who endeavours to gain via unethical means, and corruption becomes associated with existentialism by default. Hence, existentialism becomes a negative force when juxtaposed with the utilitarian idea, which champions that of the greatest good, which is as Senitor. Smith views, written into American values, which he naively permits to lead him without questioning the concept. This value of the 'greatest good' is the driving force of his cause for a boys' camp.But, what will bring more benefit to society actually depends on how one interprets the ideas that are utilitarianism and existentialism, which via opinion, inadvertently contrive ideas of what is ethical and unethical which informs the voter of what is democratically acceptable. To explain further, the business venture is viewed in this film as unethical, and thereby will be unacceptable to the voter. Perhaps the narrative of the film should have balanced the viewers' opinions by explaining that the business venture proposed has the potential to provide employment, and spin-off enterprise for individuals. As such, these individuals would have the potential to prosper further and provide further employment, and so on. Meanwhile, the boys' camp would actually contrive a sense of good, and thus instill into them another person's perception of what is ethical. Is such paternalistic contrivance not just as corrupt in the sense of selfishness and self gain as any businessman (or woman) pulling a politicians strings? Further more, Senitor Smith's paternalism would stifle the individual's freedom of thought. Ironically, such stifling of individual thought along with paternalism is what leaves voters, such as that of Senitor Smith - remember here a representation of the average Joe Public - vulnerable like children, open to manipulation by corrupted politicians.Meanwhile Capra utilises emotions, which he purposefully exacerbates as a means of overcoming the otherwise monotonous bureaucracy at the heart of politics. Without such affectation, Capra would have lost his viewers to sheer boredom. This is especially during the filibuster which Jimmy Stewart performs via the implementation of the sentimentality of an underdog, fighting via the democratic process, corruption within politics on behalf of his fellow citizens. This affectation is juxtaposed by Capra in order to further achieve the portrayal of that of a man pleading for mercy after being assumed to be guilty. For his convincing performance in this as the doggedly determined crusader of justice, then Stewart deserves high praise. Kudos also goes to the great Jean Auther, whose implementation of her thespian skills serves to draw attention to her competent acting ability in the part of Clarrisser Saunders, who coerces Senitor Smith's emotions. The accomplished actor Claud Rains was also effective in his role as the politician corrupted by the unacceptable face of business, which is as already suggested, personified as that of 'selfishness'. Sailing so close to the (political) wind here Capra gives one potential reason for implementation and enforcement of the Hays' Code as a justifiable force of stability within the United States film industry. Retrospectively viewed with cynicism, because it is perceived as constraining democracy within the art of film making, the paternalistic Hays' Code was originally written with ethical intention at the time of its implementation, which was during a period of political instability throughout the world. This instability was further exacerbated by the centralisation of the otherwise fringe politics of the far left and far right highlighted through the emergence of fascism and communism, culminating in illiberal dictators in, among other nations, Italy, Germany and the USSR. Hence, the film's reference to dictators, who ironically are used to promote the satirical point that proponents of illiberal politics are fascinated with Western-style democracy, here undermined by Capra's portrayal of it as an essentially corrupt force. The time of the film's production means that there is allot of political incorrectness. An example includes the idea that boys as opposed to girls are the backbone of a nation. But where would have Mr. Smith been without Clarissa Sauners? Business is also highlighted as white, overtly heterosexual, male, middle age, and middle class. But, the question is, have things changed for the better in a world of political correctness? Well, if not, then political correctness is a mere token gesture to the excluded and disaffected voter.In sum, this is an intelligently directed, brilliantly acted, thought provoking film,and arguably a must see!</fullReview>

This does not happen! This can never happen! This drama is so corny and over-idealist and impractical BS!!". Thats when another part of me interjected, "May be it's supposed to be sentimental rubbish! Yes, this does not happen. But, should this not happen ? Why can't we have Mr. Smiths in the Washington ? Why shouldn't we fight for lost causes ? Why should I reject this as sentimental rubbish ? Is there anything wrong with being idealistic ? Is what Mr. Smith representing wrong ? No. If he is not wrong in his principals, then why should I think of it as rubbish and corny ? Why should I accept that politicians are going to be corrupt ?..." And this is the beauty of this film. It shows its viewer that its not wrong to be honest and try to defend and uphold our ideals. It also shows that, in order to bring reform, one ought to be prepared to fight. Fight against mighty forces, and have faith that justice will prevail. This movie is not meant to be realistic and practical. Its meant to be what it is so that people are inspired by its beautiful and powerful message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important, inspiring, and brilliant film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the golden age of cinema, year 1939, Frank Capra released his political masterpiece "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." Starring James Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Claude Rains, it is a film about a naive young "Boy Ranger" leader (no doubt meant to be a reference to the Boy Scouts of American) with big dreams about American politics, history, and freedom, who is selected by the governor of his state to replace a deceased senator. Expecting a dream come true, he soon finds that he was only selected to be pawn for the powerful and corrupt "Taylor Machine" along with his fellow senator Joseph Paine. Rather than back down and follow orders, he decides to stay true to his ideals and stand up against corrupt politics.This film is a landmark in cinema for several reasons. First of all, it was incredibly important too society. It was often frowned upon at the time because it was one of the first films, if not THE first, to paint a somewhat negative picture of American politicians, but it was also banned in several fascist and communist countries because of it's message of democracy, freedom, and the power of one. It was the last American film to be shown in France before the German occupation and no doubt gave hope to the country that freedom was on its way.It is also a very inspiring film. Many claim that Frank Capra's work is all very unrealistic and corny. Several claim more specifically that in real life this film would not have ended the way it would. I disagree with that, but even so, there's not denying that this film is powerful. By the end of it, you feel very uplifted. It makes you believe in the power of your voice, the power of one man, and the importance of having high ideals.It is also just overall an incredibly well-done film. Some of the transitions are very quick, but that just the time period, filmmakers at that time had yet to experiment with flashy camera work and creative transitions and such. Most definitely what was important about films in the 30's and 40's was the content much less than the camera work or the editing, and the content is fantastic. The film has an excellent screenplay, and lovable characters as well as some detestable ones. It's also very informative, containing somewhat of a lesson on the way the legislative system of our government works. but what stands high above everything else in this film is most definitely the acting.James Stewart is absolutely brilliant as the young and naive, yet determined Jefferson Smith. When he gets to Washington he has every appearance of a little boy going to see his favorite baseball team play for the first time. In the first part of the film he's very passive and very vulnerable, but also very kind, but once he starts to stand up for himself, he exudes power with his performance, and you can see the transition completely.Jean Arthur is adorable as the cynical yet sweet Saunders, and while the romance between her and Smith is a little underplayed, it's very captivating. Claude Raines also give a brilliant performance as Senator Joseph Paine. You can see the inner struggle of his character in his expressions and his delivery is impeccable. And Harry Carry's reactions as the President of the Senate are priceless. They're subtle but very amusing.All in all this is a movie that true film buffs absolutely should not miss, as well as anyone who is interested in politics or would like a good lesson in acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr Smith, Meet Mr Graft!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Frank Capra masterpiece surfaces to the pinnacle of movie making!! "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" is a film which introduces the American public to the pejorative intricacies of the political process!! Jimmy Stewart's performance in this movie is considered one of the best acting performances ever in the history of the American silver screen!! Back in 1939, even with the Great Depression, Americans conceptualized politicians as icons of altruism who epitomized moral and socially ideological beliefs that people in this country could adhere to!! By attrition, more and more Americans have accepted the fact that politicians are the masters of one precarious preoccupation..it is called graft!! The complacency of pork barreling was something that the political spectrum wanted to keep covert... Here is where the very wet behind the ears Mr Smith (Jimmy Stewart) becomes astounded by the ulterior motives of the actual Washington DC, and not the one which he revered all his young adult life!! The film "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" makes filibustering a form of heroics, and translates the desires of the American people to the dogged tenacity of Jimmy Stewart to overcome graft!! Such a resilient assertion of democracy garnered an auspicious reaction from the American moviegoer!! "Mr Smith Goes To Washington" has become a legend in the movie world!! Such a charisma is largely due in part to the acting, and the directing in this movie!! At the same time, this film's strongest feature is the overall premise that graft can be overcome by a freshman senator, this powerful element to this movie ultimately cultivated a camaraderie with the American people!! If you have never seen this film before, I strongly recommend that you do!! When the phenomena of the White House and stars and stripes forever become relegated to a citadel of disillusionment, it takes the vigor of a magnanimous maverick politician like Mr Smith (Jimmy Stewart) to set things right!! Jimmy Stewart has always been the Mr squeaky clean baseball, apple pie, and mom type anyway!! He is perfectly cast for this movie!! Frank Capra, who has a virtual myriad of accolades in the world of Hollywood, does a tremendous job at directing this movie!! All in all, I think that "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" is a definite American movie legend!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra made some great films in his career (You Can't Take It With You, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, It Happened One Night), and he made some near-great films (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life, Lost Horizon, Lady For a Day). Not bad for a Sicilian boy! Maybe he and my grandfather came over on the same ship as they only lived 38 Km from each other.This film which starred Jean Arthur and James Stewart may be a little corny for many people's tastes, but it is my favorite Stewart film. I like movies with a political theme, and this one is timeless. The same things that happen in this film are likely happening right now in Washington.Stewart gives an outstanding performance as Jefferson Smith and makes an unlikely candidate for public office; much the same as Robin Williams in Man of the Year. He got one of his five Oscar nominations for this role, and the New York Film Critics considered him the best of the year.This was a year in which Clark Gable was up for an Oscar in Gone With the Wind, Laurence Olivier for Wuthering Heights, Mickey Rooney for Babes in Arms, and the Oscar winner was Rober Donat in Goodbye Mr. Chips. Presitigious company, indeed! Lewis R. Foster won an Oscar for his story, Capra was nominated for best Director, losing to Victor Fleming for Gone With the Wind, and he lost Best Picture to David O. Selznick for the same film.Two supporting actors, who gave marvelous performances in this film also got Oscar nominations: Claude Rains as Sen. Joseph Harrison Paine and Harry Carey as President of the Senate. Who could forget that smile during the filibuster.One of the greatest films ever made in Hollywood. A real David vs. Goliath story that will warm your heart and get your blood pumping. This is a classic from the day when movies stood on the strength of the actors and the script, and not on CGI, sex, or violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington" is simply one of the best movies of all time. It embodies the principles of democracy and fair play that the world has forgotten and should revisit. It's one of Frank Capra's best! Mr.Capra won the Academy Award 3 times in five years. It's refreshing to see a movie that expresses ideals. Things were simpler then, ( the film is older than I am!). There is a minimum of sfx. There is, however, a great deal in the way of depth of feeling. Besides the leads, Jas. Stewart and Jean Arthur, the supporting cast is stellar. All roles are very well-cast. The characters are extremely well-defined. The script is so well crafted that it takes us on a rollicking comedic romp, sets us up,and then drops the hammer on the substance of the story. This film will never be surpassed as a perfect example of what great cinema can and should be... at least some of the time. Viva Frank Capra!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The death of a senator results in party crisis. As the powerful members pitch their own candidates, the head of the party, at the insistence of his children, selects Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) - a local scout hero. People against this decision are told that Mr. Smith with his boyish charm is a perfect man for the job as he won't ask inconvenient questions and at the same time party will get some middle class support. All hells break loose when Mr. Smith turns out to be a Lincolnian. Mr. Paine, who is the other senator from the state and Jeff's ideal since childhood, slams him with charges of corruption to get rid of him. Jeff is heartbroken with the realities of Washington. He decides to take the next train home but his secretary Saunders (Jean Arthur) who is already jaded with political surroundings helps him fight back. Performance-wise James steward is at his best. He is very convincing as a local hero, a Lincolnian youth and frustrated senator. Jean Arthur is good. She did a little over acting but its OK for comic relief. Claude Rains is very good as Mr. Paine. Edward Arnold is too good. Thomas Mitchell is fantastic as Diz Moore. This movie is extremely comical, serious stuff and jokes are happening at the same time. The film is extremely tight, entertaining and very well crafted. It was my second Capra film. I wanted to watch this film to checkout the senate footage. It turned out to be a huge lesson on US senate for me. This film actually explains lots of processes i.e. Jean Arthur describes how a bill is passed, oath taking ceremony etc. The first half of the film is establishing and humorous. Second half of the film is extremely definitive and to the point. The last 20 minutes of the film are thrilling. I think its one of the best story, dialogs and screenplay I have seen ever. It's a flawless film. The only other films in the same league are 'Anand', 'Guide' and 'Bicycle thief'. All of them are genius works. 'Advise and Consent (1962)' has the same backdrop but has just too many flaws. I don't have a 'Cinemascope' brain but while watching this film I noticed some scenes which were done in a particular way to narrate the story for e.g. in a sentimental scene Jean Arthur's eyes are in the shadow as tears wont go with her character. I think it's a shame that this film lost all its well deserved Oscars to one of the most overrated and boring film 'Gone with the film'. The only reason it got an Oscar for original Story was probably because there was no competition. I'm sure this movie was sidelined for obvious reasons. It came out in the middle of the world war and America bashing was the last thing Americans wanted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do the right thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My all-time favorite movie because it is, above all, a film about simply doing the right thing. It is not even about Mr. Smith doing the right thing, however, because we know all along that he will. He couldn't be any other way. The real hero of the movie (you may disagree with me here) is Payne. Payne is like us. We are often conflicted about knowing what the right thing is; in denial and rationalizing actions we know are wrong; and weak about doing the right thing when we do know what it is. Jeff Smith only needs Saunders to remind him of what is right, and he will do it. But all is still lost without Payne. For sixty years the biggest criticism of this film has been its abrupt ending. It is often called a contrived ending. But I believe it is the perfect ending. Like Payne, each one of us has to step up, find our humanity, find our conscience and only then can the hero save the day, with our support! The film is brilliantly written with memorable characters and scenes. It is a perfect romance as well, since the attraction between Smith and Saunders is founded completely in their mutual respect and admiration. Without any kissing at all, the romance is there in their eyes and in the concern they display for each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many will dismiss this great film with slanders like "sappy," "corny," and, worst of all, "Capra-corn," but anyone who can watch this movie unmoved and uninspired must have a heart of stone. This tale of the idealistic American everyman struggling and triumphing against the greed and corruption that has tarnished the institutions of our country is done in a way that only Capra could pull off. This is perhaps his greatest achievement, with competition only from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. The acting is superb, with Jimmy Stewart giving an absolutely mesmerising (and frequently hilarious!) performance, and Jean Arthur making the role of the cynical secretary Saunders truly memorable, and reminding us that she's one of the most under-appreciated actresses of all time. The two of them have great chemistry together, and the balance between comedy and drama is perfect. For me, what makes this film truly remarkable is that it is profoundly patriotic without resulting to the flag waving, "no questions asked" attitude taken by many people today. The movie expresses a real love for the country, but is not afraid of showing the flaws in the government, though admittedly the resolution IS unrealistic, but that just adds to its charm as a political fantasy. After all, who secretly doesn't wait for a Jeff Smith to come around and win us the America we wish we had? Definitely a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crash Course in Civics?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a vacancy opens, Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed to be the junior senator of some western state (Montana in the book). He does not know much about the procedures of the Senate, but quickly gets a crash course on how politics works. His one and only project he wants to push through, a boys camp, turns out to be a very contentious issues.This film has been nominated for and won a number of awards. And why not? It's an interesting tale of an ordinary man who goes to the government to get something fairly normal done. It's a film many people could identify with. I think it is also a strength of the film that no one is ever identified as a Republican or Democrat, essentially making it a story about civics and not about politics.I was not impressed with the cinematography, including the "hat shot" where the camera follows Smith's hat to show how awkward he is, or the use of the "soft lens", which just strikes me as blurry and ineffective. A face and music can be more powerful than a fuzzy frame.All in all a great film, though perhaps a bit long for some people's tastes. James Stewart is great as always (though I prefer the more mature Stewart), Jean Arthur is a decent female lead, and Jean Arthur's hats really do a fine job in the supporting actor role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest "American" Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is a better film about America and American ideals, I have yet to see it, or even hear of it. Frank Capra is the quintessential American director. He was obsessed with optimism and an unequaled faith in the American spirit, and it really shows in this film. I personally don't care if the story is a bit far-fetched or if the characters are a bit exaggerated. This is not so much a film about Washington politics as it is about the power of right ideas. I feel he adroitly accomplishes his goal, which is to show that good can prevail. James Stewart is one of America's greatest actors. He was as hard-working and talented as anyone else. The role of Jefferson Smith could have easily been a caricature. A typical actor could have overplayed his bunglingness. Stewart, however, gives him a humanity and a naive sincerity that makes you really sympathize with him. This is one great performance. All of the supporting roles are very good. Claude Rains is perfect as the corrupted senior senator. He gives his character a interior goodness. I never really believed that he was totally evil. Jean Athur is witty and cynical as Saunders. She is one of the many innocents caught in the machinery of Washington. This is a really good movie. As a history teacher, I would like all my students to see this movie. This is more than fantasy. It is a positive view of America. It is a belief that the good should fight for the good until the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Stewart plays Jefferson Smith, a toddler in a man's body taken out of his small town rural play-pen and plunked down into the heavy political traffic of Washington DC. The sudden death of the incumbent Senator of an unnamed state prompts the state's political machine to appointment Smith as interim Senator. Smith's a local celebrity in his hometown, a proponent of boy's healthful living, the founder of Boy Rangers whose mission it is to prepare the male youth of today to take their place as the patriotic cheerleaders for the American Way in the world of tomorrow. The senior Senator Joseph Paine admirably played by that fine actor Claude Rains, and his puppet master, corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor, in the person of actor Edward Arnold, are convinced the newbie Smith is na?ve enough and malleable enough not to disrupt their dirty program of graft and shady dealings so that business can be carried on as usual. Arnold, virtually typecast by Hollywood as the venal, power hungry businessman really puts this character across with all its hallmark, villainous trappings. Jean Arthur as Clarissa Saunders is tasked with a real thorny assignment. She's Smith administrative assistant, a Washington-wise veteran of the savvy, cynical breed who takes him in hand, steering him and cheering him on. So refreshing, and pathetically unspoiled is the new Senator, Saunders can't but help taking him under her wing and---ultimately falling in love with this touching, earnest sap. Most of the action takes place in the Senate chambers that serves as the arena of combat, a theater full of drama, tension and political maneuvering in action. Spectators in the gallery are the enraptured audience. Perched eagerly above are a contingent of the newspaper corps avidly gazing down on the proceedings notebooks and pencils at the ready to document any newsworthy copy that can be finessed into sensationalist reportage. Thomas Mitchell plays Diz Moore, one of these tough, weathered news-hounds, a man without illusions yet one not immune to sentimentality, himself joining Saunders in her concern over Smith's dilemma. Well, things don't exactly work out the way boss Taylor and his ally Senator Paine are convinced they will. In Capra's world honesty and just causes never go unrewarded. Smith introduces a Congressional bill to fund a national boys camp, and doing so unknowingly intrudes into one of the bad guys well laid schemes crafted to enrich themselves and their cronies back home. Frank Capra was a life long right-wing Republican who reviled President Franklin Roosevelt and adamantly opposed his New Deal programs during the Great Depression. Capra had achieved the American Dream of fame and fortune and saw no reason others could not do the same. He lived the American Myth and spent his professional life making films that were skilled vehicles of propaganda. In Mr. Smith, both Democracy and domestic bliss reign over all in this happily ever after Capra love letter to America. This is a true film classic and a noteworthy example of Capra presenting America to Americans at its most idealized, fantastical best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra directed this classic political comedy/drama, which stars Jimmy Stewart as naive but pure Jefferson Smith, who is appointed to the Senate to replace a deceased senator. The political machine headed by evil Jim Taylor(played by Edward Arnold) thinks that simple Smith will be easy to control, and not stir controversy because he isn't a crony. He is befriended by veteran Senator Joseph Paine(played by Claude Rains) who has been gradually corrupted and cowed by the rotten political bosses. When Smith proves to be his own man, who can't be corrupted or bribed, Taylor uses Paine to concoct a phony scandal related to a bill Jefferson was trying to get passed, leading to a filibuster at his senate hearing...Jean Arthur plays his ally won over by his sincerity.Outstanding film is even better today, with an intelligent and insightful script about political corruption and the destruction of anyone who dares to stand up to the political machine(partisanship) that rules it is sadly still relevant today. Jimmy Stewart is excellent, and was deserving of an Academy Award(he didn't win) for his entirely believable and impassioned performance. Script pulls no punches either, with a particularly shocking scene of youngsters trying to spread the truth about Mr. Smith being run off the road or beaten up by thugs! Stirring ending may be wish-fulfillment to an extent, but I for one wouldn't have wanted it to end any other way!</fullReview>

He gets appointed by the Governor to replace a deceased senator for the remaining of his term. When Smith gets to Washington D.C., he sees the sights and memorials like Lincoln Memorial and Capitol Hill with such awe and reverence. It isn't until he wants to get something done that he is met with those who preferred the status quo way of doing things. Smith isn't bought by anybody like the others and he won't sell out as well. The cast is first rate. Jean Arthur is brilliant in this Capra classic. The supporting cast included the Hollywood greats like Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Beulah Bondi, Ruth Donnelly, and others.

Don't destroy the idea of this film by taking it like that. OK, remove the whole American propaganda frame and think of it like there is just a man who will fight a rotten mechanism, who will dedicate his energy to mankind, to his fellows.I still feel I haven't said enough but...there is much to say about justice and politics, there are libraries out there in the whole world.

		<fullReview>Cinema is sometimes classified into two categories- the realistic, and the fantastic (fantasy-based). This film masterfully captures both, a specialty of most Frank Capra classics. They are not fixed to a single era, but all eras, the truest definition of a classic. This film released in 1939 has young James Stewart at his very best. It is a political drama/ comedy with elements of patriotism and the usual good vs evil plot. The film has a crowd pleasing element only matched by few.Jeff Smith (James Stewart) believes that children are the future and they should take the values from their great Country. When a senator dies in his state, the governor is forced into an awkward position of electing him the new senator. When Mr. Smith- the true patriot, arrives Washington, he is amazed by all the greatness that Washington possesses. He comes up with idea to propose a Bill that would let kids come together and enjoy the wilderness in a plot in his home town. His colleague Mr. Pain has his own plans with that same land. The film then releases the full fury of what corrupt politicians can do to a truthful man. The U.S. Senate is amazingly detailed. It's also a nice lesson in how the Senate works, how bills have to go through committees, the rules of behavior and filibustering. A heart warming patriotic film from a very rare and different angle.</fullReview>

It's contemporary significance can be demonstrated by the fact that when the Nazi's in occupied France banned the showing of Hollywood films several French cinemas chose this film as the last one they screened, one for 30 consecutive nights, to act as a lasting beacon for democracy. The film also commented upon corruption in states such as Montana at the time. It's timelessness can easily be demonstrated by the current echoes that the film has with the activities of the Murdoch media empire, their ability to exert major political influence and the ability to subvert public opinion by distorted coverage in the Murdoch press and in his TV empire via channels such as Fox News. The film is another example of Capra's little man against the big machine and it is strange that this consistent theme comes from Capra and Stewart who were both avowed Republicans. The performance by James Stewart was star making but is somewhat histrionic for my taste. However his commitment to the role can be demonstrated by the fact that he took various concoctions to actually give him a very sore throat for the scenes at the end of his "fillybustering". Jean Arthur's character and the relationship with Mr Smith seems somewhat unconvincing and some of the humour, such as the drunken scene, seems heavy handed and unsubtle. That is unless you are a fan of such modern starlets as Jeniifer Aniston,then you'll think that characterisation in broad strokes and via a few forced expressions is fine. The supporting cast is wonderful, particularly Claude Rains, but his final dramatic change of heart is unconvincing and is one aspect of the film that won't translate to a modern audience who are used to their politicians being bought and paid for, professional party line hacks. Capra has an ability to deal with big themes through the struggle of a single man and that is his genius. This film is no exception and the United States Film Regulatory board has nominated the film as one that is "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant". So why doesn't it work for me? Because I just can't get over the big hole in the plot. If Mr Smith is disgraced because they produce false papers saying he owns the land on which the dam is to be built why doesn't he simply say if I own the land then there won't be a dam and I'll build my Boy Rangers camp there after all. And if Mr Smith does have documents showing that he owns the land how could the evil Jim Taylor then plan to go ahead and build the dam on the land? The film has all of the great themes of anti corruption and stands up for the little man, the benefits of democracy, truth and redemption and a has a dramatic and positive final outcome. However the central narrative thread is flawed and so the drama in the Senate seems a bit hollow to me when a bit of smart thinking by Mr Smith could have saved him 23 plus hours on his feet and a very sore throat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Naive And Cynical At The Same Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to appreciate a movie that manages to be both hopelessly naive and bitingly cynical at the same time, and that still manages to make everything work. The great strength of this movie is James Stewart in the role of the newly appointed (much to his surprise) Senator Jefferson Smith, sent to Washington by his unnamed state's governor to fill a vacancy created by the death of the incumbent. Of course, Smith wasn't really appointed by the Governor. The Governor (and Smith's senior Senator) were just tools of the state political machine - a role Smith is expected to fulfil. But he's ill suited to the job. Jefferson was the leader of the Boy Rangers, who's spent his adulthood instilling into the boys pride in America and democracy and who isn't about to give in when he stumbles across corruption being planned by the machine, which then sets out to destroy him as quickly as it made him.Stewart was great in this role. His wide-eyed wonder at seeing Washington for the first time; his social awkwardness and shyness; his genuine humility (not believing that he belongs in the Senate); and finally his growing contempt for the corrupt system he discovers - these are all portrayed absolutely perfectly by Stewart. The movie is his, backed by a strong supporting cast - but it's his.The mix of naivete and cynicism might seem an awkward fit, but it worked surprisingly well. The portrayal of life on the floor of the Senate was also interestingly shown. The "scandal" Smith gets embroiled in (as he's framed by the machine) plays out far too quickly to be believable, and yet you feel his anguish and despair over his reputation being attacked and his honesty called into question. In an age in which attack-style politics is now the accepted norm, it was nice to see the decent, honest guy who just wants to do what's right triumph against the corrupt mud-slingers. This is a very enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The great American film, a testament to the power of people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No film is a greater champion of democracy than "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." One would be hard pressed to find a film that better communicates the ideals upon which America and democracy were founded. Forget all the patriotic war films or political biopics, "Mr. Smith" is the most American film of all time because it reminds us what it means to have a government for the people, by the people.What's most impressive about what is arguably '30s and '40s master Frank Capra's greatest cinematic achievement is that despite not identifying the state Senator Jefferson Smith (Stewart) represents or identifying any political parties, the film is still able to make a profound statement about the complacency among politicians for corruption within government. No one is implicated in this film and no political bias could possibly sway a viewer's opinion -- it's one hundred percent about how in a democracy, people must stand up to their government, opinions and beliefs aside."Mr. Smith" does it by creating a protagonist in Jeff Smith that represents the typical youthful, idealistic American. When a senator dies, the governor of his state feels caught between the people's choice for a replacement and that of an influential businessman named Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold). He decides to appear as if he isn't favoring either influence by appointing Smith, a boy scout leader -- a choice that shocks everyone. At the very least, the governor figures Smith will be so overwhelmed by Washington that he'll stay quiet in the Senate and allow Taylor's hush-hush controversial dam to be passed.Smith arrives in Washington and is awe-struck by the monuments and the buildings, not unlike a young American seeing D.C for the first time. All he's known his whole life are the ideals America stands for, not the inner-workings of the political system. We are in his same shoes and much like the film corrupts this idealism for Smith, it corrupts it for us. Stewart, who officially breaks out in this role, is perfect. He has charm, but he's rather nervous and clueless. He is phenomenal at being nervous and uncertain despite speaking with strong conviction -- he's easy to relate to as he fights for what he believes in as the film progresses.Smiths' emotions are our emotions through the film and that's where "Mr. Smith" draws its true power as a film. Between Capra's work building up Washington and then exposing it and Stewart's ability to demonstrate this same idea through his reactions to it, we want to give up when Smith wants to give up. We're even surprisingly convinced ourselves by Jean Arthur's -- who plays Smith's assistant -- passionate speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, pleading Smith to keep fighting. As he continues the fight, we support him, pity him and much more. It's his fire to keep the purity of American ideals that is truly inspiring.Essentially, Smith is any one of us, a well-respected American, who happens to find his way into a role where he can make a difference, and he single-handedly tries to do what every American wishes he or she could: stand up for what he believes in and never give up, no matter the cost, because it's what's right. There have been films about people making a difference or fighting for the American way, but never one that acts as such a strong metaphor or even a microcosm of when democracy is its most powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a beautiful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This intentionally was going to be a sequel to the movie "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", also directed by Frank Capra, starring the same actors from that movie but instead the script was altered and an alternate title was given; "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington". But yes, when watching this movie it becomes visible how this movie could had worked out as a sequel to "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town". It features a similar sort of story about a random small time man who suddenly gets thrown into the big bad world of money and power. It a movie of a man against the crooked system.I must say that I like this movie better than "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", while that movie on its own right also already was a great and fun movie. This movie however seems to be better with its comedy, in its first halve at least, which makes this an even better and more pleasant movie to watch.But above all things it also has a better story, which works inspiring. Yes, it's a patriotic movie but in this case I can really live with that. It's a moralistic movie, concerning politics and ideals but without all of the sappy elements. The movie actually received an amazing total of 11 Oscar nominations, something not too many movies can say but it unfortunately only took home one award, for its writing. It received nominations in all of the mayor big categories. Besides its drama and comedy the movie of course also features a healthy portion of romance. Not a big shame that it didn't took home any more awards, when you consider that it was nominated in the same year "Gone with the Wind" was and some other great classic movies, such as "Stagecoach", "The Wizard of Oz" and "Wuthering Heights", just to name a few.It features James Stewart in a great role. He always had the ability to play a character comical like but also with a serious undertone and effective during the movie its more dramatic moments. Also great was Claude Rains in a role, in which he was made to look much older than he in fact was at the time. His very natural acting style seemed to be ahead of time. Both actors received their first Oscar nomination for their roles in this movie. They should had won both really.One of the best, most powerful and most beautiful 1930's movies I've ever seen.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful and - at the time - controversial film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Frank Capra's autobiography, "The Name Above The Title", he writes beautifully about the political backlash and nightmare-of-a-premiere he had in Washington, D.C. for "Mr. Smith..." 4000 people jammed into the D.C. cinema premiere, Senators, Congressmen, filled the seats - and started leaving in droves about 30 minutes into the film. It was a disaster with a major political backlash on the Hollywood studios in the form of threatened legislation. "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington" is a wonderful film which had the nerve to suggest that corruption exists in our own beloved Capitol. Even the powerful Joe Kennedy (Father of JFK) got into the fray - on the side of the government - and demanded that Columbia withdraw the film from distribution. An amazing side-story to an amazing picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civics for Dummies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, do we ever need a refresher course in the subject. 2006 has been quite a year, worth studying in some detail. Congress proposed a bill that would hike the minimum wage for the first time in almost ten years. (Meanwhile, Congress had voted itself almost ten raises in the same period.) Enemies of the minimum wage hike tacked on a repeal of the estate tax for the mega-wealthy, so the bill flunked.I just give that as an example of how some things worked during this past year, a period in which Congress worked for 93 days. (They gave themselves two weeks off for St. Patty's day alone.) Anyone who follows the news knows as much as I've just written, and in fact I may have added some misleading details out of ignorance.How can such things happen? If a bill is designed to raise the minimum wage, period, how can an explosive device like a repeal of the estate tax be buried in it? How, exactly, does a bill get "hung up in committee"? WHAT committee, and why? And how come the House Ways and Means Committee is always described in the press as "powerful"? What makes it so damned powerful? All these kinds of issues are raised and answered in a five-minute lecture given by Saunders (Jean Arthur) to Honorary Senator Jeff Smith (Jimmy Stewart). It's not really as complicated as it sounds. I learned more from Saunders' little explanation than I did during months of civics in the fifth grade. So much for your class, Mrs. Greene. You never liked me anyway, and to tell you the truth I always found you a little overbearing. And I didn't care for that business of whacking people with the ruler either.The movie, as a movie, is informative but sterile. The villains are really villainous -- except for Claude Raines, the bad guy who turns good. The issue in this case is hardly one involving life and death. It's not about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or abortion or capital punishment. It's about a kind of Boy Scout camp that Stewart wants to build on some unused acres in his home state, land that will be paid for by the Boy Scouts themselves by sending in their nickels and dimes. ("No more than ten cents apiece," says Stewart.) As in many of Capra's populist and popular entertainments there are shady shenanigans going on behind all the public nobility displayed. A bad guy (Edward Arnold) intends to build a lucrative dam on that land and discredits Stewart, who is humiliated and scorned by his former admirers. The format is familiar and undemanding.And of course no one in Washington is as naive as Stewart. The Boy Scouts? Dimes? Are you kidding? But it is SO simple that, like a fairy tale, it becomes gripping. We watch as Hansel and Gretl are prepared to be popped into the oven.If it were any more realistic, aimed at a more sophisticated audience, it wouldn't work. The characters and their motives have to be clear and pure. That's the whole point of the movie. The simplicity leads us step by step through the political process, as an army training film might tell you how to dismantle an M-16.What realism the film has disappears almost entirely at the end, when Stewart collapses on the Senate floor but is saved by Claude Raines who has just undergone some sort of epiphany. Man, does Stewart suffer through his lone filibuster, his voice shot, two days without sleep, disheveled and shaky, only to be redeemed at the end by Raines. No need to get into religion here but that epiphany and that suffering for all our sakes is suggestive.I watched it last night after not having seen it for years and expected to be bored, but wasn't. I enjoyed the film for its entertainment value, and because now I know a little more about how things inside the Beltway can go so terribly wrong.</fullReview>

She sees this dumb innocent guy come to town, that the rich and boisterous politicians are trying desperately to take advantage of, but he turns out to not be so dumb after all, with the help of Jean Arthur. Though he could have never have beaten them at their game had he not had her by his side, coaxing and helping along the way. The movie is one you won't ever forget. It's one to pass down from generation to generation, as i have done with my own children. You will be captivated by the awesome sites too of Washington, D.C. and the actors do their job tremendously. Buy it, you will never regret it. Other movies like it you will enjoy are Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, Shepherd of the Hills, and the Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake Blondie Series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film full of passion and truth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Smith goes to Washington is a fantastic film about a truly honest man in a corrupted, dirty system, just trying to make a difference. Jefferson Smtih is played by the amazing Jimmy Stewart. Jefferson was the leader of a boys troop and had absolutely no experience with the government when he was suddenly thrown into the position of senator. As Smith arrived in Washington, all he could think of were the things that all children are taught about this great nation of ours. He was thinking of all of the morals and ideals that this country was formed on, not what it had become. He stood in awe of the massive statue if Honest Abe not knowing that the people he was going to be working with were the polar opposite of honest. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington really does deserve more credit than it had been given. The acting is unbelievable, in a good way. Jimmy Stewart plays his role as Jefferson Smith with such passion and charisma. No one can even come close to him when it comes to fully getting a feel for a character and a situation. He is absolutely brilliant. Jean Arthur also does a terrific job. Overall, the acting is flawless. The story line of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is very unique and intriguing. It is very real and reveals what politicians are like and how our system really works. Maybe it isn't exactly correct with the one man that isn't president having complete power of what bills are passed or not, but the film really shows that the majority will always have the most power, and one person does have the power to form a majority. The plot is totally original and impressive. The directing is also brilliant. Frank Capra just can't go wrong. Mr. Smith was just one of the many wonderful films Capra directed, including Citizen Kane made only 2 years later than Mr. Smith. Directors today don't even come close to Capra's truthful style. Everything about this movie is great. It deserves to be much higher on the list of top 250. It should be at least in the top twenty. Mr. Smith touches the heart of the viewer and not many films are capable of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspiring tale of perseverance and righteous vindication.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington With the death of a senator in the opening scene, the puppet masters of the government look for a new yes man to fill the dead senator's shoes. They find Jeff Smith, a son of liberty, a mentor to young boys. They expect Jeff to roll over and die for them, they expect him to do as they say. But what they don't expect is for Mr. Smith's honor and ideals to overcome all odds. Jimmy Stewart oozes with charisma in his role as Jeff Smith, the small town guy with big ideals. Jimmy makes the role lovable and he drips with a realism that would make Stanislovsky proud. He also delivers all his lines with sincerity that envelops the audience into this heroic battle that Mr. Smith is catapulted into. But every lead actor is only as strong as the actors supporting him. The supporting actors in this film each brought a multitude of talents to the screen. They played their parts with an unmatched professionalism that made `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' a joy to watch. The performances were in every way inspiring and memorable. Feeding the actors brilliance was the writing in Mr. Smith. The story was both original and entertaining. The story line starts with a medium pace, it then slows a bit in the middle so it can slip in some essential patriotism, then the end steeply climbs up to the satisfying and enthralling conclusion of the story. To show off the fantastic writing the director (Frank Capra) uses double exposure (a cutting edge editing technique at the time) and he also includes shots of monuments in Washington, D.C. that are exalting to the spirit. And even though Capra's directing is anything but subtle, in this case, it was appropriate for him to drive the point home. The major themes are patriotism and perseverance, which evoke emotion in anyone with a soul. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was and is an American classic. And American classics don't deserve to collect dust. I loved this movie because I was lost in the beautiful story. After the triumphant climax I snapped back to reality and found that I had actually been praying that Jeff would find vindication. This film, this masterpiece is worthy of being bathed in compliments and of being watched by all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra is Captivating!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON,' is an overlooked gem of our time. Does the senate really treat rookies or newcomers like they way they did in the film? No one really knows except, for Frank Capra. He manages to show how even a great man can sometimes be condemned for no apparent reason.In the beginning, one of the states (no idea which one) has lost one of their senators , and is in a mad scramble looking for a replacement. The governor has selected Jefferson smith (James Stewart) To go serve as a senate member in Washington. But is this a mistake? Does he know what could possibly go wrong? Jefferson knew very little about being on the senate, so this serves as a target for criticism, and ridicule from other senators. The other senate member, of his state is senator Paine, an old friend of his dad's. Payne is going along with smith on his way to Washington, to help him out. (or as though we think.) When Jefferson arrives in Washington, he runs off to go look at the natl. capitol, and other places, leaving senn. Payne and others behind. When Jefferson decides to come back, he is introduced to beautiful young Clarissa Saunders. (Jean Arthur) Through out most of the movie she tries to help him along, but finds that she is getting nowhere with him. At the same time Jefferson is trying to propose a bill to the senate, that will create an all boys camp, on government property. This is where the trouble starts. While Jefferson is trying to figure this out, sen. Payne, tries to round up some people who can help him get Jefferson out of office. The next day, when Jefferson is ready to present his bill, he is in for a rude awakening. He is extremely nervous and scared. When it comes time for him to present his bill, a lot of the senators are extremely rude to him, and won't even let him speak. This ends up happening because sen. Payne and others lied about him and tried to get him into trouble with the law. Jefferson finding out the hard way that everyone, (even his own friend) has let him down disgracefully, decides to go sit and weep by the Lincoln memorial. When who should come along at the right place and time? Miss. Saunders. She convinces him not to give up, but to have faith in what he believes in. She takes him back to his office, and decides to stick with him all the way through, so he can not only defend his bill, but also stomp on those who have committed that foolish act against him. The heat is rising on the floor of the senate house as Jefferson is trying to defend the bill, after hours and hours, of talking he then starts to defend himself against those who hate him. A few hours later while Jefferson is still arguing with other senators, sen. Payne does something remarkable That can?t be discussed without spoiling the movie. Even though Payne did a terrible thing to Jefferson, he made up for it by coming clean and doing the right thing.Young good looking James Stewart, and older but not to old Claude Rains, make terrific duo in this film, as not only being friends, but true enemies as well. The film has many values to it, especially on how far a friend will go to help someone out, even if his dishonesty towards his friend is apparent. This film has earned a passing grade from the reviewer. It is not the best thing ever viewed before, but it is worth seeing sometime. Go rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearly a product of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington", though overly sentimental and a bit over the top at its climax, provides a unique look at what America of the late 1930's wanted itself to be ? for "Mr. Smith", both as a movie and as a character, is the ideal political drama. A regular, average-joe citizen (Jimmy Stewart) finds himself an emergency appointee in the wake of a senator's death. Even though this average-joe, Jefferson Smith, is a na?ve country boy planted by a political machine, he still somehow fights a David and Goliath battle against dishonest businessmen and politicians.This is the state of politics America wanted to be true, then and now. It has a cynical press that first defames Smith, then later sides with him in his epic political fight. It has a well-oiled political machine that first destroys Smith, then is destroyed by him. Time and again throughout the movie, the pure idealism exuded by Smith wins over every one around him (most comically the Vice President himself) and leads him to triumph over his enemies.This idealized view of US politics came at a critical point in US history: in 1939, Hitler was well on his way to conquering Poland and the rest of Europe, sowing the seeds of World War II. Director Frank Capra's congressional refresher course served to remind Americans what separated them from their enemies and made their liberties worth protecting (a concept Capra would revisit in his "Why We Fight" series of propaganda films for the US government)If Smith's naivete is played up (especially in a handful of romantic scenes), it is only to further drive home the point that the US system allows for even those such as Mr. Smith to create political change ? at least in the world of the movie. The resolution of the climax is also quite melodramatic, with a Perry Mason-esque shouted confession from the guilty party and a subsequence nervous collapse.Overall, "Mr. Smith" is ultimately a product of its time. Sentimental? Yes. Melodramatic? Yes. Over the top? Yes. But all this was a purposeful move by Capra to show off the power and freedom afforded by the US political system. As a period piece, a political film, and simply as an enjoyable tale about overcoming adversity in the name of truth, "Mr. Smith goes to Washington" will live on as one of both Capra's and Stewart's best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jimmy Stewart's Finest Performance in Capra Gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a timeless, brilliant parable of Good Vs. Evil, played against the backdrop of the U.S. Senate. Good is represented by Jimmy Stewart, in the film he SHOULD have won an Oscar for (Giant MGM, trying to bolster 'Goodbye, Mr. Chips' revenue at the box office, influenced it's Academy members to award Robert Donat with the statue; smaller Columbia Pictures just couldn't generate as much 'firepower' for Stewart; however, the following year, Stewart would appear in MGM's 'The Philadelphia Story', and win Best Actor). He is magnificent as Jefferson Smith, an idealistic youth leader, who is offered up as an innocent and gullible replacement for a Senate vacancy. The forces of Evil are personified by Claude Rains, as the suave and corrupt senior Senator, and Edward Arnold, brilliant as a ruthless party boss.In many ways, 'Smith' is cut from the same cloth as Capra's earlier masterpiece, 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town', and both films costar the radiant Jean Arthur, here cast as Smith's secretary. She is an old hand at understanding political wheelings and dealings, and at first, she considers her new boss nothing less than a total idiot! But Smith's integrity wins her over, and with the help of reporter Thomas Mitchell (1939's busiest actor!), the three manage to outlast the 'bad guys' in the most rousing filibuster Hollywood has ever filmed.Two supporting characters in the film deserve special attention; Harry Carey, one of Hollywood's most beloved Western stars, plays a warm, sympathetic Vice President, in a small but very crucial role; and Beulah Bondi is terrific as Stewart's mother (she would play his mother again in the Capra/Stewart classic 'It's A Wonderful Life').Whether you're viewing the film for the first time, or the hundredth, you are in for one of the most wonderful cinema experiences you'll ever have, from the best year Hollywood ever had! Simply put, this film is a masterpiece! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great, well written and terrificly acted film from beginning to end. Jimmy Stewart's major breakthrough role is still one of his best. He plays Jefferson Smith, newly appointed senator from Montana who upon his first visit to Washington, is being mocked by the newspapers and accused of stealing children's money!Stewart does a fantastic job maintaining the emotional and comical aspects simultaneously. He received his first Oscar nomination for his outstanding performance. Claude Rains is also very good as the "evil" Senator Joseph Payne who tries destroying Smith's reputation. An outstanding supporting cast, accurate direction, genuine writing and a patriotic score make this film a classic not likely to be forgotten for another 72 years!*****/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic for everyone to enjoy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's 1939 classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is very enjoyable to watch. It is easy to follow, for the most part, and it tells the wonderful story of a young, unexperienced Montana senator who travels to Washington D.C. and embarks on a political scandal involving a close family friend. The screen writing is what pleases me the most about this film. Jimmy Stewart... what a fantastic actor! He garnered his first Academy Award nomination for his role in this film. A film for everyone to enjoy and one that you'll cherish the moment your done viewing it!*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank Capra's triumph!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie! James Stewart gives, in my opinion, his finest performance as the naive senator Jefferson Smith, who goes to Washington with the idea that he's going to change the world. He thinks of Washington as the greatest city, and, as a matter of fact, gets lost his first day there. People want to take him to the Senate to show him around, but Jeff wanders over towards the Capitol building and ends up boarding a tour bus. He has a boyish innocence to him that is absolutely charming.My favorite part is when Senator Paine, following big man Jim Taylor's orders, brings in baskets of telegrams saying that Jeff should end his filibuster. Jeff looks at them desperately, and hangs his head, thinking that he almost killed his voice for nothing. But then, Jeff looks at the president of the Senate, who has liked the idealistic young man from the beginning. The President gives Jeff a warm smile, and Jeff smiles back. He realizes that he can continue with his filibuster, and do a good job!"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" is definitely one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. If you're a Capra fan, or a fan of James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Harry Carey, Edward Arnold, or Thomas Mitchell, I really recommend this. Also, Claude Rains gives one of the best performances ever as Senator Paine. So I give this wonderful movie a 10: the highest rating there is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving, inspirational film characteristic of Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capra is often criticized for making his films too "mushy" and overly dramatic, taunted with phrases like "Capra-corn." Perhaps this is true for some of his lesser films, but even the most stoic of critics has a soft spot for Capra's 1939 film, Mr Smith goes to Washington.Stewart gives a commanding performance as the title character who epitomizes everything good and pure - he is a scout leader and lives with his mother after all. When elected to Congress, he is awkward and admirable all at once, common for nearly all of Stewart's roles. After being framed by corrupt politicians, Smith acts to stand up against the system and defend what is left of the nation's ideals.James Stewart makes this film great. One scene in particular stands out: he describes his home to his assistant Clarissa (played wonderfully by Jean Arthur). Her eyes light up at his vivid, moving descriptions, and yours will too. And who can forget one of Stewart's most famous scenes, the filibuster near the end of the film.Capra does make the film dramatic, but with purpose and to great success. During this time, the country was in need of patriotism. Capra had always used his films as carriers of messages (as in "It Happened One Night"). The message rings true today and the movie will move you... if you let it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Capra Masterwork Resonates Still as Both Tribute to and Exposé of the U.S. Political System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are films that are purely formulaic and consequently redundant, and then there are select classics that seem to be inspired by the same formula but in a way that make them feel fresh every time you see them. Such is the case with legendary director Frank Capra's political 1939 masterwork, as he and veteran screenwriter Sidney Buchman tell the story of the underdog who must face seemingly impenetrable obstacles to achieve a greater good. Capra made his reputation on films which conveyed such unbridled idealism like his most famous work, 1946's "It's Wonderful Life", but I would argue that this one has a broader sense of resonance since it deals unflinchingly with the corrupted American political structure, a situation that has unfortunately changed little in the nearly seventy years since the film's original release.A young James Stewart is perfectly cast as Jefferson Smith, the na?ve leader of a local Boy Scouts-type organization, who is swept into office as his state's junior senator by the all-powerful political machine headed by a Boss Tweed-like figure, media mogul Jim Taylor. In awe of the senior senator, Joseph Paine, Smith follows Paine's advice to push a bill for a national boys' camp back in the home state. A problem arises in the fact that the camp is to be built on the Willets Dam site which Taylor and Paine plan to use for graft. Along the way, Smith wins the support of his initially cynical secretary, Clarissa Saunders, who becomes inspired by Smith's integrity and encourages him to push the bill. This leads to his tenacious efforts to pass the bill, going as far as staging a 23-hour filibuster on the U.S. Senate floor. It's a monumental climax that Stewart turns into one of the most classic scenes in film history.Supporting performances by familiar actors are uniformly strong with the wonderfully acerbic Jean Arthur as Saunders, Edward Arnold in full-bluster mode as Taylor, Harry Carey as the silently supportive Senate president and Claude Rains as the conflicted Paine, with Thomas Mitchell, Guy Kibbee, Eugene Palette, H.B. Warner and Beulah Bondi in smaller roles. The one flaw is the abrupt ending in which one character experiences an instant transformation with little pay-off shown for Smith's efforts. Apparently, Capra unwisely cut these scenes out after preview audiences seemed fidgety at the two-hour mark. Regardless it remains an inspiring piece of American cinema. The 2000 DVD from Columbia fortunately contains a pristine print from the Library of Congress vaults, as well as the original theatrical trailer and a featurette and commentary track from the director's son, Frank Capra, Jr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stewart finally became a star.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" is the film that finally brought my favorite actor James Stewart into the big leagues. How could director Frank Capra have made a better choice than Stewart for the quintessential gawky, idealistic, innocent, honest, naive, all-American Senator Jefferson Smith? Smith is a true patriot, a man who knows Lincoln and Jefferson by heart, a man who marvels at all the various historical monuments in Washington, and a man who is enthusiastic about being a junior senator representing his state. He even dreams of establishing a national boys' camp for the purpose of uniting boys of all races, creeds, backgrounds, &amp; walks of life and educating them in what it means to live in the land of the free. Unfortunately, life in the Senate seat is not all peaches and cream as Smith had hoped. Before he knows it, the senior Senator Joseph Paine (brilliantly portrayed by Claude Rains), a man Smith admired all his life and who took Smith under his wing like a true mentor would, suddenly turns 180 degrees and convinces the Senate body that Smith's expulsion would be of best interest. It so happens that Paine and party boss/newspaper tycoon Jim Taylor (neatly played by the sinister Edward Arnold) are involved in a crooked irrigation plot that just happens to be where Smith wishes to establish his camp. Smith is dumbfounded to learn that he has been framed and that all kinds of opposition, including newspaper stories, billboard posters, radio announcements, telegrams, etc. are all in favor of his being expelled, and yet he did nothing wrong; everything was doctored up by Taylor and his assorted heavies. Smith is so disheartened that he intends to leave Washington, but it is this chain of events that brings out the better qualities of Smith's feisty secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), who encourages him to stay and fight back. He does, and his nearly twenty-four-hour filibuster is filled with memorable quotes and light touches of humor. To me, Jefferson Smith is a true hero because he is an ordinary man faced with overwhelming loads of corrupt opposition, and yet he decides to stick to his guns and fight. He eventually loses his voice and faints, but he still wins the day as Paine rushes back into the Senate and screams that Smith has been telling the truth all along.Here are some of the more memorable sequences of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." Aside from the filibuster, Smith has one other notable scene on the Senate floor, and that is his introduction of the bill to establish his boys' camp; he very nervously reads aloud the text of his bill while his hands shake and the Senators laugh at him. At the gala celebration honoring Smith for his appointment to the Senate, he rises to his feet and remarks, "Thank you. I - I - I - I can't help feeling that there's been a big mistake somehow." (As biographer Gary Fishgall wrote, this is how most average people would react if they suddenly found themselves appointed to the Unites States Senate.) As Saunders helps Smith write his bill for the boys' camp, Smith's sentiments range from strong statements of patriotism, to pleasant marvels of nature, to questions for Saunders about her background. As Smith and Paine chat quietly together on the train, Smith finds it quite comforting to be in the presence of an elder who he believes to be a fine, virtuous gentleman."Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" was quite an outrage for politicians, as they felt it placed them in quite a dim light. But the public loved "Mr. Smith," and James Stewart must have garnered hundreds of congratulatory notices for his role as Jefferson Smith. No other actor could have portrayed Smith as well as Stewart did. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is It Possible To Not Like Jimmy Stewart?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, "Mr. Smith" is a terrific example of classic Hollywood writing, and one of Capra's best movies, but this film was made to me by Jimmy Stewart. He was that sort dumb man charm that makes you like him right away, to root for him, for his character. And there a lot of actors he can do that. But unlike most of the likable Hollywood stars, Jimmy Stewart is also an amazing actor. Vocal patterns, facial expressions, whatever, Jimmy Stewart can use them to transcend any kind of a powerful, or subtle, emotion . And this performance was the highlight of his career. it defined everything that was great about Jimmy Stewart. Not to mention a great supporting cast featuring Claude Raines.I would have liked to give the film a higher rating, but as always, Capra's sentimentality got to me. Some of the stuff in the film is so happy it feels fake. Capra is the master of sentimentality, but it is still not the greatest of film styles. This film is still classic. It is best both Capra and Stewart had too offer, and the combination provides mostly joy, though sometimes it can be piled on a little too thick.7.5/10* * * 1/2 / * * * *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Political Story With Some Good Messages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I started seriously collecting films in the mid '90s and discovered classic movies, this was one of the first famous classic films I watched. I found it a good movie, a very powerful one, but yet one I have not watched again, for some reason. I guess it wasn't that attractive to me to see multiple times.Yet, I can't criticize it. Jimmy Stewart is interesting as always, in the lead as "Jefferson Smith." Jean Arthur is the most fun of all the actors to watch in here and actually her "Clarissa Saunders" might be the lead character, not Stewart's. Claude Rains is so good that you want to punch his character, "Sen. Joseph Paine" right in the nose!I will say it's very dated, but some of that corny stuff adds to the enjoyment of the story. Some of it is refreshing, too, like the unashamed overt promotion of solid values, for instance - something Liberal viewers watching this must hate. You don't see that much patriotism or values-first themes in movies anymore.A good movie, but at 130 minutes a bit long and one that I would advise to rent first instead of purchasing blind because of its high reputation.</fullReview>

Movie had the usual 1940s era flaw of a strange, short ending (I'm not sure why they did that back then.) Jean Arthur was also so great. She was such a lovely lady. There seemed to be chemistry between her and Stewart, whether that was actual or acting. I really liked how they returned several times to the Lincoln Memorial and used the text placed there. Edward Arnold (whom I saw just the other day in another of his movies) certainly plays the corrupt politician well. I greatly disliked him by the end. I highly recommend everyone watch this movie, both for the acting and for the content. It'd be good to know there was still one honest person in Washington nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely not a great, timeless classic as many people imagine. However, it makes essential viewing if you're a fan of any of these - Jimmy Stewart, Frank Capra, 30s comedies. And yes, I'm a fan of all three. No wonder I fell for it.It is rather difficult to critically evaluate Capra's populist parables. Criticizing them is a bit like taking a spade to a soufflé! The movie works so compellingly on first viewing that one doesn't mind the numerous problems in its screenplay. The flaws become more apparent on multiple viewings.I don't think it ranks among the very best movies of the thirties. The first half which plays like a screwball comedy is positively brilliant. However Capra turns serious in the second half when there is no basis for seriousness.Nevertheless it makes wholesome family viewing. The performances, I must say, are exceptional without any exception.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is the classic story of an American Hero. After the death of the senate, they strive to search for a new candidate, yet not an honest one. Who's ever heard of an honest government official? They're looking for a guy that is a puppet. A puppet in the puppet master's show?they search for a coward that will do anything to be in and stay in the senate. Ironically, they find quite possibly the only man with true morals, Jeff Smith (Jimmy Stewart). Without going into too much detail about the movie, it must be said that the cast was brilliantly chosen. Jimmy Stewart is such a spectacular actor and can light even the darkest of a character. The fact that he's portraying an honest, caring man does him even better. Every line is sincere, full, and alive. He has such talent and grace on the set. He was born to be an actor, and this movie was lucky to have him. Jean Arthur put on a magnificent show. She was sheik but tough, distressed, but strong. In addition to the acting, the plot was solid?flawless and catching. It got very slow and drawn out at times, but nonetheless, it was amazing. Frank Capra didn't go wrong in making this film. All in all, this film is definitely a keeper and very recommended. Having an overall score of 8.4/10 stars, this viewer doesn't disagree. A solid 8 for an astonishing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rusalka's twenty-first film review: An American Morality Play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1937, Columbia Pictures optioned Lewis R. Foster's original screen story, "the Gentleman from Montana." The studio's ace director Frank Capra, read a one page synopsis and passed on the project. Columbia then sent the story to Rouben Mamoulian, who agreed to make the film. Upon hearing this, Capra reread the synopsis, changed his mind, and offered Mamoulian Golden Boy for the property.On August 10, 1938, Columbia announced the project as Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington with Gary Cooper reprising his Longfellow Deeds character. Months later, Samuel Goldwyn, with whom Cooper had an exclusive contract, decided not to loan out the actor to Columbia. Capra recast the film with his star of You Can't Take It With You, James Stewart.The film was renamed Mr. Smith Goes to Washington on January 26, 1939. Production began on April 3. While some location work was done in Washington, the majority of the film was done at Columbia's Gower Street studio. The major set piece was an exact replica of the Senate Floor, built by art director Lionel Banks at a cost of $100,000. It was here, over the course of four weeks, that Stewart performed the climactic filibuster scene. To give his voice the proper hoarseness, Stewart had his throat painted repeatedly with a mercury solution. Production was completed on July 7, 1939.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington had its world premiere in the nation's capital on October 19, 1939. Every senator and representative was invited to the screening, as well as the Washington Press Club. Depicted as drunks and theives, they denounced the film as un-American. More controversial was the offer by several sister studios to buy the negative and destroy it, fearful that the Axis powers would use the film for propaganda reasons. Studio president Harry Cohn refused and proceeded to distribute the film across the country.Although critics and audiences loved Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, it was an extremely expensive film to make ($1.5 million), and only broke even on its intial run. But Harry Cohn didn't make the film for profit, he made it for prestige. And that's what Capra gave him. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington recieved eleven Oscar nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (Claude Rains, Harry Carey), Best Music, Best Sound, Best Editing, Best Art Direction, and Best Screenplay (original story) --- winning in the latter category. A timeless populist masterpiece, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is, was and always will be "one of the best shows of the year."Mr rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Washington, D. C. Hollywood-style 1939</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is as close to a feel good film from the thirties as we're liable to get. When this was made in 1939, Hollywood was at its apex, churning out such films as Ninotchka, The Wizard of Oz and Gone With The Wind. This was the final film between Frank Capra and Columbia Pictures. This was also the film that gave Jimmy Stewart his first Academy Award Nomination. It is worth noting as you watch this film that when it was made, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was safely ensconced in the White House just a year away from finishing up his second term and running for an unprecedented third term (which he would win and lead America through World War II). I think the optimism that was beginning to shine through in the waning years of the Great Depression and in the pre-War era can definitely be seen throughout this film.Perhaps the film's greatest moment is towards the very end when Mr. Smith filibusters on the floor of the senate. This is gripping drama if there ever was any. Claude Rains gives a stunning performance as the token but vindictive Senator that attempts to destroy Mr. Smith's political goals and aspirations.This film is good tonic for anyone who has doubts about the truth in government and what a meritorious service it is to serve one's country at the highest levels. I strongly recommend this film to anyone wanting a good dose of old fashioned American politics.My rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living the Ideals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" premiered, the reaction on Capitol Hill was that the film was a gross distortion of reality. Certainly this was an understandable and in some respects not exactly unreasonable response from the members of the "world's greatest deliberative body", also known as the United States Senate. Capra had been pretty hard on them and their bosses back home, and they felt that they were neither as corrupt as Claude Rains' character nor as gullible (at least initially) as Jimmy Stewart's. But the senators' objections collapse against Capra's grasp of essential truths: politics is a rough business where an idealist has little or no place and where only the strong survive. The question Capra poses is where can an idealist find the strength to endure.The Hill credo, articulated by Sam Rayburn, long time Speaker of the House (and personally incorruptible), was "to get along, go along." Jefferson Smith (Stewart) decides not to go along and soon is fighting for his political life. Smith's final victory is only what audiences would expect, then or now. But the real high point of the film, and of Stewart's magnificent performance, is the filibuster sequence, Smith's fight rather than his triumph. As the tension builds and the odds mount against him, he proceeds undaunted. Miraculously, there is not a touch of self-righteousness in Smith, only earnestness born of the deepest conviction in the true greatness and promise of America. All of this in unbelievably moving, probably the most moving sequence in all of Capra's work. Here, in a faithless arena, stands a man whose faith is strong and unfailing; it must be because it's all Smith has. The miracle is that it's enough to see him through to the end, but the true beauty of the film is to see Smith live his faith and achieve his political survival by holding to his ideals, rather than by renouncing them.This leads to a question: was Jimmy Stewart really acting? He was, but surely Stewart believed everything Jefferson Smith said in his heroic filibuster. He was giving more than a performance, he was living his ideals on film. A few years later the actor was flying a B-24 over Germany and fighting for the beliefs of Jefferson Smith in the real world. Stewart not only lived his ideals, he was ready to die for them</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm far too much of a cynic about everything this movie stands for to really fully appreciate it. I've always hated the kind of sentimentality Capra espouses but I cannot deny that he is a great director. There is such sincerity in everything he does that even these themes that reek of over zealous sentimentality can actually feel compelling to an audience that just isn't susceptible to them. For one thing he always casted his films extremely well. 'Mr Smith Goes to Washington' is driven by it's excellent performances that turn these characters with motivations that seem so one dimensional into powerful representations of the optimistic world Capra so believed in. This is compelling despite all it's cartoon eccentricities. The fact is this is the most interesting Capra film. It shows a world that is dark and where Jefferson Smith is the only real idealist in it. It is an achievement equally shared by Capra and his brilliant cast headlined by Jimmy Stewart.Jimmy Stewart is really pitch perfect even when he plays seemingly simplistic characters in these type of films Stewart does have an ability to show the motivations and soul behind the nice guy persona and that isn't an easy thing to do. It's hard to remember his talent because the Stewart persona has become so iconic it's almost a parody. I like this representation. He isn't blatant or loud. There's some unspooling to be done with Jefferson Smith. He's a character that changes a great deal of the course of the film and we get to see that through Stewart's performance. His bright eyed idealism is in tune with the Stewart legend but the best moments from Stewart come when Smith begins to lose that hope. My favorite scene in the film is when he revisits the Lincoln Memorial after he learns the truth about the culture of corruption. Stewart is so good in this scene that he almost makes us forget the film we are watching and expect something tragic. This performance is essential in looking and assessing Jimmy Stewart as a an actor.My favorite performance comes from the great Claude Rains as the hardened career politician Senator Paine. This part could have very easily been a conventional villain especially in a black and white Capra world but Rains is brilliant here because we see that this character is more than appearances. He isn't black and white and like many men like him we get the feeling this character has repeated the lies until he believes them. I love the build up on Raines face as he listens to the classic filibuster ending. The writing rightly shows that men like Jefferson Smith come to Washington all the time with idealism but they end up becoming like Paine through compromise. Raines shows this. We can't hate this man. That he finds redemption in the end shows the best qualities about the American ideal that Capra loved. There's a lot of goofy stuff here. It's not a film that hesitates to engage in the most blatant over the top melodrama. It's also undoubtedly a piece of propaganda. The America in this film unfortunately is the concoction of storytellers and myth makers like Capra. Capra makes us believe and hope in it though. It's entertaining and silly but the sincere way it is told and acted captured the attention of a cynic like me. It's grade A 'Capra corn'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie of truths...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" is a drama movie in which we watch a man who is set to be a senator by the spineless governor of his state. He is a naive and idealistic and he wants to change everything starting from the building of a camp for children but his plans promptly collide with political corruption and there the true fight starts.I liked this movie because unfortunately shows us the truth that we all know but never want to believe or talk about it, political corruption and how this influence all of us and our lives. Also this movie also shows us the corruption of th press which is just a small part in the whole political corruption and has as a result the influence of people with lies in order for the companies or politicians to have bigger profit. I really liked the plot of this movie because it represents and shows all of the above. The interpretation of James Stewart who played as Jefferson Smith was simply outstanding and also good interpretation made by Jean Arthur who played as Saunders. Another one interpretation that has to be mentioned is Claude Rains who played as Senator Joseph Paine.Finally I have to say that "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" shows the truth about most of the politicians in many countries of the world who just want to earn more and more money. They do not care about anything else except that and have help from the press and media to succeed their goals. Although this movie also shows us also the other part of it, a decent man who believes in something that everyone forgot and fights for his believes until the end and never surrender, that's the true meaning of this movie and this we have to have as an example for our lives. So as you can understand I strongly recommend this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>compelling sincerity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Corrupt political boss Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) has a land scheme on a dam building project. When the US Senator dies, he wants the governor to put his man in the job. The governor gets overwhelmed and picks the head of the Boy Rangers Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). The junior Senator Smith is guided by the crooked Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) who was his father's friend. Smith is utterly naive and unfamiliar with Washington. He falls head over heals with Senator Paine's daughter Susan (Astrid Allwyn). Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur) is the dead senator's secretary. She has lost her idealism and faith in the system. Smith proposes a national boys camp. Saunders starts to believe. Donations pour in but the campsite turns out to be part of the dam project and threaten the political graft scheme.There is such overwhelming sincerity from Frank Capra that any cynicism is driven out. That's the beauty of this movie. It taps into the quintessential little guy against the big guys. Stewart is utterly believable as the completely naive common man. Arthur is a great broad with a heart of gold. The start is a bit of a chore until James Stewart and then Jean Arthur get on the screen. However it doesn't get much better in cinema than the Senate filibuster scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Educational and courageous - Stewart at his finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jimmy Stewart stars as Jefferson Smith, the leader of the Boy Rangers who was appointed by Governor Hopper (Guy Kibbe) as a new U.S. senator for his state. Realizing him having no prior political experience and his naivety, Hopper thought that Smith would be easy to manipulate. Once in Washington, Smith discovers the downsides of the political process as his first piece of legislation he introduced, producing a national boys' camp, leads to a conflict with state political boss Jim Taylor. Taylor tries to corrupt Smith and then attempts to destroy his reputation through a scandal, hoping to lead to his expulsion from the Senate. In on the scheme is the crooked Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains).Having first watched this film in a college government class, this movie is both educational and fascinating. You get to learn part of the legislative process of the U.S. Senate, including introduction of bills, the committee process and the filibuster. And, you get to see a good piece of cinema work with a captivating story and superb acting, from the corrupted Jim Taylor and Senator Paine concocting their scheme for political gain to the courageous Senator Smith trying to beat the political machine to seek the truth and fight for his constituents. Having the odds stacked against him, Smith presses on, showing the audience that even in a machine as big or tainted as the U.S. Senate or any other political institution could still yield a man of integrity and honesty. At the same time, you get to see the U.S. Senate in action, letting us see the political powerhouses as they debate the laws that will eventually affect our country. Even for a drama-genred golden oldie that is over two hours long, Director Frank Capra really kept the plot's momentum going strong and screen writers Sidney Buchman, Lewis R. Foster, and Myles Connolly wrote a fascinating script that really attracts the audience's attention. I thoroughly enjoyed this film - it is highly recommended.Grade A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The finished products of Jimmy Stewart under the direction of Frank Capra are nothing short of pure works of art.Who better than Stewart to play a popular yet naive hometown boy who goes to Washington where he is expected to be nothing more than an easily influenced clone for other senators and nothing to be taken seriously at all,only to end up a champion for what is decent and right.I consider Jefferson Smith a precursor to Rocky Balboa,because when you think about it,they are in fact,similar.Set up to fail,only to win big.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a joy to watch not only for it's story,but for the acting genius that was Jimmy Stewart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 102Honesty and righteousness. In Frank Capra's 'Mr.Smith Goes to Washington', you're going to learn a lot about those two things that all humans should strive towards. This is an inspiring film, and an American classic.Smith is a shy man with little confidence when we first meet him. And it was a shock when I first met him. I have only known James Stewart as George Bailey, arguably the swellest guy to ever grace the screen. He, in comparison, is charming and headstrong. So to see Stewart, stumbling over his words was really something. His performance is outstanding. From his humble beginning to drained, heartful end, we see a character transformed by outside forces and inner strength. But the titular character isn't the only standout. In fact, the entire cast is commendable. Jean Arthur is transformed from a cash-minded to a truth-minded person, with a growing liking for Smith like the characters in 'It Happened One Night'. Claude Reins is easy to hate as the political slimeball who thinks of himself more than the good of the people. As said before, the whole cast shines.I'd like to mention the beginning. Many older movies have very slow beginnings. Not this. Instantly we are thrown into the plot, with a series of phone calls and one hilarious "NO!" From there, the drama mounts, and the tempo stays high. 'Washington' could've been a dreadfully boring film. But Capra knew what he was doing. He has a thing for inspiration, eh? I would've given this film a low nine, if not for its one fault: the ending. The ending is so rushed. Right until the end, the film is a masterpiece, but then it just ends. The point is served, and we can draw our own conclusion, but 5 minutes of footage should've been added to settle things down. Capra would learn this several years later with his masterpiece, 'It's A Wonderful Life'.Themes of justice, sticking to your guns, corruption and more hit you like a political activist trying to drum up support. 'Washington' gives you many things to think about. And if not for the too-soon ending, it would be a masterpiece. 8.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Capra's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" was released in 1939, Frank Capra already had a trio of Best Director Oscars sitting on his mantle. His latest film was met with wide acclaim and at Oscar time it was rewarded with an impressive eleven nominations (winning one). Today, over seventy years later the film is rightly recognized as a classic.The story concerns idealistic senator Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) who is appointed to his position by superiors looking for someone who'll be seen and not heard. However, when Smith attempts to utilize his position for the good of his state's citizens he quickly finds that his proposed bill conflicts with an existing bill that was drafted with less than honourable intentions.The cast is, in a word, excellent. James Stewart's Oscar-nominated performance is the bedrock upon which the film is built. He brings a sense of nobility to the character that could have seemed phony in the hands of another actor. Jean Arthur's world-weary character is similar to the one she played in Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" and she once again does a fine job. The supporting cast also contains some noteworthy individuals. Claude Rains deservedly landed an Oscar nomination for his standout performance while Thomas Mitchell and Edward Arnold could easily have been similarly honoured. Harry Carey also scooped up an Oscar nomination for his performance though I don't think that it was really that extraordinary.The film's only Oscar win was for the original story. The fact that the plot has the usual Capraesque elements would seem to suggest predictability but the screenwriters do a fine job of getting us invested in what's transpiring on screen. Capra landed an Oscar nomination for his deft direction while the editing, sound and art direction were also awarded nominations. These were all important elements in the film's overall technical appeal, as was Dimitri Tiomkin's stirring score, which was also Oscar nominated.In the end, my only complaint about the film is that it seemed to drag slightly in the latter stages. This is perhaps unsurprising given the fact that the climax takes the form of a contest of endurance. Nevertheless, this amounts to the latter stages being merely good while the rest of the film is exceptional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic story about the triumph of the spirit?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd not seen this Frank Capra film before, so I was very happy to sit down recently to see it. A long time coming, but it was well worth the wait.The year 1939 saw some of the greatest of the classic Hollywood period: Gone with the Wind, Wuthering Heights, The Wizard of Oz, The Grapes of Wrath ? and of course, Mr Smith. Now, having seen this one, I have to say I like it better than the others.And that's strange for me because I don't much like fantasies ? because this story is a fantasy dressed up to look like a believable story. What makes this movie for me is, apart from Capra's directorial skill, the acting: all of the main actors ? James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Thomas Mitchell, Harry Carey, and H. B. Warner ? give flawless performances aided by a scintillating script from Sidney Buchanan.The story, as most know, revolves around a young man, Jefferson Smith (Stewart) who's pulled from obscurity to appointment to the US Senate, after the incumbent dies in office. Smith goes to Washington, sets up his office, engages a very engaging Clarissa Saunders (Arthur) as his PA, and sets about settling in. In doing so, he unsettles much of the sitting Senate when introducing a Bill for a Boy's Camp, to be built smack dab in the middle of an area where crooked senators had been finagling land sales prior to the construction of a new dam. Damn! They think?especially one Senator Paine (Rains), a real pain in the posterior for Smith as he sets about initiating a filibuster in the Senate to gain approval for the passage of his Boy's Camp Bill.Got all that? It's not so complicated, really, and it's a lot of fun watching the players as they jockey for position, to get the upper hand on the other. There's pathos as Smith staggers about, exhausted, dispirited, almost at wit's end. There's high drama, as Paine denounces Smith as a liar and charlatan. And, there's love, sweet love, as Saunders - chaste Saunders - comes back to help Smith with his filibuster.Today's audience would probably regard the story as so dated. In many ways, it is of course. There is, however, an overarching theme to this narrative that's contained in the US Constitution ? and in other democracies ? having something to do with government of the people, and so on...Some might even argue that it's over the top, and I suppose it is: how can you expect any new senator not to become corrupted by Washington, given the excesses of the last forty years or so? So, that's why Mr Smith is a fantasy: such a story exists only in your wildest dreams. It could never happen in real life. Could it? Well, this is 2008, and look around at what's happening...This is a film for all Capra fans. It's perhaps his best. And, I recommend it for all to see at least once.I also think it's a film that's still as relevant today as it was in 1939. In fact, I think it's one of those rare films like Casablanca (1942): it's timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jimmy Stewart wins hearts and minds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Stewart was perhaps the forefather of good old fashioned 'aw shucks' likability in American cinema. He represented the common man, so what better way to get the masses on his side than to show him railing against corporate greed and yet still emerging from the murky swamp with his sense of idealism unblemished? Here is a character to throw your support behind and root for like the noble prizefighter who just won't lay down. It may be emotion in the rah-rah and flag waving sense, but his commitment and integrity gets the blood pumping. Hopefully it gets people thinking that if Jefferson Smith were a real man then they'd vote for him. It would be a vote for decency - a quality which we tend to find is sadly lacking amongst politicians in general.If he were a fool then he wouldn't have my sympathy, but there's more to this guy than the simple patsy the top brass think they're recruiting... He has a few allies to help stiffen his resolve in the lions den, and one of the great pleasures beside the pure ethics of the tale is the canny way a gradual affection develops between Smith and his strong-willed secretary (Jean Arthur). It's traditional in virtually any setting to have a dash of romance that may well blossom, but don't let the earnest nature of Jefferson fool you into thinking it will be sappy. As the man becomes more confident in his new environment, he begins to get an education in all sorts of other ways, too - tastefully dealt with, of course. We as the audience learn along with him. Remarkably for a document of 1939, even as a basic civics lesson much of it hasn't dated and is disguised in an entertaining manner.It's cleverly set up from the beginning that Jefferson Smith is a reverent and respectful man, so for me the misty-eyed sentimentality that underpins the story never grated in the slightest. Part of his appeal is that his core values manage not to change, so it would have been a shame to see his character grow hardened.Mr. Smith got his shot at going to Washington. I urge you to take the trip with him. For anyone who still holds a shred of optimism in their hearts, it will not be a wasted journey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra's movies not really so corny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's movies are often criticized for being "corny".But actually, if you exclude the obligatory"happy ending', they are models of brutal reality and cynicism.I suspect that the happy endings were forced on Capra by both the studios and the censor,as the Hays Office wasn't merely concerned with sexual innuendos,but frowned on showing the "establishment" in too unpleasant a light.Certainly right up to the last minute,the picture of how Smith is being crushed by the political establishment,whose only concern is to protect its graft,is depressingly realistic.Then Capra had to pull his punch.Senator Paine's last minute crackup,unfortunately,is all too obviously impossible.People who get to such a high political position,and stay there for so long, no longer have any consciences or other decent feelings left.Perhaps Capra deliberately chose such an impossible "rescue" for Smith,as a way of showing the implausibility of this ending. It is impossible to say what state Capra was thinking of,but Taylor's henchman,the one that he tells the Governor to take orders from while Taylor is in Washington,has the last name "Allen". Huey Long's stooge, and flunky who took his place as governor of Louisiana, was O.K.Allen,which is suggestive.Certainly if he was looking for a corrupt "newspaper",he could have no better model than the New Orleans Times Picayune,then and now.While opposed to Long, it was and is the supporter and protector of the most corrupt local politicians in the country.One sterling example being former Mayor "Slimy Sidney" Barthelemy,who decimated the engineering department of the Sewage &amp; Water Board so that no one would object to the construction of the worthless floodwalls that collapsed and flooded the city.As someone once said,"You wouldn't have such corrupt government without a corrupt news media".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps Frank Capra's best directed film, if not necessarily his best overall film, Capra tells the story with an effective visual side, although praise should also be extended to the cinematography and the smart editing, which allows for speedy pacing without confusion, and which features informative montages as part of the editing design. In many ways, the film is similar to 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town', and it is not really better; instead of improving as it approaches the end, 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is weakest towards the end. It seems to have a nice, feel-good air to it, so a "happy" conclusion is easily predicted, and if that is not enough, the conclusion itself is contrived. The final twenty minutes in fact are rather messy, and even if well paced to begin with, this over-sentimental tale does not stretch too well over more than two hours. There is a lot that makes this film worth watching though, even with its detractors. As well as the already mentioned visuals, Claude Rains and Harry Carey are excellent in their supporting roles, and the film does provide some insight into the workings of the United States senate and related politics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie that makes those who are in fact U.S citizens glad to be such even though it shows corruption in the highest offices of the U.S legislative branch. The way this movie ends up with a patriotic image in the American mind set is quite amazing and the review would argue that the reason this movie does come of with such a patriotic view is that the hero of the movie is easy to relate to and like. Though the hero has strong beliefs about how the U.S is run and the greatness of it all his beliefs are shaken by a man who to him represents everything the America is supposed to stand for turns out to have given in to a political machine. When the hero of the movie finds out that everything he has believed as been a false front he fights and does something that no other senate has ever done he held the floor of the senate for over twenty four hours eventually outing the corruption that had befallen his state. The way the director was able to get away with presenting this corruption and still be seen as a patriot was that he kept the corruption small confined seemingly to one un-named state and eventually defeating it with the biggest patriot of all whom in this movie is Mr. Smith. The way this movie was written and filmed was genius it invokes suck a feeling of pride and patriotism it is almost scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jimmy Stewart is the famous `guy next-door' type of actor and certainly does well playing one. `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is a movie about good old-fashioned patriotism and the lack there-of in today's society. This movie was sweet but a little hard to get excited about; the small, very small, love story is really what kept this reviewer's interest and to say that the plot was riveting, well, would be a bit too much, in all honesty.  As stated before Jimmy Stewart (Jefferson Smith) did what he does best, and that's look handsome, play the part of a confused, yet loveable man and fall in love with the right woman. Having watched two other films that Stewart has starred in, this character is definitely the most straightforward and easiest to read, not exactly a round character. This is his early work and really what the story need though, so in this case it's completely acceptable. His love interest is a very pretty woman (Clarissa Saunders played by Jean Arthur) who most ladies can sympathize with because of the fact that Mr. Smith takes a little while to notice her in the way that she comes to notice him. The love story is truly a breath of fresh air compared to most today; there are no sex scenes or any inclination of any hanky-panky and that receives a huge applause from this reviewer where it seems that in every movie and every television show that people are `shacking it up' all the time. Besides the love story, the situation at hand is that a senator has suddenly passed away while a very important bill is at a critical point in the senate. The replacement needs to be a `yes-man', and naively the replacement is chosen to be Mr. Smith. Which at first seems to be the right one because he is in awe about EVERYTHING that goes on, even the young boys who help in the meetings know more than Mr. Smith does. Well eventually Mr. Smith gets his bearings with the help of his secretary and he soon discovers a scandal occurring involving his idol and father's best friend and this truly upsets the uncorrupted American patriot that is Mr. Smith and he soon tries all that he can to fix what's going on. The conclusion unfortunately is so abrupt and after all the time and energy invested in the scenes leading up to it, creates a bit of disappointment to the viewer. While the viewer really wants to applaud the attempts of Mr. Smith it's a bit of a cheesy ending and a bit unbelievable. However, this really opened the eyes of this reviewer to the means necessary to pass a bill, and how it's not just cut and dry, there has to be a lot of persuasion, not just `this is a good bill because' but more like `if you vote for this bill I'll do you a favor?'. This concept is really sad because it makes one wonder if that's what the founding fathers wanted congress to look like, if that's how things needed to be accomplished. Knowing that the good guys have honesty and scruples and that they wouldn't do things that way can lead to be really upsetting because they would be the ones to try to pass bills to help the good of the cause.  In essence this movie was decent, a `must-see'?; probably not, unless congress and politics really get your engine revving or if you're a big Jimmy Stewart fan. The plot is a bit basic and the ending predictable but it's a cute flick. The love story is the most interesting part for this reviewer but the politics were kind of interesting as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Frank Capra Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Mr. Smith goes to Washington' was directing by Frank Capra and released in 1939. It stars James Stewart as Jefferson Smith, Jean Arthurs as Clarissa Sanders, and Claude Rains as Sen. Paine. `Mr. Smith goes to Washington,' was a movie purely made for its time, and also was made for the American people. Being that is was a Frank Capra movie, with its heartfelt characters, `let's root for the underdog,' appeal, it truly grabs you and puts you on an emotional roller coaster. The film itself has been so jam packed with political propaganda and `let's all live for the American dream,' sometimes it can feel as if you are being brainwashed. Frank Capra was a man of genius knowing that what Americans like seeing is the underdog going in, being beaten to a pulp, and coming back from absolutely no where and winning his victory. And that is exactly what Mr. Smith is based on. So much so, even though Mr. Smith himself has stood his ground in the lion's den and fought back with all most not gaining anything, you can still tell the outcome, and when it does come you are still relieved, happy, and content with the way the movie ends. That is the mark of a well-made movie. Frank Capra really brings out the sympathy and compassion in people with this film, making people yearn for the political leaders to make the right and just decisions, giving them a sense that, if no one will stand up for justice, `I WILL!' James Stewart does a fantastic job of portraying this ordinary, wholesome man, with a Big American dream, peering up at the Lincoln memorial as if Abe himself were God. Overall, it was a well-made movie with superior acting, although sometimes a little overdone. You can tell this is a Frank Capra film. I give it 8.5 out 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a grand film!Mr. Smith goes to Washington is such a spectacular film. Not necessarily one that keeps you on the edge of your seat, not unlike many other films of thetwentieth century, but it deals with somewhat realistic events. It deals with the point of view of an individual, not by some large-and-in-charge character wesee almost everyday, but by an average joe.This film has almost all the elements. Love, tragedy, passion, devotion, and almost documentary like. It is supported by a memorable cast that warms your heart everytime you watch it. It is the epitome of all lessons to stand up for what you believe in, and never give up hope, even with all bets against you.No modern day restoration can even come close to the real thing. JimmyStewart, Claude Rains and others are the best working cast that this century of film could see. It is a rarity to see such a dynamic film that deals with an ordinary, everyday person, and this film is just so that it can and will show you to stand up for what you believe in and never give up hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the presence of faith lost cause is golden. We all have dreams of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but one man sees that in his destiny. This is man, who starts out a boy and becomes a man in the world of Democracy, is Jefferson Smith (James Stewart).The movie starts out abrupt. A Senator dies and must be replaced by a puppet so to speak. After long harassment Mr. Smith gets elected and is shipped out to Washington D. C. Things start to unfold as he gets to know the dirty business that his town has swept under the bed. Will his sincerity be enough to persuade a Congress to the righteousness of the basic life of the United States of America?In retrospect of the quality of the flick the directing was two sandwiches short of a picnic. The `subtle' inclusion of the word liberty throughout the flick, and the constant reminder of patriot participation were laughable. The editing and cinematography was so choppy I couldn't help but giggle like a Japanese schoolgirl. However, I do understand part of the choppiness could be based on the restoration used to keep this flick alive.Since this flick had themes of propaganda I wasn't too fazed by how easily someone with money can control power. That was until I recalled the 2000 presidential election. There was so much corruption in that election that it made me sad. Also, I don't know if society will ever have a happy ending. I would recommend this flick to people who like Jimmy Stewart, and those who like a grand old time looking back on old views of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is an honest and witty tale of the American political game. It also tells the tale of what happens when a simple and divine man suddenly decides to step into that game and play hardball. Jimmy Stewart gives his greatest performance in Frank Capra's funny and deliciously realistic take on the American political spectrum. This is truly a masterpiece of epic proportions with masterful writing, brilliant acting on the part of Jimmy Stewart as Jefferson Smith, Claude Raines as Sen. Joseph Paine and Jean Arthur as Saunders, and extraordinary filmmaking on the part of Frank Capra. It is truly a classic among classics and should have taken Best Picture away from Gone with the Wind in 1939. The same could be said about Jimmy Stewart who did not take home Best Actor for his performance in this movie. However, he did take it home the following year for his role as a reporter in The Philadelphia Story. However, that performance does not even come close to the subtleness of his performance as Mr. Smith. Complete with scandal, love, and history that would blow your mind, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is truly a film that the whole family could enjoy and demonstrates how brilliant a filmmaker that Frank Capra truly was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is quite easily one of *those* classic films that everyone has heard of but not everyone has seen. It's referenced in everything, from television programmes like The Simpsons through to American Politics textbooks. It's got that glowing word-of-mouth aura about it, kind of like another of Frank Capra and James Stewart's collaborations, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. You know the story even before you see the film: James Stewart plays small-town community hero and full-time Boy Ranger Jefferson Smith, the idealistic naive kind of guy who's an aw-shucks patriot and can quote chunks of Lincoln and Washington off the top of his head. When one of the sitting senators in his state passes away, the massive political machine controlling and choking the state, headed by the ruthless James Taylor (Edward Arnold), goes into action. It's already bought out the senior Senator, Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains), and attempts to break Jeff's back when he does finally go to Washington and his idealistic hope of setting up a national boys' camp in his home-state runs smack against a dam-building graft scheme Mr. Taylor is currently hatching. With the help of sassy, worldly Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), Jeff sets out to prove not only that he is innocent, but that his faith in his ideals and principles will win him the world and the respect he deserves, all this through an absolutely cracking filibuster that takes up the last fifth or so of the film. There is much to recommend MR SMITH, but I'd like to concentrate on the acting. Three actors deserve special praise for their work showcased in this film, although the supporting cast is also excellent, from the page boys in the Senate Room through to Governor 'Happy' Hopper (Guy Kibbee), the sympathetic Senate President (Harry Carey), and of course, Edward Arnold as Jim Taylor is as crusty and mean as ever. However, the three top-billed stars must also take top acting honours. Jean Arthur is excellent as 'Call me Clarissa only if you mean it' Saunders--she's completely believable from first to last, from her initial skepticism about the "Daniel Boone" she was going to have to shepherd around, through to her last impassioned fight for and with Jefferson Smith to win through against the Taylor political machine and the Senate. It's easy to believe her when hardboiled city gal Saunders listens to Smith waxing lyrical about nature, about the wonders of the American system and political symbols, and melts--her drunk scene when she keeps promising to marry her buddy Diz Moore (Thomas Mitchell) because she doesn't yet know that she's already in love with Jeff is great to watch. One really cannot help but adore Arthur, always sweet, real, and very much a Capra heroine (see YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU, MR DEEDS GOES TO TOWN etc.).Claude Rains is, as usual, excellent in his role as Senator Paine: he creates a character who is flawed but essentially good, someone who is so used to 20 years of taking orders from someone else that he can believe he's just 'compromising'. It takes Jefferson Smith, of course, to make Paine realise that there can be no compromising one's ideals without losing something even more important--one's integrity. Paine's final impassioned scene, when he bursts back into the Senate hall, is a fabulous display of deep self-disgust. Rains truly is one of the most undeservedly unknown actors of his generation: a rare chameleon who blends into every role he plays so much so that he's appeared in some of the most famous film classics of all time (aside from MR SMITH, he also plays key roles in CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS, to name just two), and is not only as well-known for it as he should be, but also isn't often recognised from film to film! His performance is MR SMITH is no exception: pitch-perfect and utterly credible.Finally, we come to James Stewart's Jefferson Smith, what must surely be one of the best performances ever committed to film--not just of Stewart's own filmography, but of every screen actor to date. He makes a potentially hokey, foolish character a real person, someone you'd really like to meet some day. By the end of the film you're cheering Smith on without reservation, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that you *believe* Stewart as Smith. From his first stuttery speech down to his final powerful filibuster, Stewart makes the role his. No person, dead or alive, could take on the role and hope to perform anywhere as well as Stewart has done. It would take some doing to keep the Washington sightseeing scenes from being oversentimental, and Capra manages to do so only when Stewart's expressive face is pictured onscreen, marvelling at these symbols of democracy and the American Way. (The flag montage goes on far too long for my taste.) Moreover, his filibuster scene alone could have won him lifetime achievement awards. Whether fired from within or aided by mercury (Stewart requested that his throat be painted with it so that it would be appropriately hoarse while filming the later hours of his marathon filibuster), it's quite a sight to behold. The fact that the Academy Award didn't go to him in this year is a travesty only slightly mitigated by his win in the same category the following year for THE PHILADELPHIA STORY. This film, however, truly contains the archetypal James Stewart character--an idealistic everyman-hero who loses confidence in himself but always comes through on top in the end.If it isn't evident enough by now, the performances given in this film by the three top-billed actors is reason enough to watch it. However, MR SMITH also has a great script, fantastic production values, and a wonderful message. It may be Capra-corn, but it's Capra-corn of the first order, and will make you both smile and cry and believe that the world is a much better place than you thought it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Stewart made me cry..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being an American citizen, I've always been wary (and more than a bit cynical) of all the flag-waving star-spangled U.S. patriotism and the grand illusions that the country claims to stand for. However, 'Mr Smith Goes To Washington' reminds me that my cynicism is merely a by-product of the corruption and b**tardization of what, in it's essence, is a country based on some wonderful ideals, not in fact of the country itself. James Stewart conveys the idealism and naivete and (all to rare) honest-to-God decency of newly appointed Senator Jefferson Smith to absolute perfection. I really believe that this is Jimmy Stewart's finest hour. It's damn near impossible not to be deeply touched by his performance. He puts across with real depth of feeling the character's complete conviction and belief in the fundamental moral elements that the United States was built on, and also his complete heartbreak when he realizes that all is not so clean and constitutional in his nations capital as he had perhaps always believed. The rest of the cast provides first rate support, the direction (Capra at his best) is impeccable, the script is smart, touching, witty.. you really couldn't ask for much more from a film. If you only see one James Stewart movie (or one Frank Capra movie for that matter) try and make it this one. 10/10.</fullReview>

James Stewart was my favorite character because he never gave up to build a boys camp at willow creek were the dam was being built.

		<fullReview>but the end was much too abrupt. The senior Senator's blurted confession on the Senate floor did the work of Smith's boys back home a bad service and their efforts were wasted. I had been looking forward to their success in getting the word out, never mind that it was just one city &amp; just boys on bikes or with wagons. The Machine's goon tactics needed to be exposed and Taylor &amp; the Gov should've been brought low. I suppose one could assume all that would happen after the film's end, but I wanted to see it for myself. Most especially the triumph of the boys. What was it anyway that finally crumbled Payne's cookie? He stormed out, then we heard "gunshots" (I thought he'd suicided...it would have been more in character than what did happen), then he stormed back in to make his confession...and I don't understand why. Maybe he somehow learned of the hurts suffered by the home boys. Of course the movie would have run somewhat longer had they gone the suicide-&amp;-exposure route. Finally, I must say I really enjoyed the work done by Harry Carey as the Vice President. I got the impression that he enjoyed doing it. Had I my choice of parts to play in this production, for sure his is the role I'd choose.But no more than 9-of-10...darn!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A corrupt state pork-barrel machine sends a stripling do-gooder to Washington as its junior senator. The idealistic young man refuses to be duped by his cynical masters, and in a heroic filibuster speaks out for youth, liberty and the American Way. This amiable tosh is classic Frank Capra material, with a very young and (it has to be said) somewhat wooden James Stewart as Jefferson Smith, the clean-cut patriotic hero. Jean Arthur is great as Saunders, the quick-witted factotum who falls in love with Smith during his 'liberty' speech. "Do you mind if I give you a rough idea of what you're up against?" she asks the boyish senator, then pitches in on the side of David against Goliath. Her knowledge of congressional procedure enables the filibuster to work. Boss Jim Taylor runs his home state like a personal fiefdom. The politicians are all in his pocket, from the ineffectual governor 'Happy' Hopper (Guy Kibbee) to Joe Paine the distinguished senator (Claude Raines). When Paine's senatorial partner dies suddenly, the governor is empowered by the constitution to nominate a replacement. Boss Jim Taylor wants an innocent nobody who won't pry into the lucrative dam-building project that he is setting up. Young Jefferson Smith, with his youth-leader credentials, seems the perfect fall guy. "Keep Smith away from anything that smacks of politics," orders Taylor. Joe Paine was once an honest man. In his youth he worked with Jeff Smith's father on a campaigning, anti-graft news sheet. Now he is Boss Taylor's placeman, given the job of steering the Dam Scam through the Senate. He is also told to 'supervise' the young senator with the high ideals. When Jeff's broadsheet, "Boy's Stuff", is mobilised in defence of liberty, Paine is poignantly reminded of his lost integrity. Washington has corrupted him. No wonder that Saunders tells Jeff, "This is no place for you - you're halfway decent!" Is Jeff "the greatest hero we ever had"? Or is he "the simpleton of all time"? Perhaps the two are not incompatible in a film which equates naivety with moral strength and sophistication with sleaze. The newly-arrived junior senator goes into raptures at the sight of the Capitol, and wanders off in a patriotic daydream, "lost in the wilds of Washington". The Lincoln Memorial is lovingly filmed and the Liberty Bell sequence is stirring, even though it teeters over into sentimentality. Little wonder that when the newspaper man's woozy head clears, he thinks he has been punched by George Washington. Jeff has the monolithic righteousness of the First American. Some aspects of this celebration of American values are hard to swallow. Would a state governor, even a corrupt one, really nominate a callow know-nothing to serve in the Senate? How come Saunders knows to turn up at the Lincoln Memorial? The Privileges and Elections Committee investigation is dropped without being resolved, and Joe Paine's abject volte-face is simply ridiculous. Harry Carey is great as the benign president of the Senate, but his tolerance of the young senator doesn't need to be laboured as clumsily as this. It is demeaning (and unnecessary) to have him giggling behind his hand. And yet this tale of "plain, decent, everyday common rightness" isn't all lumbering awakwardness. The photography is actually rather stylish. We see the grey suits of the state 'machine' making their corrupt deals in the shadows, and the talk between Jeff and Saunders inside the Lincoln Memorial is beautifully shot in almost-darkness, signifying that Jeff's morale is at its lowest ebb. When Jeff confronts Paine on the floor of the Senate, the young man's face is given the strongest position on the screen (upper right centre) while the old charlatan's head is in the correspondingly weakest spot (lower left centre). The purpose of the film is to reassure ordinary Americans that their institutions are not infested by graft, and that the little guy, if he is decent and sincere, can defeat the corrupt machine. All he needs is the courage to stand up and say, "No sir - I will not yield!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film's appeal has not diminished much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(WARNING -CONTAINS SPOILER) The freshness and appeal of the dialogue and characterizations and the portrayal of overwhelming institutional machinations that threaten to leave American ideals in the dust has not diminished that much. Of course , much of it seems quaint now - strangely located somewhere between realism and folksiness: The movie convincingly establishes the silly/Quixotic nature of Stewart's attempt to draft a Senate bill in one night - so when he actually achieves in doing so, it's hard not to see it as an abandonment of seriousness, a surrender to dreaminess. Stewart only wins his cause, after all, through a rather abrupt, bizarre crack-up by Rains - something of a deus ex machina that leaves the corrupt jungle largely unscathed. Of course, it could hardly be otherwise, but the movie might have aged better had it acknowledged the limitations of its story. Maybe that's why the scene where the newsmen gang up on Stewart and mock him as an ineffectual seat-filler has a nastiness and bite exceeding anything else in the film - a rationality that the more contrived, idealistic plot developments can't push away. The film certainly zips by though, and the evocation of Stewart's patriotic wide-eyed wonderment when he first comes to Washington is still stirring: maybe Capra couldn't grapple in much complexity with the actual status of such idealism in modern government, but then not many movies have managed it since then either.</fullReview>

I don't think any remake can be as brilliant and excellent as the original. I instantly loved this movie which is as honest as its main character Jeff Smith. After the sudden death of a senator Jeff Smith who is popular among children is named senator. He gets himself into a lot more then he bargains for when refuses to go with the plans for a dam. This movie gives the audience an interesting look into the inner workings of the American senate. A powerful and compelling movie that leaves the viewer guessing as to what will happen next.

Like honesty and the American spirit of adventure and patriotism. No one but Jimmy Stewart could have been cast for this role. He even reprised this naive, idealistic type character in the film "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" I rarely agree with The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but they were right in nominating Stewart for "Best Actor" of 1939. He did not win, but that year was packed with outstanding performances and excellent films. He was awarded the "Best Actor" by the New York Film Critics Circle Awards. Jimmy Stewart's 'Filibuster' performance was by itself worthy of an Oscar. A fine film that never goes out of date.

		<shortDescription>A classic today, but 60 years ago Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was one of the first movies to spark controversy inside the beltway.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thirty years ago, I was you," says Senator Paine to the young, idealistic Jefferson Smith, "but I learned to compromise."The film is Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, the story of a man who takes on the political system, refuses to compromise, and still wins. Unrealistic? Perhaps, but director Frank Capra takes an Oscar winning story by Lewis Foster, combines it with James Stewart's virtuous portrayal of innocent every man Jefferson Smith, and makes audiences once again believe that "lost causes" really are "the causes worth fighting for."Yet in the cloakrooms of Washington this positive message was not embraced. The controversy surfaced in the October 5, 1939 edition of Variety featuring the front-page headline, "Capra's 'Mr. Smith' Goes to Washington and Solons, Seemingly, Can't Take It.""Infamous," "treasonable," "disgusting," and "outrageous," were only a few of the sizzling adjectives used by lawmakers to describe the film.The uproar, according to Variety, stemmed from the "too close to the average lawmaker" depiction of 'Senator Paine,' a character who mentors freshman Senator Jefferson Smith only to turn on him. It was also reported that the film's virtue-will-triumph approach had no impact on irate congressmen who insisted that the picture reflected poorly on the dignity and integrity of the Senate.Incidentally, this added publicity, along with the film's strong reviews and word of mouth, resulted in bullish box office. Opening at Radio City Music Hall, Mr. Smith quickly became the biggest hit in town, earning $110,000 its first week. This was followed by big openings in Buffalo ($15,000 its first week), Cincinnati ($16,500), Detroit ($17,000) and Philadelphia ($22,000). It even pulled $15,000 in Cleveland the same weekend as a traffic- stopping Notre Dame-Navy football game attended by over 80,000 people.Today, as we near the 60-year anniversary of the film's release, it stands as an unlikely early target of vicious attacks by lawmakers who feared its impact on the minds of film patrons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Capra Americana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes To Washington is my second favourite Capra film to perennial Christmas favourite It's A Wonderful Life. This film has all of the elements that make a great film and still holds a slight bit of romance in the plot to keep the film exciting. If Capra ever intended to make a film based on Americana this one would surely fit the mould. Constant images of the historical landmarks that make Washington what it is are reminders of the greatness of this nation and the freedom that holds it together.The plot idea of corruption in the U.S. Senate may have been the first of its kind. Jimmy Stewart plays the small-town politician who is chosen to replace a recently-deceased Senator. He is chosen because the powers that be believe that he will vote the way they want him to and not raise a fuss when asked to. However, when Stewart decides on an initiative that contradicts the plans that the higher-ups have, they raise a scandal that nearly destroys him, his beliefs in what America stands for and provides us with one of the greatest performances ever caught on film.Capra's direction is flawless, capturing the feel of tradition in Washington and producing the best acting from Stewart, Jean Arthur and Claude Rains. The manner in which we see the protagonist bent but not broken has been duplicated by so many other filmmakers, but never really done quite as well. The performances by Allen and Rains each added great scenes to this film, especially in the last hour when the good vs. evil battle is at its peak. I don't believe that any actor at the time could have given a more convincing performance than Claude Rains.This film is another great Hollywood classic that I have been fortunate enough to see and I would recommend it to all.9/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This super film brings together the talents of James Stewart and Frank Capra for one of many successful outings. Stewart is Jefferson Smith, who finds himself a Senator ill equipped for the corruption that surrounds him.It's a brilliant turn from Stewart. He plays the naive yet thoroughly decent Smith with charm and wit, and is wonderfully supported by Jean Arthur as his assistant, Saunders. Her abject cynicism is slowly eroded by the innocent values of the new Senator, and she falls in love. This love story serves the story beautifully, as both actors and Capra tug at our heartstrings and draw us into the drama.There is also fine support from Claude Rains as Joseph Paine, Smith's mentor, and Harry Carey as the President of the Senate. Put all of this together and you have a gem of a movie. The triumph of good over evil, the lone voice over the conglomerate, and small town values over big city corruption, added to a touching and affecting love story told with charm and humour, creates something very special. This is a film to make you feel better about the world and your fellow man. It's a beautiful piece of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A vacant senate seat leads to naive but idealistic Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart) being picked as the replacement. The political machine of nefarious "boss" Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) is behind Smith because they believe he is gullible and can be made to vote however they want. But when a bill Smith wants to push through for a boys camp comes into conflict with a graft-laden bill Taylor wants pushed through, the young Senator gets a lesson the hard way in Washington politics. Before Smith's knocked out for the count, he gets help from a seasoned political aide (Jean Arthur) who has fallen in love with his goodness and honesty. Together they take on the Taylor machine and Washington's corruptness.Earnest, sentimental classic from the master of the sentimental, Frank Capra. Stewart gives a tour-de-force performance, particularly in the second half. He's helped ably by Arthur, Arnold, and the venerable Claude Rains as an elder statesman who gave in to corruption long ago. It really is a terrific cast from top to bottom. Worthy of singling out among the support though are Thomas Mitchell and Harry Carey, Sr. Mitchell is great as Arthur's reporter friend. This, of course, would not be the last film he made with Capra and Stewart. Harry Carey almost steals the movie and he's only in it here and there. His total screen time doesn't amount to much but in every scene he's amazing with subtle facial expressions and a knowingness in his performance that comes with experience. This is really a phenomenal film. Patriotic and unabashedly so. They don't make 'em like this anymore. A must-see for everybody and a truly classic film.</fullReview>

Jimmy Stewart's character early on is sometimes too naive to be believable for someone raised by a newspaper editor, someone who has studied American history as thoroughly as he has.But when this movie is good, it is as good as any movie ever made, and I do not say that lightly.Much of the power of this movie is in the uncompromisingly negative portrayal of political corruption, embodied in the brilliant performance of Edward Arnold, always a fine character actor, at his very best. His cold-hearted ruthlessness and drive never go over the line into caricature; he is always devastatingly believable, enough to send chills down your spine.Claude Raines, another very fine character actor, gives perhaps the most well-rounded performance in the movie, as a once idealistic politician who has allowed himself to abandon all sense of honesty in the pursuit of personal gratification, only to have his former, almost forgotten self brought back to him by the son of an almost forgotten former friend. Few modern American movies made for the general public would dare to portray such a character as so capable of duplicity for so long.Jean Arthur is good, but her part is perhaps the least natural and most preachy. Eugene Palette actually gets a significant role as another corrupt politico and does a first rate job of it.But then there is Stewart at his best, as well. Once his character, Jefferson Smith, gets shaken out of his naiveté and comes to grips with the ugly reality of congressional politics, he delivers a performance as riveting as any I have ever seen on film.This is no cheerfully optimistic Capra movie. In the end, Stewart wins not because the system works - in fact, it completely fails him - but only because one man slips over the edge. Once that happens, the movie ends two minutes later. The rejoicing is brief, because in fact Stewart's character, giving his best, cannot triumph over the Senate's corruption and indifference. Good does not win out over evil because it is better. It therefore left me with a most unpleasant feeling: politics IS as corrupt as we fear in our worst moments.If you have never seen this movie, be sure to catch it. It is not another Capra feel-good movie. It is a masterfully constructed, by no means optimistic, and sometimes bone-chillingly pessimistic view of our democracy.----------------------------I watched this movie again tonight. Once it gets going in the Senate chamber, this movie is riveting, as good as movies get. Stewart's performance is unbeatable, directed magnificently by Capra. But again, as I wrote before, this is not an optimistic, feel-good movie. The Senate is corrupt, and goodness does not win it over or change it. It is only because Claude Raines' Sen. Payne breaks down that the tide is turned. The movie ends two minutes later, as if to say that the whole group still smells so bad that Capra does not want to linger and deal with them further. I don't think that Congress is that corrupt today, but this movie is so well made that it still chills me to the bone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Way Things Never Were</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Smith goes to Washington is a wonderfully powerful film about a single man who takes the corruption in Washigton head-on only to realize that the powers-that-be running this nation have no place for the virtues of the common man.If only all 100 senators on Capitol Hill had half the conviction of Jefferson Smith, then politics in America might not be thought of as such the ugly thing that it so often is. Portrayed beautifully by Jimmy Stewart, Smith embodies the virtues of the just and fair American man who, when called upon to do the right thing, will take a stand in an effort to revive the tenets of the documents we hold dear. Sadly, the brilliance of Frank Capra's film is that it demonstrates that men like Smith are a highly idealized vision of what an elected official (in this case an appointed official) can be. Thus, with the character of Smith, Capra and Stewart attempt to show that despite the special interests and power lobbying in Washington, that there could be men or women like him who simply want to make the best America they can--yet more likely, men like Smith don't exist or perhaps simply cannot exist.While Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is an inspiring film, it is serious about its message that it would really take more than one man with a false hope to change the nature of politics. In this way, the film has a timeless quality in that it is as relevant to contemporary political discourse as it was to politics of the day when it was produced. The enduring message of hope that there is a power from within each of us to fight for what is right is what makes this film such an important classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful and Still Timely Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a superb film about power, about how it can be used. People think of Frank Capra in an idealistic fashion, but, while this film has a de rigeur happy ending, the story it tells isn't a very cheerful one. The truths that are in the film about politics are truths that are still central to us today.Senator Paine defends himself, "I've done a thousand good things in the Senate. Our state has the lowest unemployment and the highest Federal grants. I've been a good Senator." It is a measure of the man and his philosophy, so central to so many pols then and now, that being a good Senator is identified with by the pork you can bring home to your district, while in the meantime you can sacrifice principles and ideals to get along. Paine compromises, as our Senators do today. When Taylor says to Smith of his congressional colleagues, "they don't have to worry about being re-elected, they have good lives, they take my advice", is it Jim Taylor or Jack Abramoff talking? And isn't the willingness of our current Senators to listen to K Street in preference to their constituents the exact same as Paine's willingness to do buddy buddy with Taylor? Nor are the truths this movie tells limited to the politicians alone. We talk a lot these days about media bias. Has this ever been more gracefully delineated than the scene where Saunders' press friend is dictating a piece that starts with, "The Senate rose as a body and walked out in protest of Senator Smith" and then, when Saunders rushes up and informs him that "he has to fight for it" suddenly the lead is recast, as "A tremendous David and Goliath story, with a David unarmed even with a slingshot..." or something close to that. Without even commenting, Capra shows us how the very choice of words used by the press conveys their own bias. Neither Fox News nor Jon Stewart had anything on Capra.Even the notion of idealism, as best represented by the boys in their attempt to get Smith's story out, has the harsh light of truth shone upon it: that force in the service of profit will always triumph over idealism. There is nothing idealistic in the image of boys being run off the road by those uncaring of what the consequences of their use of force might do.These realities may be wrapped up in candy cane wrapper, but they are there for those willing to open their eyes.Nor do I think that Capra is any dummy. The exaggerated denouement is, I think, an exercise in sarcasm, sort of a "here, this will make the reality of your governance palatable to you, since otherwise you can't 'face the truth' ha ha ." And by the quality of the comments, I'd say he succeeded in pulling the wool over most of the viewers' eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sentimental at some points...still culturally and universally an important movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Gore Vidal put it once: "'Politics' is made up of two words. 'Poli,' which is Greek for 'many,' and 'tics,' which are bloodsucking insects." Mr Smith Goes to Washinton is such a movie that satirizes how politics work far cry from how it should really work for the benefit of people who elect those who run this system.It's the story of Jefferson Smith, the honest and right-minded leader of the Boy Rangers, who is appointed on a senatorship by the weak-kneed governor of his state when a senator dies before he completes his term of office.When he is sent to Washington he is taken under the protective care of a corrupt and miscreant senator whom he naively idolizes because he was his late father's best and oldest friend. As time goes on however Mr Smith doesn't turn out to be a yes man as would be expected from those who run the political machine. He becomes progressively dismayed at how politics works for interests not people's good will.And with the help of Saunders who is supposed to take care of this naive guy at first he starts an honest fight.This plot is a really good and inspiring one.I am not surprised to learn that "When it was first released, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was attacked as an anti-American pro-Communist film for its portrayal of corruption in American Government.The film was banned in Nazi Germany, and in other Fascist countries such as Italy and Spain, dubbing was used to alter the message of the film to conform with official ideology, according to Capra. " Because the movie blisters the mechanism of realpolitik,political corruption within any state's political machine, and guards the ethical values that any nation has.Such a movie may have been made by another nation I could say as a non-American viewer but it seems American had the guts to do it back then.I agree with people who claim the movie was dewy sentimental and overboard at some points like a longest filibuster or seeing almost every monument in one day and become over-patriotic under the effect of a dome.So I can say this one is not as good as "It's a Wonderful Life" but it is still a culturally and universally important movie.You see politics will always stay the same but still there will be always books,movies,journals,directors etc..who will fight against this juggernaut.</fullReview>

This was my second time to see it!! The cast was great. Jimmy Stewart played Jeff Smith, an HONEST MAN (unlike Bush) and was appointed to the Senate. He wanted to overturn the corrupt POLITICAL MACHINE!!! He hated this Jim Taylor guy and so did I. Harry Carey was great as the Senate president. I liked the way he always SMIRKED and smiled. I hated some of the senators. Thank god Claude Raines's character came to his senses. The FILIBUSTER was great. Jimmy Stewart, in real life, stayed up 38 hours to add an element of realism. Howard Stern thinks James Stewart was kind of gay in real life and that his agents made him be with prostitutes to prove he was indeed NOT GAY! Any way, if you hate Bush you will love this movie. We need Mr. Smith in the WHITE HOUSE. Where are you Mr. Smith? The USA needs you in 2006!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in awhile, the Hollywood movie machine feels it necessary to punch out a worthless piece of celluloid in order to boost the spirit of the nation. An inspirational piece about sports teams or underdog individuals doing the impossible; and occasional a piece supporting patriots and patriotism. This was exactly the feeling behind the creation of perhaps one of the best patriotic movies ever to come out of Hollywood: Frank Capra's, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. `Mr. Smith' came out at a time when the nation was rebuilding after the Depression and before the beginning of World War II. America needed a boost to help its people get back on the right track. And with one of the era's most infallible stars, Jimmy Stewart at the helm, this movie was just the encouragement the public needed. With such a simple title and premise, Frank Capra had created a very moving and inspirational film. A story of courage under fire and standing up for the unalienable rights of all human beings. The title character is perfectly cast and Mr. Stewart does his best to pull off the upset. His skills and charisma on-screen are best suited to portray such a `fish out of water' person like Jeff Smith. The writing and direction are exceptional and the themes are very strong throughout. I would also have to admit that this film may have renewed my faith in our governmental body. (Well? maybe not.) It may inspire its audience, however. With such a tightly weaved plot, great acting and deep meanings rooted in the American spirit, it's no wonder this film has been rated so highly. Maybe after viewing it you may be on your way to Washington for the same reason.Overall rating for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington : A </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Politicians are whores. This we know to be fact.So what makes anyone think the idealistic Mr. Smith in MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON would not buckle at the knees and subscribe to the corruption inherent in the system, were his career drawn out long enough? Alan Grayson, the real life Democratic Florida senator in the 2009 Health Care Reform battle, is being called Mr. Smith. He swoops into a fray where his own party has exhibited such gutlessness, that by simply by telling the truth, he is being called an "idealist." Director Frank Capra's MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is a paean to idealists. If it weren't for Mr. Grayson illustrating that idealists still skulk the dread halls of Congress, MR SMITH would look like pure fantasy...No sex, no violence, no swearing, we wonder whether this is a tale involving congress at all. Then we see how a spineless governor is forced into appointing a junior senator to be a puppet of the Senate and we see that politics back in 1939 (before they invented sex, violence and swearing) worked a lot like it does these days.When we see how the spineless governor appoints the junior senator - through a coin toss - we realize it's *exactly* how politics works these days.James Stewart is Jefferson Smith, the young, naive senator. When Smith arrives in Washington D.C., it's Idealism City, as he goes tramping through a montage, visiting the landmarks: the Liberty Bell, the Capitol Building, the Constitution, the White House, the Lincoln Memorial with its inspiring words carved into a wall, that mean absolutely nothing to modern politicians. Patriotic themes, American flags superimposed flying proudly over the montage...Smith's reaction is that of a mildly retarded yokel, and when he is skewered in the newspapers for his naivete, he goes around punching out all the offending reporters. Frank Capra may be a renowned director, but how childish is this cringe-tastic scene? Not one of the reporters who smeared Smith thinks to further smear him for his lunatic reaction of spending all day hunting them out in pubs and punching them.Idealistic Smith meets his secretary, the smug Saunders (Jean Arthur), who educates him in the cynical ways of Washington. This is probably the only film where discussing how a bill goes through congress is foreplay. After Saunders describes the near impossibility of shepherding a bill through congress (like then, as now), Smith is idealistic/stupid enough to reply, "Shall we start writing it now or after dinner?" His cause becomes lobbying for funding for a Boy's Camp - unlike today, the politicians who lobbied for underage boys back then were never caught with their hands down those boys' pants.Saunders does dissuade Smith for a moment - until he gives her Obama Speech Number 21 (that inspiring one) and she goes into soft focus so much the filmstock nearly deteriorated, until they started working on that sexy bill, bodies writhing in sensual penmanship.Of course, bills do get passed in Congress - for idealistic reasons or otherwise (usually otherwise) - but Smith annoyingly insists on being so Luke Skywalker about it. Which is understandable, as Smith's character is an much a fantasy as Skywalker's. (But there's that Alan Grayson thing...) Smith discovers his hero and mentor, Senator Paine, is part of the corrupt system that he rails against, and is so crushed he goes into idealism overdrive for his Boys Camp funding. Until Paine double-crosses him and Swiftboats him before Swiftboating was invented.When Smith sees 50,000 letters protesting him, his overacting goes into orbit to combat the corruption. To combat Smith's overacting, Paine steps up his own overacting, storming into Congress and shouting a confession at the top of his voice on the "rotten political corruption of the state." You have more chance of destroying a Death Star by firing into a vent no bigger than a womp rat than of hearing an American congressman calling himself and the system corrupt.MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is lauded as one of the great American films. But it is embarrassing idealistic idiocy. Without any solutions. It relies on the age-old tactic of being a drama queen to get through the armor of corrupt politicians. But real world politicians do not ignore laypeople because they are too busy or too corrupt or even because they hold laypeople beneath their contempt. Laypeople appeal to ideals and morals and ethics that politicians had to shunt aside to get to their positions in the first place. You appeal to qualities and virtues that are not in the politician's vocabulary any more. They are bereft of those ideals laypeople appeal to. THAT is why they do not listen to you - you are speaking antelope, and they are speaking lion.Let me tell you one more thing about Alan Grayson: They're calling him "Mr. Smith" - as an insult. That should tell you everything you need to know about what Washington thinks of this film.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pet projects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Frank Capra is maybe the greatest patriot in American film. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington shows plainly that he cares about national values and that he wants to help consolidate the communitarian spirit.For Frank Capra parliamentary democracy, enacted in a monument-studded capital, is a cornerstone of the structure of American values. For him it is, as this movie plainly shows, a matter of the heart. In my opinion, that is bad. Parliamentary democracy spells COMPROMISE. It is a matter of reason. Or else it would not work. That's what is wrong with this movie, it muddles the issue in a dangerous way.The protagonists are a young inexperienced Senator (James Stewart) and the big meddler and, so to speak, unofficial King of the Senator's state (Edward Arnold). The King has a pet project, a dam which - if I got that right - he wants to have financed by the Federal Government and from which he will eventually earn a huge profit. If others, not least the population of the concerned state, will also profit in one way or the other from the dam, does not interest anybody. Least the Senator. Because he has his own pet project, a camp for Boy Scouts which he envisions - what a coincidence! - on the very spot on which the aforementioned dam is planned. No wonder he is dead set against it.So, is it all about that goddamn dam? I'm afraid it is. For the sake of the two pet projects the legislative process of a whole nation is brought to a complete standstill while the Senator is filibustering - apparently the greatest achievement of American parliamentary democracy. Not the best propaganda for the system, if you think about it. It is hard not to see this as the Senator's selfish fight for an isolated issue, with an absolute disregard for the general whole. That his fight leads to a veritable and truly uncanny ?children's crusade" is frightening, not rousing.I know, I am probably too harsh on this movie. After all, it is only a movie, and its intentions are unquestionably good. James Stewart is at his stumbling cutest, and Jean Arthur, a truly wonderful actress who holds a special place in my heart, is at moments beautiful beyond belief. But it really worries me that messages which should be addressed to man's intelligence are reduced to an emotional impact.</fullReview>

Really great stuff and just as pertinent today as it was 75 years ago when this film was made. it's a long film by the standards of 1939 Hollywood ? but certainly does not outstay it's welcome. Beautiful quality black and white photography with some nice tourist scenic shots of Washington DC. There's an amusing sequence when Stewart fidgets with his hat and a nice montage of hot metal and letterpress printing presses (which perform a sort of 'duel' in the context of the film).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Infused with patriotism, exhibiting excellent use of humour &amp; starring James Stewart in the role that instantly propelled the then-young actor into the spotlight, Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is another quality product from the notable filmmaker that skilfully presents its support of democracy &amp; is now counted amongst the great American films of its era.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington follows the political adventures of Jefferson Smith; leader of The Boy Rangers who is appointed by the State Governor to fill a vacancy in the US Senate after the untimely death of the previous Senator. Young, naive &amp; idealistic, Smith discovers an entirely different world on his arrival to Washington &amp; soon decides to stand up against corruption.Directed by Frank Capra, the film was controversial at its time of release for daring to show corruption within the American government which infuriated many back then but with time, that part of its premise has only become more significant. Capra's direction is impressive for the most part, script keeps the plot moving with enthusiastic energy &amp; the entertainment is top-notch.The technical aspects are all finely executed, leaving nothing to complain but it's the acting department which further elevates this brilliant cinema to a higher level for the lead as well as the supporting performances are high-calibre stuff here. James Stewart steals the show as the naive Senator who stages a thrilling battle on the Senate floor but the input by Jean Arthur &amp; Claude Rains is equally commendable.On an overall scale, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington hits the right balance between comedy &amp; political drama to succeed as an intelligently crafted, highly entertaining &amp; mostly satisfying cinema. While the overly-stretched finale coming to an abrupt conclusion wasn't something I was looking forward to, this often hilarious but mostly uplifting take on how one man can affect the politics of a nation is definitely worth your time &amp; money.

		<fullReview>Frank Capra is great at making heart-warming films. The audience sympathizes with Jefferson Smith(James Stewart), because he is a red-blooded American who is turned into a puppet for a political machine, and feel bad for him when he is made to look like a fool in the press and almost gets expelled from the senate. Although the story line is great, some small details i the movie are too unrealistic to ignore. Obviously the actors over-dramatized most of the film to go along with the Capra-esque style(most notably the governor's children at the dinner table), but the main problem is during Smith's filibuster. Why were the boy rangers working in a sweat shop to make Smith's newspaper? How did so many rallies and parades get started in less than 23 hours? How did Jim Taylor get away with sending men to hurt little boys and take their newspapers? Why did everyone just stand there and watch as a man slapped a kid in the face and walked out with their newspapers? Why were little kids driving a car in the first place? How come there was no one watching the parade that got fire hosed? How did Taylor get away with sending people to shoot the parade with a fire hose? These are all questions that pertain to a small part in the movie, but they bothered me to a point where I could not ignore them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A poignant and powerful American film that is extremely patriotic.James Stewart played an iconic character of Jefferson Smith, a juvenile senator. He played with a rare naive and innocence that set the role on a whole high. It is easily a charming and lovely performance by him. Indeed, there is nothing charming about the character coz its neither stylish nor flamboyant, but its supremely honest and that is what is charming about Senator Smith.This film is certainly one of the finest Capra's film and probably next only to his It's a Wonderful Life. It tells the story of how an upright straightforward juvenile boy is trapped in the conundrums of corruption that is there in 1930s America. And how he fights to overcome that. Now this is a simple line that is made extravagant by imbibing many political details in the realms of the script. From elaborating the meaning of Liberty to referring many clauses of USA constitution, this film is wonderfully insightful and politically detailed. The dare of the director to take on a corrupt and flawed state of the political system in America is worth appreciating. This indeed stands out as a very first and prominent film to take on the role of nexus between politicians and local business people. Every technical department from light to sound to writing is perfect. Above all, I loved the writing by Rob Riskin and Frank Capra. This is a fine film and has many great moments. Thanks to Capra for this and admiration for his work grows. A 4/5 for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Honest Man stands up to the corporate giant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Distinguished Gentleman borrowed heavily from this movie, though I feel that this movie is far superior to the later. In this movie a senator dies and a replacement is needed, namely somebody who will be nothing more than a stooge. They have a few names in mind, but at dinner, the governor asks his kids and they all suggest Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), a local Boy Rangers leader. So suddenly this innocent man's life is changed as he goes from a humble Boy Ranger to a United States Senator.The movie is about the corruption that flows through the government. The government was angered at this movie, claiming that it would spoil the reputation of the nation, but it does serve to destroy the naivety that people have about what really goes on in the government. Jefferson Smith is a yes man, and would have played along nicely, visiting Memorials and generally having a huge amount of faith in the system, except that he puts forth a bill which clashes with a dam that is being built. He quickly learns that his colleague and an number of other congressmen are being controlled by a business man from his state. He controls everything in the state and uses his power to get what he wants. Quickly Smith learns that there is little freedom in Washington, but rather a group of elected stooges that are controlled by corporate giants.The movie quickly becomes a battle between this lowly senator and the industrial machine. His few days in Washington quickly bring him out of his naivety to make a stand for his beliefs. Jefferson Smith is an honest man and honourable man. He refuses to bow to the pressure of the industrial machine. When they try to destroy him by creating lies about him, they learn that Smith will not go out silently. Instead he holds the floor of the senate in an effort to bring the truth to the people, yet the industrial machine moves on, trying to destroy him. In the end it is the morality of his colleague that allows him to win through. Thus what we see by the end of this movie is that even though the industrial machine controls the state, a vigilant man has the ability to bring it down.Mr Smith goes to Washington is one of Capra's left wing movies. It is one that criticises the industrial machine and how it seeks to smash over the individual. It is not a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, but rather a government controlled by the industrial machine. It has no care for the person but rather for the increased profit of the corporate bosses. It is a movie that calls out to us to see what the government has become and seek to change it. In the movie the truth comes out, but will it do so now?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dated and not so at the same time, this American icon is totally unrealistic with very realistic and currently relevant themes. It is corn-pone and completely captivating. This is an "aw shucks", "gee whiz" portrayal of the political process and has a delightfully wishful Washington D.C.A fantasy world of the American Dream for it is forever fanciful and never without charm. It is a Classic in both Art and Politics. Surprisingly, its message is topical and can be remarkable as it fortifies the adage "the more things change, the more they stay the same".Undeniably likable and only occasionally laughable, it must make today's conservatives uneasy with its combination of idealistic ideas about the common man and corporate corruption wrapped in the American Flag.It is a wonderful dream machine depiction from a time when a naive Nation could, without apology, ask for some sort of common sense, for a common cause, even if that may be a lost cause. Because those are ones worth fighting for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly feels very dated, and yet powerfully performed and created</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is one of those iconic classic films that I was scared to review. This was literally the first time I have seen it just moments ago and as the first half hour or so passed, I felt a sinking in my stomach. It wasn't grasping me, it wasn't blowing me away like Gone With The Wind did for the first time. Parts of it felt very dated, especially much of the dialogue between the supporting cast members. They all spoke (especially the children in the film) like 1940's gangsters. I know it was almost 1940 but they aren't supposed to be gangsters. Maybe it was a slang style of speech but it was overwhelming and little cheesy. They used the term "seee" more than a dozen times I swear. Then Mr. Smith begins to understand the corruption going on, then comes the epic cinematically historical filibuster and I was riveted to my chair while Jimmy Stewart pounds home his message in one of the most powerful scenes in movie history. The first half of the film dragged and didn't draw me in, but the latter half was the meat and potatoes and made this nearly everything I expected it to be. The first half of the film really delves into what is happening but I felt like it perhaps went into too much detail establishing the various characters than was necessary.Jimmy Stewart plays the iconic Mr. Smith. He definitely does not hit his stride with this character until the latter half of the film. He is deserving of his Oscar nomination because of the intense emotion and power he brings to the closing scene. Up until then he lacks something I felt. He was supposed to be a fish way out of water and he does that but without much flare. Jean Arthur is decent in her role, though her performance was one of those ones that felt very dated in her dialogue. Her chemistry with Stewart was good but I think I wanted more closure to their romance that never really blossoms into something else. Claude Rains is excellent in his performance. The chemistry between him and Stewart is terrific and when Mr. Smith discovers Rains' betrayal you literally feel the pain that would have caused. Edward Arnold is perfect as the pompous gangster type man controlling the senators from the unnamed state. He doesn't have a lot of screen time and his character is a little stereotypical but it fits the role fine. Thomas Mitchell has a small but important role as the reporter who fights for Smith's cause behind the scenes. I would have liked to have seen more from his character because he was fun and charismatic in his scenes. The film has an enormous supporting cast basically being all of the senators and the house leaders. They are all good in their roles and very believable at each step of the way. It's A Wonderful Life fans and Capra fans will recognize some of the actors from the iconic Christmas film.This is only the second Frank Capra film I have seen so I can't really speak too much on his style considering the man is a legend. This film is definitely appealing to the people and is chock full of the emotion of hope and determination for the underdog. Certainly he doesn't hide his opinion that Washington is full of corruption and perhaps even has something to say about the way Washington does its business which I don't think has changed all that much in a lot of ways. Many reviews and things I read talk about how Capra made a film for the everyman about Washington and the process and while obviously the success of the film proves that I did think it was actually very complex in some ways. His lack of mentioning parties and the actual state they were from made it a little hard to follow at times but the message still comes home. The film is a legendary classic and I don't presume to tell anyone whats good and bad about it because everyone should watch this type of film. I liked it a lot and the latter half of the movie will just rivet you to you seat. It wasn't one of my favourites but it is a must see. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr Smith goes to Washington is a movie that teaches you the power of being resilient.Frank Capra and James Stewart who also worked together in the 1946 movie Its A Wonderful Life, pulled out a perfect combination of acting and directing that will make you the viewer want to be like Mr. Smith.In a world where politics is a dirty game of, "if you can't beat them, join them." Mr Smith (James Stewart) was faced with the task of being the odd one out as he wanted to stand for what he believed in.Frank Capra and his crew had their work cut out for them to ensure authenticity; an elaborate set was created, consisting of the Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms. The thing that really stands out is the reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot.The movie plot is about a Naive and idealistic gentleman Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). Smith is the leader of the Boy Rangers and due to a gap in the senate he was appointed by the governor of his state.In the senate he met a friend of his father who he looked up to, Senator Joseph Paine.In Washington, Smith discovers the many tricks and shortcomings of politics. His goal to build a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor and his childhood hero Senator Joseph Paine.After the powers that be tried to requite Smith, he turned them down and by so doing Mr Taylor concocted a scandal that ruined Smith's name.The whole movie is then based on how he tries to defend his name.The movie did stand high on drama with few comic relief moments here and there, but the story is what makes you respect and love this classic. We are use to movies that depict the good guy wining at the end, but in this movie bit of reality are exposed, to triumph in any battle you must be ready to go the extra mile and do what has not been done before.In 1977 Frank Capra Jr. remade the film with another name Billy Jack Goes to Washington starring Tom Laughlin. In 1992 Eddie Murphy starred in a movie loosely based on Mr. Smith goes to Washington called The Distinguished Gentleman.The film also influenced many other films including Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde and Evan Almighty.This classic is very readily available now a days and I ask you to go see it.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic gem that hasn't lost its relevance ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** "An average director is like a traffic cop, a good director does justice to the script, a great director offers to the audience a new vision of the world" Bette Davis paying tribute during the AFI's 10th Lifetime Achievement Award to one of America's greatest directors: Frank Capra. ***In each film, each frame was speaking his word, showing his vision, inspiring the audience with a feeling so new it would, like for Alfred Hitchcock, inspire its own adjective: Capraesque. And not every director could achieved that in their lifetime.I felt like beginning "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" with these lines because this is certainly, the most Capraesque of all his films. Released in the pivotal year of 1939, it's the picture that crystallized the very values the name Capra stood for, which are all about a certain idea of America, deeply rooted in the heart of this son of illiterate Sicilian emigrants who came to America at the age of 6, who endured poverty, and dreamed of getting through it. Not only he did, but he also became one of the greatest American directors, the one with the most instantly recognizable trademarks, as in both style and content. "It Happened One Night", "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" or "You Can't Take it With You" made the audience so passionate about his films that his name would be top-billed. A Capra film was an event by itself, a film that would feature the struggle of one man, one ordinary man, against the corruption that gangrenes society. Capra's heroes were the incarnation of his own beliefs because in his own way: Capra incarnated the American Dream.And this American Dream would be immortalized through the most endearing of his heroes: the young Senator Jefferson Smith, played by a strikingly handsome and juvenile-looking James Stewart. The film launched Jimmy Stewart's career and if you see it, it's one point you'll never question. It's so amazing to see Stewart looking so young, especially if you compare with "It's a Wonderful Life" (where he was only 38), his features are those of a guy who can be 25 or 26, his cheeks, his awkward smile, his lanky demeanor, his eyes, Jefferson Smith is like a child, and when it comes to politics, like a baby. He's tutored by Miss Saunders, who's played by one of Capra's most familiar faces: Jean Arthur, and with her wised up experience, and cute nasal voice, she'll try to help him swimming among the sharks and not get eaten by the system. Because this is what the film is about, the fight of one young man against political corruption, a man whose heart is pumped up by all the ideals and values of Justice and Equity and finds himself alone in a world that belongs to other forces, forces that have nothing to do with government, forces that control everything. One man against the system, so Capraesque and yet so modern.The real achievement of the film, although it was not necessarily brought that way, is to portray a political system that immediately echoes the ones we're familiar with, and my opinion doesn't target a specific country. Through the antagonist characters: the corrupted Senator Payne (Claude Rains) and Edward Arnold as Jim Taylor, the ruthless tycoon who owns the media and controls the power, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" allows us to revisit the intricacies that still exist today within the political system and how some of the branches involved can lead to spheres that have nothing do with values and ideals. The all-time complicity between the media and politics is highlighted with such boldness that makes us wish we'd had more Jefferson Smiths today. But we don't, because to be elected, one must pledge allegiance to these driving forces: I call them the media, the lobbies, the major corporations. Because money creates more valuable connections than honesty, loyalty and integrity, yes they don't last, but it doesn't matter. In the name of progress, of economy, the big guys take the biggest share of the pie and leave the crumbs for people.But Jefferson Smith will ultimately stand alone against this injustice, he's just a common man, as indicated by his last name, but his first name is patriotically loaded, as if he was the only virgin mind to inherit the purest beliefs that made the dream of his country possible. That's his force, he's as honest as the old man sitting on that big statue in Washington, and he won't let the word 'honesty' have its meaning twisted until it becomes synonym of naivety or lack of pragmatism. That's the virus that pollutes today's spirit, the whole cynical ends- justifies-the-means-thing that reduces gentleness to dumbness while we're more lucid when we believe that everything is crap. Why that's the point, if anything stinks is this world is because of a bunch of people that ought to be fought, and the cynicism of those people is to make believe that they're the one who adapted to a world that can't be changed. Through Jefferson, it's like Capra advocating his own ideas: no, he's not a sentimentalist, no, it's not just about David vs. Goliath, it's about beliefs and emotions.Capra obviously has an emotional relationships with his country, and so does Jefferson. It's something in the heart and Jefferson's fight literally metamorphoses him into a fighter who'd use every weapon to stand against corruption. And the Stewart we meet at the end is a whole new one, courageous, and determined, he lost his political virginity but not his idealism, because they had to triumph, otherwise, America wouldn't be worth living in. "Mr. Smith" exemplifies the best that could come from Hollywood's Golden Age, with so many familiar faces, and the greatest compilations of Capra's trademarks, fast- paced editing, jumping shots and the iconic montage of headlines and last but not least, a significance that hasn't been lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The genius in Capra and Stewart is brought out in yet another classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was overshadowed by Victor Fleming's landmark movies- Gone with the Wind, a movie that shattered all records till then and gave the viewers a colorful experience, and Wizard of Oz, which again gave the viewers a colorful and a musical experience. The year also gave John Wayne an impetus to his acting career through John Ford's Western classic, Stagecoach. Billy Wilder and William Wyler too gave one of their best movies at that time through Ninotchka and Wuthering Heights. To sum up, it was an year that forced the people to go to the nearby theaters more often than they had any other year.Frank Capra has directed a movie that inserts itself into the fray. James Stewart is a gifted actor who can provide any director and especially Frank Capra what he needs the fullest for the role-they previously worked together in 'You can't take it with you' the previous year and the movie grabbed the Best Picture and Frank Capra was rightly awarded the Best Director.Jefferson Smith is ridiculed for his innocence, scorned at his lack of awareness of the debauchery and is threatened when he perseveres more and more. He steals the show with his brilliant acting that is commensurate to Frank Capra's directing and Foster's writing.'Gone with the Wind' might have swept the academy awards and raked in the box-office collections that year, but this is the movie that has received much critical acclaim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another gem of a movie that aired on TCM last night that I have not seen for sometime. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington stars James Stewart as a naive Junior Senator in a world of corruption and career politicians. Overwhelmed by his surroundings and his new job he leans on an old friend of his fathers and his own childhood hero Senior Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) for advice and direction. Mr. Smith finds that this country's government is not what he thought it was and neither is Senator Paine. If not for the friendship with his secretary, Miss Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), Mr. Smith's stay in Washington would have been very disenchanting. Through sheer will and determination Mr. Smith takes on the corruption of Washington and tries to fight for, what seems to be, a lost cause.James Stewart's performance in this film was masterful and he was justly nominated for an Academy Award. He exuded innocence and sincerity with every word and every nervous stumble played out perfectly as he obviously dove into this character head first. There are several scenes throughout the movie that pull on your patriotic strings as you , the viewer, are reminded of what this nation is built on and for, as you connect with Mr. Smith's cause.Not to go unrecognized are Jean Arthur and Claude Rains performances, in which they were also nominated for an Academy Award. Both of these actors were incredible and so well suited for their roles. Rains' performance in the final scene of this film was memorable, as the pressure of Mr. Smith's honesty and integrity start to wear on his conscience.Directed by Frank Capra, who 7 years later directed Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life, this film moves along purposefully, as the viewer experiences the ups and downs of Mr. Smith's journey . There are many critics who believe this film to be his best, nominated for an Academy Award Capra lost out to Victor Fleming and Gone With the Wind.Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a movie that pulls at all the right places and pushes at all the right times. The film is about innocence versus corruption, good versus evil, right versus wrong and having hope when facing adversity. Although made over 70 years ago the story is still relevant and maybe even more so today, than it was then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a drama film starring Jean Arthur and James Stewart about one man's effect on American politics. It was directed by Frank Capra and written by Sidney Buchman, based on Lewis R. Foster's unpublished story.The film features a bevy of well-known supporting actors and actresses, among them Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Guy Kibbee, Thomas Mitchell and Beulah Bondi.Capra's classic comedy- drama established James Stewart as a lead actor in one of his finest (and most archetypal) roles.The film opens as a succession of reporters shout into telephones announcing the death of Senator Samuel Foley. Senator Joseph Paine, the state's senior senator, puts in a call to Governor Hubert "Happy" Hopper reporting the news. Hopper then calls powerful media magnate Jim Taylor, who controls the state -- along with the lawmakers. Taylor orders Hopper to appoint an interim senator to fill out Foley's term; Taylor has proposed a pork barrel bill to finance an unneeded dam at Willet Creek, so he warns Hopper he wants a senator who "can't ask any questions or talk out of turn." After having a number of his appointees rejected, at the suggestion of his children Hopper nominates local hero Jefferson Smith, leader of the state's Boy Rangers group. Smith is an innocent, wide-eyed idealist who quotes Jefferson and Lincoln and idolizes Paine, who had known his crusading editor father. In Washington, after a humiliating introduction to the press corps, Smith threatens to resign, but Paine encourages him to stay and work on a bill for a national boy's camp. With the help of his cynical secretary Clarissa Sanders, Smith prepares to introduce his boy's camp bill to the Senate. But when he proposes to build the camp on the Willets Creek site, Taylor and Paine force him to drop the measure. Smith discovers Taylor and Paine want the Willets Creek site for graft and he attempts to expose them, but Paine deflects Smith's charges by accusing Smith of stealing money from the boy rangers. Defeated, Smith is ready to depart Washington, but Saunders, whose patriotic zeal has been renewed by Smith, exhorts him to stay and fight. Smith returns to the Senate chamber and, while Taylor musters the media forces in his state to destroy him, Smith engages in a climactic filibuster to speak his piece: "I've got a few things I want to say to this body. I tried to say them once before and I got stopped colder than a mackerel. Well, I'd like to get them said this time, sir. And as a matter of fact, I'm not gonna leave this body until I do get them said."Capra's Depression era film is a classic, timeless statement about American ideals, featuring a bravura turn from Jimmy Stewart as a young idealistic Senator, fighting corruption in Washington D.C.Pick it apart, dissect it and even roll your eyes at the ridiculous ending. Still, it will get to you, even if you're in your most cynical mood.Every citizen should be made to watch in exchange for the right to vote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great from James Stewart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a certain special allure to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. There is little in the way of flashy editing or dazzling set pieces, only some fine actors delivering a wildly intelligent and sophisticated screenplay. But this shining aspect alone puts Mr. Smith Goes to Washington at a level of grandiose brilliance that has all the same appeal as a sparkling big budget epic. The movie is about Jefferson Smith, played by one of my favorite actors James Stewart. After the senator of his state passes away, Smith is rushed into office to hold the US Senate seat. Smith is naive but has a very big heart with equally big ambition. He pushes for a national boys camps with the best intentions, but when his selfless prospects get in the way of plans for a dam, two other senators, Jim Taylor and Joseph Paine, conspire to get Smith kicked out of office through scandal and corruption. It is a harsh criticism of the American government, but also a wonderfully characterized and extremely captivating underdog story which Stewart plays perfectly.I've already said a lot about the screenplay of this film, but I'm going to keep talking about it because it's just that compelling. The storyline of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is its shining aspect that makes it one of the smartest films of its decade. What begins as a fun little tale about a naive young man getting to play with the big dogs in the Senate becomes a darker and very critical commentary on the US governmental system. It's not to say that the film doesn't also remain lighthearted where it needs to be. It's a very pleasant story in which our protagonist prevails through his own will and determination. But there is a consistent theme of political corruption that only goes as far as a dam construction in the film, but alludes to more serious corruption that has sadly become all the more prevalent since the film was released.One of the most amazing things about this film is just how relevant it is in todays society. Political corruption is a plague and a curse that we can't seem to rid ourselves of in this world. It only seems to grow to darker and more sinister things as the years go by, and at the time Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was made this idea of such corruption was so much smaller than it is today, in a world where under the table bargains are made every day, screwing over the good hearted Jefferson Smiths of the world. It's sad that we still see this corruption today, but at least it still makes Mr. Smith Goes to Washington a socially relevant piece of cinema.But aside from the brooding undercurrent of this film, it really does have a happy message. It shows that through selfless and kind hearted perseverance we can overcome the challenges put forth unto us by the tyrannical fat cats sitting in their ivory towers, thinking they are invincible against the sympathetic little man. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington doesn't end on a dark note and it doesn't force feed us cynical thoughts about American government. Instead it uplifts us and gives up hope that there is good in the world. That's why I think James Stewart was so perfectly cast in this role because of how incredibly likable he is in any role her pursues. The character of Jefferson Smith inadvertently demands empathy, and that isn't difficult to do when he is so empathetically portrayed by James Stewart.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a great little film. It's got a very socially relevant message, one that is transferred excellently from the marvelous script to the screen by exquisite actors. The dialouge in this film keeps you so enthralled in this movie from start to finish and the filibuster at the end of the movie is just as compelling and epic as any final battle sequence in an action movie. This screenplay does with words what other films could and sometimes even couldn't do with guns, swords, or explosions. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a compelling piece of rich cinema that shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Naive and idealistic Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), leader of the Boy Rangers, is appointed on a lark by the spineless governor of his state. He is reunited with the state's senior senator--presidential hopeful and childhood hero, Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains). In Washington, however, Smith discovers many of the shortcomings of the political process as his earnest goal of a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor. Taylor first tries to corrupt Smith and then later attempts to destroy Smith through a scandal.Stewart is heart-wrenchingly real as Jefferson. He never gave a finer more honest performance. There is a final scene in which Jefferson, hoarse from talking for over twenty-two hours, talks about lost causes in a way that causes the entire audience to silence as much as the characters in the senate. The supporting actors are forced to pull up to the quality of Stewart's deliveries and they step up to the challenge. Rains in particular shows perfect guilt at having to betray his colleague yet at the same time is willing to do so. In my life I have been to very few films which receive applause at the end. Any person with a love of film must view this exquisite film as an example of what film can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to be cynical about Jimmy Stewart's character in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington", especially from the perspective of 2010 and the fiercely partisan divide in the country. As Senator, Mr. Smith aspires to do nothing to disgrace the office. My gut tells me that a Smith in Washington today would have to be made of concrete and steel to remain true to his principles and avoid buckling under to the pressure of lobbyists, interest groups and fellow politicians. It's interesting to view this picture when the U.S. itself seems to be at the tipping point, with a majority of hard working, tax paying citizens virtually held in contempt by a ruling elite composed of both political parties. Maybe what the country needs right now is a Mr. Smith who can simply boil things down to what's right and wrong, someone with common sense who believes in honesty and integrity instead of one who can gain the most advantage through slick wheeling and dealing. It's easy to dismiss this picture as an idealistic aberration, a film who's values and vision couldn't possibly stand up to even the slightest scrutiny today. But you know, maybe that's the picture's strength. Maybe, just maybe, the mood of the country today can summon forth the spirit of a Mr. Smith, even if a real life character like that seems an impossibility. Naive, maybe. But we're talking about America here, and if America can't overcome it's own troubles, we might never get to see another Mr. Smith in Washington ever again, even in the movies.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, the movie is a bit outdated and the plot in its initials forms seem a bit rushed and may leave the audience dissatisfied. In it's conclusion, however, descrying the script as a whole, we get an inspiring - and rather unlikely - story of a man supported only in ideals and words.Superfluous - and most of time cheesy - dialogues and some strange editing cuts stain the experience, but the actors performance manages to keep this film going and, eventually, into an all-time classic.I watched this movie just after seeing Kick Ass and couldn't help to link the "why are there bad guys but no superheroes?" with the "why is there so much concupiscence, corruption and lying; while the idea of a man that is actually honest and consistent in his beliefs is so odd and outlandish"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Stewart gives a classic performance as Senator Jefferson Smith in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. It's the type of performance which makes an actor a star and, sure enough, after making this film Stewart was on his way to becoming an American acting icon. But while Stewart's performance is an undeniable timeless classic there is the nagging sense that the film as a whole isn't quite on par with the performance of its leading man. It's a good film but perhaps it falls just a touch short of excellence.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is another of those uplifting, inspiring stories which director Frank Capra seemed to specialize in. In this case the story revolves around a simple man, Jefferson Smith, thrust into a situation which is anything but simple. Smith's a good, honest, sincere fellow. A typical Capra hero. He is the head of a youth group, the Boy Rangers, and has a real passion for improving the lives of children. And he will take that passion to Washington when, completely out of the blue, he is appointed to the United States Senate to replace a deceased senator. It becomes apparent very quickly that this naive young man, armed only with the best of intentions, is in over his head. But that's part of what makes the character of Jefferson Smith so appealing. His home state's corrupt political machine figures his inexperience will make him easy to control. Boy are they ever in for a surprise.As we watch Jefferson Smith make his way in the seamy world of Washington politics it's very easy to embrace the character. But it is at times somewhat less easy to embrace the film. Everyone remembers the famous final scene. It's powerful and inspiring and brilliantly done. In that scene we get to see both a character, Jefferson Smith, and an actor, James Stewart, really come into their own. It's magnificent. But much of what precedes that scene comes across as rather mundane. The story proceeds at a leisurely pace, at times much too leisurely. Too often there just is not much going on to move the story forward. Stewart is terrific and his two main co-stars, Jean Arthur as Smith's initially jaded assistant and Claude Rains as the less than honest senior senator from Smith's state, are very good as well. So the performances aren't the problem. It's the story, which turns out to be a little too simple to really sustain itself for over two hours. And if the story had a little better pace to it perhaps the film wouldn't have in the end been in such a hurry to finish which, after Stewart's big scene, leaves us with an ending which is jarringly abrupt. Losing some scenes in the middle of the film to leave some more time to better wrap things up at the end would have been a good trade-off. But for whatever little disappointments there may be this still is a very good film, one which features one of Hollywood's most classic performances. James Stewart alone would be enough to make this film worth watching. And there are enough good things around him to ultimately make the film very satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes To Washington is a timely and absorbing drama presented in director Frank Capra's best craftsmanship. Washington's youngest senator (James Stewart) exposes corruption in high places, almost at the cost of his own career.The film is an archetypal high-flying Capra vehicle, with the little man coming out top as he seldom does in life. Supreme gloss hides the corn, helter-skelter direction keeps one watching, and all concerned give memorable performances. It's a cinema classic. In 1989, the Library of Congress added Mr. Smith Goes To Washington to the United States National Film Registry, for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, if only it were true. Those were the days when a filibuster was a filibuster...not like the wimpy ones of today. Where it is just written down on paper and the senators don't have to stay up all night and suffer. But Stewart was incredible in this. His ignorance and gullibility were offset by his strength of will and integrity. Great performance. Jean Authur was a delight as a tough, hard bitten insider who, after a bit of fighting with herself, melts and falls in love with the idealistic and naive Jeff Smith. Idealism and romance don't get any better than this. And this movie has nothing to do with civics-it is a fantasy. But if you enjoy a good-no great-old fashioned movie, this is the one to watch.</fullReview>

This is in the days before corporate graft &amp; six figure pensions were not yet a part of the Washington system like they are today.Jimmy Stewart is excellent in this as the eyes wide open novice every man who manages to get himself elected to the US government in Washington. Claude Raids, is excellent as one who wants to stop him from bringing a breath of fresh air into the Capitol. Jean Arthur is a strong actress who is excellent in her role too.The thing that is so appealing about this movie, even years later is that the viewer gets pulled into the cause &amp; really wants Stewart &amp; an honest government to win out. You root for it to happen.This is one of those cause movies that teaches ethics in Political so well that we can only wish today's office holders were required to watch it &amp; modify their behavior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a film about politics that delivers sending a message America wouldn't dream about doing today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>America is corrupted. It's full of ruthless politicians, greedy government, and well before Obama came along, George Bush pretty much ruined a lot of America. Now let me get this out of the way, I don't care about politics, I don't like politics and they bore me to tears, this movie sheds it in a whole different light. Jefferson Smith is an honest man not knowing how to handle his spot in the senate, but wants to do everything he can to help his country. No matter how much he's laughed at, no matter how much people beg him to quit, he keeps on ticking until he knows the truth, and until people finally accept for who he is. You won't find a story like this in the world now a days, it's practically guaranteed, but it really shows the American dream so to speak, and really lifts your spirits up when all is said and done. The end where Jefferson is speaking in front of all the people dead tired, is not only classical, but absolutely riveting and remains one of the most intense endings you will find in a movie.Performances. James Stewart is absolutely wonderful in his infamous role as Jefferson Smith. His determination, his willpower, yet his strong vulnerability all made for one compelling character. Stewart is always dependable and I rank this as one of his best performances. Claude Rains is very effective as Senator Paine. He's not the man he used to be, and some of his scenes with Stewart really hit home for me. Jean Arthur is wonderfully classy as Clarissa. Edward Arnold is absolutely ruthless as Taylor, you'll hate him.Bottom line. I'm not a politician, I don't know much about them, frankly I don't care too, they bore me. What I do know is I liked this film very much, and while it may be a bit dated too others, it's refreshingly good natured and really shows how corrupt America has become now a days. A required viewing for true film buffs.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Authentically patriotic and passionate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Hollywood's famous Golden Year of 1939, comes "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington". Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and competing against "The Wizard of Oz" and "Gone With the Wind" for Best Picture.The story of a naive man becoming a U.S. Senator, the conflicts and fight he wages. James Stewart is perfectly cast in this role. He's an ordinary, charming, innocent and very like-able person. Jean Arthur as his secretary, Claude Rains as the senior Senator and James Stewart all give heartfelt, passionate acting performances. When Mr. Smith first comes to Washington, he has a childlike excitement, enthusiasm and idealism about him, that sets him apart from all the other established Senators. Though the story is set in 1939, the film does not feel dated, because of it's universal themes of integrity, patriotism and a passion for defending what one believes in, against the establishment. I was impressed with the authenticity and passion of the film.Director Frank Capra had a nickname in Hollywood at the time: "Capra Corn". The film could be accused of being a little corny: overly sentimental and sweet. This was the style of Frank Capra, showing an ordinary man confronting extraordinary circumstances, which would be repeated in his later and excellent: "It's a Wonderful Life". Capra's films are admired for their naturalness and charm. I admit I'm a fan of his style.From "It Happened One Night", 1934, to "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington", 1939, to "It's a Wonderful Life", 1944, Capra had a trio string of excellent films, with his signature naturalness and charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking out for the little man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No filmmaker in history was more concerned for the underdog than Frank Capra, the champion of the people cinematically speaking. With practically all his pictures, he attacked corruptness and lack of freedom whether it be in politics, society or regular home-town settings.Very much like his previous Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is about an idealistic young man from a small town who travels to a big city with no notion of what he is about to get into. In both films, Jean Arthur plays the key role; the spunky news reporter/ press girl who finds herself attached to the title character in hopes of helping him make his dreams come true. Arthur is so good in this role because her dry, sardonic humor is wonderfully akin to the type of work environment she finds herself in: rough, lethal, and just plain unlikable at times. One of the keys that prevented Capra from making the same film twice was in casting James Stewart as Jefferson Smith. Stewart, one of the greatest of all American actors, is perfectly realized here; able to capture both the idyllic innocence and the fiery passion required for this role. Also well cast is Senator Joseph Paine, played here by the great Claude Raines who still remains known as Captain Renault of Casablanca, although he did many other films as well.Never before and perhaps never again has a film so thoroughly explored the way in which politics affect our everyday lives, even if we don't vote or read about action in Washington. The way Capra and his faithful writer, Sidney Buchman, establish each side of the spectrum and then lay out all the facts is quite amazing. Here is a young man thought to be a stooge; a nobody but simply able to play the patsy for the bureaucratic structure set up behind him. Unfortunately for them, his idealism and loyalty take over as he soon is poking his nose in places they don't want and asking questions they'd rather not answer. Every single step of the way we cheer for this Jefferson Smith, not necessarily because he is such a great senator but because he believes in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness- things I'm sure we wished we believe in.In a cynical and corrupt time, the political world needs a Jefferson Smith. However, for every Smith there are at least two James Taylors (Edward Arnold), pragmatic in every sense and ruthless. Another reason this film remains classic is that it cannot date. Its subject material will always be relevant, and for us it is a reminder that there are good people out there with a sense of honesty and humility. It is in these times we need reminded of what our government was originally created for: to help the workingman, the underprivileged, and all those people talked about in speeches but rarely dealt with.Capra knew how to deal with them and later on in his career, he and favorite actor Jimmy Stewart would go on and create another timeless masterpiece that struck notes deeper than just ideal politics or social behavior. Rather, they would make a film able to peer into the soul of human existence and find the very reason we have our living and being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favourite Film, Even with a Glaring Inconsistency</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I review a Frank Capra movie, (one of my very favourite directors), I like to remind viewers that Capra has a consistent flair for INconsistency in his movies. In this offering, We see a very aggressive, well-informed press corps, in an unnamed state in the Union, hounding the governor to make a senatorial appointment without the influence of bad guy "Taylor". But later in the film, when the new Senator Smith (Taylor's nemesis) needs political support back home, this well-informed, aggressive press corps is no where to be found.If you can get past that (most people never even think about it), then this film is a knockout. I can show this movie to people of all ages, even friends in the congregation, without having to apologize for an off-color sequence or something embarrassing. Everyone feels good after seeing this gem.The film's message will inspire anyone with a brain and a heart. You come away knowing that one man *can* make a difference.As always, Jean Arthur makes every guy wish there were more like Clarissa Saunders in the world. And of course, every man will want to be a "Mr. Smith." This film is not only a call to civil duty, but also a subtle hint to crooked people to come clean. Indeed, that's the key to the story's resolution, if you watch for it.I have reopened my review to add the following: This may not seem related, but it is. In "1984", the protagonist is captured, and told that The System does not allow martyrs. Because if they allow martyrs, then revolutions would succeed. If you pay attention, in the final torture scene of "1984", the fellow has a chance to become the very martyr they fear.There is a mighty seed of truth in social commentaries like that. Every reform needs martyrs. "Mr. Smith goes to Washington" shows clearly one man's willingness to be a martyr. And at some point, corrupt systems MUST crack, when men are willing to push back hard enough, even at their own peril.</fullReview>

If there were no fashion gestures and mimics of that time you could not say that the film is so old. The movie does not miss anything, even not the color. The script is so planned and detailed that every dialogue is important and makes perfect sense. Can you recall of any such film made in color? Camera is pretty much piece of art. The technique of shooting, shot and scene interactions are perfect. Plot is fast, engaging and coherent. Art scenes representing body language mixed with camera angles, light play and contrast are amazing. The one could say that Capra really learned from German expressionists. Although has a high rate on IMDb, this movie remains underrated. A real gem from grandmaster of propaganda film - Frank Capra who here proves his feature film talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why not call their bluff?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie, inasmuch as its use of the film medium. The script is pretty decent, the cinematography is superb, and the acting is excellent.But there's one plot point that I don't get: why couldn't Smith just call Taylor/Paine's bluff? The frame is that he owns the land, and this is supposedly proved to the Senate committee. Okay, then why doesn't Smith just propose the following, if he indeed owns the land in question: after his inevitable expulsion from the Senate, he will donate the land to the Boy Rangers? After all, according to the accusations, he didn't even pay for it. And if Smith now owns the land, instead of Taylor and his cronies, wouldn't that ruin Taylor's bid to make money by selling that land to the government? It just seems the frame is great for ruining Smith's name, but ruins Taylor's scheme in the process.Anyway, this movie is very relevant for today's America. It should give you a clue as to how real-life politics work (except without the last-minute deus ex machina to save the good guy). By all means, watch this classic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood, in the days of the studio system, was not a haven for individualists. Much as film writers and egotistical filmmakers like to ascribe authorship to one person, in truth cinema is by its very nature a collaborative means of expression. Hollywood, in its golden age, produced many of the greatest pictures ever, because the studios were like well-oiled machines for making the most out of collaborations. Mr Smith Goes to Washington is a great example.Let's look a bit at the history of this picture. Frank Capra, he of the "name-above-the-title" had had his biggest successes so far in partnership with a wonderful yet rarely remembered screenwriter called Robert Riskin. The story of Mr Smith Goes to Washington would have been right up Riskin's street, but unfortunately the writer, fed up with working in Capra's shadow, had decided to go his own way. Still Capra and Columbia wanted a picture that could be a loose sequel to Riskin's Mr Deeds Goes to Town, and would say about politics what Deeds and You Can't Take It with You (another Riskin script) said about wealth. A skilled and experienced writer by the name of Sidney Buchman was brought in to adapt a story by Lewis Foster. The result, while neither as witty or as charming as genuine Riskin, nevertheless made up for it with the devastating power of its message.Once you have your A-grade script, you must get the right cast. Nowadays typecasting is looked on as restrictive and unimaginative, but it's part of the beauty of classic era Hollywood. Look at Jimmy Stewart, with his innocent face and frame so spindly it looks like he might blow away in a strong gust of wind. And yet when he gets going he has this boyish enthusiasm that makes you believe in him all the way. Stewart had first come to public attention in the top box office hit You Can't Take It with You, and had had a number of lead roles since then. For audiences of 1939 it would have been like seeing a dear friend step into the senate, and any modern day viewer who has seen a handful of Jimmy's pictures will feel the same. That's how he works in the role, and that in turn makes the whole picture work.It's not just Stewart. Everyone appearing in this picture is perfectly cast, admittedly to type. Jean Arthur as usual plays the sharp-witted tomboy with a good heart, an ideal partner for the honest yet sheepish Stewart. The bulky, pointy-nosed Edward Arnold, in his tiny circular glasses, is the very image of the callous businessmen, and frog-voiced Eugene Palette is just right as his pompous stooge. All told, Mr Smith Goes to Washington contains a treasure trove of familiar character actors ? Thomas Mitchell, Claude Rains, Guy Kibbee? each doing business as usual, and it is the very acceptability of them as their typical personas that makes this picture feel so immediate.And what about Mr Capra? Let's not play down his contribution, even if it isn't quite worthy of having his name above the title. Capra is like the conductor of the orchestra. Not only does he coax some great performances out of his cast, but he arranges things superbly to give emphasis as and where it's needed. In many of the early shots of Stewart he is shown in long shot in large spaces, like a little boy lost in a world he doesn't understand. In the first few scenes at the senate, Capra pulls a nifty trick with perspective, framing Stewart so that the top corner of the room converges with his head. The effect makes him appear very small, like those optical illusions you can make with two equal lines that appear to be of different sizes. As Smith gains more confidence and his words more resonance, he starts to emerge from this corner. In their quiet and intimate scene at Capitol Dome, Stewart and Arthur are shown against a plain background, so all focus is upon them and nothing will distract us from their words. All these techniques look very simple, but it takes a master craftsman to know when and how to use them.Capra no doubt thought of himself as a Jefferson Smith-type character, a little man standing up and making a big splash through pluck and determination. That's why he fought to get his name above the title, and essentially marketed the "Capra touch". But Hollywood is not congress, and even Jefferson Smith couldn't have done it without Saunders. No, this delightful and nearly perfect picture is the work of a wonderful, Tinseltown team.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur stars in Frank Capra's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939) as Jefferson Smith, a young, honest and very patriotic senator; and Clarissa Saunders, Mr. Smith's secretary who tries to teach the new senator how Washington works and assists him when it seems everyone has turned against him. Immediately after his arrival, the media attacks the former Boy Ranger's leader. Unfortunately for Mr. Smith, this isn't the last time lies will come against him. After proposing a bill for a summer camp for boys, a fellow senator Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains) turns against Mr. Smith. His bill, it turns out, interferes with one for a dam to be built on the same plot of land the camp would be located. With the assistance of Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), a corrupt man in charge of the media and politics in Mr. Smith's home state, false evidence is planted against him and the reality of Washington comes crashing down. Refusing to back down, Mr. Smith continues to fight the corruption, not just for his innocence, but for the future generations.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was a bold and direct attack of the government's corruption. Frank Capra exposed the greed, lies and lack of interest in the real American people. It wasn't, however, a film to destroy the democracy, but to try and save it. There is a patriotic feel about the movie, one that shows what America is really about. Frank Capra was simply trying to remind the American people what the founding principles were, and that anybody could change the country if they had the will and determination to believe in what was right and not let anything stand in the way of it.The character Jefferson Smith was shown as a regular man with a strong belief in what America was founded on. He developed quite well throughout the film, starting as a na?ve man and ending a strong, determined senator. Mr. Smith is seen at his strongest during the filibuster, which he does to expose the corruption to his home state, and prove his innocence. He stands, talking and quoting the constitution for over twenty-three hours straight. By the end, he is hoarse and growing weak. It isn't until Senator Paine has piles of telegrams bought in does Mr. Smith become quiet. As he digs through them, it is obvious just how tired he is, and though determined, his body just shuts down, and he collapsed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra's movie "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" is from 1939. At the same time, other non-American born film directors either made confused war-chaser movies like Zinnemann did, or they delivered filthy patriotic crap on the lowest possible level like the Hungarian Michael Kertesz did in his so highly-praised "Yankee Doodle" (1942). However, stop and think what Capra is showing us in the movie: It starts with a sight-seeing tour that leads into the National Capitol of Washington, directly at the basis of American history. But the rest of the movie is dedicated to present the US Senate as a bunch of liars, betrayers and crooks who are as far away from the initial American ideas and ideals as anyone just can get. Hope comes for this continent in the person of the bum-chuck Jefferson Smith whose name is, of course, not arbitrarily chosen. However, it takes even him until to the last minute, before one of the criminal leaders who had misused American freedom, welfare and thrust of the public, breaks together. I would say: This is a very brave little movie, it exudes exactly the same miraculous atmosphere of hope even in the most proceeded situations as "It is a Wonderful World", Capras unsurmountable masterpiece, does. Such form of non-trivial, non-stupid and non-unnatural form of hope only such a director could inject into his movies who had it really deep in his heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the best movies ever made are the ones that can have a great overall message, but still be loose enough for someone to enjoy it on a basic level. One example is South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. Another is Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. This movie is without a doubt a classic, and, in my opinion, Frank Capra's masterpiece. The inocence of Mr. Smith just draws you to him. This movie makes you hate the most powerful people in the nation. It also helped to show the world what political machines were capable of. But, most of all, it is yet another, and maybe the best, movie about a small man standing up to a huge adversary. The ending is one of the best ever. It ranks up their with Citizen Cane, Vertigo, Wonderful Life, and Dr. Caligari. It is a pretty basic scene, but it is executed perfectly. If I had to pick a scene to emulate James Stewart's whole career it would have to be this one. The passion in his face right before he falls to the floor is really heart-wrenching. I would recommend everyone sees this film, and then buy it, if it suits you.</fullReview>

Stewart has one of his best roles as the earnest, gawky fellow from a state that is never identified. Arthur is fabulous as his knowing secretary, and Rains, Arnold, Mitchell, and Carey fill out the fine supporting cast. As he's prone to do, Capra goes a bit overboard with sentiment and melodrama at times, but overall manages to create a film that ranks only behind "It Happened One Night" and "It's a Wonderful Life" in his oeuvre. The scenes inside the senate are well executed, although the ending is somewhat abrupt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best way to learn about the history and government of the United States is to visit Washington, D.C.; Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington invites viewers to experience this through film.The plot is interesting, if not a little absurd. When a senator from a state dies in office, a Boy Ranger head, Jefferson Smith, is appointed to replace him. Mr. Smith has no experience whatsoever with politics. Needless to say, there are greater minds at play. Mr. Smith's enthusiasm for his position is evident from his trip to Washington: immediately after leaving the train, he is captivated by the Capitol dome and takes a tour of the city. The scenes where he stands next to Lincoln's statue are immortal. The plot from there is quite unbelievable (especially the filibuster sequence), but nonetheless inspiring and educational. I don't think it was meant to be taken too seriously; it pokes fun at the nuances of the government.The acting is excellent. James Stewart was ingenious as Mr. Smith. Claude Rains is effective as Senator Paine. Jean Arthur's portrayal of Smith's secretary Saunders is underrated. The direction from Frank Capra is great. He produces very clean cuts and cinematography. This is especially evident in the montage scene when Mr. Smith first tours Washington. The scenery, including historical monuments and the interior of the Capitol, is fascinating.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is an American classic. Its themes on democracy and government are timeless. Likewise, James Stewart's performance remains as fresh as ever. It is easy to forget that the film is so old. Perhaps the most important thing that it reveals is that the past is not so different than the present.</fullReview>

Here's another film that I hadn't seen for around fifteen years and again it's certainly better than I remembered and probably suits me better now as an adult than when I was a kid. While I think there are some weaknesses in the first half of the film and while it could have been cut down a tiny bit, there's no denying the shire power of the second half, which in my opinion is perhaps some of the greatest stuff ever filmed. This is all due to the incredible performance from Stewart whose speech is so heartfelt and emotional that's it's impossible not to feel for him. Claude Rains is equally brilliant as one of the greatest screen villains in history. A remarkable film to a remarkable year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is interesting: this is my 100th review for IMDb, and I can think of no better way to do that than with this masterpiece.For my money it ranks alongside Casablanca as the best black and white movie of all time.It's theme that Liberty should stand, and stand for something, that character must stand for something good and that the right to sit in power is a privilege not an excuse to abuse the people will always be universal. From the Greeks to the people movements the real meaning of democracy is not the chance to make the fast buck, but rather to expand and extend the human spirit to simply to build a better future from mankind.Mr Smith is not simply idealistic it captures and encapsulates all that we would all want our governments to be, and all that we would not want them to be.Absolutely hypnotic viewing and truly one of the greatest films ever made - some will charge it with too much sentimentality or idealism - I would argue that that's the point - we sell our dreams and ideals short - and movies at their best remind us that we can still hope, long for, and yes, even deserve a better world.As long as future generation see films like this and Casablanca then hope lives on.A masterpiece to be treasured and should be seen afresh again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..nothing much to add..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>....for all the praise and accolades for "Mr. smith Goes to Washington".Frank Capra - although I'm not a fan for any particular director, writer and/or actresses - did a great job with a wonderful script by Sidney Buchman. James Stewart ("Jefferson Smith"; Jean Arthur ("Clarissa Saunders"); Claude Rains ("Senator Paine"); Edward Arnold ("Jim Taylor"); Harry Carey ("President of The Senate"); Thomas Mitched ("drunken newsman") all did stellar roles in this movie. Everyone was right-on.The only other comment I would like to make is: We haven't seen anything like this filibuster in many years, and that situation needs to be corrected. Of course, today it would be difficult to do - we all know our government is as about as corrupt as it could be. BUT - how does a politician get there in the first place? As all have written, this film needs to be seen in every home with every member present, and certainly should be a class all its own in every school. I remember it when it was first release and say again, re-release it with all the cannons shooting. Bravo to all !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story of Innocence vs. Political Corruption, as Director Frank Capra Touches All the Bases in Grand Slam Home Run of Pure Americana!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beginning with a distressed scene of various men from various stations using the modern convenience of communications, the telephone to impart information about the passing of a Senator. The death is sudden and unexpected. Far beyond the grieving or sense of loss, it is described in terms of being a newsworthy item, or a bit of bad luck for a Political Machine.Its master plan to extract untold monetary gain from the well intentioned emergency deficiency(federal aid)bill.We are privy to behind the scenes conferencing and to meeting the guys who could be called the 'King Makers' or at least, the powers behind the throne.A conversation between the un-named State's surviving Senator, Joseph Paine(Claude Reins)and Political Boss, James Taylor(Edward Arnold)concerning the importance of their getting things done post haste! The selection of an appointment to fill out the unexpired term of the now expired Law Maker. Qualities like ability, integrity, devotion to duty education and background do not make it into the conversation.The new Senator must know how to keep his lip buttoned and to take orders from the Political Machine, as conveyed to him by his senior cohort, Senator Paine. It will be the Governor's(Guy Kibbee)duty under law to make the selection. This is a much more complicated chore than it would seem. For the Gov is totally in the pocket of Boss Taylor.Governor 'Happy' Hopper has not only Taylor to contend with, but also an amalgam of citizens, representing a cross section of the electorate, who have a grass-roots reformer in mind for the post. The Gov cannot find peace, even in his own household, where his wife and large number of offspring are all very astute of the back room political world that Daddy inhabits.But it is through the kids that 'Hap' learns of the Hero, Youth Leader, one Jefferson Smith(Jimmy Stewart). Smith is honest,hard working, knowledgeable, and a super student of American History. He is also very 'wet behind the ears.' When it comes to pragmatic dealing with real world problems, he has the outlook of a boy.An accidental tangling with Boss Taylor's Boondoggle, an unnecessary damn for the same river canyon that Smith would establish a 'NMational Boys' Camp', Smith is branded as being 'trouble'. Against his better judgment and wishes, Senator Paine has his own daughter, Susan(Astrid Allwin), get Smith away from the Senate and any knowledge of the grafting intent of its one section.Smith is told about the reason for his absence from the Senate and how and why it was orchestrated by Paine and his daughter. Emraged, he starts asking a lot of questions about the Dam project and about Taylor and his control of the Machine.They frame Smith and, well then the big showdown comes into play. The trumped up charges, the move to expel Smith seem too much, but another meeting with his Secretary, "Saunders"(Jean Arthur)sets him on the track for the battle in the Senate Chambers.The pivotal occurrences seem to all revolve on Claude Rains' Sen. Paine Character. His character (small 'c') is a highly complex blend of all that is good and bad in mankind. Joe Paine had once been an eager beaver of an innocent, much like his youthful Protégé, Smith. But along the line, Paine started excessively 'playing ball' and 'doing business' with special interests. His role was reduced to that of "Whore". And the one scene that seems to break Senator Paine is a short and quiet for Mr. Claude Rains' character. At a sort of 'victory' party given by Taylor celebrating the successful frame job of Smith, Taylor is seen teasing some party girls (obviously some 'Bimbos')about which one would get some little trinkets or money, Paine looks on angry and tormented. The scene strongly reminding him of what he has made of his own daughter.The film's credits list only the 2 names of Jean Arthur and James Stewart as Stars above the title, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON. In a sense, just about any of the 10-15 or so players turned in 'starring' performances. Edward Arnold, Guy Kibbee, Thomas Mitchell, Eugene Palette,Bulah Bondi,Ruth Donnelly,H.B.Warner,Piere Watkin, en ad infinitum, all gave top supporting, even career performances! We have to pay a special tribute to Harry Carey's portrayal of the Vice President(the President of the Senate). His VP is stern, business like,capable and experienced. Yet he is also a kindly and decent man. He remains impartial while the most serious charges are put on the seemingly guilty Smith. And besides, he looked so much like my Paternal Grandfather &amp; namesake, John T. Ryan, who passed on in 1944, 2 years before my birth.Once again the masterful Mr. Frank Capra has taken this assembled group of favored actors and mixed them in with a fine, decent and believable story giving us what has to be a real, true slice of Americana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Capra classic that still is enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic had escaped my viewing pleasure until recently when our neighbor Emily needed to watch it for high school extra credit. Typical Capra movie where one person, dedicated to doing what is right, can make a difference for society.James Stewart is Jefferson Smith, an honest son of a deceased newspaper man and who also publishes a small paper, but loves nature and the heritage of the USA. When a senator dies unexpectedly, and the governor needs to pick a replacement to serve out his term, the crooked newspaper man Jim Taylor wants to be sure they send a 'yes' man, someone who won't ask too many questions. At stake is a big project to build a dam which will make millions for Taylor who has bought up adjoining property under false names.Jeff Smith is picked because he is green, and they think surely he will just go along. But everyone is surprised when Smith nervously introduces his own bill, to use the same land slated for the dam, for a boys' camp. Coached by his office staff Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur) he fights those against him by using the filibuster tactic.Jim Taylor is powerful, 'owns' most of the politicians, mounts a campaign to discredit Jeff Smith, and it almost works. Anyone can guess how the story turns out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in my government class, and I'll admit it I was not expecting much of anything, but I was totally wrong. This is bar-none one of the best movies that I've ever seen, and that's not even close to an exaggeration. I love how this movie accurately portrays American politics, and gives us somewhat of a hisotrical perspective of the above. I love the main character, and I love the voice of the girl that's his secretary, her name escapes me right now, it's just so clique(spelling?). It has the knight in shinning armor kind of thing going for it, in a sense that the main character, Mr. Smith, is like a pure essence, and everyone else is evil, and it gives you hope for him and through him for American politics. This is the kind of America that Jefferson wanted, one that is run by the people, not by the elites of the country. This is by far the best black and white movie that I have seen, and for anyone that doesn't want to see it because it is black and white should see it, because it is so good.. You should watch it all at once though, I saw it over a period of three days, and I still think it's great, but if you see it all at once, it is probably so better since you don't have to wait to see what happens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manages to illicit American patriotism in even the most jaded</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a sometimes sappy, cheer for the under-dog type film, but I recommend you allow yourself to be sucked into it because it is a fun ride. The film was made in 1939, so there are some areas where the times (and how far cinematic technology has come since then) are obvious. Camera shots cut away and back to get closer to their subject in the beginning scenes rather than panning in. But don't let this keep you from it. There are also some beautifully shot scenes and fantastic camera work. There is a particular moment when Jeff Smith (Stuart) first approaches the Lincoln Memorial. The camera is set up high above the scene and you look down through those grand columns as he approaches Mr. Lincoln. It is stunning. The acting is superb and James Stuart shows his comedic genius. Jean Arthur is beautiful and tough and unforgettable in her role. There are plenty of quotable lines throughout. Perhaps one of the greatest feats of this film, however, is it's timelessness. All of the themes are still relevant today and the characters are still believable in our time. I truly believe this is one film EVERY American should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Capra classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr Smith Goes to Washington is from that wonderful Class of 1939 films that included Gone With the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, Stagecoach, Wuthering Heights, Ninotchka, Dark Victory, Of Mice and Men, Goodbye Mr. Chips, Beau Geste, Intermezzo:A Love Story, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Young Mr. Lincoln and Gunga Din. Wow! What a year. Two films rose above the illustrious pack at the Academy Awards for 1939. It was Gone With the Wind with 13 nominations vs. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington with 11 nominations. GWTW by a knockout with eight wins and two special awards while MSGTW only won a single Oscar for Lewis R. Foster and his original story. The story of a young freshman senator full of ideals who takes on the political machine in a tale of freedom and decency vs. oppression and corruption. This film is kind of an extension of Director Frank Capra's earlier film Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. Capra of course is the respected legendary director of such other classics as It's a Wonderful Life, Lost Horizon and It Happened One Night among many others. Capra's cinematographer Joseph Walker who photographed It's A Wonderful Life, Lost Horizon, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and It Happened One Night as well as many other great films for other directors is here behind the lens. Dimitri Tiomkin scores the film. In the cast in their Academy Award nominated performances are James Stewart, Claude Rains and Harry Carey. Also in the cast are Jean Arthur, Beulah Bondi, H.B. Warner, Ruth Donnelly and William Demarest. It's a drama with a lot of comic relief. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Tame Compared to What's Happening Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is timely, even in 2006. It's probably the first really powerful film to take on the deal making and graft that went on in upper echelon politics. We are so naive as a nation when it comes to this kind of stuff. As I write this review, a new law concerning the accepting of gifts just hit the books. But it didn't include add on amendments to feather the nests of political districts. Of course not. You can do without the two martini lunch, but not the bridge to nowhere. This movie is about what happens to a man when he has high ideals. First of all, it's doubtful he would even be elected today. He would have to have millions and tell a whole string of lies to get there. Once there, he would have to see which backs to pat and butts to you-know-what. Still, Stewart does play a man of honor, one who thinks there is hope, and he gets his shirt tails caught in the machinery. The bad guys know that they may lose this battle, but it goes on to this day. All the cards are already stacked. Stewart's performance is masterful. He brings passion and commitment to the role. I like to think that he is something like the guy he plays. Frank Capra did a lot of work for the government and must have seen the ugly side. Some say his work is too simplistic. If the rest of America is collapsing around us, we should look to some of the optimism of the Capra films. Even if they stretch realism, they should make us think of the way things should be. I'm sure that were he alive today, some humorless knucklehead would be tapping his phone lines and screaming subversive.The movie shows that there was polarization back then (1939) and the corruption in government had to be addressed. I wonder if there's a Jefferson Smith out there somewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie twice in my lifetime - the first on Christmas Day 1997 on my old hometown's local station, and the second was on a very excellent DVD release in my Government class as a prep school senior in 2004. This is a very good, very old, and very nice film that depicts our nation very well. Even better is Frank Capra, which some of y'all might have known in many other movies of the time. This is a great film, and I suggest that you watch the DVD version. Even though this is fullscreen (there was no widescreen at the time) and mono, you'll have a very eclectic selection of languages to choose from, so that you don't have to make this movie "American!"

		<fullReview>The term Capraesque when applied to film has come to mean sentimental, cosy and idealistic. But under many of Capra's superficially simplistic stories lurked a seed of angry bitterness. The desperation of the Great Depression is acutely palpable underneath the screwball romance exterior of "It Happened One Night," and despite its reputation as a heart-warming Christmas film, "It's a Wonderful Life" has some very dark moments which effectively illustrate one man quickly approaching the end of his rope.In the world of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," everything of course turns out right, justice prevails, and American government is depicted as a body of men who basically want to do the right thing by their people. But it's also an angry indictment of corruption and the self-interest rampant in our government that existed then and still exists today. Rich politicians want the poor to stay poor (or they at least have no incentive to help the lower classes improve their situations), because it benefits them. This movie was pretty fearless for its time, when anti-government sentiment would not have been popular and would become even less popular as the U.S. entered WWII and patriotic fervor struck the nation.Anchoring this film is James Stewart, who deserves mention along with Jack Lemmon as one of cinema's great everymen. He gives a slow-burn performance here, at times very similar to the one he would give seven years later in "Wonderful Life.." Even given their darker undertones, Capra's films may still be too saccharine for some to tolerate now. But there's something appealing about his movies today. They don't shy away from tough issues, but they make you feel like Mankind has it in him to make everything turn out o.k. in the end.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can not recall a director that I have seen in my life that has the simple depth that Capra has. You will not get the true genius of Capra until you have seen a few of his other films. What makes this film so special is that it tells a story of a Washington D.C. in the early 40's that we still going on in our day. Capra has the correct formula for storytelling. Using simple real influences like a greater good vs. a greater evil. We watch how these two forces impact a common soul. These elements create great tension and good stories. I would recommend any of Capra's films to anyone who is not afraid to watch a movie that is still black and white.</fullReview>

Mr. Smith is so unsuspecting but you gotta love him. My favorite line is when Saunders tells him to go home and stop making people feel sorry for him. I was proud of Jefferson Smith when he took the Senate floor and gave a filibuster-it showed his determination to do what's right through it all! I think you will enjoy this movie. It almost made me cry sometimes at the unfairness of Senator Paine, Jim Taylor, and the Taylor machine. Some of the information is a little out of date-there are 100 senators now, not 96. I also like the president of the senate because he seems to be on Smith's side during the last part of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" is chiefly about the right and duty of every American to stand tenaciously for their beliefs, for their defense, and for the truth. Jimmy Stewart plays a naive, yet charitably-hearted and popular icon named Jefferson Smith who realizes that the political office can be effective and reverent if it operates solely for the people, rather than "grash" or garish, entrenched special interests. Selected by Virginia political bigshot Jim Taylor, who influences every affair in the state, from the political landscape to the savage press, and in turn Governor Hubert Hopper as well, to succeed a perished senator, Mr. Smith goes to Washington oblivious of the sordid and ruthless nature of American politics, and is merely stupefied by the majesty of the Capitol Building, enthralled by a visit to the Lincolm Monument, greatly reveres his colleague, Senator Joseph Paine, and wants to serve only with the best intentions for the citizens of his state. An exceedingly nervous and modest fellow (hardly the candidate of a record filibuster), when Smith meets Senator Paine's gorgeous daughter, he fumbles with his hat and clumsily drops it to the ground, which gives the viewer the concern that if he hasn't the backbone to regularly converse with an attractive woman, then how can he possibly survive the trials and hardships of the United States Senate? His secretary, Clarissa Saunders, initially dismisses Smith's "superficial morality", yet is eventually captivated by his poetic innocence and honesty and assists him in creating propositions and offering advice, while secretly falling head over heels for him. During his first day in Congress, Smith trembles relentlessly in presenting his case for the construction of a National Boy's Camp, and is scoffed, sneered, and humiliated by 96 members of the Senate. It turns out that his noble aspirations may be in peril, when it is revealed that a dam will be constructed in the proposed spot of his camp, of all terrible ironies. Thus ensues a heartwarming, hilarious, and incendiary confrontation between the innocuous, noble Mr. Smith and the rest of the tainted Senate, as well as the imposing "big shot" Jim Taylor, in a captivating look at how democracy and goodness should prevail when honest, tenacious men like Jefferson Smith hold their ground, stand up for their beliefs, and act impervious to any derision of their enterprise. It lacks a satisfiable and comprehensive resolution, and it may be at times overly condescending, sugarcoated and sentimental, and somewhat politically pretentious and fantastic, yet "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington" is profound, eliciting a noble statement about democracy and teaching us that it is "the lost causes that are worth fighting for". In Jefferson Smith, we see an American hero, standing courageously, against all odds, for the honor, good will, and dignity of political representation. A fine and noble film indeed that is definitely a timeless and timely American classic. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER STUFF INSIDE!!!!!I love Jimmy Stewart, see (as one can tell by my username), and he is such a great actor. True, a couple of his later movies (in particular: Rear Window and How the West was Won) are not so hot, but practically all of his earlier ones are top-hole. This is such a sweet movie I tell you. Claude Rains is the perfect villain and James Stewart is the perfect, good-hearted, good-natured, darling, inexperienced, youngest senator of all time, all around good-guy. It's a Wonderful Life (also by Capra) is in my opinion, the finest of Jimmy's movies, for his bumbling shyness is practically gone and he shines in the role of an out-of-luck business man in the depths of despair, but Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a close second in my estimation. When he slugs all those reporters! and that faint at the end is amazing! He just collapsed, eh! Just like that! Wow! I'm kidding of course in showing such enthusiasm for a mere faint, but it certainly was an enjoyable watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing like a good patriotic movie to cleanse the communist out of you. And Frank Capra's classic Mr. Smith Goes To Washington does the trick!With the country in a deep depression and patriotism at an all time low, the American people needed a boost and this film gave it to them. With its simple plot and strong sense of patriotism, Frank Capra's film helped rebuild the American people's morale and restored their sense of patriotism, by strategically using one of the era's most popular American icons, Jimmy Stewart. His 'boy next door' charisma helped sell the overly patriotic character of Jefferson Smith to the audience. His acting, characterization and delivery was moving and sincere. Capra created a powerful and inspiring story of an all-American boy, tested and criticized by the 'Political Machine', standing up and fighting for the unalienable rights of all human beings. The character of Jeff Smith represented more than the underdog in this film. He represented the average American who was down, but not out for the count. In the film, his character fought hard and was knocked down many times, but with the odds against him and the bid dogs laughing at his face, he rose and stood up to the occasion. He fought 'The Man', and 'The Man' went down. Jeff Smith gave more than entertainment; he gave light at the end of every American's dark tunnel. With his focus on the cruelty and manipulation Jeff Smith faced in the film, Capra provoked the audience to feel angry towards the crooked politicians and sympathetic towards Smith. This brilliant use of propaganda-like technique evokes the patriotism deep inside of the individuals watching until the film's climactic ending where it leaves them sweating red, white and blue. However, many of the characters were one-dimensional as if the actors playing them were just 'acting out' their part. They weren't as intense as Jimmy, of course a lot of them played the straight man or woman, but at least give the people some variety! Their gumby-like facial expressions were a bore and much of the film seemed exaggerated and unrealistic, referring to the scene where Smith goes on a punching rampage, punching every press guy in site! PLLLEEEEASE!!! You can't do that, there's a thing called assault &amp; battery but who cares it's Jimmy Stewart. That guy can do whatever he wants. Punching rampage or not, this movie is great for all the Jimmy Stewart fans out there. It's not his best work, but does outshine the rest of the characters in the movie. This is also a great movie for anyone who needs a healthy dose of patriotism. Overall, it was a well-made movie and entertaining enough to see a second time.</fullReview>

In the film a Senator dies and the Governor Jefferson Smith gets appointed to fill the spot of the Senator. He is very naive and will say yes just about to anything. Well, so they think. They don't think that he will actually stick up for what he believes in and stay honest. Jimmy Stewart who plays Jefferson Smith of course did a fabulous job. He is a true talent and legend. It's nice to watch an actor who is very diverse in the characters he plays. He is not the same in every movie. He portrayed Jefferson Smith very nicely and that you wish he was senator off screen. That is how real the character seemed. The movie reflected how much the director (Frank Capra) loved America. The close up shots of the different sites in Washington DC really brought out the American spirit. It showed that the character Jefferson Smith was very proud to live in the U.S. It is a classic film with no bad comments to say about it. It is a fun creative plot with great acting. Make some hot dogs, grab the American flags, get the family together and watch this fun patriotic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, what a wonderful movie. This movie had great actors and actresses, had a very interesting plot, and a spectacular way of portraying the truth of the unheard man. I really enjoyed this movie, I think the reason would have to be that the plot flowed so freely. I'm not going to tell you much about the movie but, its like a man that knows nothing about the government and such. But he is chosen by powerful people to be a senator mainly because they believe that since he doesn't know anything about the government and the way its ran. That he will not be able to object to the ways the powerful people run him. Though Mr Smith encounters a lot of problems along the way. The good man always comes out on top. I loved this movie, its one of those kind that keep you on your toes, and that wont allow you to put the movie on pause. I couldn't handle the way they treated Mr Smith, it was like that he was just a rug for the powerful people to wipe their feet on. I know that I would not of liked this movie if it did not end the way it did. I in a way though did not really like the ending, because I felt that it could of showed what happened to the powerful people that took advantage of Mr Smith. I encourage you to watch this, it has beautiful people, a magnificent plot. I thought it was great specially since pretty much the whole movie took place inside the congress building with the president and all of the other senators. I have not seen many movies that just take place in one main spot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director and produce Frank Capra, comes a movie with a bigheart. It?s just one of those feel good movies, in which anyonewho ever had a dream can relate to. ?Mr. Smith goes toWashingtonÓ showcases Jimmy Stewart ( Mr. Smith) in his epicperformance as a determined young senator. With WashingtonD.C. as the brilliant setting, ?Mr. Smith goes to WashingtonÓ showsexactly what the United States was built on, hopes and dreams. This wholesome story of one man and his dream ?a dream forevery boy in AmericaÓ. This is a film truly made for anyone of anyage to enjoy. I guess it just shows that Capra and Stewart make a good team. The sparks lit up on screen, it?s not much later until they makeanother hit movie together (?It?s a wonderful lifeÓ, 1946). Both usedtheir craft to the fullest. Capra uses his creative genius to get thestory across through a more cinematography point of view. WhileStewart uses his natural stance on screen, to make every linecome out as if he honestly means it. That?s superb acting! Although saying the same for the whole cast would be a lie. The movie contained many cast members. There were senators,all the little overly dramatic Boy Scouts and the many, many extras. The scenes in which all the senate members were in, seemed tobe most difficult to sit through. The scenes just seemed to dragon a bit too long which would make it hard to try and get throughthe over acting of some of the characters. The little boys seemedto be most common for this method of acting, they added a littletoo much drama! Although the movie had a feel good story to it, itbegan to drag on and on and on.... ?Mr. Smith goes to WashingtonÓ shows just how shady ourgovernment is, but one mans hopes and dreams can over see allof that. This wholesome and clever movie deserves it?s oscar forbest writing on an original story. This reviewer gives ?Mr. Smithgoes to WashingtonÓ an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engaging, albeit simplistic, film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes To Washington is an engaging, albeit simplistic, film about the power of determination and the effect one man can have on society. While it is rife with Capra's signature sentimentality and less-than-subtle storytelling methods, it is also very effective. The story is one of a triumph of dogged persistence and idealism over "the political machine". It evokes the spirit of Norman Rockwell's "Freedom of Speech".Jeff Smith (Jimmy Stewart) is a young, idealistic leader of a boys' group similar to the Boy Scouts, who is chosen, much to his surprise, to be elected senator. He is filled with hope and aspirations of his country's future, seeing his surroundings with wonder and amazement. His only plan - aside from patriotic yet vague hopes - is to pass a bill in Congress allowing for the creation of a national boys' camp. This, of course, earns him favor with boys all across the country, idolizing him and sending him campaign contributions - a nickel at a time. He meets up with his new secretary, the lovely yet callous Clarissa Saunders (usually just "Saunders"), played by Jean Arthur, who helps to write and introduce his bill. However, conflicts arise when the proposed land for Smith's camp is the same site as the soon-to-be-proposed Willet Creek Dam. Soon, Smith discovers an aspect of America he never expected - the puppetry of Jim Taylor, an extraordinarily wealthy tycoon who works his way into the innermost workings of Congress.In many ways, he represents an ambassador of sorts between the world of boys - filled with adventure, ambition and a certain irrefutable yet candidly simple logic, and the world of politics - filled with cynicism, bribery and self-interest. (in fact, aside from Jefferson Smith, just about every politician in the film is either corrupt or simply very stubborn and foolish). Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of the young senator is so incredibly naive, boyish and filled with blue-eyed wonder far past the point of realism (at one point, he punches several people in the face), yet he manages to retain a certain charm. Saunders notes that when he left for the Senate for, she felt as if she were a mother wishing him well on his first day of school. Without giving away any details, despite the implausibility of the character this is one of Jimmy Stewart's best and most entertaining performances.However, the best performance in the film - beyond any doubt - would have to be Claude Rains's portrayal of Senator Joseph Paine. Paine is a more complex and interesting character than the others, most of whom have rather predictable personalities and story arcs. Paine, once Jefferson Smith's mentor and good friend, is forced to campaign against him. He has been justifying his allowance of the Taylors' influence for years, and despite his basic good nature, he has learned how to play the game of politics. He is a man who at times hates his job, but knows what must do and pursues it with everything he has - and Rains is utterly convincing in the role.Still, the film is far from perfect. Many of the characters seem simple and hollow - as if they were merely the execution of the story's premise, rather than actual humans in a difficult situation. Much of the film seems incredibly exaggerated and unlikely - particularly what happens to Smith's fanboys toward the end of the film! Capra's basic filmmaking strategy is to bombard the viewer with emotion and inspiring, patriotic monologues.Ultimately, despite its flaws, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is very entertaining. As long as the viewer doesn't take it as seriously as it seems to take itself, (and doesn't mind a barrage of stars and stripes) it is a very enjoyable and significant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why I didn't like it when I first saw it nearly two decades ago. At the time I felt that it was an inferior version of Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, which I had seen years earlier and loved. I felt, that far from naive, Mr. Smith was hysterical, self-righteous, megalomaniacal, manipulative, humorless, and downright fascist with his intransigent zealot's zeal for cleaning up government corruption and his private army of "boys". The casting is certainly typical Hollywood: the good are extremely handsome, the evil are extremely homely, and guess who always wins. Poor Eugene Pallette elicits sympathy just because of his ungainly appearance, and his incessantly demeaning casting as a goon. I still have some of those misgivings after seeing the film recently, but this is a very well-made one, particularly, the cinematography. It is absolutely amazing that Hollywood should have gotten so good, so early, and that such an art should have been lost so long ago. No camera work in the last forty years remotely compares. It is not just the black and white, it is the shades of gray, the contrast, the lighting, pacing, angles, composition, a very sophisticated art. The scene where Smith weeps at the Lincoln Memorial is very moving. I think it would have been more moving if the lady hadn't appeared to console him. But why highlight Lincoln, why not Washington? Indeed, isn't it astonishing, that no movie has ever been made about Washington? (I am not saying it should be made, just wondering why not). Harvey is still my favorite Jimmy Stewart movie. Far more humor in that one. As a movie, on a similar subject, I thought "Storm Center" (1956) more satisfying than Mr. Smith: "dumpy" woman hero, small town, low key, bolder message. In real life I only saw Jimmy Stewart as a dog-lover. He appeared on TV with his dog on Dinah Shore's pet show. The last time I saw him was on Johnny Carson, reading a poem he wrote about his late dog, and choking up. I felt so sorry for him. A rather inscrutable man, who flew missions not only over Germany, but also over Vietnam. I think his son died in that war. It is amazing that such a long-lived, accomplished man was never interviewed about his movie career, nor wrote anything about it, or his life. So public, yet so private. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without a doubt, the best Frank Capra movie I've seen. It has the typical Capra storyline of an average man who becomes great, but it's told in an incredible way. Mr. Smith shows the corruption in the senate and tells the story of one man who wants to stand and fight the corruption.Jimmy Stewart gives the performance of his career in Mr. Smith. He perfectly plays the naive junior senator Jeff Smith. Stewart is once again teamed with Jean Arthur as his secretary, also in her best performance. Claude Rains is brilliant as the Senator Joseph Paine who attempts to destroy Smith when Smith discovers his plans to build a dam in their home state.Mr. Smith Goes To Washington has everything that makes a movie great. Brilliant directing, brilliant acting, and a fantastic screenplay. Not only is Mr. Smith Capra's best film, but it's also one of the greatest of all time.</fullReview>

Anyone who's seen Harvey can attest to that but this movie raises James Stewart above merely great, to legendary. Watching this movie you feel every human emotion, happiness, sadness, anger, and everything in between. Mr. Smith goes to Washington to do what he feels is right and no fights for it no matter what. Even after they ruin his name and try to run him out of town he will not give up. The final scene in which Mr. Smith makes a brilliant filibuster, is the true testament of high ideals and good men.

		<fullReview>To truly enjoy this film and not wince at its inherent sappiness you have to remember how optimistic you were as a child. Though ostensibly about the duplicity of politics, what this production is really about is the idealism of youth versus the cynicism of adulthood. The treacley nature of this work is easier to swallow if you remember that as a child you believed in the vision that is central to this film; freedom and democracy are ethereally intertwined by distinguished men in government. I know, I know, it's hard to say without laughing. Capra uses his filmmaking acumen to the fullest with interesting lighting and au fait camera positioning. Jean Arthur is engaging as always and Stewart is, of course, right in his element. The only real problem is the awkward introduction of Smith. The first time we meet him he has already accepted an appointment to the U.S. Senate. This seems rushed. It seems as if a scene in which the na?ve Smith is coaxed into serving would have added so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scathing satire of American "democracy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An all-time classic, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a scathing indictment of the American political establishment. It's about Jefferson Smith who is an all-American "Boy Scout" who fully believes in the Constitution and all the myths of American democracy. He's chosen to replace a U.S. Senator who has died, and because of his spotless reputation in the community and inexperience in politics, the Governor, controlled by capitalist interests, chooses to name him Senator thinking they could easily manipulate him. Once he arrives in the Senate, he quickly discovers that his idealistic (and naive) belief in the American system to reflect the will of the people does match up with reality. He's smeared by the corporate media (the Washington Press Club denounced the film as un-American after the world premiere) and his efforts to pass a bill to establish a local camp are sabotaged by the corporate political machine because it interferes with plans to build a dam on the same land. Seeing Smith as a liability, the corporate state goes into full character assassination mode, while Smith embarks on a filibuster in the Senate with the goal of exposing the corruption of the system. The brilliance of the film is that it shows how capitalist interests own and control the political system (a system that is set up as a distraction from that fact), and yet it doesn't allow Smith to be completely triumphant, which would have reinforced his idealism and proved the system can "work" if only good people are elected. The ending is left ambiguous and somewhat bleak as Smith proves his point but nothing is fundamentally changed. Jimmy Stewart gives a fantastic performance as Smith in this classic by Frank Capra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr Smith, I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After previously having viewed various Capra works over time I've grown accustomed to his style of storytelling which in turn has given me a greater appreciation for the film medium. But to come into, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," to see James Stewart leading a heavy political commentary peaked my curiosity and surprisingly stirred some doubts. Would an innocent John Doe be able to carry a story of this magnitude through an individual's chest as had been done before with Frank's tales? Or would it end up being a bullet fired without any gunpowder? Thankfully I can say that the effort has lived up to its reputation that it has built for the past 60+ years.When speaking of politics in film most things tend to turn towards the political climate of stories and not the political systems/structures themselves. They depict what gets produced and how it affects the individuals but not the workings and conflicts along the way. To toss a man into a twisted game and show his utterly honest attempt at survival was a bit of a fun concept to see unfold. Although I was a bit dissatisfied with how the good versus evil was played out (look no further then the scene where the older politicians prevent newspaper distribution by an absolute cruelty to minors) it is carried out realistically which is what counts. It also should go without mentioning that the entire Filibuster performance is inspiring in the way it was composed.To think that Jefferson Smith's have been crushed by the weight of the U.S. government since this release is a bit saddening. It is interesting to note that this film was labeled as pro-communist upon its release for depicting such a realistic corruption. But despite the trials and tribulations these well spirited people must face as stated by Smith, "Somebody'll listen to me." We have Jeff. We have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America's the best! GO BUSH!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing like a good patriotic movie to cleanse the communist out of you. And Frank Capra's classic Mr. Smith Goes To Washington does the trick!With the country in a deep depression and patriotism at an all time low, the American people needed a boost and this film gave it to them. With its simple plot and strong sense of patriotism, Frank Capra's film helped rebuild the American people's morale and restored their sense of patriotism, by strategically using one of the era's most popular American icons, Jimmy Stewart. His 'boy next door' charisma helped sell the overly patriotic character of Jefferson Smith to the audience. His acting, characterization and delivery was moving and sincere. Capra created a powerful and inspiring story of an all-American boy, tested and criticized by the 'Political Machine', standing up and fighting for the unalienable rights of all human beings. The character of Jeff Smith represented more than the underdog in this film. He represented the average American who was down, but not out for the count. In the film, his character fought hard and was knocked down many times, but with the odds against him and the bid dogs laughing at his face, he rose and stood up to the occasion. He fought 'The Man', and 'The Man' went down. Jeff Smith gave more than entertainment; he gave light at the end of every American's dark tunnel. With his focus on the cruelty and manipulation Jeff Smith faced in the film, Capra provoked the audience to feel angry towards the crooked politicians and sympathetic towards Smith. This brilliant use of propaganda-like technique evokes the patriotism deep inside of the individuals watching until the film's climactic ending where it leaves them sweating red, white and blue. However, many of the characters were one-dimensional as if the actors playing them were just 'acting out' their part. They weren't as intense as Jimmy, of course a lot of them played the straight man or woman, but at least give the people some variety! Their gumby-like facial expressions were a bore and much of the film seemed exaggerated and unrealistic, referring to the scene where Smith goes on a punching rampage, punching every press guy in site! PLLLEEEEASE!!! You can't do that, there's a thing called assault &amp; battery but who cares it's Jimmy Stewart. That guy can do whatever he wants. Punching rampage or not, this movie is great for all the Jimmy Stewart fans out there. It's not his best work, but does outshine the rest of the characters in the movie. This is also a great movie for anyone who needs a healthy dose of patriotism. Overall, it was a well-made movie and entertaining enough to see a second time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the time of WWII in order to keep their actors, writors, and any other person envolved in the movie making process from being sent to war,Hollywoods finest agreed to produce movies to improve American morale. Mr. Smith goes to Washington is one of those movies. This movie has all of the red, white, and blue, and anything inbetween that could make all people proud of America. Jefferson Smith a leader in a small town is suddenly put in the position of state senator. He is very naive and this is the only reason he was given the job. Soon he is able to make his own project which with out his knowing goes againsn't the political machine of his state. Smith finds out that one man is running his state and corrupting its politions with money. He fights againsn't it with all of his might and with the constitution keeps the senate floor running for over 24 hours! This movie of Frank Capra's is certainly idealistic and perfect for America during the time of war. But today can seem almost cheesy, When Smith goes to Washington he a common tourist times 10. He insists on seeing almost every monument in one day and worries his fellow politions! Now this is a little over board, he should have more priorities than that. Although certainly very American this movie is a little over patriotic and not the best of Frank Capras work. The reunion of Capra and Stewart is wonderful in this movie, Stewart is wonderful playing his role as the naive senator.This choice for Stewart is superb he is a role model for all Americans and enhances the movies morale to the nth degree! Overall I would rate this movie a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all my problem with this movie may be I am not an American. It may be it won a lot of Oscars. But the movie have been made before just better by the same director.Story: Same story as Mr. Deeds goes to town. Just removed of the parts where you get to like the protagonist. Seriously Smith arrives to Washington and disappears for 5 hours without anyone knowing where he is. Then you do not think he is a guy from the countryside like Deeds was but just a plain idiot. Then the conflict arrives. They have planned the same land for a Dam and a boy scout camp. The camp could have been moved easily without anyones protest the rich backer could even have bought some other land for him and be standing as the hero. This just destroyed the premise of the movie that the conflict is based on nothing plausible.Actors: Jean Arthur was lovely and played very well. Jimmy Stewart had better been replaced by Gary Cooper as in Deeds. Stewart of course did not have a lot to work with in this movie.Conclusion: It may have made a large impact when it was made. But not in any way subtle about anything. You pretty fast get hammered into your head how good Smith is and how corrupt the rest of the politicians are. Funny thing is the movie ignores politics completely. Had they wanted to show how it works then they had just found a solution about moving the camp. A bogus conflict flush out all the corruption. There are loads of better movies and less preachy about corruption. See Mr. Deeds go to town instead as that is a real gem even though topic is not politics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tropic of Capra-corn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading Director Frank Capra's bio, I was left breathless. Talk about working one's self up from the ranks. Here's a man who pulled up those bootstraps to achieve the heights in screen directing.In "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," Capra's acknowledged "masterpiece," everything speaks to the "little guy against the corrupt mass." Capra apparently knew this scenario well, as his bio indicates.Yet, as I watch the film unfold, I cringe numerous times. I wince, sigh, and go "ugh" --not to mentions some expletives that emerge.While I admit the man's a master (maybe genius) at his technical craft, I also note the film is utterly manipulative, overly sentimental, and emotionally exasperating. His sublime cast (especially James Stewart, Claude Rains and Jean Arthur) hurl themselves into the proceedings 100%. And with Capra's closeups, it's pretty hard not to feel something.What I feel most often is strangely repelling. The whole enterprise seems grossly exaggerated and dramatically overblown. Yet I can't deny the public's enthusiastic reaction to this nearly 70-year old film. It's not my cup of tea, though, and ditto for many other works of this director. Capra joins the ranks of DeMille (and--I'd predict 70 years from now--Spielberg): grossly dated as relics from the "Picesan Age" of social and cultural values.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Art of Compromise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Politics has, and always will be, the art of compromise. If it wasn't hardly any of the business of the nation would ever get done. Even a boy ranger has to do that every now and then. Compromise is not a word heard in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Frank Capra's heroes and villains are starkly contrasted in his populist films. This film with its powerful performance by James Stewart as Jefferson Smith, interim appointee to the United States Senate from an unnamed western state, is now such a part of Americana that criticism of it is almost sacrilegious. The performance is great, but the premise behind the film needs some examination.Having a national boy's camp seems like a fine idea, who could be against it. But having it be at Willett Creek in his state, was that truly necessary? Granted that the proposed dam is piece of pork barrel legislation that a few are going to make a killing on. Quite realistically the dam is a rider on an appropriations bill that Capra names the "deficiency bill" which is a bill for further relief to the citizens of 1939 USA which was still in the Depression. Stewart is by his filibuster, holding up relief for a whole nation. Here's where compromise comes in. The seasoned politician or even a novice trying to learn would ask himself, just what are my priorities? Isn't getting that boy's camp my goal, how do I achieve that goal? In the end Stewart might get that boy's camp, but I certainly hope if he did stay in the Senate he didn't develop any other goals that halted the nation's business.Give and take, that's what it's all about folks.Jean Arthur is a fine Capra heroine. Women in Capra films can certainly be independent and have careers, but their main function is to support the hero, especially when he's down. Her best moments in this film and in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is when the hero seems beaten and all is lost, she provides the spark that gets him up before the bell counts him out.Capra rounds the cast out with a whole crew of familiar players who you look to as old friends whenever you see one of his films. One of Capra's great attributes was an intuitive sense of casting, just like John Ford. Whenever you see Edward Arnold, Guy Kibbee, Thomas Mitchell, you know immediately the kind of part they will be playing and you welcome them as old friends.Claude Rains plays the other Senator from Stewart's state, a well respected man who's being talked of for the White House. It's Rains's only Capra film and as always he gives a great performance. He's the mouthpiece of Edward Arnold's political machine in the Senate and has been there a few terms. He's also an old friend of Stewart's late father. It's only an appeal to Rains by Stewart on a personal basis that breaks things open during that famous filibuster scene. Capra had to have that in the story because other than that, Stewart would have been dealt with by his colleagues summarily despite his last stand heroics.Ego is something that has to be put aside occasionally. I do wonder what happens to Stewart and Arthur in the future because it doesn't look like he's learned that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good story, but not very well filmed or acted, in my opinion. The acting was amateurish, the cuts were disjointed, and the ending seemed abrupt.At any rate, it gives you good insight into the kind of people behind the Republican party in America today (e.g. Taylor, his corporate and politically corrupt cronies, and their evil political machine).Mr. Smith on the other hand, is much more representative of the people and ideals of the Democratic party. A giving person who cares about people and a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and not corporate or other narrow minded interests who utilize dishonesty and playing on humanity's worst instincts, like fear and hatred, to win elections.It also is currently applicable to the filibuster debate in the Senate. This movie shows how political appointees (in this case Senators - back in the day), are NOT always good for people or the country as a whole. Jeff Smith was chosen to be (although he balked) a surefire yes-man, and his senior counterpart was a corrupt tool of the corporate controlled political machine of Taylor.Today George W. Bush wants to appoint a few judges who have clear track records of supporting certain greedy, polluting, irresponsible, corporations over everyday average Americans, or who place their religious beliefs and views over the Constitution and it's protection of every American's rights, liberties, and freedoms.Hence the necessity, in such extreme cases, of using the filibuster. While not as dramatic as Mr. Smith's filibuster, is certainly as useful for the common good of every American, to prevent the worst of the worst and the most extreme of the extreme, legislation or political appointees, from being foisted upon us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Relevant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films succeed in being relevant a decade or two after its release, but Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is still relevant 77 years later, especially in a voting year with questionable candidates.Before Frank Capra ventured into his war propaganda films in the early-to-mid 40's, he made some of the most important and acclaimed films of all time. In back to back years he directed the 1938 sleeper hit, You Can't Take it With You, and the classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Capra carried some of the same cast members over to the ladder, as Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Edward Arnold are among the many who acted in both films. Continuing with the tradition of Capra's other works, Mr. Smith deals with a common man taking on big ideas and ideals, only to be shut down by those more powerful and privileged.This was the film that really showed the world what Stewart could do. Even though I have seen tons of his films, this one stands out as some of his finest acting and most demanding roles of his filmography. He was always great at playing an every-man and someone you can undeniably root for, and Jeff Smith is a defining role for him. Smith represents the audience in going along for this political ride and I loved the way Stewart gave the character a certain amount of innocence and vulnerability while also displaying a graceful and powerful presence as well.Having wonderful chemistry in You Can't Take it With You, it's no surprise that Stewart and Arthur's work together here is just as good, if not better. Arthur plays Clarissa Saunders, who manages to keep Smith afloat even though he's constantly swept away by Washington and all of the extra perks for being in the Senate. It's also not a forced romance, like a lot of 30's films, it takes a while for it to be developed as its handled with care. Arthur may very well be the best romantic partner Stewart ever had.1939 was a fantastic year for film, with Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind also being released. But perhaps no film from that year is still as relevant as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Capra covers the film with patriotism with beautiful shots of Washington D.C. and a patriotic song here or there, but its his step into a pessimistic style of filmmaking that's most intriguing here. The last 30 minutes with Stewart giving an Oscar worthy performance and Capra seamlessly twisting the story into unpredictable territories is truly something special.+Stewart becoming the Stewart we all love+Arthur is marvelous+Capra's balanced directing10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Bleeds, Red, White and Blue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sends a very strong message to the American people, as not all politicians are corrupted or on the take. It shows the true way how a democracy system should work here in the US. The political statements shown in this movie were attack when the film was released, as people thought of it as anti-American and pro-Communist for its portrayal of corruption in the American government. In my opinion this film shows the faults and positives of our political system. A film like this really can give the viewer of what the true democracy system feels like and shows it only takes the courage of one man to stand up against corruption. Mr. Smith is that man who is not a career politician, just a common man that bleeds red, white and blue. He has an idea that would benefit sociality as it will help kids stay out of trouble and become men. When he finds out about the graft scheme he stands tall and challenges the big political machine Taylor, with out fear like the other members of the hall. This shows the courage of a man standing by his self against the same members of his party. Mr. Smith stands his ground and keeps to his word to ensure that a "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is based on an unpublished story. This is another Capra's "gentleman" who travels to the big city. Mr. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is the affirmation of idealism ordinary "small" man, benevolent and noble individuals whose actions can and manages to change the world. Director's style is excellent. Mr. Deeds has already won the audience. Mr. Smith is another part of similar stories and themes. Coincidentally, "man of the people" becomes essential. By chance he comes in the opportunity to learn about the disease of society and to a painful, romantic, compelling and always humor bathed in a way defending real human values. Comedy upgraded socio - political ideological segments. American society, like any other is perishable. It is unlikely that this one little man can change. The culmination of this film returns us faith in the true value.James Stewart (Jefferson "Jeff" Smith) is idealistic and honest man who will soon disappoint the world of high politics. Fantastic performance was launched in the stars. His performance was fantastic.Jean Arthur (Clarissa Saunders) is quiet in search of human warmth. The search for something that would change her monotonous everyday life is at times accompanied by sarcasm. I must admit that I really like her acting. Her experience is growing in the climax of the film. It is again a "trigger" of the main character.The story is a playful and dynamic, perhaps a little more symbolic. The picture is excellent. The dialogues in the troubles are good. Romance is definitely late, but the intimate moments of the main characters are very well designed. It's a strange feeling. Almost all my works great, and I'm still not satisfied. Certainly this movie will not be called controversial. Honesty, love and kindness in times of corruption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave it 10 stars--but let's just say I'm good for another 50 years before I see this again. I thought it was sentimental shlock and that Stewart's performance was questionable, and that is the best I can say. When we look at an actor's oeuvre over time, the audience can compare performances, and for me, he was weakest here.I don't like these kinds of movies because they are a deliberate attempt to tug on the heart strings of the audience; the audience is being overtly manipulated. And not a bit of it rang true. That Washington is a cesspool is self-evident from reading the daily news; that someone idealistic could expose Washington on such a flimsy basis as a questionable land deal...About the best moment was when Stewart's Secretary explains how a bill is passed; now that sounded true to life. Guy Kibbee's performance of a corrupt and weak governor was spot on.So given Stewart's weak performance, given the sentimental shlock, given overt audience manipulation--like I say, I'm good for another fifty years before I watch this again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undoubtedly one of the most beloved American films of all time, Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is one of the great directors most cynical portraits of the U.S., revealing an infestation of corruption all the way to the top of the Senate in the city where the Capitol Dome and the Lincoln Memorial sit uneasily as symbols of idealism. The film is also one of his most optimistic, and this blend of attitudes have led to many other Hollywood movies being labelled in his honour as 'Capraesque', one of the most misunderstood and overused labels in cinema.'Capraesque' is commonly lumped upon movies with an overbearing sense of positivity, with the little man, or woman, ultimately overcoming overwhelming odds to triumph over whatever conglomerate or institution trying to stamp all over them. But what the labellers forget is the skill required to convincingly build up the struggle of the hero, making the climax all the more poignant and satisfying in the process. When Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), the small-town head of the Boy Rangers, is invited to join the U.S. Senate, he accepts the role with humility and a determination to prove himself worthy. What he doesn't know is that fellow senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) intends for Smith to be a stooge while he and his boss Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) go about their dodgy business.Initially, his "aw, shucks!" persona is met with ridicule by the press, and is seen as a naive idiot by his secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur). However, his patriotism soon endears him to Saunders, who witnesses his peers and superiors begin to tear him to shreds as he uncovers a scheme to buy up land. As Smith, Stewart is perfect, embodying the kind of American ideals that the country prides itself upon but rarely follows, stubbornly holding court while he fights for his reputation in a riveting climax. It's a Wonderful Life (1946) is commonly labelled as Capra's finest moment but, in my humble opinion, Mr. Smith is his crowning achievement, a movie of such substance and social insight that it more than transcends its now-routine formula and reaffirms a belief in good overcoming evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939): Dir: Frank Capra / Cast: James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Thomas Mitchell: Powerful and feel good political drama about honesty and integrity entering into a place of corruption. When a Senator passes away corruption threatens to step in until Jeffrey Smith is brought to the scene. Smith is seen as an honest man in awe of the Washington he has only dreamed about. He desires to do good by passing a bill to open a Boys Rangers camp but corrupt oppositions plan to build a dam there and counter Smith by smearing his name via fraud and damaging his reputation. Director Frank Capra is at his best in one of his greatest achievements. James Stewart plays off the wonderment and determination of Smith right up to the point where he stands practically alone against the Senate to defend himself against false accusations in a rousing climax. Jean Arthur plays his cynical secretary devoid of trusting the system until Smith sparks new hope that has her backing him up. Claude Rains plays Senator Paine who was friends with Smith's father but is now instructed to publicly destroy him. Rains reveals guilt and is pulled between integrity and corruption. Edward Arnold plays antagonist Jim Taylor who is determined to crush Smith. Thomas Mitchell plays Arthur's smitten aid. Theme showcases one man standing for truth and honor until hitting exhaustion.

		<fullReview>If anyone asks me why James Stewart is my favourite actor, I just say, watch the final scene of Mr Smith Goes to Washington. The final scene of this movie is simply of the greatest things I have ever seen in any film ever. That may sound like a hyperbole, but I'll never forget the very exact feeling of goose bumps I had when first watching it. Mr Smith Goes to Washington is one of only a small handful of films I would call life changing, one of the films which helped to mould the way I think and ultimately turn me into the person I am today. It encouraged me to be more skeptical, not to believe everything you here and stand for what you believe in till no end. It's thanks to films like these why cinema is my bible. I know this all sounds corny, but then this is a corny film; is there a scene in any movie more unashamedly patriotic than the montage which occurs when Smith first arrives in Washington? As much though as Capra is criticised for his films being overly idealist, Mr Smith Goes to Washington does not exactly paint the most glowing picture of the American political system. To quote Thomas Paine, "The duty of a true patriot is to protect his country from its government".One of my favourite scenes of the film is in which Saunders (Jean Arthur) attempts explaining to Jefferson Smith the entire procedure of creating a bill and submitting it to congress. For starters the scene is incredibly funny with the comedic timing and Stewart's childlike reactions. Secondly it's a very informative civics lesson. I'm sure much has been written on the film's deeper meaning and continuing relevance in today's world, and while I can't profess to an expert on every nuisance on the political system works, and I probably never will, despite how much I may try. Thirdly, this scene shows us how Jefferson Smith acts of the film's ambassador the for the average Joe watching film who's just as confounded by Sauder's lecture as Smith is. The other very striking monologue is Mr Paine's speech in which he justifies corruption as a comprise in order to achieve good deeds, a process which has existed since the birth democracy. As convincing as he might sound at first, through the course of the film you can he's a man who knows he's sold out on is ideals. Really, if I ever met someone in elected office, I would ask them if they have seen this film.The film is snappy and faced paced; with the culmination of some of Hollywood's finest character acting talent helps carry the exposition in an entertaining and at times screwball like manner. I'll also take this opportunity to raise the question, why is Jean Arthur such a forgotten actress? Despite working with several big name directors, co staring with famous actors and appearing in a number of beloved classics, her presence is incredibly overlooked as the definitive urbanite career woman with her wit, warmth and innocence. Also, that voice!Mr Capra and Mr Stewart, thank you for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Thoughts Hey, you all. I just saw Mr. Smith goes to Washington and I have some thoughts. Don't consider this to be a proper review. It's not. I don't even think I should assign a rating to this or any other classic film. Not to say I couldn't. But it's moot. The point of star ratings and the like is to convince people whether or not they should see a film. But any film that has stood the test of time, like this one has, deserves to be watched regardless of what anyone like me thinks of it. With that out of the way, let me say a hundred words' worth about the film.If you are looking for artistry in film, this is not the movie you're looking for. There are some nice scenes, particularly those with the American flag and the Lincoln Monument and the like. But that's not the purpose of the film. It wants to win you over with its message more than anything.Should you watch this film is you are not American? Hm... Well let me think... would I watch a film like this about Sweden or France or what may you? Yes, I would. But I'm a film and history buff. Watch it if you feel like being submerged in a pure, passionate representation of Americana.This is the best Capra film. If you haven't watched a one of his movies before, this one is a good place to start. And you should watch at least some of his films; he may not be as 'good' as a lot of other directors, but he nonetheless shaped a good portion of American cinema. If I were teaching a history class on the first five decades of film, he would be one of the names I would make sure everyone knew. Fair warning though: if you are watching one of his movies for the first time, you may be thrown off-guard by his optimism. Even this, one of the more pessimistic ones, has all the tropes one may expect.I think I enjoyed this movie more now than I would have a few years ago. There just seems to be so much more cynicism in the air now. Maybe it's the world. Maybe it's the part of it I live in. Maybe it's just me. But the end result is that I felt relieved by the film. It was like a breath of fresh air. A dizzyingly saccharine breath of fresh air. Optimism is more appreciated when it is rare.That is not the only way the film is better appreciated today. Congress has never been liked. Look at their approval rating throughout history. But nowadays, they are despised with a fervor like nothing else. I'm sure you've hear the joke that the only thing Republicans and Democrats agree on is the worthlessness of contemporary Congress. Of course, the Congress portrayed in the film isn't entirely accurate. You see the exaggerations needed to make it work as satire. But there is a lot of truth in the film. It is an early (and very good example) of what we know call dramedies.This film may not change your life. It didn't change mine. But it certainly a film that has moved at least one person. Probably a lot more. And if you cannot pick out at least one moment from the film that moved you, then you are either cold or too politically radical. This is a film that deserves to be watched.(The Boy Scout Printing scene still made me laugh, though)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Oscar nominated Frank Capra (The Bitter Tea of General Yen, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, It's a Wonderful Life), I had seen a few clips of this film with the leading actor, and I was definitely going to watch it because it appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically U.S. Senator Sam Foley, of an unnamed western state, has died, governor Hubert "Happy" Hopper (Guy Kibbee) has to find a replacement, his corrupt political boss, media magnate Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), wants a man appointed who will appeal to the people, and will be easy to manipulate. It is after a suggestion from his children that Hopper appoints the head of the Boy Rangers, naive and idealistic Jefferson Smith (Oscar nominated James Stewart), he displays a positive demeanour and does everything possible to gain a good reputation, but the newspapers portray and brand him as a bumpkin. Senator Joseph Paine (Oscar nominated Claude Rains) has a public esteem, but is secretly a crook, he wants Smith to propose a bill, with the help of his secretary Clarissa Saunders (Shane's Jean Arthur), who worked for his predecessor, Smith suggests a bill to authorise a federal government loan to buy land for the national boys' camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America, donations pour in immediately. It is when Smith goes to Washington he realises all the manipulation he has been drawn into, the situation gets worse when he realises he has been tricked into a political scandal, and he must appear before the Senate chamber. Smith exhausts himself to probe his innocence, proving himself actually knowledgeable about many subjects others thought he was naive towards, talking non-stop for about 24 hours, reaffirming the American ideals of freedom and disclosing the true motives of the dam scheme, until in the end he collapses, and Paine loudly confesses the scheme intentions, proving Smith's innocence. Also starring It's a Wonderful Life's Thomas Mitchell as Diz Moore, Eugene Palette as Chick McGann, It's a Wonderful Life's Beulah Bondi as Ma Smith, H.B. Warner as Senate Majority Leader, Oscar nominated Harry Carey as President of the Senate, Astrid Allwyn as Susan Paine, Ruth Donnelly as Mrs. Hopper, Grant Mitchell as Senator MacPherson, Porter Hall as Senator Monroe, Charles Lane as Nosey, William Demarest as Bill Griffith, Dick Elliott as Carl Cook and A Star Is Born's Jack Carson as Sweeney Farrell - Newsman. Stewart won his actor for The Philadelphia Story, he lost out in this film to Robert Donat in Goodbye, Mr. Chips, I agree he could have perhaps won this film, he is an endearing character, the only problem I have is that the politics is a little hard to keep up with, but the plotting by politicians using the leading character as their puppet is interesting, the best scenes are him defending himself in a courtroom style chamber, there were the small amusing moments as well, I can sort of agree with critics giving this film five stars out of five, it is a worthwhile political comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Story, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Writing, Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Sound, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin. Jefferson Smith was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, and the film was number 29 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, 100 Years, it was number 26 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies, and it was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers.

		<fullReview>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a film that lives up to it's title. A man named Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart) is appointed a senator for Missouri after the old one dies. Jefferson is now alongside Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) also from Missouri. Jefferson arrives in Washington, DC completely vacant minded about politics and meets his cynical secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur). Because Jefferson knows almost nothing about politics he was pretty much the perfect man to put in that position as Paine, Governor Hubert Hopper (Guy Kibbee) and a man named Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) are three corrupt politicians planning to build a dam, somewhere in Missouri. Luckily Jefferson has plans to build a boy scout camp at the exact same place and the two plans collide. Jefferson inexperienced but more determined then Paine, Hopper, and Taylor to get his ideas across, and along the way actually get's Clarissa on his side too. After a long filibuster in which Jefferson get's absolutely pounded but nevertheless continues talking all kinds of lies from Taylor's political machine come in. When Jefferson eventually faints. Paine can't bring it upon himself anymore and brings the entire blame on himself. It's a great and inspiring movie. The acting is great, especially from Stewart, and the story is amazing. And the filibuster scene which is now one of the most famous in film history is just incredible. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and go watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having loved everything of Frank Capra's work I've seen, especially It's a Wonderful Life, I wanted to see this film, as I feel Capra was a wonderful director and James Stewart a great actor. So this was a perfect combination and works superbly.Mr Smith Goes To Washington has a totally original story, that is beautifully constructed and never falls into slushy sentimentality, a huge danger with this sort of film and moves quickly. It looks lovely, the cinematography and scenery are delicious eye candy, while the film is richly scored, not to mention superbly directed by Capra.The script is another outstanding asset, it is honest, funny and poignant. And then there is the superb acting, whether this is Stewart's best role is up for debate, personally I think not, but as the idealistic senator there is no denying he is superb here. Jean Arthur is wonderful too as the cynical secretary, Claude Rains is excellent as always but the best supporting performance comes from Harry Carey, who is magnificent as the vice president.Overall, a superb film, and in the top 5 of my favourite Capra movies. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aside from some forgivable "sledgehammer symbolism", this is a perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film several times before and I recently sat down with my teenage daughter to watch it. We both loved the film and I really think this would be a wonderful film for kids, as it is very profound and has a lot to say. However, my kid did use a term to describe the film that it very appropriate. She used the phrase "sledgehammer symbolism" to describe how sometimes Frank Capra (the director) used too much strong symbolism and that because of this the movie sometimes lacked subtlety. Some good examples are the name of the main character, the idealistic Mr. Smith. "Smith" was used as an obvious symbol of the common person and his first name, "Jefferson", was lifted straight from the American founding fathers.However, despite this and a few mildly "schmaltzy" moments, the film was incredibly uplifting and unforgettable in so many wonderful ways. The acting was astoundingly good. Not only does this movie have perhaps the greatest set of supporting actors in movie history in the same film (perhaps only rivaled by the original TWELVE ANGRY MEN), but Jean Arthur and Jimmy Stewart were absolutely perfect. I just can't imagine anyone doing a better job. Stewart played a naive but decent guy who is initially overwhelmed by Washington and by the fact that he was appointed Senator. He then, when the chips were down, morphed into a mountain of previously untapped strength and did an absolutely mesmerizing job when he fought for the truth in the last half of the movie. Arthur was also great as the cynical and worldly-wise assistant. While I knew her as a sweet type of actress due to her many other roles as a "swell dame" or "girl next door", my daughter found Arthur's performance so realistic that she simply couldn't believe me that this was NOT a typical role for Arthur! As for the plot, there are so many reviews for this film that have summarized it so well that it isn't worth repeating. Suffice to say that it is one of the greatest films about the American Spirit and patriotism ever made--possibly only surpassed by my personal favorite, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES. This film is an absolute must-see for any serious film fan and anyone who dislikes this film ought to have his or her head examined for termites!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happens next?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With as much as I love Jimmy Stewart, I did not care for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. There were too many unrealistic aspects to this movie that made it very hard to fathom that what was happening was actually happening. Not only was the movie unbelievable, but what a terrible ending, or lack there of I should say.The story of a boy ranger being appointed Senator without any political background except a knack for reciting famous speeches from previous presidents and excerpts from our nation's Declaration of Independence is c-r-a-z-y. Granted this is just a movie, but come on! Wouldn't happen!The movie does give the viewer some insight as to what goes on in our congress and what it takes to create a bill, so if you're ever interested in how its done, I would recommend you see this movie! Too bad that is the only way I would recommend it. The thing that is the most puzzling is the fact that there was no conclusion. To me, the ending was something less than desired because there was no ending. The movies just stop, which leaves the viewer with a blank expression on their faces asking `What happens next?' And what does happen next? Mr. Smith Goes to Washington has an uncomfortable, unresolved feeling to it. One that causes the movie to receive a low rating of 5 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One Where Jimmy Stewart Won't Shut Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, Jimmy Stewart's character (Jeff Smith, natch) is a dangerously ignorant rube. For a short while, his awe of Washington D.C. is charming. After a few scenes of his ADHD "look at that" sight-seeing, you have to wonder if he's going to get mugged by somebody while he's staring up at the Lincoln Memorial. Even his associates lose patience with the enthusiastic hayseedery. Jeff is just lucky that Saunders (Jean Arthur) doesn't have the same amount of contempt for him that Arthur had for Stewart's performance.Still, there's something special in the final 30 minutes of this picture as Jeff filibusters on the Senate floor. It's cornball and as unsubtle as punches to reporter's faces, but Jeff's fight for his political life represents all the little people out there who feel steamrolled by The Man. You know, 99% of us. And the movie has endured. The American Film Institute ranked it 29th and 26th, respectively, on their 1998 and 2007 Top 100 lists and they made it their 5th Most-Inspiring movie. Ol' Jeff Smith was their 11th best hero. Men who won't shut up and then faint at critical moments are cheer-worthy!At least the excellent Claude Rains is around to give the flick gravitas, even if his change of heart at the end is staggeringly unbelievable. Thomas Mitchell's hard-drinking reporter is fine too and Harry Carey (as the Vice President) is a sneaky delight. As for Jimmy Stewart, something must be cleared up once and for all. It's not that he led a one-man filibuster. It's just that his slow-talking stammer made his speech take all night. Hi-yo! Thanks, you're a beautiful audience. I'll be here all week. Probably filibustering.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the "Podcasts" section for our 42-minute Mr. Smith Goes To Washington 'cast?and many others.

Neither is the idea of a political party electing a puppet to be controlled by the machine actually hot off the press. Back in the 1920s Warren Gamalial Harding was a party puppet who actually made it to the White House and sat idly by as his party sold off the US oil reserves in what became known as the Teapot Dome scandal. Jimmy Stewart and Frank Capra were a shoo-in in virtually anything and for the second time Jean Arthur found herself falling for a naive but honest man.

		<shortDescription>Nice Remake of Mr. Deeds Goes to Town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Essentially, this is the same story as MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, an earlier, better, Capra film. Stewart is good as the altruistic young senator, but not as good as he was in movies like THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, or even ROPE, where his characters have much more meat. Jean Arthur is wonderful, playing the same kind of role she played in DEEDS, but with more maturity and confidence. Claude Rains is terrific as the duplicitous senior senator from the same unnamed state as Smith.The movie itself is a good lesson in Washington politics, relevant even now with its cynical mentality about money and corruption. But the story doesn't quite hold up. At some points it's like watching an infomercial for AMERICA! The Constitutional propaganda gets a bit much even for a Capra movie. I loved the filibuster sequence to a point - and then you get to that point and it's over the top. The ending is particularly unsatisfying, especially given Capra's normal emphasis on conclusions.I don't want to give the impression that I didn't like it, it's an excellent movie. I just wouldn't put it into an elite classic category.</fullReview>

He has visions, just as our forefathers did. With God on his side and the words ofthose great leaders in heart, Smith carves into stone the feelings, hopes and dreams of every young person who has said to themself, "I want to make a difference" or "I care about you, so I'm going to help you." That's thesupreme effect that Capra's characters have on us. Theypaint this picture for us of how we envision the world or of what we, as people, want to do with the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important, but unfortunately not that entertaining...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** Here might be spoilers **The little common guy, Mr Smith, gets a opportunity to go to Washington and be a part of Democracy. What he not knows is that persons behind his appointment is planning to use him for personal reasons (greed, whatever?). Painfully slow, the naive Mr. Smith finds out, and in a try to expose those dark powers that run his beloved country, he takes a battle of endurance in the senate.Viewed solely as a movie to entertain, this is not good. The plot is evident all the way. The humor is plain and as mentioned above, some parts, for example Mr. Smith understanding how it really works, is taking a very long time, bringing the movie to a slow pace, actually bordering on dull sometimes.However, fortunately for all involved, not least for any viewers, this movie has some other strengths. This movie got a message. An important one as well, as important when this movie was made as it is today. Freedom. Liberty. Democracy. It is evident through all the movie, scenes of these words from famous monuments keep appearing, so no-one should be able to miss this. Everyone, anywhere who is getting appointed to any position of (democratic) power should watch this movie and contemplate the values and meanings of this words. This goes for people used to democratic traditions as well as those who are not. Unfortunately, I find the movie naive in a way similar to Mr. Smith, as it is very narrow-minded. I got the feeling that the movie suggested there was only one way. The American way, the American dream. Now, what kind of liberty and democracy is it when there is just one possible way (not in any way criticizing the American dream, just hoping for more alternatives). So in this, I feel this movie actually contradict itself. Being a such a strong advocate for real democracy, it is painfully single-minded. If one can break through this slight shortcoming, this is a important movie.So, all in all, if I somehow try to combine the entertaining aspects and message aspects of this movie I should say that this is a good movie. Not the best for a Saturday night perhaps but good nonetheless. Unfortunately not great.6/10</fullReview>

For the life of me, I can't find the part of the Constitution that empowers the federal government to loan money to build a boys' camp.Call me a crazed reactionary, but I'm far more concerned about assaults on the fabric of the Constitution--even seemingly minor ones--than I am about ordinary human turpitude.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like "Citizen Kane", this classic film is very much showing its age. And even though it was produced only three years before "Casablanca", it seems decades apart. While Michael Curtiz's camera in "Casablanca" is often moving, as are the characters, Frank Capra's setups and blocking are static and theatrical.Jimmy Stewart, the Tom Hanks of that era, is consistent as usual. But Jean Arthur's Clarissa Saunders is like a cardboard cutout compared to Ingrid Bergman's fluidity, especially when she's trying to play someone who's inebriated.Worthwhile as a fine moment in film history, "Mr. Smith" nevertheless bombs when played to younger audiences in 2005, who have come to expect a heck of a lot more from their film experiences.</fullReview>

But in reality politics are not even close to what they were at that time and they certainly are nothing even remotely close to romantic. This movie lacked what you would call ?shah-bang'. It wasn't even close to being exciting. Lets look at the plot shall we? It's about this every day sort of guy, who publishes a magazine for boys. And then all the sudden he is elected to be a senator. How does that happen? And then to top it all off he doesn't even know a lick about law. It was not a bad movie; it was just not all that believable. Would a real live blood-sucking lawyer of a senator back down from his verbal attacks just in time for the movie to end? That is just highly unlikely. If an opponent is beaten then why deliver them at the last second? If victory is within ones grasp then why give out at the very end? This just does not make much sense.  Though it is predictable to following in the footsteps of the good old stereotypical American movie of the 50's. Over all this is a ?good' movie. This movie receives a rating of eight out of ten.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra sexism 101</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few things about this Frank Capra-directed classic bother me. First, we have to watch Jimmy Stewart getting schooled by Jean Arthur about the ways our government works. It's hard to believe that even the most naive simpleton did not get some basic civics course in high school, or that he could not go to the local library and look up a few things when he was appointed to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Senate. The fact of the matter is that Arthur's character, a woman, knows more about the government and its processes than Stewart, a man. Clearly, she is ten times more qualified than him, yet he is the one who gets to be Senator? I know, I know, the goons (played by Edward Arnold, Guy Kibbee and Claude Rains) want an idiot in the seat so they can manipulate him. But why doesn't Arthur or the other women like her fight for the job themselves?As if that is not enough, Capra and screenwriter Robert Riskin keep hammering the point that Stewart can get a bill passed for a law that would benefit a boys scout-type group. This is repeated several times, and we even see a throng of clean cut all-American boys in the Senate chamber on the day that Stewart is trying to introduce the bill. They, of course, applaud him enthusiastically. Never mind the fact that there are no girls in attendance-- they simply were overlooked or not invited. And why couldn't Stewart introduce a bill that would benefit both boys and girls in America? There are long speeches where he talks about how boys need to know the way our government works. Again, aren't girls allowed to know that, too?The sexism of this movie becomes increasingly apparent when you realize that there are no women on the Senate floor. And none are seen even as extras in crowd scenes involving politicians. Surely Arthur's character cannot be the only woman in the nation's capital. The filmmakers give the impression that a boys club is running Washington while the female sex is back at home preparing dinner.Did you know that the first woman senator was appointed to fill a vacancy just like Stewart's character, back in 1922? And by 1931 a woman from Arkansas named Hattie Caraway became the first fully elected lady senator, a position she held until 1945. Ms. Caraway was not the only female elected to the Senate in the 1930s. The year Columbia Pictures made MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, there were three other women in the Senate. So that's four women who should have been seen in the Senate chamber scenes of this film. But they are not there, not even on the sidelines or in the background. I am not saying this film necessarily had to be called MISS SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, but there is way too much gender bias in this film. And I don't see the purpose of it, unless the goal is to show that women do not have any say in our way of life in America. Doesn't that seem wrong to you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eh, it was OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jimmy Stewart is the famous 'guy next-door' type of actor and certainly does well playing one. 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is a movie about good old-fashioned patriotism and the lack there-of in today's society. This movie was sweet but a little hard to get excited about; the small, very small, love story is really what kept this reviewer's interest and to say that the plot was riveting, well, would be a bit too much, in all honesty. As stated before Jimmy Stewart (Jefferson Smith) did what he does best, and that's look handsome, play the part of a confused, yet lovable man and fall in love with the right woman. Having watched two other films that Stewart has starred in, this character is definitely the most straightforward and easiest to read, not exactly a round character. This is his early work and really what the story need though, so in this case it's completely acceptable. His love interest is a very pretty woman (Clarissa Saunders played by Jean Arthur) who most ladies can sympathize with because of the fact that Mr. Smith takes a little while to notice her in the way that she comes to notice him. The love story is truly a breath of fresh air compared to most today; there are no sex scenes or any inclination of any hanky-panky and that receives a huge applause from this reviewer where it seems that in every movie and every television show that people are 'shacking it up' all the time. Besides the love story, the situation at hand is that a senator has suddenly passed away while a very important bill is at a critical point in the senate. The replacement needs to be a 'yes-man', and naively the replacement is chosen to be Mr. Smith. Which at first seems to be the right one because he is in awe about EVERYTHING that goes on, even the young boys who help in the meetings know more than Mr. Smith does. Well eventually Mr. Smith gets his bearings with the help of his secretary and he soon discovers a scandal occurring involving his idol and father's best friend and this truly upsets the uncorrupted American patriot that is Mr. Smith and he soon tries all that he can to fix what's going on. The conclusion unfortunately is so abrupt and after all the time and energy invested in the scenes leading up to it, creates a bit of disappointment to the viewer. While the viewer really wants to applaud the attempts of Mr. Smith it's a bit of a cheesy ending and a bit unbelievable. However, this really opened the eyes of this reviewer to the means necessary to pass a bill, and how it's not just cut and dry, there has to be a lot of persuasion, not just 'this is a good bill because' but more like 'if you vote for this bill I'll do you a favor?'. This concept is really sad because it makes one wonder if that's what the founding fathers wanted congress to look like, if that's how things needed to be accomplished. Knowing that the good guys have honesty and scruples and that they wouldn't do things that way can lead to be really upsetting because they would be the ones to try to pass bills to help the good of the cause. In essence this movie was decent, a 'must-see'?; probably not, unless congress and politics really get your engine revving or if you're a big Jimmy Stewart fan. The plot is a bit basic and the ending predictable but it's a cute flick. The love story is the most interesting part for this reviewer but the politics were kind of interesting as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong political satire with man manipulated by woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capra's film is distinguished by a number of issues. Surprisingly strong for its time - a mainstream film offering a strong crticism of the potential for corruption and graft that is endemic in a system built on the lobby and in a society where only money and power are counted as important in the social class system. In addition it offers criticism of the introspective and bureaucratically dominated political system endemic in any so called democracy where the process and the power are clearly more important to the participants (representatives) than the outcome. Finally, of course, it, yet again, causes one to wonder why on earth men are in charge of anything given their hopelessness and their susceptibility to manipulation by the superior sex.As a light comedy, which appears to be the ostensible reason for its existence, it largely fails; being neither obvious nor subtle. Perhaps it is an early and worthy example of the satirical genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people know a lot about films. They can, for example, appreciate the costuming or the musical score, even if the story is boring or the characters uninteresting. I'm not like that. Maybe that means I lack culture. But I appreciate a well-paced intelligent drama such as Wag the Dog.So when it comes to viewing the classics, sometimes I like 'em and sometimes I don't. Art critics don't seem to be able to tell the difference. Unfortunately, I did not find Mr. Smith Goes to Washington accessible. The story is syrupy, melodramatic, and with too much patriotic fervor. It's sort of a courtroom drama, but instead of fighting over facts and witnesses there's a lot of speechmaking about morals. The ending was as contrived as the one in Legally Blonde. Sure, it's inspiring to see someone fight for truth. But can we have some plot? Some characters with depth?Who should see this film:-- Arty types who appreciate the classics-- Regular folks like me who sample the classics hesitantly, there are better picks. And avoid It's A Wonderful Life, too.I believe in rating a film based on how it plays out today, not when it was originally made. By that standard, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington only gets a 5 out of 10, not bad given the passage of 65 years but no longer a classic.</fullReview>

I found it completely irrational that simply stating to the press that Sen. Smith "owned" the property in question would cause such a furor. Didn't they have real estate records in 1939??? While I LOVE "It's a Wonderful Life" and try to watch it at least once a year, I cannot understand why this dreadful effort is considered one of Capra's best. Don't waste your time or your money.
