		<shortDescription>Old-fashioned horror movie works like a charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE FOG Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: MonoWhile celebrating its centenary birthday, a small Californian coastal town is visited by a ghostly fog containing an army of murderous spirits who take revenge for a terrible injustice.Released on a wave of expectation following the worldwide success of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN (1978), THE FOG surprised everyone by generating only moderate returns at the US box-office, though it's arguably the better of the two films. Beautifully photographed by Carpenter stalwart Dean Cundey (BACK TO THE FUTURE, JURASSIC PARK, etc.), this unassuming 'ghost story' opens on a lonely clifftop at midnight, where crusty old sea dog John Houseman tells an audience of wide-eyed children how their home town was built on the foundations of tragedy. As with HALLOWEEN, the pace is slow but steady, punctuated by a series of well-judged scares, and there's a relentless accumulation of details which belies the script's modest ambitions.Jamie Lee Curtis headlines the movie opposite her real life mother Janet Leigh, though Hal Holbrook takes the acting honors as a frightened priest who realizes the town was founded on deception and murder. As the fog rolls in, the narrative reaches an apocalyptic crescendo, as the film's principal cast are besieged by zombie-like phantoms inside an antiquated church, in scenes reminiscent of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968). Scary stuff, to be sure, though Carpenter was forced to add new material during post-production in an effort to 'beef up' the movie's horror quotient, including a memorable late-night encounter between a fishing boat and the occupants of a ghostly schooner which looms out of the swirling fog (similar scenes would be added to HALLOWEEN II in 1981 for the same reasons, though under less agreeable circumstances). Production values are solid, and Carpenter cranks up the tension throughout, resulting in a small masterpiece of American Gothic. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that is truly terrifying?!? ?It exists and it's named `the Fog'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A solid, powerful story?slowly developing and photographed with a unique sense for tension. THAT is `The Fog'. This story will leave a big impression on you and it's easily John Carpenter's best and most effective horror film. His most underrated as well, since people always refer to `Halloween' and `The Thing' when listing his best accomplishments as a director. Personally, I think The Fog is much more haunting and fascinating than these two, and it's one of the very few films that still scares me after all these years. Uniquely set in a small coast-town called Antonio Bay, where the inhabitants are preparing the celebrations for the town's hundredth anniversary. Only, they do not know that the genesis of their town went together with a devilish conspiracy, resulting in the unfortunate death of many seamen. These doomed victims rise again now, suddenly appearing from mysterious fogbanks that come from the ocean. If you're ? like me - a sucker for ghostly myths set in abandoned surrounding, The Fog will be one of your most satisfying purchases ever. Carpenter brilliantly builds up an unbearable tension through simple methods, like long shots of an isolated countryside and a chilling musical score (not as famous as his `Halloween' score but equally effective). The bloodshed and images of cold-hearted monsters are kept to a minimum in order to leave it up to your own imagination. And for once, this actually works! The detailed sequences in which the town gets surrounded by an inescapable fog is more than horrific enough. Forget about all the overblown, big-budgeted and so-called `horrifying' films? This little, overlooked production scares the hell out of people since more than 20 years already. And it'll keep on doing so for yet another very long time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A frightening film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog is an instant horror classic from the first scene- a salty, old sailor tells a group of young children the true story of a ghostly, wrecked ship. The scene was so simple yet so thrilling that the viewer is hooked (no pun intended) for the rest of the film. The cast is great and the music sets the tone just as it did for Halloween. The best part of the film is that it made no attempt to explain everything away in a hokey horror sense (Why are the bodies returning to life?). Things happen simply because they happen. Much like Night of the Living Dead, the characters are not concerned with why they are in danger, but more concerned with getting out of danger. On a side note, John Carpenter has the best endings of any filmmaker on the market. Just as Halloween and The Thing both ended with a sense of foreboding and silent terror, The Fog ends with style and allows the viewer one final scare. A definite hit!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare real scary movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Fog" is one of the very few real scary movies. For some reason phones that begin ringing on their own and car alarms that go off without any reason, is still much more scarier than a CGI-ghost appearing out of a wall. John Carpenter has always been a master in creating scary, creepy scene's with minimal resources but maximum scare. If you also liked this movies, I also recommend "In the Mouth of Madness" to you, a criminally underrated horror masterpiece, also directed by John Carpenter. The movie has a good and original creepy story with awesome ghostly figures and gore, without any blood. It is notable that this movie had a low budget which works perfectly for the dark, depressing atmosphere. The movie is quite short and because of that the movie feels 'incomplete', if like not all of the events are covered in the story, this is also due to the fact that the movie has an open ending of course like almost every horror movie has. For some reason, because of this 'incomplete' feeling the movie feels even creepier.The movie has some good actors in it. Remember this movie was made back in the days when it still was OK for well known actors to appear in horror movies. Present day, only young unknown actors seem to appear in horror movies. This movie stars; Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh ("Psycho") and Hal Holbrook. Not the worlds worst actors if you ask me. It's especially amazing that all of those three are in this one movie, considering the low budget of the movie.This movie is perfect in what it tries to achieve. It creates a perfect horror atmosphere, with a typical creepy musical score by John Carpenter himself and has some good creepy moments in it. This is one of the rare real scary movies ever made. "The Fog" is an unique and original horror movie and sadly, horror movies like this will never be made again.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy Atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Houseman sits around a campfire telling children about the story of a ship that went down near their home Antonio Bay and how the drowned sailors will reappear 100 years to that very night in the fog. It is a wonderful beginning to a very chilling film, directed by the modern horror meister John Carpenter. As with most of his films, Carpenter creates a scary atmosphere through moody settings(the California coastline, a lighthouse, an old Church), relentless mood music as in Halloween, good character acting(Holbrook, Houseman, Curtis, Leigh), and a claustrophobic feeling of something vice-like gripping you. The story has some plot problems, but none enough to detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. Adrienne Barbeau is as lovely as ever in the lead, and the film is credible amidst the background of supernatural actions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*Still My Favorite Ghost Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*(Riverhead Free Library)(I would like to print a sort of retraction here. I said that I had never seen any other John Carpenter movie, but I fibbed. I remember seeing 'Prince of Darkness', and wasn't too impresed by it, despite all the neat special effects. I'll reserve further comment for that page.)My bias runs towards the traditional ghost story and variations on that theme.All the elements of a good ghost story are in 'The Fog': an ancient crime, retribution, foreshadowing, atmosphere and discovery of why things are going wrong. The film is most powerful because of what is not shown or explained. It's not even necessary to see the faces of the drowned lepers - just the glowing eyes and the sense of rotted bodies is more than enough thank you!Antonio Bay is celebrating its anniversary as a town. However, the residents don't know the terrible secrets behind the founding of their township. 100 years ago, Blake, a rich man, was afflicted with the disease of leprosy. He wanted to use his own money to establish a colony for him and others like him. The town fathers back then, though, didn't want a leper colony close by. They pretended to be sympathetic, then hatched a conspiracy to lure Blake's ship to the rocks where it crashed and all on board drowned. The town fathers had nothing against taking Blake's gold, however. You see, this is one of those movies where you have to pay attention - sometimes that is asking a lot with the public's short attention span of today. Pay particular attention to Hal Holbrook, who plays Father Malone, when he is reading from the diary that falls out of the church walls. That will go a long way in explaining the ending.I also love this movie because it was made before all the advances in computer technology. There is an 'organic' feel and look to the special effects - very unlike all the computer-generated tricks you see in movies of today. People had to be more creative back then. Today, technology is so relied upon that many in Hollywood have become lazy. (I still marvel at how Demille did the parting of the Red Sea in 'The Ten Commandments - way before all these computer advances!)My main complaint with the fog is that the progression of events is a bit choppy and uneven, but that doesn't stop you from enjoying the movie. Also take note of how this is one of those flicks where you can read all the credits and know who did what. It annoys me that today's movies, when they run them on television, do this split-screen nonsense and roll the credits so darn fast you can't see who worked on the film.Consensus is mixed on this film. Some say it's Carpenter's worse. I can't say that because I haven't many of his films. I'm not a fan of the slasher-type stuff. I love the more subtle chilling effects, the power of the unspoken word or a certain look, etc.I'm 43 now, and when I'm talking to the 20-somethings about scary movies from years ago, I make it a point to bring up 'The Fog'!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog Keeps Rolling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scary then and still scary now." That's what a lot of people say about this movie, and I have no argument against that. I'm not particularly a fan of "ghost stories" but this is well done and still looks good, which is why they keep coming out with DVDs on this film and a recent re-make. It's a classic.Unfortunately, the re-make didn't have the cast this film had. Ladies go first in this "original" with Adrienne Barbeau in the lead as "Stevie Wayne," a small- town disc-jockey whose studio is a lighthouse. "Wayne" has a sexy voice that complements the story and adds a nice touch to it. Then there's the real life mother-daughter duo of Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The male lead is played by someone I am not familiar with, Charles Cyphers, but he does a fine job. John Houseman gets good billing here but he's only in the film the first three minutes!The "star" of this film, however, is the silvery, luminescent fog....a special-effect that was eerie 25 years ago and still has that effect. The films only lasts 90 minutes to the story zips by, the violence is effective but not overdone and the suspense is terrific. The only annoying aspect of the film is the typically-weird theology mumbo-jumbo with another weak priest (Hal Holbrook, in this case) shown. Hollywood loves showing priests who are pathetic. The rest of the movie is fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish, Creepy?but a little Foggy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not John Carepenter's best movie, "The Fog" is an atmospheric ghost story that delivers a few good chills. We can't expect our beloved horror movies from the 70's and 80's to hold up forever, and "The Fog" has become a little dated over time."The Fog" is very scenic and has a great ensemble cast including Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh (Jamie's real life mother), and a small cameo by John Houseman? just to name a few.I particularly liked the premise of Jamie Lee Curtis's character Elizabeth Solley, a solo hitchhiker on her way to Vancouver who gets picked up by local resident Nick Castle (Tom Atkins), sleeps with him the first night they meet, and then never leaves his side through the rest of the movie as the terror of "The Fog" unfolds. Boy, you just HAVE to love the 80's!!! The small coastal town of Antonio Bay is celebrating it's 100 year anniversary. However, also 100 years ago a ship sailed along its shores and a curse was born. Unbeknownst to the new residents, the sailors of that vessel have come back, walking through the nightly glowing fog to kill and avenge the loss of the treasure that was stolen from them.I won't say more as not to give the movie away. For nostalgic purposes, this film is definitely worth a viewing. If it's been a very long time since you've watched "The Fog" and you don't remember it all too well (as was the case with me) it's worth a second look indeed."The Fog" is not bloodbath/slasher horror, but it does make for a good spooky late night film. With the current remake currently in production and to be released by 10-05, what better time to revisit the original!!Recommend!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stay Away From the Glowing Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One hundred years ago, on April 21st, the wealthy leper Blake bought the vessel Elizabeth Dane and moved with his friend from a leper colony to California to build a town for them to live with more comfort. However, while crossing a fog in Spivey Point, they were misguided by a campfire onshore, steering the course of the vessel toward the light and crashing her against the rocks. On the present days, on the celebration of the centenary of the fishing town Antonio Bay, a glowing fog appears, bringing the zombies of Blake and his crew to kill the residents. Father Robert Malone (Hal HolbrooK) finds the hidden journal of his grandfather in the wall of his church, and discloses that Antonio Bay was built with Blake's gold. Further, a group of conspirators including his grandfather lighted the fire to sink Elizabeth Dane and robber Blake's fortune and now the ghosts of Blake and his crew are seeking for revenge on the locals."The Fog" is a dark ghost story of this master of horror John Carpenter, who deserves an Oscar his great filmography. The cinematography and special effects are great, giving a scary atmosphere without the need of gore. It is nice to see again a gorgeous twenty-three years old Jamie Lee Curtis acting with her mother Janet Leigh. The screenplay builds the horror in a low pace, but increasing the tension. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Bruma Assassina" ("The Assassin Fog")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Glowing Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched The Fog for the first time since the early 1980's the other night. John Carpenter and Debra Hill did a fine job with this one.The good points of the movie deal with the overall story and the setting of the film. The story is explained fully during the movie and the setting in California is superb and creepy. The music is also disturbing. The background music coupled with the uneasiness and lonliness of the town, Antonio Bay, is very effective. No gore whatsoever in this one so the whole family may watch this movie together. When I was about 10 or 11 years old this movie did scare me quite a bit. The only negative was the characterization. No character development at all but that was probably intended. Jamie Lee Curtis's role is strange. Some references to Halloween are also found in the film. i.e. Look out for the name of one of the main characters.Overall a good movie. Not great but good. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the Remake. Carpenter's Original Ghost Story is Deeply Chilling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the lack-lustre 2005 remake of Carpenter's "The Fog", I quickly ran to my nearest television set and inserted this DVD into my DVD player just so I can recall the days when horror film's were made without the over-use of annoying CGI.This film (along with that other Carpenter film, whats-its-name?) is a testament to the fact that you do not need a $30 million dollar budget to create an effective scary ghost movie. There is no CGI here only talent, mood, a great location and a creepy story.The story takes place in Antonio Bay. A depressingly gloomy but charming seaside town whose inhabitants become the victims of a thick, glowing fog carrying the angry ghosts of lepers who were killed in a shipwreck a century earlier. What makes this ghost story original in my opinion is that the ghosts depicted here are not transparent, floating phantasms that move objects and say "boo". They are walking dead guys, covered in rags, dripping in salt water and armed with knives, hooks, swords and possibly every other sharp, metallic object you can think of and simply slice up their unfortunate victims.The cast is first-rate. The stand-out performer is Carpenter's then- wife, Adrienne Barbeau who plays Stevie Wayne. A sexy radio disc-jockey who becomes trapped inside a light-house while the rest of the cast seeks refuge in an old church outside of town. Scream-Queens Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh and Nancy Loomis co-star as the other luck-less female victims and put their screaming talents to good use. The legendary John Houseman makes a great cameo appearance in the opening sequence, setting the creepy tone and the man sure knows how to tell a tale. The great cast, the location, the creative fog effects and a simple yet effective Carpenter score all contribute in making this low- budget chiller a clear winner.However, it should be stated that "The Fog" is not perfect. Despite a chilling first 20 minutes, the film takes its time in building its tension and therefore drags a bit. And even those who love this movie will admit that it's not as effective as Carpenter's "Halloween" and under close inspection, plot holes become too apparent. But us fans don't seem to care since we all know that this film is not intended to be taken too seriously. It's about a killer fog for crying out loud. Anyone approaching this for realism needs to re-evaluate their criteria for viewing horror movies since many of these genre films are simply made to entertain (and to scare the pants off you) and if you are a horror fan (like I am) you should find plenty to like here. By combining several different branches off the horror genre and using it to great effect, "The Fog" is a combination of such classics as "Halloween" and "Night of the Living Dead".So forget all of this CGI stuff for a minute and see what a true horror movie should really be like. "The Fog" is simple yet deeply chilling and atmospheric. Follow it with Carpenter's ultimate classic (you know which movie I'm talking about) and double your pleasure.There's a reason why this low-budget shocker is so beloved by fans of the genre. Recommended.3.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS* It's the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Antonio Bay, a quiet little coastal town in California, and celebrations are in order.But an uninvited guest is coming to town... a dangerous fog, a glowing fog, a DEADLY fog, which hides ghosts who want revenge on the town.Who will survive The Fog? This is an atmospheric, intense and chilling ghost story which manages to scare not with blood and/or gore, but with atmosphere and foreboding, like in the siege in the church scene, or the scene where the Fog comes down the hill to Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau)'s lighthouse. Director John Carpenter and producer Debra Hill (RIP) opted for a change of pace after the classic slasher 'HalloweeN', and managed to bring even more terror out.And remember, 'what you can't see won't hurt you... it'll kill you!'

		<fullReview>The Fog is directed by John Carpenter who also co-writes the screenplay with Debra Hill. It stars Adrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, Janet Leigh, Hal Holbrook, Jamie Lee Curtis and Nancy Loomis. Carpenter also scores the music and cinematography is by Dean Cundey.The Californian fishing town of Antonio Bay is preparing to celebrate its 100 year anniversary. As the clock ticks past midnight strange events start to occur around the town, it seems that the town has a secret and that secret is back to make a point...Not as praised as Halloween and The Thing from John Carpenter's early horror output, The Fog sees the director tackle the ghost story premise. For many who lapped it up back when the 80s began, it still enthrals and holds in its eerie vice like grip, for others in this desensitised age of gore and cgi overkill, it proves to be a film unable to justify the love poured on it by the fans. Which is a shame.Being able to appreciate the craft of John Carpenter back in 1980 certainly helps to avert some harsh criticisms thrown its way, because Carpenter has achieved, pound for pound, a better ghost story on a fraction of the budget afforded big Hollywood genre productions that have been made since. That's not to say it's perfect, for it's not, Carpenter himself has never been wholly satisfied with the final film, this even after re-shooting a third of the film after originally making a picture reliant on suggestion over presence, but with some smoke machines, a synthesiser, a game cast and a spooky revenge story on the page, he's made a sub-genre classic.Carpenter has somehow managed to blend old fashioned ghostly goings on within a modern setting, that of a fishing town that proves perfect once the sun goes down and the town tries to sleep. You can practically smell the salt in the sea, such is the knack of the director for setting the mood. Then with minimalistic panache, the director marries up fog with synth beats to create maximum dread, and then he teases, perfectly, by only letting us glimpse his ghosts as dark figurines, making us fill in the blanks as to what they look like, where armed with our imagination they prove to be more scary than some CGI enhanced entity created in the blockbuster age. The killings that follow carry a high gruesome factor, and we don't need (or get) buckets of blood for them to impact, and the suspense is jacked up so much in the final quarter it proves to be edge of the seat stuff as the spring finally uncoils.Filmed in widescreen to give off a higher end production value, which works, Carpenter surrounds himself with familiar folk and inserts in jokes and homages that also keep the film grounded and a mile away from Hollywood excess. From character names to Hitchcock stars and references (Bodega Bay anyone?), the pic feels exactly what it is, a film made with love; Carpenter even cameos at the start of the film and it is a world away from the smugness of a Shyamalan. Yes there are problems, Curtis and Atkins are strangers who meet and in the blink of an eye they are in bed together, which looks to be a bad edit, while the gathering of principal characters in one place for the finale is a bit of a contrivance. Yet these are minor irritants, because The Fog is a film that once loved will always stay loved. In 78 Carpenter plotted the course for the slasher formula to follow, in 1980 he helped realign (see also Peter Medak's The Changeling) the good ship ghost story that was on rocky waters. Low budget creepy excellence. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A First Rate Ghost Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Fog", John Carpenter manages to accomplish what few other directors are able to do: create a very chilling and spooky ghost film, a real rarity in Hollywood history. I have fond memories of watching this with my mother for the first time at night and remembering both of us having goosebumps. The movie begins with an old sea captain (played brilliantly by John Houseman) telling a group of children around a fire about a ship that crashed into the rocks because they saw a strange light in the area. All the men drowned, though their spirits never rested. Instead, they lie in wait for the day when they will take their revenge on those who wronged them. A very effective opening indeed. Though it does not end there. All around town, strange things begin to happen: car horns and lights start going off, glass is blown apart in local shops, and a strange fog seemly comes out of nowhere. Beware of this, because there's something very powerful in that fog. So many things make this movie what it is. First, the effects are simple but effective. Scenes are shot in a wide pan vision, giving the film a broader look, the fog is so simple but yet so intimidating at the same time. Then there is the acting. I don't think one could ask for a better cast then what we have here: Tom Atkins, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, Hal Holbrook, to name a few. But perhaps what really makes the movie what it is, is the fact that everyone loves a good ghost story, and John Carpenter, along with Debra Hill, manage to give us just that. PS. Remember to beware of the fog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective little chiller that is better than its effects would suggest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The small coastal town of Antonio Bay is celebrating its 100th year since being founded. However the residents are not aware of the tragic history of their small town and think nothing of the wider significance of the date as they prepare for a big party; they don't even put together all the strange things that start happening on the day itself. However when a small boat is lost in a dense fog that contains a mysterious ship some residents begin to suspect something more sinister than meteorology is at work.With a remake in the cinemas and the fact that I had just returned from the coast of northern California I thought I'd revisit The Fog having not seen it for almost 15 years. Trading on the very hallmarks that made John Carpenter famous (before he couldn't buy a hit movie) The Fog is an effective chiller even if it won't scare those accustomed to more gory, modern fare. Quite short and to the point, the film makes good use of the fog to draw tension out of every scene and overcomes the potential silliness of a smoke machine working overtime behind the scenes. Instead the tension is consistent and produces a good few jumps and build ups along the way; the ghosts are kept well hidden so that the limited effects don't undermine them by totally exposing them. Carpenter uses his usual minimalist electronic score to good effect, playing it low and constant like a heartbeat.The famous cast help the convincing atmosphere and do more than just run and scream. Barbeau leads the cast well from the solitude of her lighthouse and she helps keep the tension up with her delivery. Curtis and Leigh both have smaller roles but they add class to the film and they "do" scared well. Atkins makes for a good male lead and he gets solid help from Holbrook and a few others in supporting roles. The zombie creatures move slowly but are a good presence.Overall this is a solid chiller from the days when Carpenter seemed to know what he was doing. The low budget effects are covered up by solid delivery and a consistently tense atmosphere which is supported by convincing performances and Carpenter's usual low, steady consistent score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog is set in the small North Californian coastal fishing town of Antonio Bay which will be celebrating it's 100th anniversary very soon. But the town of Antonio Bay has a dark history as Father Malone (Hal Holbrook) discovers when he finds his Great Grandfather's journal, it speaks of murder, theft &amp; thick fog... Late one night out at sea on a small trawler named the Sea Grass three men are listening to KAB Radio, the local station when the female D.J. Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau who was director Carpenter's real life wife when they made The Fog) warns of a fog bank. The fog engulfs the Sea Grass &amp; the three men on board, Al Williams (John F. Goff), Dick Baxter (James Canning) &amp; Tommy Wallace (George 'Buck' Flower) are all brutally murdered by ghostly figures that seem to travel inside the fog itself as if part of it. The next morning a friend of Al's Nick Castle (Tom Atkins) &amp; a hitchhiker named Elizabeth Solley (Jamie Lee Curtis) search for him at the docks but is told the Sea Grass never came back. Nick &amp; Elizabeth take a boat to look for the Sea Grass &amp; soon find it floating out at sea, seemingly deserted but on closer inspection they discover the body of Dick. Meanwhile Stevie has a friend who works in a local whether station named Dan O'Bannon (Charles Cyphers) who reported the wind blowing in the opposite direction from which she had seen the fog visibly travelling, this along with the disappearance of the Sea Grass &amp; when her young son Andy (Ty Micthell) brings home a mysterious piece of wood from the beach which seems possessed Stevie begins to think that the fog contains something evil &amp; she might just be right...Co-written &amp; directed by John Carpenter who also has a small uncredited cameo as Bennett during the opening sequence set in the Church, I think The Fog is probably his second best film after The Thing (1982) &amp; was Carpenter's first film after Halloween (1978) which was a huge hit. The script by Carpenter &amp; producer Debra Hill is at heart a simple ghost story &amp; a terrific ghost story it is as well. It's extremely well told, paced &amp; realised. The Fog is deliberately slow to start with, although it never becomes boring, well to me it never but I suppose if you have a short attention span or are impatient then The Fog may drag in places for you. The layers of the story build as it reaches it's climax &amp; is never less than interesting &amp; gripping all the way. The central premise of The Fog works really well as I think fog in itself is creepy on it's own, fog plays on our fear of the unknown as it surrounds you &amp; if it's thick enough your visibility is literary zero &amp; anything or anyone could be right in front of you &amp; you wouldn't know it. The character's are given just enough personality so we care about them which is essential for a scary film such as The Fog to be a success &amp; they are pretty likable, The Fog has two main character's who actually never meet on screen &amp; only briefly talk to each other on the phone towards the end as we live through &amp; witness their individual experiences with The Fog &amp; this twin perspective worked well. Carpenter's direction &amp; film-making technique is excellent in The Fog, his use &amp; placement of both silence &amp; sound is great, he uses plenty of slow pans &amp; establishing shots to really build the atmosphere &amp; tension. The cinematography by Dean Cundey also helps immensely, very simple yet at the same time very striking. The Fog is also pretty creepy &amp; has some good scares throughout, I particularly liked the image of a thick fog outside someone's house &amp; then suddenly there is loud baning at the door, unable to see who it is out of the window they must open the door &amp; discover who or what is there. The ghosts themselves are really only seen in silhouette except one shot at the end when one of them is seen to have green rotten skin riddled with wriggling worms. There isn't much blood or gore, just some quickly cut scenes featuring the ghosts killing people with various hooks &amp; blades. The acting is very good from all involved. Overall I found The Fog to be a gripping, wonderfully atmospheric, creepy &amp; highly entertaining way to have spent 85 minutes of my time. I actually prefer The Fog to Halloween, a great horror film that is an absolute must for genre fans &amp; anyone else looking for for some classic creepy horror. Highly recommended although it may be a little slow for some, but I'm sure if you put the effort in you will be rewarded with a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Not Bear Scrutiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This thriller begins well, has plenty of forbidding atmosphere, and is well-directed by John Carpenter. The problem is the script. SPOILERS FOLLOW:Can't ghosts pass through all objects without any breakage? What's the backstory on the Jaime Lee Curtis character? She hitchhikes a ride from stranger Tom Adkins, they've a terrifying experience in his truck, but later they end up in bed together, and she still sticks around. Why does a dead character suddenly come to life in the hospital? Why does the disc jockey (Adrienne Barbeau) insist that all characters go to a church when the fog strikes? Wouldn't it be better to drive as far east from the coast as possible? In the denouement, Barbeau never finds out if her son and his babysitter are alive. And as the DVD attests, some scenes seem "tacked on", to raise the violent quotient, which caused some re-shoots after editing. Granted, most horror films have plot contrivances, but this one seems too much for its caliber cast and crew. On the plus side, Barbeau, who mostly acts alone, save for a scene with her son, is exceptional as the radio DJ, conveying alarming terror as the film progresses. Adkins and the rest are OK, but Curtis gives a lesser performance here. Some old-fashioned scare effects still frighten. The Northern California photography is haunting and un-nerving, with fantastic fog effects. With a fine-tuned script, this could have been a classic, rather than a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Fog" still stands as a great classic supernatural thriller and a jewel in the crown of Horror King John Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I led a rather sheltered life as a child and teen. My parents were strict about the movies I could see and were completely against me taking in any type of supernatural horror films. I would go to my father's house during the summers and that's when I would catch up on all the great films I missed for the past year. One of my fondest memories is watching "The Fog" one night around dusk with my cousin.It made a lasting impact on me that was evident five minutes after the credits rolled. Back in the early eighties, big trucks would drive through my father's neighborhood right before the sun went down and spray for mosquitoes. The insecticide created a thick fog that slowly crawled up to the house from the street. Needless to say, I was terrified.The little coastal town of Antonio Bay is about to pay for the sins of its forefathers. 100 years after being misled to their rocky demise during a dense fog, a phantom ship full of ghostly specters exacts their revenge on the ancestors who plotted their deaths. No one is safe until the six living relatives of the conspirators are put to death."The Fog" is rather tame besides some bad language and a scene of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins discussing her art in bed together. For all intents and purposes it's a study in visual minimalism. A lot of violence and killing is insinuated but happens off-screen, which gives it a classic feel missing in more graphic and gory films. It's truly a practice in the school of "What you don't see is scarier than what you do." It's a lesson many filmmakers could stand to learn today."The Fog" is one of those special horror films I hold up as one of the greatest ghost stories of all time. I look at it as an introduction to horror movies and used it as such on my son. It's dear to my heart and my experience seeing it for the first time will stay with me forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a scary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this today. God, Adrienne Barbeau. Could she be any sexier? If I was that little kid waking her up in her nightie I would have been licking my chops. And of course the ghost pirates don't want to do anything with her but kill her. The town wasn't the only thing clouded by the fog. I guess they did paw her for a bit. Anyway...It seems one of the main reasons why this and many other flicks of the late 70's and early 80's are so scary is because of the sense of isolation. The town the horror is taking place in is the only town in existence. There are no other people or goings on in the world. Phantasm 1 and 2, Halloween 1 and 3, Salem's Lot and so on. You got the feeling these towns were completely cut off from anything, any modern thing that might help, such as the National Guard, the govt, or just plain other people in the country. That's why horror movies these days suck. The world just isn't so believably isolated, communities just aren't' so believably? incompetent. That's why I think The Blair Witch Project did well, or was done well. It isolated the characters. No cell phone, computer, crowded towns. The sense of isolation was one of the scariest or unsettling aspects of those flicks mentioned, regardless of the horror involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danger, keep out of the Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog is, at times a very creepy chiller from John Carpenter (Halloween).The residents of Antonio Bay are preparing to celebrate the town's centenary. But a strange fog comes to town and spoils things. Contained within this fog are the ghostly, seaweed infested corpses of sailors who have come to get revenge concerning events exactly 100 years ago. They kill several people, including some fishermen on a trawler out at sea, a meteorologist and child minder Mrs Kobritz. Other strange things also happen, including a piece of drift wood found by KAB Radio operator's son Andy Wayne. His mum, Stevie broadcasts KAB from a remote lighthouse. She also nearly becomes one of the victims.The fog is very creepy throughout, especially the situation of the KAB lighthouse and John Carpenter's eerie music.The excellent cast includes mum and daughter scream queens Janet Leigh (Psycho) and Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween). Also, Adrienne Barbeau as Stevie, John Houseman and Hal Halbrook. With Lee Curtis's Halloween co-stars Nancy Loomis and Charles Cyphers.For a good scare one evening, watch The Fog. Excellent.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

I am fifteen and I firmly believe that John Carpinters "The Fog" is the greatest horror movie ever made hands down. It is so scary in fact that you never clearly see the faces of the ghosts, also they have no dialogue, they just stand there completely still, their ominous shadows looming in your mind. Another thing that struk me about "The Fog" was that the music is simply amazing and the fact that you cannot escape from them, even if you barricade yourself in a room the fog will simply seep under the door.

		<shortDescription>A Must See For Any Horror Fan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching quite literally thousands of movies in my lifetime, The Fog remains one the best most enjoyable and memorable films of them all. It's extremely well written, filmed directed and scored. The acting is well above par and the special effects while simple, stand the test of time. When I first saw this movie it was on late night TV. I was eleven, I wasn't supposed to be up and I certainly wasn't supposed to be watching horror movies. I paid for it because this one scared the pajamas off of me...but I absolutely loved it! The Fog went straight into my (even then) large movie collection secreted away in my closet and it's been apart of my collection ever since. I now own the BluRay and I can say that without a doubt, this movie is even better in 1080p.The atmosphere in The Fog is chilling from the very beginning. It grips you with a ghost story and then doesn't let go. The film keeps building suspense all the way through and even now, much older than when I first saw the movie it still creeps the hell out of me. It's not full of gore, nudity or even foul language but it simply doesn't need any of that. Despite the fact that you could watch this movie with little kids in the room it's still one of the best horror movies out there.If you haven't seen this movie yet...what are you waiting for! Pop some popcorn, grab a soda shut off the lights and prepare for a sleepless night...and hope it doesn't turn out to be a foggy one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's eerie cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the inspirational and now a mega-classic landmark horror film, "Halloween", filmmaker John Carpenter crafted this tense and atmospheric little tale that combines elements of the "slasher genre" with the classic archetypal "ghosts at sea" cursed town stories. Although flawed on many levels, "The Fog" is considered by many to be one of Carpenters best featuring 1980's genre star actress and real-life wife, Adrianne Barbeau, scream queen legend, Jamie Lee Curtis, and witty and charismatic Tom Akins. This characterizes what will later inspire the early 80's classic "Creepshow", and has gone down in history as a template for what makes a chilling and effective horror film for future inspiration.Lovely, Barbeau is a radio station owner and announcer that discovers a strange fog that covers the city of Antonio Bay, California causing the disappearance of a sea crawler's crew and many weird happenings such as dogs barking, car alarms, objects appearing and moving about...etc. Atkins is a cynical local and Curtis is a hitchhiker along for the ride trying to solve the murders and mysteries which are tied to a legend concerning a leper colony, lost treasure and revenge plot all victimizing the residents of Antonio Bay. Its the classic campfire story meshed together with Carpenter's talented eye for eeriness and ambiance with a skilled cast of suspense movie veterans that handle a remarkable script with plenty of charm and energy. A box office flop that inevitably became a cult classic, this film's brilliant photography and strong use of lighting and silhouetting offset any of its shortcomings. It also features Hal Holbrook as the town priest, Janet Leigh and John Houseman. Charles Cypher plays a character named Dan O'Bannon, a homage to the writer of "Alien" that immensely inspired Carpenter. "Creepshow" and "Escape From New York" reunite much of the cast in 1981 and 1982, and Curtis returns for "Halloween II". This is the stuff that horror films are made of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our celebration tonight is a travesty. We're honoring murderers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILER ALERT*** As the seaside town of Antonio Bay revs up to celebrate it's 100 anniversary an eerie and luminous fog, going against the wind, slowly overtakes the local fishing trawler "Sea Grass" and within minutes the entire three man crew is brutally murdered. Inside this fog there's a number of badly decomposed looking zombie-like mariner who are using the deadly mist as camouflage in assisting them in committing their crimes. It's not until later that we and the towns religious leader Father Malone, Hal Holbrook,find out the reason for this Fog/Zombie alliance and it has to do with the very founding of the town of Antonio Bay.After doing a number on the "Sea Grass" and it's crew the Fog creates havoc in Antonio Bay itself causing everything electrical to go haywire. The disruptions also include local radio station KAB who's midnight to dawn music program is hosted by the sexy voiced, as well as looking, Stevie Wayne, Adrienne Barbeau. Father Malone finds at approximately 12.04 AM a journal hidden in the wall of his chapel written by his grandfather that puts the fear of God into him. The journal explains, or better yet confesses, the sins that Father Malone's grandfather committed, together with the five other founding fathers of Antonio Bay, that resulted in the deaths of Captain Blake, Rob Bottin, and his crew of five on the trawler "Elizabeth Dane" which happened in the early morning hours of April 21, 1880. April 21 is the very day that's now being celebrated by the people of Antionio Bay as the towns founding and 100 year anniversary!The very effective and startling ghostly photography, with a minimum use of state-of-the-art special effects, more then makes up for the movies very plot-holed ridden screenplay. John Carpenters sharp and tight directions is on par, or in some cases even better, with his previous horror blockbuster "Halloween" that was released two years earlier.The movie also reunites a number of actors who were in John Carpenters "Halloween" that includes the love at first sight couple Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins as the out of town young hitchhiker Liz Solley and the local Antonio Bay fisherman Nick Castle. There's also Jamie Lee Curtis' real life mother Jane Leigh in the movie playing Antiono Bay's beleaguered, because of the killer Fog, Mayor Kathy Williams as well as Nancy Loomis who also stared in "Halloween" as Mayor Williams' press secretary Sandy Fadel.The Fog and it's Zombie-like mariners go on a rampage seeking out the descendants of the original Father Malone and his cohorts who were responsible for their deaths by sending them and their boat "Elizabeth Daen" to the bottom of the sea off Antiono Bay's rocky and dangerous Spivey Point.As you would have expected in a case like this it was old fashion greed that motivated Father Malone Sr and Co. to misdirect, with bonfires as navigation markers, the "Elizabeth Dane" to go off course in the dead of night and sink with it's crew as well as the some 200 pounds of gold that was on it. It was that gold that was to pay for building a leper colony for the afflicted Capt. Blake and his fellow leapers on the strip of land that was eventually to become the seaport town of Antoino Bay. In reality it in turn became Father Malone's and his fellow conspirator's's descendants both premature and permanent graves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting horror film that uses a detective element as its build up and then hits us with the scares towards the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film opens up on an old man telling numerous children a ghost story as they all sit around a camp fire late at night; you get the feeling the film is going to take the sort of fantasy, novelty approach a film like, say, The Princess Bride does as it opens up in the 'real' world and goes into a mythical world where anything is possible. Cleverly, this opening sequence is re-visited twenty or so minutes into the film when the son of one of a couple of main characters named Stevie Wayne (Barbeau) reveals he was one of the kids around the fire and it's then when we realise that this is, in actual fact, happening in our 'real' world.This is one of a few things that makes The Fog a smart and fun (if you can call a horror film 'fun') horror film which uses rather a few conventions in a clever and satisfactory manner. The film attempts to build up suspense as well as intrigue by making seemingly bland and obvious things actually rather eerie. These include someone sweeping the floor late at night in a closed convenience store whilst simultaneously having his curiosity aroused by odd happenings the other side of the shop ? we don't know what the hell is going on but the important thing is that we don't know who or what the hell is doing it. Could they be ghosts? Or was that just a spook story; since the kid hasn't stated he was part of that band of children just yet, we still don't know.Another occurrence of this is when the two characters of Hank (Haynie) and Elizabeth (Lee Curtis) are driving along in a truck late at night and suddenly have their windows smashed in following an unnatural movement of fog; again, we don't exactly know who or what has done this or even why this has happened. What I also noticed about The Fog and liked in an identifiable way was the fact the film is, for the bulk part; a detective story. Although this may sound like something to put off horror fans from watching it given the power of Carpenter's other horror effort from around this time; The Thing, which didn't cover half of the distance The Fog does and instead beds down into a situation of extreme horror and distrust; it actually plays out in a refreshing way of getting to the bottom of something truly uncanny that is happening in your home town.Given the fact that most of the film plays out like this, the film is then sliced in half again with Hank and Elizabeth doing things their way and a priest in a church taking care of things on his side of the patch. Once the priest makes a discovery and involves local political powers; you get the false, comforting feeling that everything may well be resolved in an understanding manner but this is very wrong. As each event leads onto the next, Stevie's son becomes the victim we are forced to fell bad about the most as he is the character that suffers the brute of The Fog and its ghosts the first time we actually see them properly. I feel it's from this scene on that the film moves up into the gear people from today's horror generation will relate to the most.It's from here on that The Fog becomes an often frightening fight for survival as the ghosts near their targets and ultimately; their goal. The score is fantastic as is the element of chase, the dark cinematography as the fog sweeps across land and just about anything else (including seeping through windows and door cracks) is marvellously done and a certain shot nearer the end when the ghosts are standing there, in close to perfect formation amongst some church pews; as still as stones, is imprinted on my mind as I write this.The Fog will not be a film for everyone. Do not expect a film similar to The Thing but do not expect to be completely disappointed. What few things I couldn't work out included the fact that if the old man at the beginning knew so much, why didn't he inform everyone else once the odd happenings started? Also, half way through the film when the detective element is at its hilt; I thought to myself "wouldn't it be great if even I didn't know what was going on?" thus, the fact the campfire story is told at the beginning in the first place pretty much spoils things for the audience.Do not let these things put you off too much, The Fog is still an enjoyable horror film that fans of more 'classical' horror films where the bad-guys are mythical creatures will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerie and surreal nightmare...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Carpenter has come a long way since his acclaimed "Halloween" but even when not all of his movies are perfect, they all have an element in common: they are all entertaining. "The Fog" is probably one of the best examples of this, it is neither outstanding nor a classic, and to some people, it may not even be scary; but without a doubt it is one of Carpenter's most entertaining films ever. This is not a film that aims for cheap thrills or disturbing images, this one relays on creepy atmospheres more akin to those eerie dreams that haunts us at times. This is superb storytelling at its best.On the dawn of Antonio Bay's 100th Anniversary, a series of strange events begin to occur as an unnatural fog covers the town in what seems to be the supernatural revenge of ghosts linked to the town's dark past. The inhabitants of the town will find themselves haunted by a powerful force that won't stop until their revenge mission is accomplished. At first sight, "The Fog" is a typical story of a ghost looking for revenge on the living; what sets the movie apart from the rest is the way the story is told.Carpenter's story unfolds the same way one of those old scary tales would do, putting special emphasis on the town's atmosphere and the Fog's powerful presence. The characters are still well-rounded despite this, but it is clear that the Fog is the main character of the tale. The mystery and the suspense are the key factors of the story as the movie is not very graphic (in fact, Carpenter was asked to add some graphic scares as the studio execs though tit was "not scary"), however, the feeling of dread and the surreal haunting atmosphere are more than enough to capture the audience.Despite being a low-budget production, it is admirable what Carpenter does with his special effects. Thanks to his camera-work, super lighting and the perfect use of the fog machines the movie looks terrific and at times it seems as if the fog truly had a life of its own. It is definitely one of the most accomplished low-budget horror films in history and a lesson in film-making for many young directors,as the film still looks fresh even when it is been more than 15 years after its initial release.The three women that eventually will have to face the Fog are superbly played by three of the best actresses in the horror genre. Adrienne Barbeau leads the cast as Stevie Wayne, a local DJ who discovers the link between the killings and the fog. "Halloween"'s star Jamie Lee Curtis appears as Elizabeth Solley, a hitchhiker who is on her way to Canada, and the legendary Janet Leigh plays the woman in charge of the 100th Anniversary celebration. The three women take full advantage of their characters despite the fact that character development was not Carpenter's priority in "The Fog".Sadly, the same can not be said of the male characters Tom Atkins ends up as average and probably the only one worth a mention is Hal Holbrook as the local priest. Most of this problems are due to the lack of character development, which seems to be the movie's biggest problem. Of course, it is safe to say that the movie was not built around the characters, but, like a classic horror tale, is set on the atmosphere and creepiness the supernatural provides."The Fog" may not be one of Carpenter's best films, but it is definitely one of the most entertaining. It may not be iconic like "Halloween", or down frightening like "The Thing", but if you are in the mood for a creepy ghost tale before sleep there is not a better film than "The Fog". 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another brilliant horror classic from master Carpenter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without no doubt,John Carpenter's The Fog is one terrific horror movie and it sure is one of the best films of the master to date.Why?There is a definite answer for that question;atmosphere!We always say every John Carpenter movie has a unique atmosphere but The Fog is by far his best work in terms of creating an effective atmosphere.Besides that,there are many reasons why The Fog is considered as a horror masterpiece.First of all;though the movie's basic plot may seem simple and predictable,after a couple of minutes you figure it just seems that way because there's quite an imaginative storyline that keeps growing every minute with the help of Carpenter's very well written screenplay with original twists and quite notable characters.If you like so called horror movies insulting the audience with blondes screaming and running without a sign of intelligence,you should definitely stay away from The Fog because this movie definitely deserves real horror buffs to appreciate it's charm.Besides it's great score written and performed by Carpenter himself,the movie has a stellar cast including Jamie Lee Curtis,her mother Janet Leigh(psycho),Adrienne Barbeau,Hal Holbrook,Tom Atkins,Nancy Loomis,Charles Cyphers with legendary John Houseman in a cameo in the movie's long but strangely appealing opening scene and all the performances are solid and believable.John Carpenter's The Fog is a masterpiece that still manages to scare the audience without being gory even almost thirty years later.What you can't see won't hurt you....it'll kill you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the huge success of Carpenter's Halloween, he followed it with this low budget but very well done ghost picture that has became a cult favorite.The town of Antonio Bay, California is set to celebrate it's 100th birthday, but a fog blows in from the sea and with it comes the vengeful ghosts of some dead mariners.The Fog still stands as one of Carpenter's finest films. Carpenter and long-time friend producer Debra Hill take an old fashion ghost tale and give it some truly chilling edge. Carpenter's direction is sharp, well building the suspense of the movie at a good pace. He also creates a wonderfully chilling atmosphere of mystery and the unknown. He knows that subtlety can be the most effective element in a good horror picture and it works very well for this film. Carpenter also provides another excellent music score for this picture.The cast of this film is terrific. Stars Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, Hal Holbrook, and Tom Atkins are perfect in their roles as spooked residents.All around, The Fog is an excellent ghost film, in fact it's really one of the best. It's a unique and effective mood-piece that dares to be a pace slower than other horror films. So, for those seeking fast action, look else where. But for the patient horror fan, it's a very rewarding watch. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Effective Atmospheric Fright-Fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The quaint seaside community of Antonio Bay is celebrating its 100th anniversary, but along with this revelry comes ghastly horror in the form of a thick, glowing fog that bears legions of murderous undead lepers with a vendetta against the residents of said community.While viewing The Fog, I couldn't help but laugh at the sheer absurdity of the plot; watching people suddenly become afraid of fog when they really have no way of knowing that it's dangerous. Seeing people actually close their windows, lock their doors, and speedily flee from the fog in vehicles. Maybe it's just me, but if a thick fog engulfed my house, my first reaction probably wouldn't be one of terror. The story seems all the more ridiculous after summarizing it on paper (err, in an internet comment box).However, John Carpenter has a talent for making potentially laughable stories into frightening, well-made films. The Fog is no exception. Carpenter drenches the film in gorgeous ocean backdrops and a highly unnerving atmosphere that creates a tense, palpable sense of dread. From the first moments of the picture, the viewer is immersed in an eerily silent small town midnight when strange, frightening things begin to occur. This, like many other similar sequences in the film, works very effectively and probably would have faltered at the hands of a director not so well-suited to such a laid-back genre film. At 89 minutes, The Fog moves along at an appropriately brisk pace that does not stretch the entertainment value out of the relatively straightforward story.The acting from such '70s/'80s staples as Adrienne Barbeau and Jamie Lee Curtis is, for the most part, competently handled. The better performances include those of Tom Atkins and Hal Holbrook. By the way, notice the strange similarity between this cast and that of Creepshow? I don't know if there's any actual connection, but it's amusing nonetheless. Oh, and Psycho's Janet Leigh also makes an appearance.The ending, at first, may seem sudden and anti-climactic, or it might even seem like something of a deus ex machina, but wait a couple more minutes, as Carpenter delivers a fun final "And by the way, F--K YOU!" Overall, The Fog is a frightening, heavily atmospheric, thoroughly enjoyable, and worthy horror film that, like almost every other classic horror movie that has been butchered, did not need to be remade.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Atmospheric Chiller! That's Really Creepy And Often Scary, With A Very Suspenseful Finale, And Amazing Performances!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent atmospheric chiller! that's really creepy and often scary, with a very suspenseful finale and amazing performances!. All the characters are awesome, and the story is just great, plus Jamie Lee Curtis and Adrienne Barbeau are simply amazing in this!. One of the main reasons The Fog works so well is because John Carpenter uses a lot of the same formula as he did In Halloween, the slow pace, adding tension, building up the suspense, letting us to get to know the characters, using a very chilling score, and everything else that made Halloween so incredibly effective!, plus The opening is quite creepy as well. I Thought it was cool that Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis (Mother&amp;Daughter), were in the same movie together, even though they shared hardly any screen time, and John Carpeneter has an amusing cameo at the beginning as the Father's helper, plus The film works on scares and suspense rather then blood and gore, which is a good thing in this case!. This is an excellent atmospheric chiller!, that's really creepy and often scary, with a very suspenseful finale and amazing performances!, and i say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is excellent!. John Carpenter does an excellent job here, with wonderful camera work,great angles, constantly adding creepy atmosphere and building up the suspense,and just keeping the film at a very engaging pace!.The Acting is amazing!. Adrienne Barbeau is amazing here, she was right on the ball at all times, was very likable,very intense(especially when she announces that her son is trapped by The Fog), added class, is quite charming, and delivers possibly her best performance!, she was amazing. Jamie Lee Curtis is amazing as always, and while she didn't have that much to do, she brought plenty of class, charisma, and looked especially hot,and also had really good chemistry with Tom Atkins!, she was amazing. (Jamie Lee Rules!!!!!!!!). . Janet Leigh is wonderful here, she brought her usual class, and while her character may seem pushy I just couldn't help but lover her! (Janet Rules!!!!). Tom Atkins is solid as a rock here, he was calm and cool under pressure, and delivered an engaging show!. Hal Holbrookis awesome as The Father, he was just great as he didn't go OTT as a lot of people would in this role, he also had some cool lines. Charles Cyphers has a a small but cool role as Dan I liked him. Nancy Kyes is terrible here she looked extremely bored here,and had some bad dialog, her character was also annoying and dull. Ty Mitchell is sort of annoying but not as bad as most kid actors at that time he did alright, as Stevie's son. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scary film let down by a foggy script (pun intended) (SPOILER ALERT!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to confess to being disappointed with with this film. The killings were too gruesome for me, which I understand were inserted on the behest of the studio after Carpenter had submitted a less gory, more atmospheric film. This is a shame, as I think the more left to the imagination, the spookier it would have been. I also think the ghosts looked more like badly dressed tramps. My biggest problem with it was the glaring plot errors and inconsistencies. Perhaps someone out there can prove me wrong, but this for me let the film down greatly - (SPOILERS BELOW)1. The DANE driftwood that the DJ took to her lighthouse began to drip water and spelt out "6 must die". At the end of the film when they group together in the church they refer to the fact that 6 must die, and count how many people have been killed so far. At no point has the DJ left the lighthouse or made this information known to anyone else, and it certainly wouldn't have been written in the diary, so how did they know?2. At the end when the DJ is warning the townspeople about the fog she gives a running commentary and tells everyone to go the church, as it's the only safe place. As only five people turn up at the church, are we to assume that either a) she has a very small audience, or b) the rest of the town is already dead? If it is the latter then more than six have died, and if it is neither, then is the fog not really that deadly after all?3. The story is that the original six conspired to sink the ship so that they could use the money to build the town. The diary says that they recovered the money from the wreck. So the whole film is based on the premise that the town was built on blood money. So how come at the end the vicar finds a solid gold cross behind the wall, and says the money was melted down into that? Why would they use it all to make a gold cross that would be hidden, when they needed it to make the town? Did they not need it to make the town? If so why bother with the whole sinking the ship, killing the lepers thing in the first place?Now you may think I'm just being picky, but these sorts of things bother me and prevent me from enjoying a film. Does anyone out there have the answers? Apart from that I didn't think it was too bad. I think Halloween and Assault on Precinct 13 were better though. John Carpenter has recently announced that Hollywood will be remaking The Fog with him as Producer. Perhaps these plot errors will be fixed! And the ghosts will look more scary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Next time I need to fall asleep, ill pop "The Fog" in the DVD player. This movie was soooo boring. It took me 3 separate times to watch this movie. After watching the first 30 minutes i was dozing off so i held off and thought "ah i must be pretty tired". the next day I put it back in and AGAIN i was dozing off. I actually started to dream the second time around, it put me in that much of a sleep. I awoke from my nap and turned off the movie. I thought that this movie was going to pick up so i put the movie back in the next day and actually stayed awake!!! holy crap was that not worth it.*POSSIBLE SPOILERS* The plot is stupid, So many parts just do not make sense, events that happen do not fit in at all, and Jamie Lee Curtis has absolutely no role in the movie whatsoever. She does NOTHING. The only cool parts in this movie are creepy little scares (like windows busting for no reason causing you to jump a little) that scattered throughout this mess of a movie. The fog in the movie is very silly as well. When the fog appears, so do demons with hooks. First of all, you never even get to see the demons face which is like just watching shadows of people in fog. I know some of you are thinking, but Jeff you get to see the COOL red eyes of them in the end. WOOPEEE what an awesome finale. I'm so glad i had to put this movie back and forth into my DVD player 3 times before seeing the awesome special effects of red eyes. *END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS* I am a huge horror fan, and like all kind of horror movies especially B movies and i must say that this movie is terrible. I'm sorry i had to buy it, and p.s. I'm usually pretty lenient towards movies that i own. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moody And Effective Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw THE FOG twenty years ago and remembered it as being an okay horror film though one with a silly plot . Having seen it again last night for a second time I must admit it`s far better than I rememberedA lot of people on this page have mentioned how atmospheric it is and that`s the key to its sucess - Atmosphere . The movie gets off to a very effective start with a narrator retelling a legend and the creepy mood continues throughout helped in no small part by the score . There`s also a few cliched scenes of things falling and things breaking but again they`re very effective at making the audience jump . But perhaps the aspect of THE FOG I should praise more than anything else is the discipline of director John Carpenter , he`s resisted the temptation of using gore to carry the film and I just wish he`d used the same advisable technique when making THE THINGThere were a couple of things I didn`t like however . One is that there seems to be a slight lack of internal continuity . If the fog causes electrical equipment to short circuit and glass to break then why do these things occur when the fog isn`t present ? We also see the 1970s social mores of people going to bed with each other without them knowing each others names . I don`t want to sound like an angel but if you`re going to have sex with someone you should always ask " To whom do I have the pleasure ? " . Mind you it makes a change where people who have sex in a horror movie survive to the end credits . It`s also a nice change to see a John Carpenter movie that`s effective even if it was made almost 25 years ago</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic of chilling atmosphere and music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Fog is a classic campfire ghost story. It's even set up that way in a little prologue that drips with Carpenter's trademark atmosphere, in which an old sea captain (John Houseman) tells some youngsters a story of tragedy that once befell their sleepy seaside town. Carpenter revels in setting up quaint, closed off communities or settings, and slowly letting unimaginable horrors creep up on them, their eventual realization that the quiet lives they have are about to be shaken up an integral part of what makes his films so special. In 1880, a ship called the Elizabeth Dane tragically crashed while entering the port of Antonio Bay, Oregon, mired in a thick, impenetrable fog. A century later, a similar fog sweeps in from the ocean and lays over the town once again, providing a veil for spectral ghosts to emerge from and stalk the residents. It's up to a small few to discover why this curse has been put on their town, and escape the horror. A minister (Hal Holbrook) reads an ancient volume and believes the ship was deliberately led astray, and the ghosts have come for vengeance. Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins arrive in town and are drawn into the mystery, as well as the local radio DJ (Adrienne Barbeau). The scene where a fishing trawler and its crew falls prey to the first arriving ghosts is classic and chilling, as we see them slowly take shape from the fog, freezing the fishers in their boots and the audience in their seats in terror. Carpenter has stated that his initial cut of the film wasn't scary enough, and he had some cutting and pasting to do. Whatever changes he made work fine for me. It's not an absolutely terrifying movie, more like a spooky ghost story with a one of a kind atmosphere, something John has always been perfect at creating. From the gorgeous, windswept location, to the nerve jangling score composed by Carpenter himself, it's a distinct entry in the genre and a career highlight for everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog 9/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of Carpenter's Halloween, he had a lot to live up to when directing the follow-up, The Fog. The Fog is headlined by a great assortment of actors and actresses, which include Adrienne Barbeau (Creepshow), Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween), Janet Leigh (Psycho), Tom Atkins (Halloween III) and Hal Holbrook (The Firm). Supporting cast was excellent too, a lot of them remaining apart of the Halloween team and carrying a role over.The special effects of The Fog and it's ghosts are tremendously well done being bad ass and very creepy. The initial kill scenes on the boat were a great way to hook the viewers into the madness, which is The Fog. Carpenter's music theme, which he writes and composes is overpowering, bone-chilling, and mesmerizing. In fact the entire soundtrack is very easy to listen to altogether. The Fog is all around a fantastic movie, but most of all it starts with the storyline and script, being fluid, put together and having a sense of creeping paranoia and un-predictableness. The Fog is an underrated must see for any horror fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE FOG came as a pleasant surprise to those of us who were already John Carpenter fans back in the day: it was an old-fashioned, spooky ghost story set in a sleepy little seaside town. What better follow-up to a movie about The Boogey Man (HALLOWEEN)? The opening shots are slow and moody and effectively set the stage for the supernatural goings-on about to transpire. It all reminds me of some of the Val Lewton films of yore- movies like ISLE OF THE DEAD and THE BODY SNATCHER and I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE; THE FOG has THAT kind of feel- the feel of a fable being retold around a campfire, a scary story to keep the kids awake and listening intently well into the Night. (The lepers in THE FOG actually inspired my own Supernatural Superhero, THE LEPER. To SEE a drawing or two of my character, check out the CAPE FEAR COMICS page on Facebook.) The score for THE FOG is one of the more memorable Carpenter compositions (in my opinion), though the man has YET to do a "forgettable" score. Looking for a great Halloween film this year? You can't do much better than THE FOG.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Creepy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not big on horror movies, but when they're done well and they actually have a story to tell while not relying on gore, they can be very effective. Such is the case with this film, The Fog. It's far from perfect, but it does the job it sets out to do and does it well as an independent, very low-budget film. This film is more on the lines of a creepy ghost story that will send chills up your back.John Carpenter's follow-up to his debut success of Halloween, is about how many years ago, these lepers named by a man named Blake were deliberately led to their death. Many years later, they come for revenge as ghosts using fog as their cover and also to seek what is theirs.The acting is good for the most part. Adrienne Barbeau is great as the radio host, Stevie Wayne who tries to alert everyone about the fog. There are some good supporting turns by Jamie Lee Curtis, Hal Holbrook, John Houseman, and of course the great Janet Leigh.Overall, The Fog is a good movie, especially for the kind of genre it's in. I liked it because it doesn't rely on a big production or lots of blood to tell the story. The story is not perfect and there are some flaws, but all-in-all, I was creeped out. Also, this movie has a chilling score thanks to John Carpenter. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent,Scary,Frightening And Atmospheric Horror Classic From John Carpenter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog is an excellent,scary,frightening Horror film/Ghost story that is filled great atmospheric direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy memorable film score. All those combinations make The Fog one of John Carpenter's best film's but a Horror classic.The Fog tells the story of a fictional town named Antonio Bay,California and it residents who are about to celebrate the town's 100th Anniversity. On the 100th Aniversity the residents of Antonio Bay are being stalked and killed by vengeful ghosts who are surrounded by Fog and Mist. Now,the residents in Antonio Bay have to figure out how to stop the ghosts before they destroy the entire town.The Fog is an amazing,scary,frightening and Horror classic that John Carpenter did two years after his breakthrough Horror classic Halloween and is what introduced me to my all-time favorite filmmaker director John Carpenter. The Fog was also one of the first Horror films I ever saw as a kid that truly scared me and after you watch this film you will never look at fog's or mists the same way again. One of the main reason The Fog is such a great Horror film is because it's basically an old fashioned classic ghost story that is almost like a story you would hear by a campfire and as you listen or in this case look at the story you are scared out of your mind and you are pulled into a sense of dread and fear and right from the start you are pulled into a creepy and terrifying nightmare where anything can happen and you don't know what to expect and The Fog is a truly intense Horror film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't quit until the very end. Another one of the main reasons The Fog works is because of it's dark and scary atmosphere and the photography by Dean Cunday because where most Horror films rely on blood and gore to scare and frighten the audience,Carpenter uses great and creepy atmosphere to scare viewers with shots of the fog and mist keeping viewers on the edge of your seat with suspense and fear not knowing when and where terror and violence is going to strike. Blood and gore is great for a Horror film but a Horror film also has to have an amazing atmosphere to be effective and the atmosphere in The Fog is very scary and will haunt you. The scares in the film are well-done with wonderful white hot suspense and skill because Carpenter is a master at building up suspense and tension when the suspense and tension stops each suspenseful scene explodes with a great scare and in each of the scary scenes in The Fog are surprising and shocking and will have you jumping out of your chair and will make you leave the light on and look over your shoulder. The creepy photography by Dean Cunday is just fantastic because with Cunday's photography The Fog has a distorted look to it that is very beautiful and at the same time dark and creepy. Dean Cunday's amazing and eerie photography is one of the reasons The Fog stands out and is a great Horror film. The main characters in the film are very sympathetic and likable with wonderful depth that when the horrible things start to happen we root for the main characters and we want them to live and survive. The characters aren't in the film to be slaughtered and taken out but are in the film for a reason. The ghosts in The Fog are scary and creepy because you never really see them because they are hidden behind The Fog. There are glances and peeks but we never see their faces which I think makes the ghosts in The Fog terrifying and very memorable because in The Fog you never hear or see the face of evil. In many way John Carpenter is continuing the theme of pure evil from Halloween only this time he's telling a ghost story. The violence in The Fog is effective and shocking and definitely fits in with the film's dark and scary tone but the violence is not bloody or gory because this film is about atmosphere. The ending of this film is a great and is a classic Carpenter ending,a conclusion that is truly scary,shocking and unexpected and a powerful cap off to this Carpenter classic.The whole cast is great in their roles. Adrenne Barbeau is excellent and sexy as Stevie Wayne,a local radio host. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as Elizabeth,a hitchhiker and Nick's love interest. Janet Leigh is fantastic as Kathy,the town organizer. Tom Atkins is great as Nick Castle,a local fisherman that falls for Elizabeth. Hal Holbrook is amazing as Father Malone,a local priest who discovers a secret. John Houseman is effective and creepy in his small role as Mr. Machen,a sailor who tells a scary story in the beginning of the film. Special effects master Rob Bottin is scary and effective as Blake,the leader of the ghosts. Ty Mitchell(Andy)and Carpenter regulars Charles Cyphers(Dan),Nancy Loomis(Sandy),George 'Buck' Flower(Tommy)and Darwin Josten(Dr. Phibes)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an uncredited cameo by John Carpenter in the beginning in the role as Bennett.John Carpenter's direction is brilliant and stylish,with Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film a scary visual style,tone and atmosphere. Great direction,John.The score by John Carpenter is excellent,scary,creepy and effective and adds to the film and matches the tone and each major scene perfectly. Great score,Carpenter.In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror Films,Ghost films or Supernatural Films,I highly suggest you see The Fog,a scary,effective and creepy Horror classic that belongs in every Horror fans collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An often overlooked horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The later 70s and early 80s were just such a brilliant period for John Carpenter who produced solid gold almost without fail, time after time. Unfortunately his last good film was 'They Live' and after that he seems to have completely lost the plot, his anti-establishment schtick looking more than a little old hat post Cold War. Amongst the greats of Halloween and The Thing, The Fog is often a little forgotten but it's a terrific piece of work. It starts out very much in the atmosphere created by the opening scene, an old sailor's ghost story told around the fire to chill the blood (anyone else think the Captain's role was written for Donald Pleasance?) Then there's the slow build up with little hint after hint about what's going on (the inexplicable small events which occur all over town at the stroke of midnight, what killed those three kids who were diving on 'that old ship wrecked off the reef'? why does Janet Leigh's dog start barking at the ocean all night? the hero slightly misremembering his father's tale of the ghost ship, getting its' name a little wrong, the shark's jaws situated next to the clipper ship in the bottle on display in the shop). As with The Thing these aren't a bunch of unlikeable teenagers waiting to get chopped up, these are some very capable people gradually putting together the clues pointing to an extraordinary conclusion and dealing with it admirably (in fact like Halloween very few deaths and little explicit gore). If I was to have a favourite scene it would be Stevie Way's heroic last stand atop her lighthouse, staying at her post to warn the townspeople of the impending danger (remember she has no idea that her son has been rescued). Great dialogue and music as you would expect from John Carpenter, a wonderful atmosphere created by the fog even though it's the hokiest of movie special effects dating right back to silent era. The storyline is thrilling, makes perfect sense within its' own logic and everyone acts believably given the circumstances. I was such a fan of this film I not only bought an Antonio Bay radio t-shirt but when I was in the US went to visit the areas it was filmed at. Two last things, firstly many misunderstand the scene where Dick Baxter's corpse rises towards Jamie Lee Curtis' character, scalpel in hand. Some think this is just a lame rip-off of the similar scene in Halloween but they don't get it, Carpenter is playing with our expectations, Dick Baxter doesn't want to hurt her, he wants to warn her. Lastly there's the age old question of is Jamie Lee Curtis' character really Laurie Strode from the Halloween series using another name? Maybe, she seems reluctant to talk about her past or reveal much about herself and comments that 'Weird stuff is always happening to me, I seem to attract it'?If I was to have one complaint it would be I never felt the need for the last scene, it feels unnecessary and a tagged on shock for the sake of it. I think it would have been better to end it with Stevie Way giving her chilling warning to the townspeople and ships at sea ("LOOK into the fog") but that's a small point in a terrific film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something strange is killing people in Antonio Bay, it lurks in "The Fog". One hundred years prior, a group of men were murdered out on the sea by the six founding fathers of Antonio Bay. The founders stole all of the gold from their ship, and used it to build up the town as well as it's church. Fast forward a 100 years to 1980, and to one foggy night. A fog bank surrounds a boat full of fisherman and, what appears to be the ghosts of the deceased men, viciously slaughters everyone aboard. We eventually meet our main characters. Elizabeth (Jamie Lee Curtis) is hitch-hiking and is picked up by Nick (Tom Atkins). The two of them throughout the film experience many strange occurrences by the fog and it's powers. We also meet local DJ Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau) who works from the large lighthouse. She see's the fog when it first rolls into Antonio Bay, and eventually has to warn her listeners to stay out of the fog. Anyways, the ghosts have decided that the perfect time to exact revenge is when the town is celebrating it's 100th centennial. They, inside of the fog, follow out our cast of characters up to the old church leading to a scary conclusion. It's really hard to explain the plot, but that is only half of what makes the movie so good! The scenes shot with the actual fog were done well, "The Fog" has a great atmosphere to it. Much thanks goes to John Carpenter for that. The acting is top notch. This film has some of the best actors out there at the time in Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh and Adrienne Barbeau. It's a very good horror movie that doesn't use over the top gore or jump scares to get it's point across. It's a good old fashioned ghost story that I highly recommend!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another classic chiller from John Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog is a brilliant scary little film that is better than todays so called horror movies. Even after twenty seven years its still creepy and scary with not a drop of blood in sight, another masterstroke that Carpenter did first time round with the horror classic Halloween.The opening sequence with the old man telling the tragic tale of the Elizabeth Dane to children around a camp fire at night is both scary and very foreboding...it sets up for the events that are about to occur...The seaside population of Antonio Bay must be about seventy....its a very very quiet town indeed. Obviously Carpenter and Debra Hill were working on a low budget, but to their credit they take a budget of one million dollars and make it look like ten million, and The Fog delivers thrills and chills big time.Favourite scenes are as follows:1. The three fisherman getting butchered by the Lepers has you jumping out of your seat as well as looking away. Plus its filmed in a way that makes you think you saw blood and gore.2.Even in the daylight sequences when Nick Castle (Tom Atkins) and Elizabeth (Jamie Lee Curtis) board The Seagrass, their is a creepy sense of dread of something lurking (or hidden) in a corner.3. When Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau) is gazing out to sea, she does not see the driftwood leaking water and spilling onto her radio recordings and we hear this deep, frightening voice cursing someone and talking about millstones and albatrosses before the wood explodes.4. The attempt of the ghostly lepers to kill Wayne's son Andy after killing poor Mrs Kobritz is both thrilling and rip up the armchair suspenseful.5. The final confrontation between Father Malone (Hal Holbrook) and Blake (Rob Bottin) while the small band of townsfolk fight for their lives is riveting stuff.Special mention must go to John Carpenter's music score and his assistant Dan Wyman for the 'Electronic Realization' pulse effect whenever the fog rolls in to attack and destroy. A masterful effect that adds to the menace.The Fog is a small underrated masterpiece of terror and suspense, i have a really personal liking for this film because i live in a small seaside town and feel they accurately portrayed an atmospheric setting for such a chilly parable.And whatever you do, do not watch the dreadful 2005 remake which is a mess from start to finish.This however, is Ten Out Of Ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog Is Still Thick, 25 Years Later.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Fog" is set in a small Northern California fishing town, Antonio Bay. The town is to celebrate it's founding 100 year anniversary soon, and the town is making preparations. But little do the citizens know, a thick mist of fog is returning to Antonio Bay, holding the ghosts of mariners whose ship was sunk off the coast by the town's founding fathers. As the 100 year anniversary rolls around, the fog rolls in, killing the descendants of the founding fathers in gruesome ways. It then becomes a battle for survival between a frightened priest, a radio disc jockey, a young man, and a hitchhiker. Can they escape the fog, or will it make them it's next victims? Definitely one of Carpenter's best post-"Halloween" efforts. "The Fog" is a chilling, all around creepy movie that sets up a great atmosphere. The small fishing town setting was perfect, and the final atmosphere of the movie fit everything very well. Jamie Lee Curtis makes a return in this film, acting alongside her real-life mother, Janet Leigh, but Adrienne Barbeau is the main star of the film. Hal Holbrook was great as Father Malone, the town priest who is also linked back to the town's dark secret. The opening of the movie couldn't have been any better - an old fisherman, telling young kids the story of the sunken ship on the beach. I loved the opening, it fit together with the rest of the film very well. Those with a short attention span may get bored with this movie, but if you can hold your patience and just wait, it is a really good movie. The ghosts aren't overdone, in fact all we really see is their silhouettes up until the ending of the movie, where the gruesome ghosts are actually revealed. The score for the film was eerie, and the movie uses a blend of intense sounds - then silence. Accented with the eerie fog that's moving through the scenes, it makes things all the more creepier. Also to note, Carpenter makes some subtle references to "Halloween", just check the names of a couple of particular characters.Overall, "The Fog" is an underrated little horror movie. Gorehounds probably won't be pleased because the movie actually contains little on screen violence, but the atmosphere, story, and tension are all factors that make is such a great horror movie. Truly unique and well worthwhile. Recommended. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JOHN CARPENTER followed up his HALLOWEEN box office success with this eerie ghost tale, about a small, quiet seaside coastal community fishing village of Antonio Bay, just off Spivey Point, which is enveloped in a thick, soupy, eerie, glowing fog, that overtakes the town at midnight April 21st, the 100th anniversary date of the towns beginning. Almost immediately strange things begin to happen, as it turns out, inside the fog is the angry spirits of a group of shipwrecked lepers from the ship the Elizabeth Dane, who were planning on having a Leper Colony just outside the small parchment of land that would soon become Antonio Bay before being murdered, now back from their watery grave, they seek revenge on the townsfolk for the sins of their forefathers, who led them to their watery grave on a fog enshrouded night &amp; then plundered their ship of the gold it was carrying. The ghosts waste no time at all, knocking off those who are foolish enough to wander outside in the fog by using fishing hooks &amp; swords. Father Malone (A wonderful performance by HAL HOLBROOK) stars as the towns creeped out minister who discovers his grandfathers diary hidden behind the walls of the church which documents the cruel murders &amp; may hold the answer to ending the terror.THE FOG is one of my all time favourite horror movies! I really enjoyed this movie, it's so much fun, so scary &amp; so eerie &amp; just gets better &amp; better with each passing viewing! But I honestly believe that a big part of the movie's success is due to the fact that Carpenter has re-surrounded himself with many of the same cast &amp; crew that helped make HALLOWEEN a success, CHARLES CYPHERS, editor/production designer TOMMY LEE WALLACE, actress NANCY LOOMIS, Cinematographer DEAN CUNDEY, editor CHARLES BORNSTEIN, Co-writer/producer (the late) DEBRA HILL &amp; actress JAMIE LEE CURTIS who is joined by her real life mother the late JANET LEIGH, as well as HALLOWEEN III star TOM ATKINS (sans the moustache) &amp; even pays tribute to not only the late ALFRED HITCHCOCK (the name BODEGA BAY, the setting for THE BIRDS is mentioned) but HALLOWEEN as well, as his lead hero is named NICK CASTLE (Who played Michael in some shots of HALLOWEEN) the names Bennet Tramer is mentioned (the name of heroine Laurie Strode's crush in that same movie) &amp; the name Lee Baxter &amp; one character is named after ALIEN screenwriter DAN O' BANNON whom Carpenter had a falling out with shortly before ALIEN commenced production, a character is named after RICHARD KOBRITZ who produced the long forgotten Carpenter film, SOMEONE'S WATCHING ME! &amp; Tommy Lee Wallace has his name given to a character as well. While a morgue attendant is named Dr. Phibes, which is the name of a Vincent Price horror thriller, THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES &amp; ARKHAM REEF a place that appears in many H.P. LOVECRAFT short stories. Just like most of his movies, Carpenter also composes the films score &amp; contributes one of the best scores to ever grace a horror film! in many ways the film reminded of the TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD series (in particular the RETURN OF THE EVIL DEAD), which featured a similar plot line about evil medieval knights templar who returned from the dead to seek vengeance on a small village that was responsible for their deaths a hundred years prior.Like HALLOWEEN, Carpenter knows how to make a scary movie, focusing on developing his characters, creating suspense, tension &amp; focusing on atmosphere to get his chills, rather than out &amp; out gore like the vast majority of the film-makers at the time (&amp; still today) rely on in the hopes of creating a scare. The film in many ways feels like a dream caught on film &amp; although the film is set in the spring time, it's eerie cold look, makes one think automatically of late fall. Carpenter also makes good use of light &amp; shadow, even the daylight scenes seem off, creepy. The opening campfire story being told to a group of children by an elderly sea captain is good &amp; eerie as is the scenes where machines come to life on their own. The scene where Atkins, Curtis &amp; a little boy are attacked in their truck, which is stuck in the mud, is really terrifying, as are the scenes where Barbeau is chased around the lighthouse/radio station by slime &amp; worm drenched corpses.The only downside is Carpenter leaves several questions fans may have regarding the films plot unanswered like, if the ghosts are only seeking out a limited amount of victims, that being the ancestors of those who murdered them, then why are they attacking random townsfolk as well?. Why is it that the fisherman killed on a fishing boat at the beginning of the movie discovered the next day but are in such a condition that makes it look as if they have been submerged underwater for a month? Why is it that a gold coin found on the seashore by Barbeau's son turn into a piece of driftwood which then leaks sea water? Why does the one dead fishermen revive on a mortuary slab &amp; the others don't? How is it that if the stolen gold from the Elizabeth Dane ship was used to build the town still in the shape of a gold cross?In the end, ironically enough, the film wasn't well received upon it's initial release by fans &amp; critics. In fact the film only get credit years later for it's effectiveness, now it's considered one of Carpenters best films &amp; to be truthfully honest with you, I actually think this may very well be (arguably) Carpenters best film! Followed by a really awful remake in 2005 of the same name (avoid it at all costs!)**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soooooooo BAD...and NOT in a good way(contains SPOILERS!!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this would be a good, old-fashioned horror flick. With some excellent actors, (Leigh, Curtis, Houseman, Holbrook, Barbeau...okay maybe not her so much), I figured they wouldn't do something less than decent. I turned off the lights in my empty house and got ready to be scared and entertained. Boy, was I disappointed! First of all, even though the effects are 20+ years old, they all look like high-school Haunted House-level quality. Glowing eyes on supposedly-drowned zombies? The fog itself looked like it was painted on a cel and dragged slowly past the camera. Secondly, there were so many things that didn't make any sense I don't have space to list them all here. But they include: 1. Why did they attack only the ship the first night? 2. Why did they target the people they did? If they were after six people, why were they after the father and the DJ at the same time after killing five already. And why didn't they kill Father Malone while the other people were there- why did they come back later? 3. Are we supposed to believe that Elizabeth and Nick become this loving couple after he picks her up hitchhiking and then nails her?Overall I was alternating between being disappointed and laughing at how bad it was- and not in a good way. I recommend skipping this one if you have a thing for quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>where do i begin?john carpenter's "the fog" is truly a great movie.the filmmakers had a limited budget, but achieved a lot on what they had.the plot is as follows: a thick fog rolls into the town of "antonio bay" on the day of the towns 100 year anniversary.but this is no ordinary fog. it hides within it the ghosts of some sailors(from a leper colony) who were betrayed and left to die by the founders of the town.these ghosts seek revenge on the ancestors of the founders,and of course innocent people also die by their hands."the fog" has many things going for it,including a great musical score(done by carpenter) which helps to ratchet up the tension.it also has good acting and plenty of suspense throughout.visually the movie is very beautiful, with nice shots of the landscape and the surrounding area.there are no special effects to speak of(other than the fog itself, which glows eerily)but this movie doesn't require any.nor will you find an abundance of gore, as is sadly the case with most so called horror movies made today.it relies on good old fashioned chills and thrills and succeeds admirably.but the best thing"the fog" has going for it is adrienne barbeau. who plays stevie wayne, dj and owner of her own radio station on the bay.that husky, smooth sultry voice gets me every time and is absolutely perfect for this movie.of course we do get to see her too,(alas with clothes on) which is also awesome.all in all a great movie,which unfortunately was remade into a not so great movie.skip the remake.stick with the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Carpenter horror yarn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE FOG (1980) **1/2 Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, Hal Holbrook, Tom Atkins, John Houseman. Sometimes scary-in-the-right places horror yarn about a sleepy seacoast town celebrating its 150th anniversary only to be hindered by a mysterious fog containing vengeance seeking pirate ghosts with surprisingly little gore. Atmospheric with a nice touch of having heroine Barbeau as a radio station manager/dj sequestered in a lighthouse and being trapped in the oncoming horror. Directed by horror meister John Carpenter (who has a blink-and-you'll miss cameo at the film's beginning) with an asterisk notably for uniting real-life daughter/mother scream team Curtis and Leigh ("Halloween" and "Psycho") covering two generations of thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's 1980 film 'The Fog' is a campfire ghost story put to film. It is one of the classics of the ghost story genre and is well-liked by Carpenter's fans. The film itself has a very nice soundtrack produced by Mr. Carpenter himself, and the story is as I've stated before, very interesting. The Fog focuses not on a main character but, a group of central characters whose individual experiences during this supernatural crisis bring them slowly all together for it's tense and creepy final act set in the town church. A good cast, including Jaime Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth, Tom Atkins as local fisherman Nick, Janet Leigh as centennial chairwoman Kathy Williams and Adrienne Barbeau as single mom and radio DJ Stevie Wayne, give life to this ensemble and make them characters we like and care about so, we fear for them when they are placed in harm's way. Add to that Hal Holbrook as the town's alcoholic priest and a host of Carpenter regulars, with even a cameo by Carpenter himself, and you have a film wonderfully filled with a variety of characters who are all potential victims for the marauding phantoms.John Carpenter (famous for his work in horror movies such as 'The Halloween' series) does a terrific job once again in creating a frightening horror movie. Even though there are some missing aspects in the movie (for example, we don't know much about Jamie Lee Curtis's character), this film maintains a creepy atmosphere throughout. The make-up for the zombie like creatures and the lighting for this movie is fantastic! Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stay away from the fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog is directed by John Carpenter,is written by Carpenter and Debra Hill, Carpenter also provides the music. The film stars Adrienne Barbeu, Hal Holbrook, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, John Houseman and Janet Leigh.This is one of Carpenter's best and scariest films in my opinion. The music conveys dread and is chilling. The fog effects are very eerie and we hardly see who or what is in the fog, which makes you even more afraid of it.The opening scene with John Houseman on the beach is one of the most chilling scenes ever and is a fantastic opening, Houseman is the perfect choice as the spooky storyteller and he has you hooked on his every word. I also wonder if it's possible that the whole film after that could perhaps be the little boys nightmare brought on by hearing the story? Antonio Bay, California in 1980. The town is celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of when it was founded. What the present day residents don't know is that their town has a dark secret that will come back to haunt everyone in it.In 1880 there were several people suffering from leprosy, one of them was a man called Blake, he brought a ship called The Elizabeth Dane and he and the others were going to sail in her and set up a leper colony on an island near Antonio Bay. Blake and the others were betrayed by those they brought the ship from when they deliberately misled the ship by lighting a huge fire on the beach which caused the ship to crash on rocks and killed everyone aboard.The ghosts of Blake and his men return from the icy depths under the cover of a mysterious fog and hunt down the descendants of the men who betrayed them.The Fog is very creepy and some of my favourite spooky moments are the massacre on the boat where we catch a glimpse of The Elizabeth Dane, the opening ghost story beach scene, the car windows mysteriously smashing and the luminous fog rolling in from the sea towards land.When people talk about Carpenter's films this one is often unfairly overshadowed by films like The Thing and Halloween and that's a shame because this is one of his best and creepiest films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Horror Movies of its era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched this again in a splendid double bill with Halloween last night!I still think The Fog is a very underrated movie. It's perhaps Carpenter's most consistent horror flick (yes, I know most people prefer The Thing) and has bags of atmosphere, suspense, and genuine menace as the leprous ghosts move into frame.Are they ghosts? It's a question worth asking, as they have physical substance - , banging on doors and committing murders galore. These shock moments are extremely well done, but it's the eerie atmosphere and splendidly menacing use of piano and synths that really make this film work. And an interesting plot and set of characters, too.The story is pretty well known at this juncture, and concerns a dark secret at the heart of a small Californian town's founding a century earlier. The main action takes place on the anniversary, and along the way we get several of the townsfolk coming to terms with what's happening; and as the fog, glowing malevolently, rolls in the fear cranks up...The setting of Antonio Bay is splendidly realised. It feels like a real town and the characters also feel like real people. This is from an era where not everyone had to look like a movie star and sport a six pack to get on screen, and it works. And those ghosts, knocking loudly at the doors of the townsfolk, are still frightening even today. Lot's of subtle references to the horror genre abound. Mr. Machen, Arkham Reef, Bodega Bay, etc. Never interferes with the story but brings a knowing smile and a nod to the horror fan.A superb film. I haven't bothered with the re-make - who needs it? Don't waste your time. Just stick with the splendid original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, atmospheric and original. An all-round classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a particular fan of John Carpenter, nor do I think that he's one of the best directors in the world. What I do think, however, is that he is very capable and that he has made some substantial achievements. Films like Halloween or The Thing are not only classics, they're milestones in movie history.The Fog fits snugly and comfortably into this category, although, admittedly, it's taken some time for it to get there. A flop when it first came out, it has gained cult status over the last 20 years or so, finally getting the recognition it deserves, and it is now regarded as one of the greatest and most original horror films ever made. Films are ultimately a matter of taste and personal preference. Some people like horror films, others don't. Some prefer blood-shed and violence and others like something a bit more subtle. Some people prefer a good script over technical wizardry, and others aren't bothered about any of this, they just want to enjoy themselves. The Fog is everything and none of these things. It is a matter of taste. It's a horror film, and was intended to be one, yet it can be watched by people who don't like horror films. It has gore in it (laughable by today's standards), is well scripted and visually quite well executed. It can also be watched by people who just want to sit back and enjoy a spooky film without having to think about it too much.All this makes The Fog essentially an average horror film, and in many ways it certainly is, but there is one thing that makes it stand out from the rest: its originality. It's the film's biggest strength and its biggest achievement resulting in a timeless quality. The idea that fog can carry an evil entity, that can appear and vanish at any time, and that you can't run away from was almost as original an idea as Dracula was in 1897. The film's originality is closely followed by a sinister and threatening atmosphere that draws you in very quickly.My feeling is that this is why it has eventually become a cult-classic. Perhaps it was a bit too avant-garde in its time, not what people wanted to see back in those days or perhaps it wasn't what people expected. Perhaps certain films take time to be appreciated and valued. Perhaps people have to learn to appreciate and value certain films. If so, I'm glad The Fog is now one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid Gothic style horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the success of Halloween John Carpenter's follow up film was another independent horror film with a more supernatural twist, The Fog.Set over the course of a day the small Californian town Antonio Bay is celebrating its centennial. But it is the day an old curse is set to affect the town with a strange green glowing fog moves towards the town at night, causing strange things such as breaking windows, cutting power and hiding ghosts. As the terror stalks the town a group of townspeople have to find out about a dark secret in the town's past.At around 86 minutes The Fog is short, fast paced little film that does not beat around the bush. The film does not stall in the mystery about why the ghosts are attacking and due to the film taking place over a day allows the events to move very quickly. We get to know the characters and they are portrayed as decent, likable people who you want to survive. Carpenter is an expert at creating an atmosphere, using shadows, dark imaginary and a Halloween style score to great effect. And the film was able to do this without showing much violence and shows that horror does not gallons of fake blood.The story itself and the characters has a Stephen King quality to it, particularly when we find out the reason behind the ghost attacks. The Fog has the small town setting and different types of characters, the single mum running a radio station, the hitchhiker girl who says bad things follow her and a clichd guilt ridden priest played excellently by Hal Holbrook.But The Fog is a film that does show its age, from the clothes the characters worn to the special effects which have aged poorly. The Fog close up is particularly poor because it was simply a smoke machine and someone flashing a touch. The green lighting effects for the long shots have dated poorly. Fortunately Carpenter was able to redeem himself by having Stan Winston do the special effects on The Thing.The Fog is effective atmosphere Gothic horror film that will easily please fans of John Carpenter. It is not the best film from Carpenter it is still a fine film when he was at the height of his powers. Even if you do not like horror films The Fog still works as a Gothic story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's something in the Fog!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was nearly a year ago since I saw Carpentar's chilling ghost story The Fog and I wondered that last night I would give it another try just for my sake to see if I really enjoyed it. My first impression seeing it was that it was a good little tale with not many scares, seeing last night, my thoughts have changed a lot! Going back through time quickly, not giving too much of the plot away, The original Fog is for starters set in the 18th century and it's about an old ship that crashed and something went wrong and now the men on board have died and their treasure is lost. Going through the year 1980 on the 21st of April the men who died will come back as haunting spirits wanting revenge on the quiet, little town Antonio Bay.Being all positive around I think the story was well done and it was clever to see a new level of fear but at the same time be scared because it lives in the dark, (very much like his film before Halloween). I also like the setting that it goes from beaches and boats and bays and it starts coming into the town and into the street.I must say that Carpentar casted really well in this film. He makes a little cameo himself at the start, we have an excellent but quite creepy priest played by Hal Holbrook. It also stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Adrienne Barbeau, Janet Leigh, Charles Cyphers &amp; Nancy Kyes also did brilliantly in their roles. All the actors achieve greatness.The most effective thing in the entire film I believe is the movement and glitteriness of the fog. It's eerie, glowing presence and creepy noises and monstrous (but not bloody) kills bring an instance into dragging you more into watching it. It also contracts along with the landscapes and it seems to be very scary.P.S: Making one little note to the remake. All of the positive stuff i have just mentioned here for the 80's version, the 2005 remake could not pull any off this stuff off.I give the original an 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful, Creepy, Scary! Another Masterpiece From The Master of Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the wonderful success of the 1978 classic "Halloween," John Carpenter and his pal, Debra Hill, decided to set up another horror movie. But this time, it would be an old-fashioned ghost story titled "The Fog." To this day, "The Fog" is one of the most impressive ghost stories ever made.Enter the nice, quiet coastal town of Antonio Bay. Today is the town's 100th anniversary. A group of residents are celebrating, including sexy radio DJ Stevie Wayne, normal local Nick Castle, the sweet hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley, and the priest Father Malone. Even though it is Antonio Bay's birthday, nothing is right. Under this celebration lies a terrible secret. And it begins to show when an ominous fog bank begins to envelop the town with terror. What is in the fog? What does it want? And can it be stopped? You can't compare "The Fog" to "Halloween" because Carpenter builds you up differently with it. Instead of evil in the form of a human being, Carpenter takes inspiration from the tales of classic horror authors, such as H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe, dealing with an otherworldly force that isn't human. This is a tale of revenge brought upon by a supernatural force that will not go away until it gets what it wants. As long as you don't compare it to "Halloween," "The Fog" is perfect.First off, the acting is rock-solid. Adrienne Barbeau("Creepshow" and "Someone's Watching Me"), gives a terrific performance as Stevie, and Jamie Lee Curtis is always a pleasure in horror, and she gives another great performance as Elizabeth. The rest of the cast is great, including Tom Atkins("Night of the Creeps," "Halloween III: Season of the Witch," and "My Bloody Valentine 3D"), Janet Leigh("Psycho"), Hal Holbrook("Creepshow"), and Nancy Loomis("Halloween").And you can't review "The Fog" without saying that John Carpenter is flawless directing this movie. He offers plenty of suspense and scares, and not too much gore, and frankly, that's how I prefer it. He did it with "Halloween," and he does it again in this movie."The Fog" still holds up 30 years later. It's still scary, creepy, and suspenseful. They didn't call John Carpenter a master of horror for nothing. If you love good, old-fashioned tales of revenge, supernatural forces, and towns struggling to survive that force, then "The Fog" is highly recommended. It's a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With some exceptions ("Rosemary's Baby", "The Omen" or "The Exorcist") I was never very fond of films that deal with devils, ghosts, demons and else. However "The Fog" is in my opinion a decent product of its kind by John Carpenter who wrote it and directed it.The story is most simple (ghosts of pirates that come out of a sinister fog seeking for revenge in contemporary days in a village by the sea) but Carpenter gets a fantastic creeping atmosphere that increases throughout the picture until the very well achieved and scary finale.Good cast also with Adrianne Barbeau, Jaime Lee Curtis, her mother Janet Leigh and John Houseman.An unpretentious but entertaining and enjoyable product for fans of the genre and not too fans like me also.

		<fullReview>This film came up on telly recently, I guess to get people in the mood to go see the remake starring Robin Tunney, I think it was. Anywho, I prefer this one because it's a classic, it was genuinely scary in the manner that those old type horror flicks were and of course it had the original scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis in it. Okay, so the premise is that the town in which the story takes place is built upon a curse, and every 100 years zombie-like ghosts seeking revenge for their wrongful deaths come back to claim victims that were directly related to the people involved in their deaths as well as anyone in general who gets in their way. It's unique because these zombies don't just breeze into town, they do so under the cover of a sinister fog that moves according to their evil plans.</fullReview>

As the plot unfolds, the lead characters (Adrienne Barbeau, and Jamie Lee Curtis) begin to find out what is behind the fog, and how to stop it.OK...so this isn't the scariest movie out there. Or the best made. Or even the best acted.Still, the movie is fun to watch and has a couple of genuinely good scares in it. The music is a tad bit over done and the cinematography is passable. If nothing else, it's a great movie to watch if you want to get a group of people together and laugh yourself silly at the mediocre acting and the somewhat cheesy special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small coastal town is preparing to celebrate its centennial when a mysterious and fog starts to roll in. At first the towns folk make nothing of it, but this peculiar fog appears to move against the wind and for some reason seems to be intent on reaching this town. What's more is that a fishing boat that was caught in the fog appears to have aged a lot and the people on board are dead or missing. As the fog begins to roll in the next night an old town secret is uncovered... and it seems to be the cause of the fog.This is essentially John Carpenter's first large scale theatrical film - $1 million in the budget department and with post-production special effects work - and it is a well executed classical horror story. A la "Halloween" there is a heavy focus on atmosphere, that eerie music Carpenter likes so much, and creepy shapes obscured in some way - either through fog or shadows. Not as good as "Halloween" or "The Thing," but it is nonetheless a good addition to Carpenter's oeuvre and if want a to see a classic campfire ghost story on screen, this is it. The film even is introduced as such. 8/10 Rated R for mostly implied, but nonetheless grim violence</fullReview>

If it is not broken don't fix it certainly applies to the lame 2005 remake! Ghostly pirates, the walking dead, a seaside town, a light-house and a tale of revenge from centuries back is the staple of this horror film. Good acting, great plot. Carpenter's music sets the scene. Adrienne Barbeau's husky-voiced disc jockey is a seminal 1980s moment. Selma Blair could not hope to compete with that voice... See the original; skip the remake. Alcoholic priests, sexy hitch-hikers and prim secretaries are a welcome addition to the usual horror movie staple characters. There is a pressing sense of urgency about the films; Barbeau's voice directing and warning about "Thge Fog" from her so-called safe place in the lonely light-house. Memorable.There is even an old man who sets the scene with a typical camp-fire tale of terror and acts effectively as a good wrap-around case to the projected scenario...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must have scared the eighties into shock!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter, especially back when he started out, was a brilliant director and the father of slasher flicks hands down. He established the career of Jamie Lee Curtis as a scream queen, and he knew how to shock movie goers and make them shiver with fear. His compositions of music (specifically the Halloween theme) is some of the most frightening pieces of music in film history. He acts, composes, produces, directs...and does it brilliantly. The Fog came shortly after the enormous success of Halloween. It reeks of the Carpenter/Debra Hill style which is a very good thing as they were at the top of their horror game after Halloween. The Fog is very different from the previous horror film though. The Fog is very much a ghost story about vengeance as a crew of a wronged and robbed ship comes back 100 years later to exact revenge on the ancestors of the village people who wronged them.The film has to be looked at from two points of view, one of them being what it would have been like to sit in the theater thirty years ago and watch The Fog. It would have been brutally violent, shocking even, with it's rather bloodless but still violent death scenes. The intensely suspenseful atmosphere, and intense serious characters would have had everyone on the edge of their seat. Does some of this transfer over into the point of view of the movie goer now?? Absolutely!! The film is still suspense filled beginning to end. The mysterious Fog is thick and frightening and it's still edge of your seat. John Carpenter is also the master of cheap scares (the kind of sudden noises and events that make you jump) which The Fog is full of. When you're that much on the edge of your seat in the silent Fog you can't help but jump. The cast of The Fog is so well done and everyone does an amazing job. He put together a cast of some former Halloween cast mates and also some great character actors from the time. John Carpenter's wife at the time, and infamous Broadway actress Adrienne Barbeau does a great job as Stevie, the radio DJ who is first to lock on to the horrible secret of The Fog and tries to save her son and everyone else from her lighthouse post. Her intensity and seriousness is great and she doesn't have a lot of the setting to work with. Jamie Lee Curtis is still great as she continues to establish her status. This character is a complete 360 change from Laurie Strode in Halloween. She's much more forceful and independent. Unfortunately her character starts out this way but then kind of gets lost in everyone else and she's just kind of there. Tom Atkins plays lead actor Nick Castle. He's a pretty typical horror hero. Strong, good looking, very male...but his character is much more subtly used as well. All the characters possibly with the exception of Stevie (Adrienne Barbeau) aren't really the focus but instead are just all used equally. Perhaps that's why Adrienne Barbeau got lead credits.The Fog is suspenseful and scary and gory with it's kills. It was done with such a low budget, as was Halloween, but you'd never know it in a million years. If you really watch the film you'll see the corners they cut and the movie magic they used but otherwise you'd think it was a big budget product. The film does not have a lot of depth, that's my only complaint. Halloween opens up this deep and important story and history that was able to continue for many, many films but The Fog is pretty cut and dry so it relies on the cast, and the suspense to be interesting and obviously it accomplishes that. I am sitting in intense anticipation for the remake which I am a little afraid as to how much they will "PG" it down which seems to be the way nowadays but I still think it will be great and you must see this original horror classic before you see the remake. Check it out!! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>haven't seen the 2005 version, but i'm pretty sure this kicks its ass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd been catching glimpses of this movie on late night cable for years before I finally broke down and rented the DVD. Definitely worth the rental if you're a fan of horror genre films.The storyline is simple and that works to its benefit, allowing the viewer to fill in the creepy details in many of the scenes. Also the production value is surprisingly good in this film... extremely strong cinematography and sound design. Like most of Carpenter's other films, the weakness comes in his inability to generate good performances from his actors. But it's a horror movie, so the B grade acting doesn't take away any of the enjoyment.Overall, if you are interested in seeing the new version that's being advertised on TV right now, I suggest that you save yourself some money and rent this instead. The new version will undoubtedly be a smelly cloud of flatulence compared to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a great horror movie. Carpenter is a master at this craft. He didn't waste time making bloody scenes or goofy-looking evil guys in this film. He just used fog and a few silhouetted killers. This is a great example of a horror movie. Back when they realized blood and guts aren't scary, and silent killers you rarely get to see are much scarier than annoying killers who give speeches at the end of the movie. I won't go into detail on the plot. It's basically an eerie fog that sets on a town and the killing begins! This film resists all the temptations to overdo it. There is also an awesome ending. If you haven't seen it, go rent it, now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More oriented Sci-Fi movie that works in the Horror genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Fog" is an interesting movie that stands out from the Horror genre for it's originality, clever script, and tense atmosphere. The movie provokes different emotions because it's something you haven't seen before in the genre. Even though that Carpenter's film is more Sci-Fi oriented, it delivers some truly frightening and tense moments that make it fit into the Horror genre. The story is as original as you can get. It's clever, scary, and sets you in a world of fear, fantasy, and tension. I really praise Mr. Carpenter for creating a story that involves fictional history facts, a tale about revenge, and a feeling of adventure through the movie.The settings are impressive, and that's the main reason to watch the movie on DVD. The settings of the movie are beautifully dark, and when the fog appears the movie really looks creepy. Carpenter's camera angles are stunning, perfect if you say. From the beginning you know that you're watching a perfectly directed movie. The movie's only weakness in my opinion, is it's slow development. It doesn't takes too long before a jump-out of your scene, or a death scene but some scenes steal some dynamic. That's just my opinion.The acting is excellent. Barbeau gives the best performance in the movie and that's a lot to say because a very hot Jamie Lee Curtis gives a great performance also. The rest of the cast is fine and take their roles seriously. Janet Leigh is a delight to watch as always. I really enjoy when I get to care about the characters of a movie and this happens in "The Fog". The elegant and well structured character development in the movie make it a different experience. The score is good as in every John Carpenter movie. Maybe it's me, but it's very similar to Halloween's."The Fog" delivers expectations and has some impressive scenes in the genre. The ending is chilling and satisfactory. The church attack is magnificent. The scenes where the fog "attacks" the residents of Antonio Bay are stuff for legend. The movie also has some gore , not to satisfy gore hounds but works for the movie. I would recommend this movie to any Horror fan even that it's not a 100% Horror movie. "The Fog" is a classic and a must see. Probably not Carpenter's best (depending on opinions) but still a creepy, intelligent, and visually stunning movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog is probably John Carpenters best movie, besides Halloween. This movie has a very unique story that will keep you wanting to watch and find out what happens next. The story is about a ship that crashed while in a mysterious fog on April 21st at midnight. The story takes place 100 years later in a town by the beach. The fog mysteriously returns at midnight and reeks havoc among the town. The members of the ship that crashed kill violently with no mercy. No one in the town is safe. You later find out that the ship crashing was no accident. There is a murder plot in all of this. If your a fan of John Carpenter then this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter is the "Everyman's" film maker. The stuff he shoots is not overly complex and it's frightening. Case closed. He's good! I recall sneaking into the next theater after we walked out of the end of another movie just to see what it was. In short, what was supposed to be a quick peek had me riveted to my chair and scared. No movie since has done that. I recall reading that the box office receipts were better than expected for Mr. Carpenter. Not a surprise. Yes, there are hundreds of slasher flix out there and better scripts but when you mix fog, a lighthouse, A hot DJ, wet pirates and Hal Holbrook's mustache you get a campy and very scary movie. I couldn't say exactly what draws me to this picture other than "It's Eerie". And the Eerieness never lets up. The soundtrack has a lot to do with this. It's perfect. Since its release I've liked it so much that in November of 2003 while visiting a relative in the Bay Area of California, the wife and I rented a car and drove through Marin County to Inverness and Point Reyes Station where most of the land shots in The Fog were filmed. The lighthouse out at the point is just as it's seen in the movie and it was cool how a familiar piece of land or a boat dock from the film just jumped out at you as you drove by! Most of the area hasn't been touched in 25 years. Even the red rusty Crosses that are seen lining the drive up to the old church are there! A bit faded but still standing. I was disappointed not to see the actual church at the top of the hill. Later I found out the church was located at a separate location in Southern CA. Anyway, enjoy the film. The bigger the screen and the dimmer the lights make this one come alive!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter as we know can make a film, no doubt about that, but his skills as a writer as well are nothing short of phenomenal. The Fog is a story about an old fishing town called Antonio Bay, swamped with a dark secret that will eventually come back to haunt them...literally. 100 years ago...6 conspirators who disliked the notion of a leper colony only a mile or so away premeditated the death of Blake...a leper himself. Drifting through on an old clipper ship, the lepers were stranded in an opaque fog that unexpectedly rolled in. This fog inadvertently aided the conspirators into crashing their ship into rocks. Taking Blake's gold, Father Malone, an ancestor to a conspirator soon realises that Blake has returned from his watery grave to seek revenge on those who caused his death. Stunning Carpenter film that can certainly be up there as one of the best horror movies ever made, nothing before it has been done like this and it far deserves a better rating than 6 stars...out of ten...******** out of ten!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lighthouses are just plain scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of my favourite horror films of all time.'The Fog', one of John Carpenter's films from what many regard as his golden era, takes a simple, run of the mill ghost story about 'wronged' leprosy sufferers seeking revenge from beyond their watery grave and sticks the tension levels up from the first scene.From the intro with the old sailor telling a ghost story on the beach to all the children, to the 'shock, didn't see it coming ending', this film pushes all the right buttons.To be honest, what I really like about this film, and let this be a lesson to many other present day horror makers, is the way that from the moment the film rolls to the final moments in the film it does not let-up. Whereas many films slowly build to a shocking finale this starts with it (the scene on the boat), it also manages to keep shocking you with minor scares all the way through the film, and doing this without showing any red stuff whatsoever (a classic Carpenter trait). Plus the semi-narrative from Stevie in the lighthouse as the Fog creeps into Antonio Bay was and still is a fantastic way of building the terror.It also has a great deal of thought put into the film with lots of intertwining stories that Carpenter manages to link together in the final 10 minutes.Jamie Lee is as good a scream queen as ever and while the rest of the cast is strong it is the radio DJ Stevie Wayne, played by Adrienne Barbeau who catches the eye.Plus the Carpenter score, as always, is fabulous.If only JC could go back to what made him great in the first place...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cold and Creepy Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the first horror movies I remember watching as a child, along with "The Shining" and "The Exorcist." However, "The Fog" did what those two movies could not - it was the first time I had experienced the enjoyment of being frightened. It was an amazing, fun feeling I hadn't known existed. Always before, I'd either been scared to the point of nightmares or bored half to death. The Fog was my first "rollercoaster" movie; it scared me so badly that I couldn't wait for the next scary scene!Shot up in beautiful Point Reyes California, "The Fog" lives up to its name. There are lots of lovely shots of the misty coastline, the cold, salty fishing town and the ghostly, lonely sound of foghorns. This is a true Northern California beach, where there are no bikinis or suntan lotion, but lots of layers of sweaters and a ceaseless, chilling wind. It's a peaceful, isolated town where nothing much ever happens...until one dark night, on the eve of the towns 100th anniversary.The opening scene sets the mood for the rest of the film, as crusty old sea captain John Houseman tells the village children the spooky story of the Elizabeth Dane, the ship which crashed upon the rocky shore 100 years ago, a wreck that no man on board survived. In almost no time at all, the children's ghost story comes to life, and the rotting remains of the sailors who died upon the Dane now rise up from their watery graves to take revenge upon the town. Seems Mr. Houseman either left out some important details or hadn't been informed of them: the ships crew were lepers, and they had been murdered by the founding fathers of the now 100 year old town, their gold (with which they hoped to build a leper colony and live in peace) stolen from them.Jamie Lee Curtis is here, displaying all of her scream queen talents. Her real life mother, Janet Leigh, is also here, playing a high strung but likable town official. Nancy Loomis is very funny as the deadpan assistant to Ms. Leigh. And, of course, Adrienne Barbeau is also here in the role of the strong-willed, no nonsense DJ for the towns only radio station. Hal Holbrook turns up as a drunken priest who really gets into his role of Town Martyr. This film is still effective. There's actually very little gore and most of the violence is suggested, which makes it somehow scarier. The leper ghosts are almost secondary monsters. The real menace is the Fog itself as it materializes out of nowhere, rolls silently over the hills, covering everything like a cold, white blanket and glowing malignantly. The Fog is definitely one of the main characters, and is used to its full potential. Also very creepy are the shots of the rotting ship with the torn sails floating silently by in the foggy night, and a board with the word DANE carved upon it, which suddenly begins to "bleed" seawater whilst a deep and demonic voice quotes from Coleridge's epic (and very spooky) poem "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner." By the time the ghosts actually make their appearance in all of their zombie-ish, seaweed draped, slimy glory, you're already effectively freaked out.This is a great movie to watch on a dark and stormy night...or even a bright and sunny day. It's still scary even 20+ years later. One of Carpenters best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conventional Carpenter offering. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter openly admitted in an interview at the NFT in the early 1990's that when he saw the first married cut of THE FOG, he felt it didn't work. Nicknamed FOGOWEEN by crew members, according to production designer Tommy Lee Wallace just before it's release in 1980, this is more suggestive of a Hammer and early Universal horror than an 80's stalk and slash.Still, as a long-time Carpenter fan, THE FOG is a movie that I have a soft spot for. There are some neat scares throughout and the myth of the boat that got lost in fog and caused the sailors on board to drown, only to come back on the 100th anniversary of their town's birthday to 'celebrate' is eerie.It was the first Carpenter film I saw after HALLOWEEN scared the hell out of me in early 1982 (the film premiered on BBC television over Christmas 1982) and the anticipation of the shocks and scares in that film whetted my appetite. Favourite moment - the grandmother who answers the front door.....Inevitably, the climax of the film seems a little damp, with very little logic in it's heart, but the atmosphere and suspense elsewhere in the film make for a passable hour and a half.A cult horror favourite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the Fog Rolled In...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog is absolutely my favorite "ghost" story ever! It is another classic served up by the master of horror, John Carpenter (Halloween, The Thing, Prince of Darkness). The story centers around the seaside town of Antonio Bay, where they are beginning preparations for the celebration of the town's 100th birthday. As the story unravels, the mystery surrounding the town's origins are revealed. They have something to do with the mysterious glowing fog that has rolled into town, as well as deceit, murder, and revenge. You'll have to see the movie for yourself to learn the answers! What really sets this one apart is the eerie atmosphere and the sense of the unknown that befalls each victim of the Fog, as well as the creepy score. Some top notch scream queens also grace the screen in this picture, including Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween), Janet Leigh, and Adrienne Barbeau. Other notable actors include John Houseman, Hal Holbrook, and Tom Atkins (before he was dead set on stopping the production of Silver Shamrock Halloween masks). Nancy Kyes also has a role in this film as yet another link to the Halloween franchise. This is probably the most perfect movie to watch during a thunderstorm with no lights on. Watch it alone...if you dare!</fullReview>

The mood settings are perfect for a horror (fog) movie, the beach town, the lighthouse and so on, I love the scene at the beginning of the movie when it shows the bay from the mountain side with the wind effects, the glowing fog is fantastic, but what I loved best about this movie is the ghost knocking on the door, I would definitely freak out at midnight if someone (or something) knocked on my door with a fish cutter (meat hook).

		<fullReview>Modern filmmaking's greatest asset, John Carpenter, delivers the goods with this chilling 1980 ghost story. What sets this film apart from other imitations is its classy cinematography and witty dialogue. The film's structure is setup similar to the fog that it tries to recreate. The movie moves at an ominous and creeping pace, taking its time to drift into the viewer's subconscious. The fog thus becomes a scary and lurking character, thanks to Carpenter's assured direction and Dean Cundey's meticulous lighting.This is not a film for those viewers raised with movies like Scream and XXX; rent a Freddie Prinze Jr. film instead. This is a film for the thinking viewer, one who likes to be scared in style. Like a ghost story, the effectiveness lies not in the outcomes of the characters, but in the build up of tension. Carpenter offers a few jolts along the way, but this is a film like the original Nosferatu, in that it becomes so effective because of its slow and forboding pacing.What also makes this film a horror classic is the usual stellar cast that composes Carpenter's films. In this one there is Curtis, Leigh, Barbeau, "Assault on Precinct 13"'s Darwin Joston, Tom Atkins and even the director himself. The actors make the most of Carpenter's witty and at times self-referential dialogue, and really compliment the class of Cundey's photography.The patient and knowledgable viewer is bound to love this film for its stylish photography and genuine suspense. The story is literate, and the performances memorable. Fear stems from the unknown, from the unseeable, and Carpenter knows this. His fog is a character scarier than Jason, Michael or Freddy, one that truly cannot be stopped. Watch this film, you won't regret it. But as applicable to all Carpenter films, if you don't see this in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio (included on the Laserdisc and DVDs) then don't watch it at all.</fullReview>

Carpenter's score perfectly sets the mood, showing that Carpenter is just as talented a film composer as he is a director. As with Carpenter's other best work, he also provides characters that the audience can actually care about rather than the one-dimensional screamers and victims of so many inferior horror films.For best effect, watch this movie with the lights off.

		<shortDescription>Another form of horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When John Carpenter finished his classic, Halloween, he began shooting The Fog (1980) as "another form of horror film." He also recycled many of the actors. This flick stars both Jamie Lee Curtis and Nancy Loomis from Halloween, Janet Leigh (Psycho) and several other all-star actors and actresses. This movie was a bit talky for our liking (after all, making a film as good as the original Halloween is almost impossible) but an enjoyable romp nonetheless. A small California costal town is terrorized by a fogbank and the curse of a hundred-year-old shipwreck. The "fog killers" are chilling and almost resemble a "Hellraiser" atmosphere. Simple but effective. This 91 minute classic is a bit dated but a must-have for collectors of horror films and is now out of print.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this on television a couple of Halloween's ago, and I was very frightened. John Carpenter does it again. From the very opening where a sailor tells kids the tale of a lost ship around a camp fire, to the dreaded ending, it keeps you locked onto the screen. The music yet again sets the mood (just as it did in Halloween), and is very creepy and sends tingles down your spine. I like how the movie immediately opens with a creepy, atmospheric scene and doesn't bother explaining why these things are happening or how, and THEN the suspense comes. No, this movie opens with suspense, and ends with suspense. And the ending is very dreadful, yet a good ending nonetheless. I like how five sequels didn't follow this, and it just leaves it to your imagination on what else happens after the ending. I recommend this film! ***** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's classic story of vengeful ghosts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my all time favorite horrors and one of my favorite John Carpenter flicks, in fact, since I was too young to see Halloween when it came out, this was the first Carpenter film I saw in a theater and the flick that started me on my love of his movies. The Fog tells the story of the 100 year anniversary of the small coastal California town of Antonio Bay and as the town prepares for it's centennial celebration, a dark secret is revealed. Legend has it a leper colony paid the founders of Antonio Bay a lot of gold to let them settle nearby but, they were betrayed and murdered as their ship was lured into the rocks to crash and sink. All were lost but, now a horde of vengeful spirits returns from the sea, wrapped in a surreal fog, to make the descendants of those who wronged them pay with their lives. The Fog focuses not on a main character but, a group of central characters whose individual experiences during this supernatural crisis bring them slowly all together for it's tense and creepy final act set in the town church. A good cast, including Jaime Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth, Tom Atkins as local fisherman Nick, Janet Leigh as centennial chairwoman Kathy WIlliams and Adrienne Barbeau as single mom and radio DJ Stevie Wayne, give life to this ensemble and make them characters we like and care about so, we fear for them when they are placed in harm's way. Add to that Hal Holbrook as the town's alcoholic priest and a host of Carpenter regulars, with even a cameo by Carpenter himself, and you have a film wonderfully filled with a variety of characters who are all potential victims for the marauding phantoms. And as for those phantoms, lets not forget to mention the ghostly Captain Blake (FX man Rob Bottin) and his vengeful crew who are portrayed with practical FX which makes them quite spooky and gives them a heavy dose of menace and a lot of effectiveness when they are on the attack. There is loads of atmosphere and some very solid scares and suspense created by Carpenter, along with some great cinematography from frequent Carpenter collaborator Dean Cundey, which makes this a good, solid, old fashioned ghost story and a fun Halloween treat. And Carpenter again delivers a score which adds chills and foreboding to his tale of ghostly revenge much like he did for Halloween and he starts the film off perfectly with a chillingly fun opening sequence with veteran John Houseman as a crusty sailor who likes to tell kids scary stories. It sets the mood for the thrills and chills yet to come. Made back when there was no phoney CGI, just solid make up effects from master Rob Bottin (who went on to do The Thing's FX for Carpenter) and some very basic down to earth smoke and mirrors style visuals that are as beautiful as they are scary. A great flick the likes of which they rarely make anymore. One of my must watch flicks during the Halloween season!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In it's initial release, I recall John Carpenter's THE FOG(1980) being not so popular and panned as being a rather slow, boring ghost story. But now, over 30 years later, this film seems to have gained a lot of momentum and is seen and respected as one of Carpenter's better films. I'm definitely in the contingent that likes this movie a lot! Maybe, at the time, there really wasn't another movie quite like this one, so audiences didn't know what to make of it. Perhaps they wanted another Michael Myers type killer, like in Carpenter's Halloween movies.THE FOG is really an old-fashioned, simple horror tale about a small, seaside fishing town celebrating it's centennial. The film boasts a spooky, creepy atmosphere throughout it's run and it is all set up by a wonderful opening sequence of an old fisherman (the reliable thespian John Houseman) on the eve of the 100-year celebration relaying a spooky story of town's inception. It so happens that the formation of the town itself was done by ill-gotten gains as, in 1880, a group of pillagers coaxed a ship carrying a lot of wealth into crashing, killing all of the crew. The ghosts of the ship's crew have returned 100 years later to avenge their deaths by killing the descendants of their murderers.The film boasts an extremely solid and reliable cast, including horror movie icons Jamie Lee Curtis (of Carpenter's Halloween films), her real-life mom Janet Leigh (of the great film Psycho), Tom Atkins (of the not-directed-by-Carpenter Halloween 3 and the cult 80s horror classic Night of the Creeps), and Nancy Loomis (of Halloweens 1, 2, and 3). In addition to the horror stars, THE FOG also contains a pair of famous non-horror actors, who I think actually steal the movie: Hal Holbrook as the shady town priest (who knows more than he's letting on) and an extremely luscious Adrienne Barbeau (she certainly ain't Maude's daughter in this one!) as a disc jockey at the town's radio station, which is occupied in a lighthouse, prominently featured throughout the movie.The aforementioned female cast members are absolute stunners in this! Curtis looks completely different from her look in the Halloween movies. In those films, she looked so innocent and drab, while in this one, she wears a lot more makeup and is much sexier. This movie really set the stage for the look she would sport throughout many of her 80s movies. Even at this stage of her career, a literal 20 years removed from Psycho, Leigh still looks fantastic and gives her daughter a run! Loomis looks her absolute best in this movie, sporting a sexy-mature look (amazing how much different she looked in this than in any of the Halloween movies). And what more can I say about Barbeau! She is positively gorgeous in this movie (never looked better before or since, frankly!).While the movie moves at a slow, leisurely pace, it makes it all the more creepy and sucks the viewer into the plot. The "Fog" itself is a very ominous, intimidating, and scary presence. Even though a healthy amount of scenes take place in the daytime, they manage to be spooky mainly because Carpenter injects scenes with engrossing dialogs of characters like Leigh and Holbrook, long-time residents of the town, who know of the fabled, infamous history of it's formation. As the "Fog" claims each one of it's victims, the tension mounts, leading to an intriguing climax, with an ending that is precursor to many of the ones that we typically get in virtually every horror movie under the sun now. But without the ending that we got, I'd actually feel somewhat cheated. THE FOG is definitely a John Carpenter keeper!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fog is one of carpenter's masterpieces, and truly deserves it. It's intense, scary, it creates a great atmosphere of tension. All of the movie is conceived in order to get the public inside it. The film delivers that. We can feel the fog approach us, and we won't see it the same way after we watch this. It's a simple horror tale well crafted, and very accurate. It has its flaws (jamie lee curtis character was disposable, and i would like to see more people scared about the fog) but for me they're only tiny tiny problems.plus, this is a film about colonialism, conquering land at all costs, betrayal,hate and revenge. The Americans may think about slavery, when they tried to control people just because they could. we, europeans,think about the same, but also about how our countries were formed, and how we obliged so many African tribes to form so many fake republics. maybe one they a fog would come and revenge on us. I don't know, but this film made me believe that could be possible. Pure cinema magic, a masterpiece of terror and suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Attack of the Very Patient Ghosts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am glad that we finally have ghosts that aren't totally aimless and random in their killing sprees. Usually they are portrayed as rather goofy, confused aggressors who just slash and slice anything that comes their way.However, there is just one little catch: why didn't these ghosts resurrect much earlier, so they could butcher the actual perpetrators of the 100 year-old crime, rather than taking it out on some meaningless 3rd-generation offspring who haven't a clue about what the hell is going on? And why this obsession with round numbers? Why not rise up out of the fog after 83 years 4 months and 35 days, why after exactly 100 years? How I love horror film "logic".They could have risen at the 10th anniversary of the massacre, for example. That way they could have found nearly all of the guilty ones, AND it's a nice round anniversary-worthy number. Everyone wins. The ghosts get their revenge, the offspring don't get butchered (well, they don't get born in the first place, actually, ehem) and justice is done.I'd like to also know what exactly it is that ex-lepers-but-now-sea/fog-ghosts do for an entire 100 years while they wait for revenge. Do they pester their leader to move the Revenge Date a few decades earlier? Do they play chess, or do they just stare into dolphins and squid all day? TF is done with a certain degree of style, typical of the late 70s and early 80s, which is why it isn't boring in spite of the rather slow pace.Why does everyone open the door when they hear ominous-sounding loud knocking after midnight? Why does Carpenter cast two uglies such as Janet Leigh (looking more dried-up and corpsy than the ghosts even), and her awful amateur daughter Jamie Lee? Watching Jamie Lee kiss gave me a big shudder, much more eerie than the most brutal murder committed by the ex-lepers. Carpenter hates beauty, that must be it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some centennial pirate ghosts terrifying and frightening a modern-day fishing little town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superior version from John Carpenter and Debra Hill (Carpenter's wife and producer) story with believable casting and astonishing scenes that occur on a California coastal little town threatened by a hundred-year-old shipwreck and subsequently horrifying people . This is a grade-A chiller based on writing credits by Carpenter and Hill and quotation by Edgar Allan Poe , it concerns about a centennial seaside village of Antonio Bay , California . The sleepy and cursed location was built by the founders over the victims of a horrible crime . Nowadays some Zombies like ghost-pirates are seeking vendetta for their deaths and are returning to revenge themselves on the town inhabitants which stole them their gold these hundred years before and they claim retribution . Undercover of the fog they carry out their vicious attacks , murders and mayhem against the residents( the priest Hal Holbrook , the Mayor Janet Leigh, Charles Cyphers, Nancy Loomis). A young girl (Janet Lee Curtis) with similar name to the ghost ship, Elizabeth Dane, and her boyfriend (Tom Atkins)confront against the vengeful ghosts and a radio commentator (role of Adrienne Barbeau who subsequently married John Carpenter) tries to salve her son.The picture contains suspense, horror, chills, scabrous killings , shocks and there's plenty of blood and guts . The movie takes accent as suspense well as fantasy with the fog apparition. This splendid original film is stylishly made displaying an intelligent treatment with magnificent actors and acceptable special effects . The main casting is pretty good as Jamie Lee Curtis , Adrienne Barbeau and Tom Atkins and the supporting cast are frankly well as Hal Holbrook , Janet Leigh and George Buck Flower , among others. Gore and violence abound including decent scares with tense horror sequences . The grisly murders are scary and creepy ; as the ghosts execute a real massacre with nauseating and gruesome assassinations by hooks , knifes or cleaver. Eerie and frightening musical score is composed by means of electronic realization by the same John Carpenter . Director John Carpenter is in familiar ground with this well-done tale about eerie phantoms of eighteenth-century back from the dead . The film was realized during his best period in the 70s and 8os when he directed classics as Halloween, Christine, Big trouble in little China, They live, 1997 escape from N.Y .and The thing . It's recently (2005)remade by Rupert Wainwhright (Stigmata) with Tom Welling , Maggie Grace ,Selma Blair, Sara Bostford , Kenneth Welsh and was also produced by Debra Hill(recently deceased) and Carpenter and resulted to be a formulaic and regular attempt to cash in on the success of original and superior The Fog. The movie will appeal to terror fans but contains a roller-coaster dark suspense and disturbing fear .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic, pulpy horror story that doesn't fail to please at all. The special effects are really well done, especially for the time period in which it was made. John Carpenter's genius shines through, and instead of a low budget slasher flick, we're given genius moments like the first kill scene - observe the lack of music making it seem even more cold and distant - and the utilization of the radio host throughout, not to mention the bone-chilling final scene. Jamie Lee Curtis is sexy and mysterious, captivating the eye immediately, and John Houseman and Adrienne Barbeau both put on great performances as well. Sure, at times you can predict what will happen next, but that doesn't tarnish this great movie one bit. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts off with an eerie campfire story and lives up to the darkness described in the old sailor's tale. It's creepy without unnecessary computerized gimmicks and tricks. There are few horror movies, in my opinion, that can manage to be truly scary without computer effects and gore, and this is one of them. If you haven't watched The Fog, do yourself a favor nd go pick this one up. If you're into computer tricks, the newer version is decent, but this one is just as scary--if not more--and relied on real, in-the-flesh work to accomplish that task. My favorite parts are the campfire story, and the scene at the radio station with the piece of driftwood. Eerie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a horror movie which has aged very well. The Fog is very unique in that it is a wolf in sheep's clothing so to speak. You wouldn't expect it to be all that spooky, but after watching it, you realize "wow, that was frightening!" The Fog didn't need cheesy action to make it good, stupid CG to make it spooky, or big name actors to make it authentic. The actors were all very good, Not a single one to complain about. Unique characters and a different kind of setting made this movie truly special. The only bad thing is, some parts seemed a little dragged on. However, do not let that stop you from watching this. I give this movie 8/10. If you are looking for a good classic horror movie, check out The Fog.

		<fullReview>The quiet Californian seaside town of Antonia bay is celebrating their 100th anniversary, but also it's the anniversary of a terrible shipwreck. A local priest discovers a diary of their ancestors that hides a horrible secret that they were involved in the wreck. Through this, a couple of the towns' folk realise they're cursed and the unnatural, glowing fog hides the ghosts of the lepers mariners seeking revenge.The guy who brought us the highly influential and smash hit "Halloween" returns to the game with more rarefied horror in the minor 80's ghost film "The Fog". After being somewhat underwhelmed by its plainness with my first viewing, I was hoping things would change when I took my second chance with it. I seemed to like it more this time around, but while it's creepy atmosphere and stinging score blankets the screen; I found the pacing to be too stodgy to rally up any sort of intensity or even a sense of real urgency from this horrific ordeal. It's a slow burn tale that builds slowly to its harrowing final outcome and there are well-timed shocks effectively tucked in by director John Carpenter. The potent premise is a straightforward ghost tale and while it's an intriguing set-up that takes hold early on with many bone-rattling occurrences, it gets a little wayward in some staged scenes and trumps in with a few distracting plot holes in the latter end.Solidly poised direction by Carpenter redeems those blights with strikingly impulsive visuals and haunting set pieces of our uneasiness of just what is lurking in the unknown. There's a good choice of location and Dean Cundey's sinuous cinematography is beautifully balanced out. The make-up of the restless ghosts have a freaky awe about them when sited with their glowing red eyes and pasty appearance.A fine committed cast is on hand and it's filled with Carpenter regulars. Even with the likes of Tom Atkins, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, Adrienne Barbeau, Hal Holbrook, Nancy Loomis, Charles Cyphers and John Houseman. They are nothing, but your stock characters that make no more than a little dent in the surface. Carpenter stacks them up one on top of each in the story. The gorgeous Curtis is wasted in a small role, but the silky voiced radio DJ played by Barbeau, Leigh's rosy parade organiser and the rigid father performed by Holbrook gave the flick some added life.Watch the fog slowly roll in, within this subtly modest (if undervalued) effort by Carpenter.</fullReview>

Eerie lights, dark figures, and the masts of an ancient schooner appear in the swirling mists. Using knife, hook and sword, they exact revenge on the townsfolk for the sins that the town's founding fathers committed 100 years ago.Audio/Video: Excellent transfer from VHS to DVD. All of the dark areas are visible in the DVD, but not on the old VHS.Extras: The Fog documentary, outtakes, photo gallery, audio commentary from John Carpenter and Debra Hill.Final Thoughts: This movie is excellent. Most of the cast is from my favorite horror movie of all time Halloween. The Fog is a chilling ghost story. I heard the remake sucks, but I will have to see it before I judge. Buy The Fog on DVD, because the special features are fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, this movie can't really be called the best horror movie of all time, but it has a lot of the great aspects that make it a classic John Carpenter film. The music, the actors, the feel of it. It's all great.The Fog is about a small town that, 100 years after a boat full of lepers were killed off the shore, is overtaken by a strange fog. Turns out that the ghosts of the lepers are back for revenge. This movie is really well done. The ghosts are creepy, and it has a really good ending.I bought this film on a whim. I'd never seen it before, and I bought it so I could compare it with the new remake, which was awful by the way. I'm really glad I own it now though. It's a true 80's horror classic.

		<fullReview>The Fog is a gem in movie land. A near perfect visual telling of a classic style ghost story. I enjoy the fact that there are not overt sexual references (all of it is done subtly) which for the time was very rare. Although there is violence, I still will let my kids watch this movie with me. This movie reminds me of the story by Washington Irving "the Legend of Sleepy Hallow" A ghost is coming back to take those who happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. The people of Antonio Bay that get killed may not have any link to the ones doing the killing except Father Malone. Father Malone at least had the honour to stand up for his Grandfathers sins and took his punishment, although I think the honest gesture should have been enough. I love a good scare. The remake worries me. I am not sure you can improve on it. Has Hollywood run out of ideas I mean there are about a dozen remakes or movies from TV shows this year</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Fog is great little horror film about a small coastal town that has kept a terrible secret for a hundred years and is in for a nasty treat. The film starts out with Carpenter's trademark music, one of his best scores ever I met add. The movie's creepy atmosphere overwhelms the film's small flaws and acting in this film is above par for most horror films. Jaime Lee Curtis's acting ability did improve greatly since Halloween.The best attribute to this film is it's plot and pacing. The story is very simple and straight forward and it never seems rushed or dragging. The effects in the good but they mostly stand out the best in the ending. If you are looking for a good horror/thriller movie look no farther. The only problem with this movie is that you are leave wanting more, but I feel the director didn't want to overkill anything and you can see why when you see The Fog.</fullReview>

The show started off pretty in a subtle mood not giving off too much suspense.But as soon as the first body was discovered on that boat everything else seemed to slowly seep in. The suspense soon evolved into a hair-raising horror when the fog appeared and it engulfed the whole town.I was shocked out of my wits when those phantom figures appeared. If that was creepy enough, check out those glowing eyes. I mean just imagine staying home alone in the middle of the night and suddenly a pair of eyes appeared in front of you.

		<shortDescription>Superior supernatural horror shocker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The vengeful ghosts of a bunch of slain lepers return shrouded in a lethal unearthly fog to avenge their untimely deaths on the 100th anniversary of a small seaside California town. Director/co-writer John Carpenter does his customary masterful job of carefully crafting and sustaining a powerfully brooding gloom-doom atmosphere of pure fleshing-crawling dread and fear; Carpenter's simple straightforward style keeps things classy and absorbing throughout while building the tension to a nerve-wracking fever pitch which culminates in a harrowing conclusion. Moreover, Carpenter handles the violence with admirable restraint and brings a strong near poetic quality to the opening portion of the picture (an early sequence depicting the presence of the fog upsetting the tranquility of the sleepy hamlet is especially striking). The underlying theme of revenge and past misdeeds catching up with the present gives the film an extra shattering resonance.The tip-top cast rates as another major asset: Adrienne Barbeau as sultry-voiced disc jockey Stevie Wayne, Jamie Lee Curtis as sexy rich hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley, Janet Leigh as the bitchy Kathy Williams, Tom Atkins as likable fisherman Nick Castle, Hal Holbrook as dour guilt-ridden priest Father Malone, and Charles Cyphers as amiable weatherman Dan O'Bannon. Popping up in nifty small parts are Darwin Joston (as a coroner named Dr. Phibes), the immortal George "Buck" Flower, John Goff, and Carpenter himself as a janitor. Nancy Loomis supplies a winning blend of sass and spunk as the sharp-tongued Sandy Fadel. John Houseman has a bravura cameo as crusty old sea salt Mr. Machen. The red-eyed ghosts are genuinely creepy while the glowing fog radiates a marvelously sinister quality. The remote coastal community setting projects an unsettling sense of isolation and vulnerability. Dean Cundey's sumptuous widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of stunning visuals. Carpenter's eerie score further enhances the overall spooky mood. One of Carpenter's most effective and underrated movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gimmicky horror 80s style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gimmicky and rather empty horror film that reminds me somewhat of an old 3d film in its constant need to have someone or something pointlessly coming out of the shadows. The use of Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis are two nods to horror films of the past. The music too seems at times to be a rip-off from tubular bells, the score used for the exorcist, a film which this one leans on heavily in places.There are a lot of inconsistencies and inexplicable things in the plot. At one plot a dead seaman comes back to life in the morgue (one also questions why on earth Curtis would be left alone there?), only to scribble the letter 3 near to Jamie Lee Curtis. At no other point do the victims of the fog rise again and one suspects this was merely to engage our sympathies with Jamie and have a bit of cheap suspense. Like everything else here it is largely gimmicky.Again, quite why the owner of a lighthouse, an expensive piece of real estate one imagines, spends her nights broadcasting a radio show is not explained.Although I am an atheist, I was shocked by the many blatant anti-Christian elements in the film. The local priest is a drunk who welshes on paying. His grandfather, another preacher, quite literally stiffed a crew of lepers by stealing their money and arranging their murder. This is what brings the fog to the town. It seems that in the end the priest might atone for the sins of his ancestor by sacrificing himself. But no. Even that dignity is denied him. The fog lifts and it seems that the film makers have shown him mercy. But at the end, the fog returns and he is brutally butchered thereafter.Although characterisation is minimal (Curtis jumps into bed with a man she hitched a ride with immediately without even knowing each others names!), it is obvious from the outset who will live and who won't. The crew of dead lepers may well be cinema's first ever Politically Correct murderers; middle-aged men, an old woman, and priests are unceremoniously dispatched, but the (as usually annoyingly whinny) kid, the sexed up couple and the single mother are all spared.The film does excel in atmosphere. The sight of the town wreathed in fog is beautifully captured. But one does have to wonder why the full resources of Hollywood are being used (then and ever since) to show a series of increasingly sadistic murders?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the scariest I have ever seen even though it doesn't have the slash and gore of lots of the movies from the 80's.John Carpenter, back in his heyday, created a very scary, atmospheric movie about the return of a ghostly crew from a sunken ship from 100 years ago, and the resulting death and mayhem in small Antonio Bay.The mood and atmosphere and the music (very similar to his eerie classic movie Halloween) all come together well to scare the viewer.The acting is overall good, the story fairly strong (there are some inconsistencies, but what the hey) and while there are some aspects of the story that are left unexplained the movie as a whole works.Adrienne Barbou is good as the local DJ who begins to see the carnage unfold and tries to warn the residents of Antonio Bay, who are celebrating the 100 year anniversary of the town. Seems the founding fathers of the town stole the treasure and killed the men on a ship and guess the dead sailors didn't care for that too much, and they have come back for their revenge.Teen scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis has a role as a hitchhiker who gets caught up in the terror and it was kind of fun to see her act with her mom, the late great Janet Leigh (who of course starred in the horror grand-daddy of them all "Psycho").This movie is a little dated, but overall still hold up well and is not one I would ever watch by myself after dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A catastrophe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very intriguing to me how someone who made "The thing" could have made a film like this, or Halloween.This film...is so incredibly boring, it's hard to break it down into a solid analysis here, hard to word...There are long conversations about nothing important, nothing interesting, and a lot of the time nothing about the plot...just ppl talking; characters introduced without introduction, just like that, like 30min into the film. There are long, long drive scenes: some protagonist driving around town, no dialog, just a transition turned into a scene of its own, with zero atmosphere or artistic vision. The film is extremely long to start running, everything is so horribly predictable, stale, boring, soporific... Nothing that happens is original, out of the ordinary, captivating, mysterious. The death scenes are just...nothing. I was going to say "a joke", but they're not even that. They're nothing.It's the story of a small town. Pirate ninjas in the fog who want their gold back. Nothing happens. Then they appear at the end. Then everything is okay again. Have never, ever seen such a slow movie MY ENTIRE LIFE, let alone horror films of course.I give it 2/10 because of the concept; nothing original, nothing Poe and others haven't written countless brilliant pages about; and some nice stills and landscapes during the film.It is a catastrophe, ppl calling it a horror classic, one of Carpenter's best, rating it 8 or 9 or even 10 are clinically insane and should be locked up and have their every move monitored 24/7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow start and predictable once you figure out the basic plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What lurks within the fog in a small fishing town in California called Antonio Bay seeks revenge. They seek vengeance for their murder exactly one hundred years ago. Father Malone played by Hal Holbrook discovers a journal that contains a secret about his grandfather. As Kathy Williams (Janet Leigh) prepares a town celebration to honor their fore fathers, Father Malone finds out the truth about murder for gold. Nick Castle played by Tom Adkins picks up a hitchhiker named Elizabeth (Jamie Lee Curtis) and within a few minutes strange things start happening in the town. Windows are shattered out of cars, furniture moves on its own, car horns and alarms go off simultaneously as well as a pump begins saturating the ground with gasoline. One person that has a birds' eye view of the fog rolling in is lighthouse and radio owner, Stevie Wayne played by Adrienne Barbeau. She plays a large role in helping some of the characters to the safety of a local church in an attempt to avoid the fog. So what exactly seeks revenge for the undue time of the murders? Ghosts or zombie like creatures with red eyes and carrying hooks set out into the night to seek six un-expecting townspeople. While during the movie only five are killed, Father Malone finds the gold that was stolen and returns it to its rightful owners, he fears he is the sixth victim sought after, or is he? The theme of the movie is revenge. The ghosts seek revenge on descendants of the ones' who are responsible for their deaths. The movie begins with the fog moving in on an unexpecting fishing boat called the Seagrass; once the fog descends on the boat the ghost like creatures take their first three victims. As the movie progresses, Nick notices that it looks like the boat had been under water, things were rusted and he found salt water in a beer can. As him and Elizabeth wait for the coastguard, he begins to tell Elizabeth of a similar situation his father encountered several years back, so it makes you think that the ghosts had come back to seek revenge before, but nothing developed from that conversation. This is much like John Carpenters hit movie Halloween, also starring Jamie Lee Curtis, where the killings occurred out of revenge. Although this was not as popular a movie, the effects of the fog were impressive. It seemed as if the fog glowed and was able to travel wherever it wanted to. The on location shots were beautiful during the day, made you really feel you were right there on the shore line, until night fall and the deadly fog sought after its next victims for its revenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter once again shows his magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Autumn is nearly here and that means it is time to bring out those scary movies again. With that in mind, a recommended viewing would be the John Carpenter directed movie, "The Fog." John Carpenter did an excellent job showing the audience that you do not have to make a gory film to be scary. "The Fog" came out in 1980, 26 years ago, and it does not look outdated. Carpenter did a wonderful job mixing a ghost story with a bit of slasher as well.The centennial of the small town of Antonio Bay has finally arrived. However, the events of 100 years ago are about to come back to haunt the town, because a conspiracy of the town's founders resulted in the deaths of several lepers in a shipwreck. The conspirators had planned to lure the lepers' ship towards the rocks so that it would sink, and they could recover the cargo of gold and use it to pay for building the town. The sinister plot succeeded when a fog rolled in, blinding the crew, and forcing them to follow the false fire on shore. Now the ghosts of the crew are back and so is the fog that led them to their doom. Only now, it conceals and protects the ghosts, as they seek their revenge on the residents of Antonio Bay.Since this is a scary movie, the scare factor has to be there and fortunately, it was. Like "Halloween," "The Fog" did not rely too much on gore, but more on actual creepiness. Too much of today's horrors rely on the gore factor. Carpenter also wonderfully creates a chilling atmosphere by using fog machines to its full potential. He proves that what you do not see is scarier than what you do see. John Carpenter also composed a perfectly chilling soundtrack, even though it is a little too similar to the "Halloween" theme.One thing confusing this is the R rating. There was very little language and the gore was not enough to warrant an R. There were zero signs of nudity or sexuality. In 1980, the PG-13 rating did not exist, but this movie could have gotten away with a PG rating. Oh well, the rating should not be something to complain about. After all, complaining about a movie rating is the last think you should be complaining about.For a horror film, the acting was good. Jamie Lee Curtis plays a hitchhiker named Elizabeth Solley. Janet Leigh plays a town official named Kathy Williams. Adrienne Barbeau played a very important role as a Radio Disc Jockey named Stevie Wayne. Hal Holbrook played the likable priest named Robert Malone. The very first scene involves John Houseman telling a ghost story to a few kids, which was done really well. The actors did well, but the real star was not any actors or actresses but the fog itself.There are not very many negative things to say about this film. There are a few plot holes and the premise is a little silly, but if you can look past those, you can enjoy this. As a horror movie it needs to do two jobs, one is to entertain and the other is to scare and it did both. This is a perfect movie to watch in autumn time with the lights off. If you are looking for a movie with lots of deaths and gore, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a creepy ghost story, you can do a lot worst then watching "The Fog."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Designed as a ghost story but executed as a slasher film, "The Fog" works only intermittently as an atmospheric chiller. If only there was something compelling to the story or its characters, it might have been another early standout in the career of director John Carpenter.Antonio Bay, California is about to celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding. Unfortunately, not everything in its history is worth celebrating, especially an episode involving the sinking of a leper ship off Spivey Point. A bad thing was done, and now it seems the ghosts of the wronged are back for revenge - and not particular about whom they take it out on."This town sits around for a hundred years and nothing happens," one resident says. "Then one night the whole place falls apart."This all ties into the fog, glowing eerily as it makes landfall and becomes the backdrop for a series of scary scenes. The optics look great; in fact the whole movie has an irresistible sheen to it courtesy of its coastal shooting location and the talent of cinematographer Dean Cundey. But the script, co-written by Carpenter and Debra Hill, doesn't employ these ghostly qualities to much effect, using the fog as curtaining for a team of shambling killer shapes.In his DVD commentary with Hill, Carpenter allows he had to punch up the film after an initial cut revealed less than terrifying results. He was trying the first time for a more moody and evocative offering, something different from what his "Halloween" fans expected, but found the result too tepid. So he went back and reshot the film, adding scare scenes that, in my view, don't make sense but gave his fans what they wanted.If the town is threatened only when the fog makes landfall, why is there an opening scene of things going haywire in Antonio Bay with no fog in sight? What point does it serve to have a dead body suddenly rise and walk just so it can write a number on the floor? Why does a DJ tell the townspeople that a church is the only safe place to go to escape the fog? Why is it only the people that actually go there wind up in danger? Why does first-billed Adrienne Barbeau play all but one brief scene of the movie entirely alone?OK, that last one is more of a style point than a plot flaw. But it feels like part of the movie's larger issue; there doesn't seem to have been any focus behind it. The scare scenes are rudimentarily effective but happen in a cheap way, like a car can't get out of a mudhole while shadows from the fog move toward its occupants, or someone is killed by that old saw of opening a door while scary music plays.At one point in the DVD, Carpenter says "Some of the genre fans criticized the writing of this film in terms of its logic. My feeling is you're doing a ghost story, there really isn't too much logic to it." But there always is an underlying logic to a good ghost story. "The Fog" even tries to do this intermittently with ghostly messages of "Six Must Die" and stolen gold to be accounted for, but all serves as mere window dressing for the shock scenes and some lame exposition.The film isn't terrible, just forgettable. Carpenter and his team should be commended for trying something different. It's just that a fatal lack of vision, or energy, or story, or nerve, or something, leave you with a lot of smoke and little to take away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so absolutely terrible that I had to fast forward during parts. How dare they put this movie in the Horror section. I want to know what the budget was like for this movie because I could of made a film with a small town, beat-up rags, and two fog machines for much less. Not to mention these "zombie like ghosts" were such pansies. They only killed like 5 people (one being a grandma) and were after a gold cross conveniently hidden in the church. And then at the end, just when you think its over, they show up and kill the priest in an effort to awe the audience. If anything it just upset me to think that a sequel might stem from this.I am only giving it a 3 because the acting wasn't that bad and I liked the cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerie, Effective &amp; Downright Chilling, 'The Fog' Is An Underrated Gem Of Horror Filmmaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Persistently looming with a foreboding sense of dread, John Carpenter's The Fog is yet another masterly crafted horror from the influential filmmaker that envelops its tale with an unsettling vibe even before the opening credits have finished appearing on the screen, and keeps that minacious aura alive for the remainder of its runtime with skillful precision.The story of The Fog unfolds in the small coastal town that is rumoured to have been built with blood money that was obtained from shipwrecked lepers about a century ago, although residents dismiss it as nothing but a made-up story. But on the 100th anniversary of the town's founding, the entire place finds itself engulfed in an unnatural glowing fog that brings some ghostly spirits with it.Co-written, directed &amp; scored by John Carpenter (best known for Halloween &amp; The Thing), The Fog opens with a series of paranormal activities that transpire within the opening credits sequence and it quickly sets the tone for the rest of the picture. The campfire tale narrated earlier in the movie does allow the viewers to anticipate the upcoming events but those moments still reek with nail- biting suspense.Shot in truly gorgeous locations, the camera is splendidly utilised and nicely captures the small- town life. The widescreen format also helps in giving its images a more refined feel, plus even the smallest choices regarding its camera angles, lighting &amp; colour palette only assist in enhancing the cinematic experience. Also, it being a low-budget indie, it's amazing how well the practical effects hold up after all these years.Clocking at 89 minutes, The Fog packs in a lean plot that remains tense &amp; gripping throughout its runtime, and is expertly paced. Performances carry no complaints, Adrienne Barbeau stands out in her acting debut, but Jamie Lee Curtis isn't far behind. And then there's this absolutely unnerving but fitting soundtrack from Carpenter himself that further ups the ante by amplifying the overall intensity &amp; mood with its evocative tracks.On an overall scale, The Fog has stood valiantly against the test of time over the years and it still remains one of the most under-appreciated works of not only John Carpenter's career but its genre as well. Utilising horror elements to its full potential, making terrific use of its ominous atmosphere to deliver the chills, and elevated to greater heights by its thrilling score, The Fog is one of the best horror flicks of the 1980s that's eerie, effective &amp; downright chilling. Definitely worth your time &amp; money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, a small village is shaken by a mysterious and thick white fog, seemingly unnatural. Quickly, the people realize that something deadly lurks in the fog, and they will have to pay for mistakes of a past that they seek to celebrate. Directed and written by John Carpenter, its based on a novel by Stephen King. The cast is headed by Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis and Hal Holbrook.This film is the traditional light horror of the eighties. Without spilling a drop of fake blood, it can make the entire audience stuck to the screen from start to finish through a mysterious, tense and scary story. In this film, the theme is the past and the mistakes that a community committed, but not atoned. The script, simple but efficient, works well. The actors were also well in their roles, especially Hal Holbrook, in the role of the local priest, one of the first to realize what is really happening. The film never explains that the creatures in the fog are ghosts or zombies, despite their appearance seems to lean the second option. This is not a visually striking film, but the most sensitive people should avoid it because it raises some discomfort, by situations and circumstances and not by blood or violence, something that it hardly shows. The dramatic tension increases along the film. The special, visual and sound effects are very interesting, probably the best of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly old-fashioned ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's horror follow-up to HALLOWEEN is a subtle and effective chiller in which the titular mist menaces the residents of a small American town. At first, I thought this was an adaptation of the gory James Herbert thriller about an infected fog causing all those who inhale it to go berserk, but instead, Carpenter opts for old-fashioned thrills and spills, with his own distinctive visual look, in a tale of ghostly murderous pirates. This was the Carpenter whose films were carefully shot, excellently scored and always well acted, and THE FOG is no exception to that rule.The movie has a better back-story than most, and the convoluted tale of treasure, leprosy, and supernatural revenge hangs together well. The movie is fairly atmospheric and there are many creepy moments, as well as effective jump-in-your-seat shocks, like hands popping out of the mist. The ghost pirates themselves are excellent creations, especially the leader with the red eyes, played by makeup man Rob Bottin. Carpenter has the scenes with them in play out in total silence, and it works.The ensemble cast assembled for this flick is a stellar one. Adrienne Barbeau is one of the best scream queens and, sure enough, she gets to scream with the best of them. Janet Leigh, of course the first scream queen of them all, has fun in a minor role, whilst veteran screen-stealer Tom Atkins struggles with his miscasting; he's playing a hormonally-challenged young hero, but at 45 years old, the guy just doesn't cut it. Turn his hair a steely grey, give him a moustache, and he's much, much better. Lots of other cast members pop up from Carpenter's previous films ? scene-stealer Darwin Joston (Napoleon in ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13) has a cameo as 'Dr. Phibes' (groan), and other cast members are named after horror directors. Jamie Lee Curtis is thankfully on screen for only a little time, but gets at least one good scream in; even the sheriff from HALLOWEEN shows up.Okay, after all these years, the special effects of the fog rolling in (superimposed over the background) are quite paltry and definitely not up to scratch, but Carpenter more than makes up for this with his dry ice machine, which he uses at every opportunity (more dry ice here than at the finale of THE BLOB!). Surprisingly, bloodshed is at a minimum, and there are only a couple of deaths in the entire film, eschewing HALLOWEEN's incessant body-count fatality. Instead, THE FOG is a slow-moving, subtle and creepy ghost story, well played and very well directed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Note to self, don't buy a weak plywood front door</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog is a low budget horror classic by the amazing filmmaker John Carpenter. It has nothing to do with Stephen King's The Mist, despite both being released in the same year (1980).The movie was released after carpenter had already earned great praise with Halloween. It is about a small Californian coastal town of Antonia Bay, that is engulfed in a ghostly glowing fog. Within the fog are vengeful spirits, that are seeking their revenge for something that happened long ago.Its a simple story, but the movie really knows how to make a concept as basic as just "fog" suspenseful. It kind of feels like Jaws on land. The camera shots, the lighting, and the restraint, all help establish a really strong feeling of dread. The only thing that holds the movie back, is its obvious low budget, and the fact that the threat isn't very strong. But in a way, the fact that they don't show too much, adds to the film. Especially the small scale of the threat, set in a relatively small secluded location, helps the suspense a lot.I think Carpenter was aware of the weak story, and so he keeps up the pace. However, you can never quite shake the feeling that this whole looming threat could simply be stopped by just not answering the door, and by having a door that is not made out of weak plywood. In a way, the slow shots of rolling fog are more scary than the ghosts with meat hooks IN the fog, who really seem to rely on people opening their front door if someone knocks.You can see obviously hints of Halloween in this film. There is also great use of silence, and sudden sounds, to keep the audience on edge. There was at least one scene in the film which honestly made me jump from my seat, and I was totally not ready for it. But does it ever get scary? Meh.... maybe once. It's more of a feeling of dread, than true suspense. But it's enjoyable.There's also a 2005 remake of this film, which according to everyone is atrocious. No surprise there. Just watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Ghost Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie essentially concerns itself with a small coastal community in California known as Antonio Bay which is hosting its 100th anniversary in 1980. Although the town founders are considered as great men for their time the actual history suggests something much different. Supposedly, a small group of people from a leper colony wanted to settle in the area but when they attempted to get there by ship were enveloped by an unusual fog and subsequently tricked by six townspeople into following a campfire onto a dangerous reef which caused them to drown. Yet rather than being despised for the murderers they were, the descendants of these townspeople celebrate their accomplishments. However, what the townspeople don't realize is that for the first time in 100 years a strange fog is coming into Antonio Bay--and with it are the ghosts of the lepers who demand the lives of the descendants of those who participated in this dastardly deed. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this turned out to be a decent ghost movie all things considered. I especially liked the manner in which the director (John Carpenter) utilized both smoke and lighting to achieve the greatest amount of suspense possible. Unfortunately, there was one particular scene with the radio disc jockey named "Stevie Wayne" (Adrienne Barbeau) telling people to run from the fog which just seemed totally ridiculous. But other than that I was rather impressed and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog (1980) is a classic horror film from John Carpenter! Right after Halloween, this is a John Carpenter's BEST horror movie!! Much better (as always) than the remake. The remake sucked ass, It took me 3.hrs of watching the movie till I finish it. I will never watch the remake again. This film is fast paced not boring not too over long and goes with the story perfect! It is interesting movie and very intense horror film.I absolutely love this classic horror flick about revenge that began 100. years ago As the Californian coastal town of Antonio Bay is about to celebrate its 100th anniversary, paranormal activity begins to occur at the stroke of midnight. Revenge ghost keep visiting Antonio Bay and killing people ancestors who were responsible for killing them 100.years ago and stealing their gold. Seriously I love this movie to death. It is American Horror classic flick I love it. I can always enjoy watching this film, I had fun with it and the film is Entertaining, a great horror s lasher genre from the 80's. According to legend, six sailors killed when shipwrecked 100 years ago in Antonio Bay, California, will rise to avenge their deaths when a strange glowing fog appears. The town is commemorating the centenary of the shipwreck and Father Malone discovers a diary kept by an ancestor; he learns that the ship was wrecked by six founding fathers of the town. The vengeance of their victims will be the death of six people. As daylight fades, a mysterious fog envelops the town and begins to strew panic and death. The pain plot to film that evolves a ghosts 100.years ago that were betrayed and robbed, now 100.years anniversary, they are coming for revenge as the fog and killing people. One of my favorite best horror flicks from John Carpenter. The Fog (1980) was the perfect movie to watch on Halloween or at least during Halloween season. I think if Jamie Lee Curtis maybe got the DJ role instead of the hitchhiker one, she probably would've said nicer things about it. Even though I know it's unrelated, I think this is the closest we'll ever get to an American 'Blind Dead' remake. The Fog was intended as PG, but Carpenter put in stronger scenes due to a negative test screening. He mentioned that on the Fear On Film on the Criterion DVD/Blu-Ray for Video.The Original movie The Fog was a classic. What I do not understand is Debra Hill produced the Original Fog and The Remake and the remake was just awful. It was not scary, the effects were terrible, acting was terrible and the new Stevie Wayne was just insulting and terrible. Adrienne Barbeau was awesome as DJ Stevie Wayne in The Fog she also co started a year later in my all time favorite Sci-Fi Action flick Escape From New York (1981) in which she is the beautiful in both movies , but In Escape From New York she is deadly Maggie. There are a lot actors and actress who worked with John Carpenter before and in the future films. Jamie Lee Curtis who played hitchhiker also played 2.years earlier in Halloween (1978) first classic Carpenter horror film. Sorry I don't like that movie, but I love this movie. I can go with this film anytime. Tom Atkins he also co started a year later in Escape From New York alongside with Adrienne Barbeau. They never shared screen time together in that film and they never shared any screen time in this on either.It's a favorite of mine, and that version of the movie beats the tar off of the 2005 version.They're not even alike, and the second one to me is just plain fake! This one has so much more human interaction and realism. Great cast, maintained the creepy atmosphere throughout and plenty of good frights. I loved this movie from start to finish! It is a good ghost story and an awesome horror flick of mine! I love this film to death! I love it!!! I love Adrienne In this this film. I Love her on air voice and a terrified scene on the end of the movie when she had to face the ghosts alone. The Fog (1980) it is still all time classic and Everyone is still talking about this horror film today! The rating I am giving to this film is 10/10 it deserves it and it is John Carpenter's underrated best horror film for me. It is my 6th favorite best Carpenter film. The Fog is a 1980 American horror film directed by John Carpenter, who also co-wrote the screenplay and created the music for the film. It stars Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Janet Leigh and Hal Holbrook.10/10 Grade: A+ Studio: AVCO Embassy Pictures Starring: Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, John Houseman, Janet Leigh, Hal Holbrook Director: John Carpenter Producer: Debra Hill Writers: John Carpenter, Debra Hill Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 29 Mins.

		<shortDescription>The Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed two years after the success of 'Halloween' and the kick off for Carpenter's cult movie making career. A cute little horror flick this, a nice old fashioned spooky sea yarn that wouldn't look outta place as a Scooby Doo plot if done that way. Overall a very basic film with bottom of the barrel effects clearly done on a shoestring yet it still works effectively. I love the mist effects in this film as they remind me of many old classic black n white horror's. A really nice kind of 'Twilight Zone' feel about the proceedings that gives great atmosphere and a decent chill to the bone with all the misty cold dusk vista's.As said the film is very basic but offers nice creativity on all counts. The nasty spooky ghosts are merely actors in dark clothes and shot in silhouette, the odd bit of seaweed draped on their arms and leader Captain Blake has glowing red eyes. They simply turn up with the fog and knock on peoples doors hoping to be let in so they can kill you...how polite!Of course the cast is a classic line up of character actors, some of which Carpenter used for his previous popular horror flick, I don't need to mention them do I. Although personally I wouldn't have used Curtis again, bit samey.I like this film very much, it has a great eerie factor with a plain and simple plot, no silly frills, a pure quality ghost story of old. Loved the use of a smoke machine to pump in the menacing fog at the required moments, so very cheap n obvious but so very cool. 7/10</fullReview>

Then also kinda interestingly, Jamie Lee and Janet Leigh barely have any screen time together. The real star is Adrienne Barbeau who does a great job as Antonio Bay's DJ. Unfortunately the potential greatness for this movie is kinda flushed away with too many plot holes. Still there is a nice degree of creepy. I had seen this a bunch of times way back when and then once maybe ten or so years ago. I've had a craving for it. Was every bit as memorable as I remembered.

The fog brings with it strange supernatural occurrences and deadly ghost-like figures. A local priest (Hal Holbrook) finds a journal that may hold the answer to the fog's mystery while a radio disc jockey (Adrienne Barbeau) stationed in a lighthouse overlooking the town tries to warn people.The cast is solid with vets Hal Holbrook and John Houseman (in the prologue) showing up the kids as they are wont to do. Adrienne "Boom Boom" Barbeau makes her film debut here and is impressive. She was, at that time, John Carpenter's wife. Lucky bastard. Jamie Lee Curtis has a supporting part and I have to wonder how far into the scriptwriting process her superfluous character was added. I'm not sure what purpose her character serves unless it's to remind us that Tom Atkins is such a stud that he can bed a babe like her the first night he meets her. We would be similarly reminded of his studliness in Halloween III when he banged Stacey Nelkin, also after knowing her for a brief time. Cheeseball male protagonists were a Carpenter specialty.The Fog was John Carpenter's first theatrical film after the classic Halloween. Obviously this film doesn't match that one but who said it had to? This is a very good horror movie, dripping with atmosphere and more than a few jump scares. Carpenter wisely doesn't show you too much of the killers in the fog, showing you just enough to be spooky. The direction is great, the score (by Carpenter) is cool, and the story is pretty unique. Avoid the 2005 remake. It's garbage that turns an original, suspenseful, atmospheric horror film into just another movie where good-looking young people run for their lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog is a horror movie, directed by John Carpenter, who by the way is a horror legend. I think that looking at all of his other awesome films, like The Thing, Halloween, and In The Mouth of Madness, this film should not be compared. Comparing movies that a director makes to his other ones is a mistake, if you ask me. The Fog has a really cool atmosphere, and even the somewhat bad quality of the shooting adds to the feeling, which I think was much achieved. Aside from atmosphere there were the characters and the story. I thought the characters certainly had separating characteristics about them, but the development wasn't all that good. I didn't feel like I knew them enough to care a whole lot about them. But this is definitely the biggest of the flaws this movie has. The story itself was it's own thing. It was more like a scary story that you would tell at a campfire, and that is not an accidental thing either, as you will see at the beginning of the film. A cool back-story with an equally cool monster/monsters. I would say definitely watch this movie for fun, for some cool inspiration maybe, and for a ghostly story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hauntingly atmospheric with great locations and score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "The Fog" (1980) involves the horrific ghosts of a ship of lepers returning to enact revenge on a Northern California community 100 years after the founders of the village did them wrong. The first time I saw this film I found it kind of boring. Since then, however, I've come to see its numerous positives: - The film has MOOD. Carpenter successfully captured a nice spooky ambiance for his ghost story. The haunting atmosphere is nicely captured in the opening scene where John Houseman shares the ghost tale to a group of kids at a campfire on the coast.- Spectacular locations. The picture was filmed in the beautiful Point Reyers/Bodega Bay region North of San Francisco.- Fabulous Score. Especially the main piano piece that runs during the end credits (a variation of this piece appears only once in the proper film -- when the boy finds the artifact from the Elizabeth Dane). This musical piece actually blows away the more popular main score to Capenter's "Halloween" and should have been used a couple of more times in the film. - Good Cast, which includes Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Hal Holbrook, Nancy Kyes and Janet Leigh.- An unpredictable finish. I know this is a horror flick and people are supposed to die, but it's nice to see people NOT die for a change. It's refreshing! BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a fast-paced slasher gorefest, you will not like this film. If, however, you're in the mood for something ghostly atmospheric and aesthetically pleasing, "The Fog" will likely trip your trigger.PS: Be sure to catch the 2005 remake for a well-done updating of the film (don't listen to the whiners as it's a solid re-imagining).The film runs 90 minutes.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...just want to start off by saying Miss Jamie Lee Curtis just looks gorgeous as always though Wanda will always be my favorite character....finished watching the movie about ten fifteen minutes ago and thought it was a worthwhile watch especially on Blu-ray.the movie was very enjoyable even without the horror element. the setting was gorgeous whether it was man-made or natural. it is sort of hard to explain for me but the movie was very well handled by the makers of and it showed. it did not feel cheesy or cheap. i am just a sucker for night scenes and scenes with water in a horror or thriller and this movie did not disappoint me.the horror elements were as well done as could be expected for those days and was probably considered top notch then. the horror story was pretty refreshing and done pretty well and i loved the fog..., it looked so cool rolling around and whats hiding in them. the movie just had strong production values all around and the cinematography was oh so beautiful...i give this Jamie Lee vehicle a 7. very good horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love to gather round a fire and tell a good ghost to scare the skivvies off the kids? How bout a good Sea Ghost story....with a thick fog bank curling outside to add the creepy setting. Welcome to The Fog!!Which is what happens---the setting for the trap is done--a sea captain tells a bunch of kids a ghost story about the town they live in--the town's people murdering a bunch a leper sailors who were ship wrecked--and much worse---the town minister steals their gold and fashions a gold cross out of it. Next thing--lights go on and off, cars will start by themselves...Yep! there will definitely be trouble coming! and something....yes...something dangerous is out in the fog...The success of The Fog is based on it's creepy setting. When the fog bank and chilling wind rolls in, the audience seems to feel it. Adrianne BarBaiou does a incredibly sexy performance as throaty town disc jockey. Jaimie Lee Curtis who is starring with Mom (Janet Leigh) gives good scenes also. The special effects are minimal but are effective---lots of loud noises and window/light breaking. The only bad thing is the script can get campy at times.So pop the popcorn! The Fog makes a good Halloween treat!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By No Means a Perfect Film, But it's a Personal Favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I don't know what happened to Antonio Bay tonight. Something came out of the fog and tried to destroy us. In one moment, it vanished. But if this has been anything but a nightmare, and if we don't wake up to find ourselves safe in our beds, it could come again. To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog."This is not John Carpenter's best film in any sense ("Halloween" (1978) and "The Thing" (1982) taking the cake on that title), but "The Fog" (1980) is a still a creepy, atmospheric, supernatural horror film that holds up to this day. Carpenter does once again what he was able to do with "Halloween": take a film with a rather small budget (though "The Fog" had a larger budget than "Halloween", it was still rather cheap) and give it the appearance of costing a lot more than it did. While the film made 22 million dollars (which is good considering its budget of 1 million), it is not as impressive as the 47 million "Halloween" made. Still, I believe "The Fog" to be a wonderful film for what it sets out to be: a small, atmospheric film, relying more on the tone of the film than any impressive special effects. This is why Carpenter is my favorite horror director. Sure, his plots are never life changing, and besides "The Thing", his films are never filled with spectacular effects, but he manages to create wonderfully atmospheric films and has proved to be the best when it comes to slowly building tension.And this film is no exception. From the opening scene on the beach to the final shot, this film kept me on the edge of my seat, although I believe the film really takes off when Father Malone reads from the journal he finds. We never clearly see the creatures in the fog, which I believe adds to their threat. Their glowing eyes, hooks, and large, threatening bodies help their mystery. The fog they enter through in, though its glow is incredibly unrealistic and fake-looking, it is still quite eerie and allows for a lot of tension. Overall, the character development and plot is missing in this film, but it's still creepy, atmospheric, and a personal favorite. If you forgive its mistakes, you will be in for a nice, fun, creepy film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Foggy days and Mondays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a time in the early 80's John Carpenter cornered the market in the new old-fashioned horror market, drawing inspiration from the likes of Val Lewton, Howard Hawks and Alfred Hitchcock in bringing fear and dread into modern-day little-town America. His low-budget films exude atmosphere and put recognisable, everyday characters into danger, ramping up the tension and excitement until a dramatic resolution provides release at the conclusion."The Fog" is a good case in point. Even if the premise of a century-old murdered ship's crew returning in an eerily glowing mist to take bloody retribution on the town's inhabitants today seems far-fetched, the fact it's couched in the recognisable here and now gives it resonance and even credibility.Thus the characterisations of the principals, if not all faithfully true-to-life (Hal Holbrook's long-haired preacher and Janet Leigh's fussy Lady Mayor are drawn with too-broad strokes), resonate sufficiently so that the viewer gets some kind of empathy with their predicament. Especially good are Adrienne Barbeau whose role as the town's soothing overseer in her role as all-day D.J. from her symbolic location atop a lighthouse and Tom Atkins as the ordinary average Joe who becomes the closest thing we get to an action hero as he runs around, new young girl-friend Jamie Lee Curtis in tow, to try to save select inhabitants of the town from the gathering storm, particularly Barbeau's infant son.Carpenter largely avoids blood and gore, at least after the first coming of the avenging mariners on the fishing-boat's crew, with the subsequent deaths largely happening off- camera and I rather like that he doesn't spare little-old ladies from the mayhem. His use of his own moody electronic-music soundtrack significantly adds to the atmosphere and he effectively cross-cuts between scenes in a manner that Hitchcock and Hawks would have applauded, although the climactic final scene perhaps owes more to another H and H acolyte, Brian De Palma, for inspiration.I could have done without the tagged-on prologue, a vain attempt to add a little "Ancient Mariner" mystique to proceedings, but once the clock strikes just after midnight and that old fog starts rolling in, this is an entertaining and engaging horror film well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Fog" is not a perfect movie, but I did enjoy it very much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fair number of film scholars and enthusiasts would agree that the career of John Carpenter began with tremendous success, culminated with his much-loved 1978 scare picture "Halloween," and has been merely sputtering ever since. I am not one of those people. For me, "Halloween" was a decent yet unremarkable thriller?constantly threatened by some very bad acting?and Carpenter's track record in the years since, at least through the mid-1980s, only grew more impressive, more interesting, and more enjoyable. Hence I feel that his 1980 ghost story "The Fog" is a step up from the bogeyman fable that made him a household name in the horror genre.One of Carpenter's nicest assets as a director is his choice of subtle subject matter. He tells old-fashioned, simplistic stories without trying to make them over into something profound. After all, "Halloween" was at heart just a bogeyman story with some slight touches of Sigmund Freud thrown in. "Escape from New York" featured some social satire, but was predominately a science-fiction spectacle. And Carpenter's best film, "The Thing," became so intensely frightening because it understood its base as a 'who's who' monster movie. The same applies to "The Fog." There is an explanation as to why the ghosts in this story decide to attack a particular seaside neighborhood on a particular night, but the answer is thrown in our laps right away. Even if you axed the movie's prologue?which Carpenter originally intended?we would learn the motives of these specters before the first hour was up and the big string of attacks had begun.It would have been all too easy, and perhaps tempting, for Carpenter and his co-screenwriter Debra Hill to try and weave some mock-profundity out of all this, but thankfully, they did not. As a result, "The Fog" wisely steps away from being an hour and a half of pseudo-intellectual nonsense and plays itself with a straight face. And not for a second is it boring.The narrative bounces between several of the town's inhabitants, all of whom are represented by very talented actors. "Halloween" star Jamie Lee Curtis takes one of the starring roles and shows a vast improvement in her acting, starring alongside none other than her mother, Janet Leigh. It does seem appropriate; both of these actresses got their start in movies in which they were stalked by deranged killers with butcher knives (Miss Leigh in Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho") so it must have been a dream come true for Carpenter to put them together. Yet he does not go for the obvious tactic of turning them into cinema pals; they do not even share a two-shot until the final reel. And neither actress is allowed to steal screen time from anybody else; in fact, the only one who comes even close to doing so is the one who was the most interesting: Adrienne Barbeau as the owner of a lighthouse-set radio station, watching and reporting as the big waves of glowing fog wash over her community.I liked the people in "The Fog" and I liked the ghouls who emerge from the misty walls, but what I enjoyed the most was Carpenter's visual flair as a director: his insistence on shying from ultra-tight close-ups so aplenty in most horror films, the bluish tint he has applied to the lens, how the camera transitions between light and dark settings, and the way he stages bizarre scenarios. There are a number of 'what-is-going-on?' moments in "The Fog," such as water bleeding from a piece of driftwood before suddenly catching fire, and the director stages everything excellently. He gives special attention to these seemingly inexplicable moments. In these moments, the audience forgets this stuff is foreseeable in a spook-story and joins in with the characters, pondering what is happening and what will soon happen. And when the ghouls do appear, Carpenter uses the fog motif and the distance between the specters and the camera efficiently. He appropriately does not give us too much of the villains, thereby rendering them more effective. Less is more.On the negative side of the equation, I wish Carpenter and Debra Hill had chosen a straight-forward resolution to wrap up their story. As a matter of fact, they start out with one, only to follow in the footsteps of "A Nightmare on Elm Street," where the peaceful yet haunting conclusion is capped off with an out-of-the-blue shocker. It's not bad?especially not the way it's been photographed?it just seems unnecessary. In addition, although the ghosts' motive for returning to this town a hundred years after their deaths is spelled out clearly, the selection of their victims does seem a tad hazy. Once again, I'm glad the screenwriters did not try to make some mock-profound social commentary out of the whole ordeal, but just another sentence or two to explain who they will come after would have helped some. Basically everything else is just nitpicks: was it necessary to have Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins jump into bed a minute after they meet when the rest of the movie really just presents them as two strangers with a developing friendship?And one does beg the question: why do the ghosts target clustered individuals behind walls and barriers when there's a town gathering smack-dab in the open?So what if it's not an impeccable masterpiece? I've never been one to let nitpicks go too far, especially when my mood when viewing the picture has been predominately positive. In the case of "The Fog," my mood was overwhelmingly positive; I really enjoyed watching this simplistic ghost fable. Because, once again, it does not make itself out to be anything big, profound, and deep. It just drills as deep into the plot mechanics as it needs to (maybe a tad too shallow, I admit) and lets the director's flair take control of the entertainment value. It's not a perfect movie, but I still liked it very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog (1980) Soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a break of 2 years John Carpenter returned to the horror genre with The Fog. A classic ghost story revolving around a town's centenary coinciding with the arrival of a ghostly fog. As with the director's previous films the use of music and sound plays an important role in creating tension. After an opening quote courtesy of Edgar Allen Poe, the film begins by taking us to a camp fire beginning with a close up of a ticking pocket watch and an old fisherman telling children by a crackling camp fire a ghost story perfectly setting up the plot and tone of the film. This is in part thanks to Carpenter's self-composed piano score complementing the visuals to create a suspenseful underscore. As the film progresses the verbal rhetoric of the town's priest, reading from his ancestors diary, helps to reveal more and more detail of what happened 100 years previously. This ensures that we stay with the film to find out why the fog has returned to the town. Additionally it serves to fill in a motive for the ghosts lurking in the fog. Although this is not the only sound used to drive the plot as the sound of things breaking and car horns going off in the opening scenes alerts us to something sinister taking place. However the most effective use of sound has to be the monotonous banging of a hook by a spectral figure on numerous characters' front doors, by the ghostly sailors hiding in the fog. The use of this sound effect accompanies a character's slow pace towards the door effectively creating tension; we know they shouldn't open the door but can't stop them. Furthermore the sound of breaking glass and ticking clocks are used perfectly to reinforce the idea that we should expect something bad to happen. The ticking of analogue clocks is also significant because it reinforces a crucial plot point. This is further reinforced by the inclusion of clock like sounds in the films electronic score a clever indicator to the films plot: the time at which the leper ship sunk causing the death of the crew at 12:00 midnight 100 years previously.Another effect use of sound is the repetition of rhythms using synthesisers a notable scene is the repetition of the same two notes succeeded by a percussion sound. This is used to great effect in that it gives the sense that the fog is moving further and further inland and makes it feel like an unearthly creation of science fiction. Along with this Carpenter's electronic film score is an important authorship device as his electronic often self-composed scores have now become synonymous with him as a director. The Fog may only be regarded as a minor horror classic possibly due to it being the follow up to the seminal Halloween (1978); but that does not stop it from effectively using a combination of sound effects and sinister theme music to aid the visuals in creating suspense. The sound of hooks banging on a door alone is enough to make you think twice before you answer the door.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please be advised that this review may contain spoilers. The film, The Fog (1980), has a focus on emotional effect or mood as the theme (Carpenter, 1980). In films that focus on emotional effect or mood, it is possible to identify a single mood or emotion that prevails throughout the film, (Boggs &amp; Petrie, 2008). The mood that prevails throughout the entire film is horror. The Fog starts out slow and it takes a while to gain an interest. In the beginning, young children are being told of a ghost story around the campfire about a ship wreak that happened 100 years ago. Throughout the beginning of the film, the characters were implemented poorly because only a few of the characters actually pertained to the reason behind the fog. Basically, the beginning showed the fog, which was followed by revengeful ghosts, who attacked people for no reason. Later in the movie, it was known that the fog wanted revenge to the six founders who caused a shipwreck where everyone on the ship vanished. The people who vanished were known to be the revengeful ghosts. This is the point in the movie where things start to make sense and have meaning. There were many different characters throughout the film, The Fog. One character was a radio DJ named Stevie Wayne, star Adrienne Barbeau, whose son found a piece of wood that read "Dane", which was part of the name of the actual ship that was shipwrecked 100 years earlier. There was also a priest named Father Malone, star Hal Holbrook, who found his grandfather's diary. When Father Malone read the diary he found that of the six founders, his grandfather was one of them. Stevie was able to watch as the fog came inland and towards the town. She was able to transmit to the town where the fog was heading. The fog ended up at the church where Father Malone stayed. It was known by that point that the fog was after Father Malone as a way to get back at his grandfather. There were many techniques in the film that was relevant to the theme. One being sound effects. The Fog carries a spooky, windy, eerie sound with it when it arrives. This changes the viewers state of mind to an uncomfortable, uneasy sensation. This feeling allows the fog to be scarier than it really is which helps out on the horror effect. Another technique was the motif of the fog. The image of the fog being bright and glowing made it obvious that it was not something normal and it was something to be spooked about. The pattern of seeing the bright, glowing fog, the electricity going out, and then the knock on the door impacts the theme as well. The film reminded me of the horror film, Halloween, which was also a movie about many murders. Unfortunately, I could not appreciate this film. I am one who enjoys horror films, but this was not my type. References Boggs, J. M., &amp; Petrie, D. W. (2008). The Art of Watching Films. New York: McGraw-Hill. Carpenter, J. (Director). (1980).

		<fullReview>The northern California coastal fishing town of Antonio Bay is preparing for their centennial anniversary founded on 21st of April 1880. On the eve of the celebration approximately the hour between midnight and one o'clock this small and proud tightly knit community, is disturbed by a series of inexplicable phenomenon such as simultaneously ringing payphones, activated car alarms, shattered windows, falling signs, etc. Omens of things to come.The presiding priest who apparently loves the bottle discovers his grandfather's journal after a stone falls from the wall of his church quarters revealing a space in which the book laid hidden buried behind the masonry. In its pages he learns about a man named Blake who purchased a clipper ship called the Elizabeth Dane. A sick man with a vision sought permission from the future town founders to build a leper colony for himself and his diseased comrades a mile's distance away from the yet established town of Antonio Bay. Blake, a man of inestimable wealth, boarded this clipper ship load with his gold treasure for a journey to these same shores precisely one hundred years ago when a unearthly fog engulfed the Elizabeth Dane only a fire piercing from the deceptive shore banks were solace to Blake and his crew for safety. The proceeding pages of this startling tormented confession recounts monstrous acts broiling with human prejudice, greed, and mass murder.Upon the eve of the centennial anniversary of Antonio Bay, a strange luminescent fog rolls in. First a fishing trawler disappears. When it is finally recovered the next afternoon, it is found nearly deserted of it's three occupants save one dead man with both eyes gouged out and throat crushed. Even stranger the body after an autopsy examination proposes it had to have been under the sea for at least a month in spite of the fact this individual and the rest of the crew had been seen alive just days prior on shore in town.While the Father uncovers the conspiracy of six and their direct link to his grandfather, the local late nite DJ running her independent radio show from a lighthouse and the local weatherman are puzzled by their conflicting fog reports. An unnatural fog that appears upon the midnight hour. These and other threads begin to tie together the revenge-driven supernatural forces at work behind the mysterious menace of the fog...The team of director and composer John Carpenter, co-writer Debra Hill, and cinematographer Dean Cundey effectively score together again with a referential horror movie of substance. This time around it is a triumphant modern re-working of the classic ghost story. A self-confessed fan of H.P. Lovecraft, John Carpenter crafted his own brilliant tribute recalling notable ghost story writers of that era, Montague Rhodes James, Herbert Russell Wakefield, William Hope Hodgson, etc.Featuring a phenomenal cast Andrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, Janet Leigh, her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis, Hal Holbrook, Nancy Kyes (Nancy Loomis), Charles Cyphers, John Houseman, George "Buck" Flowers, etc, etc.Most of the shooting was done in Inverness, Point Reyes Station (K-A-B radio), Bodega Bay and Tomales Bay, small coastal towns in Marin County 40 miles north of San Francisco captures the isolated settings of fictitious Antonio Bay and lent The Fog an eerie natural canvas for its maritime horrors.The score Carpenter provided this film transitions between eerie atmospherics to downright hammering suspense, it easily rubs shoulders to his earlier work.JC's finest to date edging out his most recognized film Halloween.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern Gothic horror tale that is creepy yet not gory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment this tale gets off the ground, it grips you to the point of not being able to look away from the screen for a minute. You don't even want to blink. It is a practically perfect tale of an almost justifiable revenge as a hundred year old town on the California coast celebrates its centennial, not realizing that it was founded on greed, murder, and bloodshed. Now, out of the blue, a coastal fog comes in off the Pacific, and with it are the ghosts of the victims determined to settle a score. Breathy newscaster Adrienne Barbeau catches on to what the fog really is, and seeks to warn the townspeople out celebrating the anniversary as the fog creeps in.Fresh from her six year stint as Barbara on "Maude" (and a year after Stockard Channing took on her Broadway role of Rizzo in the movie "Grease"), Barbeau is stunning, and that on-air voice of hers is the perfect acting choice, as if she was the dead wife Rebecca from Daphne DuMaurier's classic narrating the opening of Alfred Hitchcock's film version instead of Joan Fontaine's second Mrs. DeWinter. Indeed, there are hints of the magnificent photography in that Gothic mystery, as well as 1939's "Wuthering Heights" and 1944's "Jane Eyre". Check out the shots of the lighthouse on the ocean. That, among many other camera shots, make it clear that this isn't the type of horror movie audiences were used to getting in the mid-late 1970's.With a music score that I find spookier than the theme from "The Exorcist", "The Fog" has so many elements of the great Universal horror films of the 30's, and even some of the great British supernatural thrillers such as "Dead of Night". In fact, I think this is a better horror film than "The Exorcist", a film overloaded with moments that now seem silly, not scary. There are only one or two moments in "The Fog" that I considered silly, and there is only one element of gory in a close-up of one of the ghosts. That's what makes this film creepier. Some of the elements of this film I noticed were used in the later horror classic "Poltergeist". This is certainly better than another ghost story from the same time, "The Amytiville Horror".As for the other cast members, they are all fine, but their characters really are not as well explored as Barbeau's radio station owner/DJ single mom who is strong, yet tender, and before the horror strikes, extremely funny. Once the horror hits, she remains brave and determined to do what she needs to do to protect her son, home with only the elderly baby sitter to watch over him. Jaime Lee Curtis and Janet Leigh aren't as fleshed out in their characterizations as Barbeau's are, but are fine with what they have to do. Hal Holbrook, as the priest who first discovers the truth about the history of the town, is excellent as always, and John Houseman has a nice cameo at the beginning as a wise old local man introducing the story.It's nice to see a horror movie in the year of the first "Friday the 13th" that doesn't depend on blood, gore, and gross-out effects to get audiences into the theatre. That, plus a story where the villains get some sympathy for their evilness, makes this a must see, especially for horror fans and cinema students. After being mesmerized by Adrienne Barbeau's recent performance as a mobster's vengeful ex-wife on "General Hospital", this film was justification for me that she is certainly one of most underrated stars of our time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched "The Fog" last night, and I didn't expect that much to be honest, even if it is the master that is John Carpenter! It certainly isn't his best but definitely works as a classic 70's supernatural slasher and it is actually really enjoyable.The atmosphere has to be the best thing in this film. If you watched this on a foggy night then you really would be quite scared! The direction is brilliant as it builds up this really unnerving tension throughout the film and so when the fog comes it's actually quite terrifying, even if it is just a really powerful smoke machine with a torch shining on it! The score is another highlight, it's so creepy and catchy like the "Halloween" score, both actually composed by John himself! In fact the music does really well to keep the tension and atmosphere to its thickest.However, it isn't all rosy. "The Fog" has a lot of problems that restrain it from being a proper classic. Although it is quite violent, it isn't bloody enough. John should've been much more brave with the use of gore. Most is left to our imagination and so it isn't particularly memorable.None of the characters are particularly likable either. Jamie Lee and her hitchhiker pal aren't particularly useful or memorable for that fact. In fact the characters aren't particularly well written at all! John decides to put in too many characters so we can't connect deeply with them as we would've liked to.The ending was also a bit of a cop-out, I won't ruin it for you but it's a little childish if you get what I mean. However the direct ending before the credits is superb! In the end (no pun intended) we have not-quite-so Carpenter classic but nevertheless a certainly enjoyable and memorable film with guaranteed scares if you watch it during a foggy night. The plot and idea is certainly original and so I would definitely recommend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it received fair reviews, The Fog was unfairly compared to John Carpenter's Halloween. While it may not be quite as good as Halloween, its still a fantastic movie on its own terms, a dark, chilling ghost story.The story progresses through different characters' perspectives rather than just one protagonist. The first night of mayhem immediately sets the tone of the film, strange events, a mounting sense of dread, and then pure terror as the undead spirits who are part of the fog strike with brutal violence. After the memorable opener, we gradually learn of the history of the little town the film is set in, Antonio Bay, and its dark past, revealing to us that the supernatural events are the result of a curse, the past literally coming back to haunt the present. When the fog rolls in the second time, the mayhem begins again, leading to a thrilling climax.Possibly the director's most under-rated flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Zombie' ghosts wielding blades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fog containing zombie-like ghosts seeking revenge on the 100th anniversary of their deaths besieges a small California seaside town. Halloween's (1978) horror creative duo John Carpenter and Debra Hill reunite with Jamie Lee Curtis (in a smaller role) for this effective ghost tale.Adrienne Barbeau's character Stevie Wayne is centre to this horror chiller, even though she spends most of her time held-up in a lighthouse, transmitting her radio show. Carpenter's The Fog is more about the story than central characters. The cast appear to get equal screen time, including Janet Leigh (Curtis' mother) of Psycho (1960), Tom Atkins notable The Howling (1981) star and George 'Buck' Flower of They Live (1988) to name a few. Veteran actor Hal Holbrook gives a fine performance as the guilt-ridden priest Malone.Despite the dated smoke machine-like fog the silent 'zombie' ghosts, brandishing blades, with their glowing eyes are eerily effective heightened by an accompanying typical Carpenter pulsing score.There are a few effective kills but like most good horrors some of these happen off screen. It's mostly shot on location this adds a realistic atmosphere of dread to the proceedings. There are some cheap 'jump' scares in there but what's noteworthy of The Fog is it's set ups, the spooky opening, the creepy gallon and the paranormal effects on the cars and electricity of the town. The Fog appears to be a series of great idea's brought together with a single horror tale as its backbone.It's not perfect, but The Fog's absorption makes it entertaining nonetheless. Perfect on a dark night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERShttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikSB76PNkRUTHE FOG REVIEW Coming off the heels of his highly successful breakthrough film, HALLOWEEN, John Carpenter signed a two picture deal with AVCO/EMBASSEY, and in 1980 released THE FOG. Though it was a profitable film domestically at the box office and made twenty times it's original budget, critically, the film was considered a disappointment. In all fairness, this film certainly can be viewed as a disappointment compared to Halloween. But then again, how can it NOT be? We're talking about Halloween, one of the most highly influential horror films of all time. I mean, c'mon cut him some slack here. It's kind of like when Alfred Hitchcock followed up Psycho with The Birds. It's a solid film, and an excellent demonstration of the director's aesthetic, but it clearly isn't on the same level as Psycho, and therefore, can't really be compared to it. This is the case in relation to The Fog. It's also a solid film, and it was made during what are, arguably, the peak years of Carpenter's career. And it's an excellent example of his aesthetic, as well as a demonstration of his mastery of low-budget filmmaking. The Fog begins with the centennial anniversary of Antonio Bay, a fishing town in California. As the clock strikes midnight, strange occurrences begin happening throughout the town. Three fishermen are out on the ocean, when an ominous glowing fog envelops the ship. The fishermen see what appears to be an ancient ship, as well as shadowy figures obscured by darkness and the fog. That turns out to be the last thing they see, as they are then brutally stabbed to death.The next day, the story follows the lives of several Antonio Bay residents. Stevie Wayne is the local disc jockey, as well as a single parent. Nick Castle is a fisherman trying to find out what happened to his three friends and fellow fishermen. Tagging along is Elizabeth, a free-spirited hitchhiker that Nick picked up the night before. Kathy Williams is a town dignitary and is organizing the evening's celebration activities, along side her perpetually bored assistant Sandy. And finally, there's Father Malone, who discovers his father's diary. He learns that one hundred years ago, his grandfather and five other co-conspirators deliberately misled a man called Blake, who was a wealthy man but also afflicted with leprosy. Blake wanted to settle a colony on Antonio Bay, However, a fear of leprosy and greed for Blake's gold caused the conspirators to mislead and sabotage Blakes ship, which crashed along the rocks, killing everyone on board. Father Malone fears that, on this 100 year anniversary of the founding of Antonio Bay, Blake and his crew have returned to exact their revenge.FOR MORE, CLICK ON THE LINKhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikSB76PNkRU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Fog" tells of the seaside town of Antonio Bay, which seems to have a problem on their hands. During the 100-year celebration, a mysterious fog rolls in off of the bay and soon the residents realize that with the fog, are ghost pirates out for revenge for the intentional shipwreck that occurred 100 years ago and helped to start the town as the residents know it today. Very eerie atmosphere, the creepy lighthouse, the church, and the town itself are all perfect settings for a ghost story. Also, the movie starts with an old man telling the story of the ghost pirates to a group of young kids, which really helps to set the creepy tone of the movie. The acting is pretty good with a (mostly) all-star cast, and a good script. Whether you like John Carpenter's movies or are just a fan of horror in general, check this out!Rated: R for Violence Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about bad weather! When the fog rolls in on a sleepy coastal village, its townspeople find themselves being stalked by a group of vengeful sea-faring ghosts, whose hundred year slumber has finally come to an end. Strange occurrences pile up as the body-count rises before folks wise up to what is happening, but is it too late to save the town, and more importantly, themselves? A chilling score, spooky atmosphere and an authentic sea-side setting all combine to make this one of the best ghost stories of the 80's and one of writer/director John Carpenter's personal best as well. It also helps that the film is host to one of the ensemble casts in horror history. Carpenter regulars such as Charles Cyphers, Adrienne Barbeau and Nancy Loomis star alongside the likes of Jamie Lee Curtis (reuniting with Carpenter for the first time since "Halloween"), Janet Leigh and Hal Holbrook. Heck, there's even 80's horror/cult icon Tom Atkins, who you'll notice is without his trademark mustache. The film itself, like all of Carpenter's best work, moves at a slow pace, bubbling with a sense of dread and mounting suspense before releasing its knockout conclusion.Sandwiched between more celebrated Carpenter classic such as "Halloween," "The Thing" and "Escape From New York," "The Fog" is often overlooked and in turn, is one of the director's most underrated films. Certain aspects of the film might make it appear dated (the cars, the haircuts) but the film still holds up as a classy and thrilling little chiller. Those looking for a thick slice of supernatural suspense will clearly find what they need in "The Fog".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog isn't scary at all, but what I like about it is its atmosphere. It's just... cool. From the scenes of the dense fog rolling into the bay, to the shadows of the ghouls emerging from it, to John Carpenter's self-composed soundtrack, to Adrienne Barbeau being trapped at her (cool) lighthouse radio station. When John Carpenter's good, he's really good. It's pretty unusual for me to really like a horror that isn't scary and doesn't feature a suffocating, claustrophobic atmosphere. For a Carpenter horror that's both cool and scary (kinda) though, The Thing is the one to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the fog rolls in, take precaution. When a town is cursed, take cover! In the "The Fog", a coastal town is terrorized by an evil mist, and ghosts of the past. The reason for this scare is because most of the descendants have killed the visitors of a shipwreck. The town's history is full of lies. No wonder the ghosts are furious. The descendants have taken their prized possessions, and turned it into a big gold cross. The DJ shouldn't have been one of the guilty, she had nothing to do for this to happen. The cast of this movie were indeed well chosen: Adrienne Barbeau of "Maude" fame; Jamie Lee Curtis of "Halloween" fame; her mother, Janet Leigh of "Psycho" fame; Hal Holbrook and many others did this movie justice. John Carpenter did a great job doing the movie. It's a true classic. I really enjoyed it! 4.5 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carpenters worst? I disagree. It was one of Carpenters first, and taken that in consideration it's pretty damn good. It's a good example of how to get a movie scary even before the time of CGI monsters and ghosts. I felt the film had a very realistic look, and the fog hiding the probably cheesy costumes where brilliant. Another one of Carpenters great money saving ideas i bet.The acting was good, although the characters was both good and not to good. Some where just there to fill in the space while others had pretty good roles. I especially like Jamie Lee Curtis and Adrienne Barbeau's roles. The story in itself is pretty simple, zombie like ghosts out for revenge for something that was stolen from them exactly 100 years ago. Simple but very effective and entertaining.This is a true horror flick classic, and a John Carpenter (who by the way was also in the film for a few minutes) classic. It was not the best of Carpenters films I've seen, but much taken in consideration I've decided to give it a 9/10. If you're a Carpenter fan, you must see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter Hammers Together Another Well-Constructed Winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years after John Carpenter stunned the world with the enormous financial success of 1978's "Halloween"--to this day, one of the most lucrative independent films ever made ($50 million made on a $320,000 investment!)--the writer/director/composer switched gears a bit and, along with co-writer Debra Hill, delivered a comparatively restrained but nonetheless highly effective ghost story: "The Fog." As most of the world by now knows, this film tells the story of the small town of Antonio Bay, in northern CA, on the occasion of its 100th anniversary, when the vengeful spirits of a century-old shipwreck roll in, shrouded by a weirdly glowing and unnatural fog. Viewers who go into this movie expecting to see rotting pirate zombies or leprous cadavers may be in for a disappointment, as Carpenter and Hill here seem to follow the Val Lewton credo that the viewer's imagination will supply images far scarier than anything a filmmaker can put on screen. Still, it is remarkable how much bang Carpenter &amp; Co. get from their simple images of swirling mist and ghostly, shadowy forms carrying scythes and grappling hooks. What the picture boasts more than anything is a genuinely creepy atmosphere of escalating menace, skillfully abetted by sharp direction and a wonderful score. A cast of real pros adds immensely to the fun, including John Houseman (who tells one helluva campfire story!), Hal Holbrook, Tom Atkins and what almost seems, in retrospect, a quartet of the horror genre's finest actresses: Janet Leigh, Jamie Lee Curtis, "Halloween"'s Nancy Loomis and, especially, Adrienne Barbeau. Filmed largely at Point Reyes Station and Inverness, CA, "The Fog" looks both quaint and picturesque; a charming backdrop for the decidedly unholy and supernatural mishegas that ultimately transpires. My psychotronic guru, Rob, tells me, by the way, that the 2005 remake of "The Fog" is quite lame and one to seriously avoid. Stay away from that "Fog"; do enter this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good old-fashioned ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's followup to "Halloween" isn't as good--but how could it be? Still it's a fun horror film.Antonia Bay, a small town on California coast, is celebrating its 100th birthday. Among the residents are Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau) the local disc jockey; a woman (Janet Leigh) planning the celebration with her helper (Nancy Loomis); a truck driver (Tom Atkins) who picks up a hitchhiker (Jamie Lee Curtis) and an alcoholic guilt-ridden priest (Hal Holbrook). The night of the celebration a mysterious fog rolls in with a bunch of vengeful ghosts in it. But why are they killing people and who can stop them? This film was released in 1980 and was considered a disappointment. I saw it back then originally. While I agree it's no classic I didn't think it was the bomb all critics were saying it was. As a good old-fashioned ghost story it works. It's beautifully directed by Carpenter with tons of creepy atmosphere and effective use of wide screen photography. There's also another nice music score by Carpenter (he did the one for "Halloween" also). There's a few great scenes here: John Houseman telling a bunch of children a ghost story around a campfire; the shots of the fog quickly enveloping the town; the glow the fog has in it; the attack scenes (which are more heard than seen); Atkins and Curtis trying to get a truck started while the ghosts slowly move in and Barbeau being attacked when she's all alone in the lighthouse.What stops this from being a true classic is mostly a very choppy storyline and some so-so acting. There was a huge amount of post-production work done on this (the original cut supposedly wasn't scary) and that could account for the jerkiness. Atkins and Curtis are as good as they could be with some seriously under-written characters; Leigh and Loomis are lots of fun and bring a nice touch of humor; Barbeau (who I never liked) was actually very good but Holbrook walks through his role.This does not deserve the R rating it got. In a New Yorker interview with Carpenter the reporter said he was on the phone telling production people that the kid in the movie should not be hurt--he wanted a PG. There's no sex or nudity and only one instance of swearing. There's no blood or gore at all--as I said before you HEAR things mostly. So why the R? This is cool old-fashioned ghost story that provides a few nice jolts. Recommend.There are two cute horror references in this: one character is coming from Bodega Bay (where Hitchcock's "The Birds" took place) and I noticed Dr. Phibes listed in the closing credits!</fullReview>

Especially, the lighthouse radio station that only broad-casted it's programming from 6pm until 1am. Despite it's lacking in some technical authenticity, such as a disc jockey without a headphone set, (no feedback!)and the over lit car dashboards, (maybe that was intentional by the director) this movies succeeds in it's mission to creep you out. I thought the opening storytelling scene by the firelight, at the beach was really effective at setting the tone for the rest of the movie.From the lighthouse radio station at the bottom of the long stairway, to the lonely, dark church where the main characters ended up, along with the quiet sparsely populated region, this movie is effective at creating all the visuals of helplessness the victims of the fog feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog Will Creep In And Poke Your Eyes Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyond a doubt this is John Carpenter's best movie and one of the greatest horror films ever made. The remake which came out this month (October 2005) is good and has some tremendous special effects that will linger in your mind and in your dreams. Toward the end there is one scene when one of the ghosts chases the mayor down the streets that is eerie and truly frightening. Still, the original is much more cerebral. One of the scariest moments in both films is when the ghosts pound on the door. In the original the pounding is like what you would hear on your own door. In the remake the pounding is so intense that it's like headache number 13. The normal pounding is more effective. The next time someone knocks on your door, you will hesitate before opening it.The remake is also lacking one of the most noble features of the original, the prologue by the gifted actor John Houseman. It is probably a good thing that the remake did not try to duplicate the prologue. Who could fill John Houseman's shoes? The original leaves much to the viewer's imagination, even the ghost story itself is only intimated. This makes for a stronger story structure. Another advantage the original has over the remake is the stellar cast. Though the acting is sufficient in the remake it is not of the high caliber of the original cast.There is not much humor in the original whereas the remake does have some funny parts. One of the funniest lines in the remake is by the African-American Spooner, "And leave my forefathers out of this! I'm from Chicago. Southside." As Hitchcock discovered humor helps relieve much of the hectic pace of a suspense thriller.The original also connects with another classic suspense film by the master, "The Birds." The viewer sees Highway 101 along the California coast. Soon Bodega Bay is mentioned. The remake takes place farther up the coast in Oregon.The remake is OK for those who have not seen the original, but for us who have seen the original, there is no substitute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loving a flawed horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually mention where and when I saw the movies I critique; this one was at the now-defunct Riverpark Cinema in Spokane in 1980. The Fog is something of a flawed but unnerving sophomore horror flick by John Carpenter (Halloween was the freshman here). I say flawed because there just wasn't quite enough story to keep the movie, as a whole, from looking anemic. By the third reel, Carpenter is killing off characters who really don't need to die to advance the horror and there's lots of driving about with breathless urgency. If the principles would just calm down, then, well, nevermind--you get the point. The movie would be over too early. Now, that's the criticism. Here's the compliment: By use of really effective photography and Carpenter's somewhat self-absorbed, synthesized soundtrack, the viewer will actually begin to feel the chill of the fog. The coast of Northern California is not a hospitable place; the damp creeps like little cats' feet (sorry Mr. Frost) and Carpenter's atmospherics almost, almost make up for the logic flaws and the wooden performances. I love this movie for these reasons and I forgive it for its mistakes.</fullReview>

The simple, yet effective, music for this film, scored by Carpenter himself, sets the tone for this eerie story about a small coastal town (Antonio Bay) about to be revisited by the dead it wronged decades ago. Though somewhat dated, The Fog has gained cult status and is a spooky film for the whole family to enjoy on a dark night.

		<fullReview>John Carpenter knew how to use subtlety when he made this horror film. Without any great special effects or break-neck speed character development and plot formation, he manages to deliver some of the old-world horror that touts the likes of Psycho.The movie is basically about the legend of an old curse that comes to life. Centuries ago a ship full of lepers was wrecked upon the rocky shore of a small town. The perished crew swore vengeance on the culprits who caused their deaths. Now present day, their curse begins to take hold on the citizens of the town as a dense fog creeps across the water and onto the land. Bodies soon begin disappearing and everyone flees for their lives from the terrors lurking in the fog.We she such stars as Adrienne Barbeau, Hal Holbrook, and a very young Jamie Lee Curtis. This film is definitely a good horror with a classic ghost-story feel to it. I think Carpenter should have continued on with the formula he used in this earlier material.</fullReview>

I loved it. In those days John Carpenter was the undisputed horror master and all of us kids made every effort to see his movies despite the "R" ratings. Fortunately, movie theaters back then were a lot less picky regarding who they sold tickets to, but that's another story. The film still stands the the test of time. **Possible spoilers ** Its plot is a simple revenge tale. Similar stories have been done countless times in previous movies. But John Carptenter's take on the revenge tale was somehow different. Perhaps it's the mixture of sea faring folklore combined with a brilliantly creepy musical score. Perhaps it's something else. All I know is this movie is genuinely frightening and entertaining. The supernatural elements of the film are believable. In fact, you even sympathize a little with the killers in this movie because they were indeed wronged.I strongly suggest renting this if you haven't seen it before. And if you have seen it and it's been a while, why not rediscover a classic horror movie from the golden age of the 1980s?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film to watch on a foggy evening.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it was first released and have enjoyed it many times over the years. Every time there is a foggy night, I pull out this movie and watch it all over again. I like the story line to this movie. I think the "ghosts" are out to avenge their wrongful deaths. I mean, they were lepers. The town of Antonio Bay didn't want their colony so close to them, so they arranged for their ship to crash on the rocks. You get a creep feeling over you when the town goes crazy on the first night. And when you finally see what is in the fog, you'll be glued to the screen. I think the acting was excellent as well. Adrienne Barbeau and Jamie Lee Curtis were terrific. If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you do! You won't be sorry!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's and Debra Hill's follow up to "Halloween". In this moviea town is celebrating its 100th Birthday. What they don't know is that the town is doomed. It was formed with blood money! Now the ghost live in "The Fog" and the ghost are seeking revenge! Jamie Lee Curtis and her mom Janet Leigh star! ( They have little screen time together). This is more graphic than "Halloween" but it still a creepy delight. Now if your a fan of "The Birds" listen to the audio comentary of the DVD. John Carpenter will tell you what locations that Hitch used for "The Birds" and that John Capenter also used in "The Fog". If you love this movie I urge you to see "When A Stranger Calls"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A superbly crafted film. John Carpenter really had me scared! The story is divided between two main heroines that never meet (Jamie Lee Curtis' character and the other female DJ in the lighthouse) but it's still tense and scary at times. Some of you have quoted saying it's in the same tone as Hitchcock or Poe, but i'd have to say Lovecraft as there are refernces to places such as 'Arkham' in the film, and the town is sort-of based on Innsmouth. Carpenter MUST have read at least one H.P.Lovecraft story before he set out to direct this amazing film! The ghost lepers were pretty scary - you never see their faces, just their glowing red eyes or their mangled skeletal hands! And the scene at the end where all the characters meet the priest, hide in the church and make a final defence/stand against the fog ghosts reminded me of Sam Rami's THE EVIL DEAD or the British cult DOG SOLDIERS. I'm surprised this film doesn't rank as one of horror's greats, it truley deserves it! I would highly recommend this, along with some hot, sweet popcorn and soda for a great night in!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>horror masterpiece with a message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cleverly shot, scripted, and set with the creepiest of soundtracks (Carpenter's own), this film is a masterpiece of the horror genre, representing the best work of the Capenter\Hill\Cudney team (aka Halloween) in their prime. The trio compromises nothing, and ensures that each shot\sequence is packaged with maximum visual and cinematic effect. The story builds efficiently, as puzzle pieces come together, to a terrifying conclusion. This film is often compared to Hitchcock, but I think it's better compared to Poe (putting it in an elite rank of very few).Although most of us agree in our revel of the scare tactics employed here, what I am suprised many are missing is the message it conveys. Beyond the obvious 'veil of horror' in this ghost story, there is a powerful message and moral of the story that is subtle. As was masterfully conveyed by Poe -the quintissential horrorist- that message is revenge. Misdeeds to others ultimately, and inevitably, come back to haunt you. Revenge is unrelentless, will live through generations, and will come back to haunt you and your bloodlines. It's an ancient message, but a profound one nonetheless, one that is rarely seen in film. But the Carpenter team captures it in a manner that would even have Edgar Allen Poe nodding in fiendish approval.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very scary movie I mean it was pretty damn scary. It's hard for a movie to scare me have me on the edge of my seat waiting for something to jump out at you but this movie did a good job at it. The suspense was good and I jumped more than a few times. The jump scares weren't lazy like in Resident evil they stemmed from the atmosphere, which was very good as well. Fog will always be creepy and to take something that is naturally creepy add to it and turn it into a movie is a stroke of geniuses. The fog builds the atmosphere wonderfully and once the fog comes into the screen and it implied that now anything can come out at any time I was livid waiting for it to happen.The performances are good Adrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, Jaime lee Curtis and Janet Leigh star and all do well with their roles.Another thing worth mentioning is the music yes Carpenter has created another masterful score while not as good as the Halloween theme its still unnerving.So I say watch this movie if you want a fun time being scared Carpenter said he wanted to make "a spook ride on film" and he has</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I say definitely worth watching if you enjoy a ghost story. This movie has a fun cast of familiar faces, some good old fashioned creepiness, and some good old fashioned cheap thrills. I would say the only disappointment was the need to throw in some violent slasher scenes instead of leaving it to the very powerful imagination as John Carpenter and Debra Hill intended to do. However, it was what was demanded by the viewers of the time, and I simply overlook it knowing what the original intentions of the movie were meant to be.Beautiful photography that captures the mood and makes this movie pleasing to the eye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great flick by the genious John Carpenter. I can't believe I had not seen it. I bought it at the local grocery store for 10 dollars. The scene I liked the best was the opening sequence on the beach when the kid finds the piece of drift wood. That was scary. Also, I liked that no nonsense disc jockey (john carpenter's wife). She saved that town. The FOG GHOSTS with the red eyes were very creepy also...especially when that cross made of gold appeared. John Carpenter's music was good...I like his creepy casio keyboard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible SpoilersI'm hurt by the amount of people who disregard John Carpenter's film, The Fog as nonsense. Though the director himself denies and scoffs at such supernatural existences it's this doubt that make his films so credible. There is no tongue in cheek here; this is all played out as sincerely as Michael Myers getting up after being shot six times. During it's making Carpenter himself has to re-shoot certain scenes to spice up The Fog. Despite it's flaws John Carpenter's THE FOG (I hate it when they confuse it with the novel by James Herbert!) is a genuinely good modern ghost story. It concerns the spirits of long dead pirates that were led to their death by the inhabitants of a small coastal village, and now, exactly one century later it's time for retribution.As always JC's score is simple but excellent, the cinematography fabricating the piece to be far more expensive than is its budget should allow and, despite inconsistencies in the script, this is another great film for fanatics of John Carpenter's works. Plus there are some great performances, especially by Carpenter's then wife, Adrienne Barbeau It might not be Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween, The Thing or Big Trouble in Little China, but is definitely worth analyses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog is typical for many Carpenter films, a visceral experience soon to be forgotten. Halloween has dated a lot in the last 25 years and most of his other works are stunted in the creativity department by lack of vision or budget limitations. Perhaps only The Thing will have the most staying power of his works and I certainly appreciate it the most. The Fog, unfortunately, is another supernatural thriller that isn't very super. It is better than the last few haunted house movies made, but still lacks the depth necessary to make a really good ghost story. The premise is interesting, but the cast and execution kill it pretty fast.Overall, when it comes between Carpenter and Cronenberg, I choose the latter. I will take most of Carpenter over Craven, though. It is a sort of duel between ukuleles and banjos. Not much else to say about a film with too many obvious "made-for-tv" qualities.

		<fullReview>This is an interesting but minor addition to John Carpenter's filmography. Directly inspired on H.P. Lovecraft's "The Doom that came to Sarnath", and the sea horror tales written by Hope Hodgson, this movie is a good exercise of thrill and scariness, but not as excellent as everybody says.The atmospheric setting and the insane photography are the best qualities of this humble production. Although you can enjoy Jamie Lee Curtis, Hal Holbrook, Janet Leigh and Tom Atkins, their characters are not charismatic at all and the film lacks of the chilling and claustrophobic rhythm of Halloween. Despite all of these matters, "The Fog" is a good example of well done horror B-movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 stars... even with the plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic horror film, but there just happen to be a few plot holes you can drive a small import vehicle through... if the ghosts are seeking the conspirators, why may I ask are they stalking the likes of Adrienne Barbeau &amp; her son, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins if they had nothing to do with the original crime? Are they the only ones in their cars that night? Where are the rest of the townfolk? Why aren't the ghost going after them? Why do the ghosts stalk between 12 &amp; 1 the first night, but start at sundown the next? I'm confused...All that aside, I still rate this 8 stars out of ten, simply because of the perfect ambiance. This film has one of the greatest opening sequences in horror film history.Cinematography is beautiful, with stellar composition in each shot. I don't think there is a single shot that looks like it went without careful planning. Carpenter masterfully to build up the suspense amazingly for the first 45 minutes, then goes full throttle for the second half. This is one of the all time great mood movies.Too bad the plot holes couldn't have been sewn up before the release, but that doesn't keep this from being one of Carpenter's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fogtabulous ghost story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!John Carpenter is one of those directors I admire yet cannot reallyfeel compelled to say he's great. If his career had ended after 'TheThing' in 1982 he would be remembered with greater affection. Asit is, he just seems now to be a journeyman director. Shame.However, 'The Fog' is an excellent horror movie that belies it's lowbudget status. Its use of superlative special effects of the titularcreature, the pulse-pounding music score which sets up thetension adequately, and the excellent cast all provide a non-stoprollercoaster ride of tension.The evocation of a small town America is nicely portrayed. What isa good starting point of the film is the idea of 'a town with a guiltysecret'. Now, of course, this has been done to death - see 'King'sRow' for the ultimate - but what makes it more appealing is that thechurch, and the vicars need to create a township through thebetrayal of others ensures a resonance that makes it stand outfrom other examples. Of course, this being a ghost story, we must have ghosts. Fromtheir very first appearance as they step off their ghostly galleon (asuperb special effect) onto a trawler, to their attack upon thechurch that holds the secret of the town, they come across assuperb creations. The fog envelopes them, making their figuresstand out prominently against the light. They create an ambiencenot seen since the 40s. Inded, their attacks as they loom out of thelight create genuine moments of tension. However, did they reallyneed glowing red eyes? Mmm...As for the structuring of the film... well, yes, the ideas are fine as isthe playing of the cast. What slightly lets it down is that (as usual)Carpenter plays out two climaxes at once. Admittedly, both aredone very stylishly with a good eye for effect and judicious use ofediting. However, as the scenes switch between one and anothera feeling of dissipation is evident for the viewer. Saying this, mind,the story could not really be structured any other way. Still, this isonly a minor distraction.It is a shame that 'The Fog' is often always neglected, coming after'Halloween' as it did. For me, it is a superior ghost story than manyothers and it was a brave attempt by Carpenter to extend his horrorrange and because of this integrity he lifts it substantially aboveother movies of this ilk. It is in no way a masterpiece, but if youwant thrills and tension then this is a welcome choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film probably for the hundreth time today and this film never gets boring nor does the chilling effect it leaves on the watcher. Why,John Carpenter doesn't make films like this anymore with a truly menacing feel to it like this film and Halloween,even his venture into sci-fi horror with the reamake of The Thing has a truly creepy ominious feel to the people in jeopardy and the atmosphere of the movie. His last great horror film was in the Mouth of Madness and that was not really him being creative it was an homage to the great HP Lovecraft. Vampires was okay but films like Prince Of Darkness,and his last one the truly god-awful Ghosts of Mars was so bad that Courtney Love walked out of filming her role in the movie. This movie is very suspenseful and has great acting from the always underrated talent of Adrienne Barbeau as the DJ in peril in the lighthouse Stevie Wayne. The paring of real life mom and daughter Janet leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis was a neat idea even though neither actress has much of a character in this movie. And the leper/ghosts at the end were very visually creepy looking as you finally get a good look as to what's coming out of the Fog. Is an time horror classic.**** out of ***** C'mon John Carpenter make real horror films like this classic again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***** Mild Spoilers Ahead ***An old man (John Houseman) tells a scary story at midnight to boys gathered around a campfire as "The Fog" begins. The tale involves a shipwreck which happened one hundred years ago. This campfire story turns out to be true, and unfortunately for the folks of Antonio Bay, the dead are going to rise from the sea during the witching hour of midnight on the anniversary of their shipwreck.A man driving down a deserted road near Antonio Bay picks up a young hitchiker (Jamie Lee Curtis) and frightening things begin to happen to them. A single mother (Adrienne Barbeau) of one of the boys at the campfire operates a radio station in an old lighthouse on the coastline. She and a man who is in contact with her at a weather station in the bay are first to notice the odd glowing fog and the strange way in which it moves in various directions, even against the wind. As a local celebration is being planned by a woman of the town (Janet Leigh), more frightening and ominous events begin to occur, involving a priest (Hal Holbrook) who is the grandson of a man who caused the shipwreck by building a fire to draw the ship to rocks in the water and it's doom. Three men on a boat are killed by ghosts who walk in the fog. The eerie glowing fog is headed straight for the town and death is sure to follow.This is a great movie if you like movies which make you jump out of your seat. John Carpenter, the director, is excellent at creating fear and tension. The atmosphere of the film is often creepy. The major drawbacks of the film are bland dialogue and lack of character development and interaction. Some work on these shortcomings and this might have become a classic. As it stands, "The Fog" is a good scary movie which I think fans of horror movies will enjoy. I rate it a 79/100. Are you ready for "The Fog"?</fullReview>

It will please modern audiences just as much as it pleases fans of "classic horror." It has excellent suspense, plenty of scares, and a very interesting atmosphere.

		<fullReview>This was a great film that emphasized suspense over gore. There was little to no violence in the film, and the eerie atmosphere was excellent. The acting was great by Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau, and Curtis' mother Janet Leigh, making for a powerful ensemble cast. Even the ghosts in the fog were well acted (mostly by the effects people and crew members). The direction was also very well done, and was paced in a way that made the terror gradually rise, and left you at the edge of your seat. The score (done by John Carpenter's own band)was great as well. The one thing that confused me was the reason for the R rating, which was not necessary. There was only one scene of any type of gore, which lasted all of a few seconds. The violence was less than most modern films that get PG-13 ratings today, and there was almost no language to speak of. It might have been rated R for the terror element of it, but that should not be a reason for the rating. Overall, the film was well done and well worth the rental. If you are getting the movie, get the special edition DVD with all of the special features, and look out for the easter egg on the special features page.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenters follow-up to "Halloween". That's a tough act to follow and I felt that this movie just didn't live up to it. Not that I'm saying this movie is bad, far from it. This movie, which I bought for watching on Halloween one year surprised me for how good it actually was. The acting in parts, along with the dialogue got on my nerves as to the poor quality at times, but the camera work and lighting made up for the low points. One last gripe is the character of the radio DJ Adrienne Barbeau (Stevie Wayne). Whenever she was on the "airwaves" I lost interest in the movie. The shots of the fog rolling through the town and the barely visible ghosts heighten the tension of the movie. The fog is a life-force onto itself which you don't want to go near it if you see it. All in all, "The Fog" was a successful movie for me but it would have been better if the backstory would have been fleshed out a bit more, and if the script were a bit more polished. See this film if you'd like a good scare and allow me to pass on a kernel of information...don't go into the fog!</fullReview>

To soak in all that wonderful atmosphere and photography is just as special as it was when I first saw this film.Makes me appreciate not being a kid today and not having to be subjected to the absolute garbage that is pop culture now! (TV, music, movies) etc, etc...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A visual and atmospheric treat, pure horror genius. If there was ever a film that told you everything you needed to know about good horror films, then this is it.Based on a novel by James Herbert, The Fog takes us through a story about a little village by a seacoast that holds a terrifying history of a group of pirates who were double crossed by the villagers long ago and left to perish. The only problem is now they are back and hungry for vengeance.Carpenter shows us that what you don't see really is what scares the hell out of people. He uses the fog to astonishing effect to make the viewer feel claustrophobic and really builds the tension with wonderfully composed camera shots.The result is horror at its most chilling best, essential viewing for anyone who has ever wanted to be terrified.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following the success of HALLOWEEN, Carpenter and Debra Hill presented THE FOG to us in 1979, and they do not fail. Now the movie is not as creative or eerie as HALLOWEEN, but it is eerie in its own way. Filmed up the coast near Frisco, Dean Cundey presents the film in spectacular photography. Carpenter's music is again creepy and unique. Overall, the film is worthy as are all of Carpenter's films. Give it a view, if you're a true Carpenter idolizer, you should appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely crafted ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Give John Carpenter and Debra Hill credit for trying to craft a spooky, old-fashioned ghost story and, for the most part, succeeding. "The Fog," about a 100-year-old crime that comes back to haunt a northern Californian coastal community, is an intelligent film with appealing, sympathetic characters, gorgeous cinematography, an actual story to tell, and an excellent cast (Adrienne Barbeau being the standout). Unfortunately, Carpenter and Hill seem too aware of the need to live up to the reputation they established with 1978's "Halloween." The result is a film that, while generally compelling, works overtime to frighten us. Still, it's many notches above most horror films from the '80s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wasn't at all what I was expecting from those involved with this film but what do you know? I loved it! This film is very old-fashioned in many ways and uses the less is more rule of horror storytelling very effectively although a little bit of gore was added to placate audiences of the time and era. The Poe quote opening the film seems to me very appropriate as the film is often eerie and almost dreamlike(or should I say Nightmare-like)--almost like something Val Lewton might have produced in the 1940s but with modern sensibilities and EC comics style zombies. Many little stories are told within the film to build up tension and suspense in the audience and I felt these work very well. A good ride with a simple ghostly revenge plot--it works. It's solid entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE FOG is a classic supernatural horror masterpiece that will never die! I have been waiting impatiently for the DVD release of this treasure...and finally, MGM has released a fantastic Special Edition with brand new interviews (including director John Carpenter, producer Debra Hill, and star Adrienne Barbeau...) As a kid, this movie scared the sh*t out of me... and it still packs a punch today! John Carpenter's masterful direction and storytelling blended with perfect atmosphere and a fun cast make for a superb supernatural work of art. And of course, Carpenter's classic throbbing and tantalizing score works it's magic on your ears...and especially builds in the final 30 minutes, really putting you under the spell of the movie. The FOG itself is a creepy and fun effect! I'd rather watch the magically lit glowing FOG than any CGI eye-candy that they put in today's flicks. The rotting dead are also very frightening with their sharp hooks, sickles, and seaweed soaked skin. They are especially creepy looking toward the end with glowing red eyes!! Why don't we see movie monsters as scary as these guys in today's flicks??? I often say that I would love to see Carpenter re-make a modern day version of THE FOG...But then I realize, why mess with perfection? Do yourself a favor and check out one of the best Supernatural tales ever filmed...THE FOG! It will Blow You Away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lepers Conned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Debra Hill and John Carpenter spin this old-fashioned and somewhat chilling yarn about a maritime colony of lepers looking for a slice of peace near the Northern California coastal town of Antonio Bay. The Bay's gold-hungry priest cons the unfortunate group of seafarers, conspires with locals to kill them, and steals the lepers' 'treasure,' melting it down to fashion a large shining cross. This horror film has violence, but not the visual kind. The ugly and disgusting things that go on here are more generally heard than seen. The Fog is kid-friendly; the small ones have to have a modicum of violence built into their horrors, even if they're tamer than most other films of this era (1980). One of the best scenes include a female discjockey, played by Barbeau, who plays 'Cap'n hook' on one of the zombie pirates that want kill her. Watch this one as a family, and microwave plenty of popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, underrated ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good ghost story, which went outside the usual formula of 80's slasher flicks. Carpenter uses the eerieness and suspense he created for Halloween in The Fog.*WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW*The 100-year birthday of the California town of Antonio Bay is fast approaching, and it will be one that the town's residents would rather have not happened at all. A century earlier the first settlers of the town lured an unsuspecting ship crew to their doom, by burning a fire on shore which lured the ship through a thick fog until it crashed against the rocks and sank, killing the crew. Now, on that anniversary, the ghosts of the crew, concealed in the fog that contributed to their deaths, are returning to Antonio Bay to exact revenge and claim what is rightfully theirs. One of the creepiest moments involves the deaths of 3 men on a boat. The first thing they see is the ghostly apparition of the ship, with ripped sails and soaked decks. The fog clears away to reveal several dark figures standing in the middle of it, and one at a time the men are killed. The next is when the glowing fog rolls into the town as the celebrations are closing, and with it comes the ghosts of the crew, hunting for a total of 6 victims in place of those who had caused their deaths. As the fog moves through the town, it menaces people trying to flee, in their homes, or anywhere else. A DJ (played by Adrienne Barbeau) warns the town, "Get inside and lock your doors...close your windows...there's something in the fog!". The ending was particularly interesting....you have to see it to understand it!This movie is grossly underrated as it was released on the heels of 'Halloween', and wasn't given a lot of press. It has a good story, is mostly well acted, and has genuinely frightening ghosts. The story is fitting to one told around a campfire, like it is at the start of the movie and so sets the stage for what follows. The music is genuinely creepy and fits the film well, especially when the fog sweeps in at the end of the celebrations. An excellent little movie that scares better than today's horror flicks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fog is a good little film. It is a very well-told ghost story. It is creepy and not a lot of blood &amp; guts, which is a good thing. The story is interesting and deals with revenge by some phantom mariners who want to extract some revenge for the loss of their gold by the people of Antonio Bay. Revenge is always good motive for one of these tales. The performances are solid, not great, but good. The story and the atmosphere are great. I am surprised there hasn't been more movies done with ghosts and such using lighthouses and sea-side towns. This helps create the atmosphere needed to tell a story like this. Along with the original haunting, The Innocents, and the Changeling this ranks as one of the better and my favorite ghost stories on film. Spooky, creepy, entertaining. Grab some popcorn, turn out the lights and watch on Halloween with the other mentioned movies for the best in spooktacular television.You won't be disappointed</fullReview>

Having watched it recently THE FOG hasn't aged gracefully in terms of the special effects (though I see Rob Bottin's name in the credits -- this must have been one of his earliest projects -- he also did the FX for Carpenter's THE THING remake). Still, the story is what makes THE FOG worth watching. It's probably a bit too slow for today's audiences. Also of note for Bay Area residents: they filmed a lot of this around Stinson Beach.Not one of Carpenter's best movies, but still worth a rent if you like ghost stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Fog" was director John Carpenter's followup to his monumental horror classic "Halloween". Even though this movie doesn't surpass his great 1978 film, it's definitely one of his better efforts. "The Fog" is about a small California coastal town that's celebrating its 100th anniversary. However, this will be a 100th anniversary celebration that these townspeople will soon like to forget. Ghosts of sailors killed in a shipwreck approximately 100 years ago come ashore on the town in the form of a very thick fog, seeking revenge on the descendants of the people who caused their ship to run aground. "The Fog" is one creepy movie, especially when the glowing fog rolls around. A good cast is featured here. Jamie Lee Curtis (reteaming with Carpenter after "Halloween"), Janet Leigh (Curtis' real-life mother), Adrienne Barbeau (Carpenter's then wife), Hal Holbrook, and (in a cameo) John Houseman star. Well made thriller has plenty of scary, eerie, and creepy moments thanks in large part to Carpenter's scary, eerie, and creepy music score (one of his best music composing efforts). Only one quarrel: how can somebody see the town streets through a thick fog from a lighthouse that appears to be far away? *** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's follow-up to HALLOWEEN is an unfortunately obscure horror masterpiece; he gives us not a haunted house, but a haunted town! A sleepy, seaside town is menaced by the 100 year old curse of a mysterious shipwreck.

Film delivers the chilling goods, with an intriguing new detail every few minutes that makes the viewer marvel. ***1/2 out of ****; an underrated classic; get out and get your hands on a copy of it if possible, because it's out of print.P.S.--See if you can spot Carpenter; he has an unbilled bit as "Bennett", the church assistant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure cinematic magic ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1980, "The Fog" was John Carpenter and Debra Hill's second collaboration and the follow-up to 1978's "Halloween," one of the most important and influential horror movies of the last thirty years. The massive critical and commercial success of "Halloween," as well as its iconization by an adoring public, created unusually high expectations for the next Carpenter/Hill project, and the duo's electrifying, gothic-tinged ghost story blew those expectations out of the water. "The Fog" was not only informed by Carpenter's tense, skillful direction and his haunting trademark music, but it pulled off the near-impossible task of displaying even more effective imagery than its beloved predecessor. "The Fog" is easily one of the most stylish films ever made, overflowing with gorgeous, almost dreamlike images that are so exquisitely rendered by Carpenter that he transforms the entire movie into a visual feast. The long shots of the malignant neon fog rolling and creeping across the face of the ocean are, at once, breathtaking and portentous. The first scene of the film, a campfire tale told to a group of youngsters by the charismatic old Mr. Machen (an incomparable John Houseman), sets a suitably eerie tone, while also deftly providing the viewer with crucial expository details that foreshadow the events to follow. As the Pacific coastal village of Antonio Bay prepares for its centenary celebration, the long-buried secret of the town's history rises to the surface and a hundred-year-old conspiracy is discovered by a descendent of one of the town's founding fathers. Amidst these events, something even more sinister rises from the black depths of the sea to exact a bloodthirsty revenge on the inhabitants of the village. As multiple story lines and characters are seamlessly woven together, a handful of the town's residents must risk life and limb (literally) to combat the murderous entities lurking in "The Fog." This movie is not only a superb ghost story about supernatural retribution, but also a pointed commentary about the consequences of choices made. The sins of the father being visited upon the son (or in this case, the sins of the ancestors upon the descendents) is a striking motif within this story, and imbues the movie with a graveness of theme that few other genre films have successfully orchestrated. "The Fog" is an outstanding achievement technically and visually, but, in my opinion, the movie would not have worked had it not been brought to life by the faultless performances of the powerhouse cast. Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Janet Leigh turn in great performances, and Barbeau's character, in particular, played by Barbeau as gutsy and resourceful, is a formidable heroine. The female leads are given superb support by Hal Holbrook, Tom Atkins, and Charles Cyphers (in a smaller, but memorable role). The cast invests the film with a sense of authenticity and legitimacy that leaves the viewer feeling that the fictitious proceedings truly matter. Though I am one who appreciates the use of intense violence in certain films, Carpenter wisely eschews the use of graphic bloodletting, a decision that maintains the integrity of the film's disquieting atmosphere. That said, "The Fog" delivers suspense and shocks in abundance, developing a sense of urgency and terror by "suggesting" much of the violence not portrayed on screen. This would not work in a Fulci or Argento film, but, then, Carpenter's films tend to work on a different level. The scenes of the swirling fog camouflaging the hideous terrors within it are some of the creepiest ever filmed, and transform the cursed mist into a character unto itself. The film also serves up a gut-wrenching shock ending that subtly reinforces its prevailing theme. "The Fog," from first frame to last, is pure cinematic magic, and is, without dispute, one of the finest horror films of the last three decades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rememeber watching this film as a kid, it gave my sister nightmares for months and she has never watched it since. It's classic Carpenter, in my humble opinion, I prefer this film over the much overrated Halloween, don't get me wrong Halloween is a great movie, but Black Christmas came before and was much better and doesn't get any of the recognition it deserves. The Fog, creates in some scenes an intense atmosphere of dread and foreboding, which adds to the chills, accompanied by the wonderful creepy score, by none other than JC himself, as with Halloween. Its classic JC in the sense that he really delivers with direction and the creation of atmosphere which is SO important and that 99% of the attempted horror flicks of today just can't manage at all. Blake and his fellow ghostly slashers are great, with their glowing red eyes and dark statuesque. The assortment of weapons and the death scenes are very well done, you really don't need bucket loads of blood and gore to frighten and shock, the death scenes in The Fog, are violent and even verging on disturbing. Maybe its just me but I'm also very fond of some of the funny moments in the movie, Janet Leigh's line to Nancy Loomis (Halloween) 'Your the only person who makes Yes Ma'am sound like screw you' is a fantastic line and makes me smile every time. For me The Fog is an extremely underrated Horror classic, far too often overshadowed by Halloween and The Thing (which wouldn't be half as good without Make-Up genius Rob Bottin, now would it?) Even the end of the film doesn't disappoint, its unexpected and ends the film perfectly. Jamie Lee doesn't do anything for the movie at all, but as usual Tom Atkins is great. So a slasher/ghost flick with a plot, stranger things have happened I guess. Of course the film isn't perfect but as far as chills and scares go, you can't go wrong with The Fog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Followup to the Classic Halloween</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern day ghost story with old fashion sensibilities. Combines the ideas of Ambrose Bierce, and HP Lovecraft with brilliant film execution. The Fog(1980) continued the string of very good to excellent horror films that were made in the 1970s. Began the decade of the 1980s very well before the mid to late 80s when the horror genre was dying down. I describe it as part ghost story and part slasher flick.The Fog(1980) has stood the test of time as a classic horror film of the 1980s. Has everything in a 1980s horror picture that makes the film a worthwhile viewing experience. While most horror films from this period focused on masked murderers and naive teens, The Fog(1980) is more interested in atmosphere and mood. A little gem of a film that is better than some of the horror films of its time. The Fog(1980) did not get very good fanfare when first released and bombed at the box office.Had the unfortunate disadvantage for John Carpenter of following his masterpiece, Halloween. Uses some of the formula that made Halloween an instant classic. Instead of having one faceless scary monster the director fills the screen with a ship load of faceless villains of evil. The Fog(1980) is a brilliant horror motion picture in its own right and one of John Carpenter's top films. Like in Halloween(1978) there isn't much in the way of gory violence.The ghosts of the pirates led by Blake have a spooky presence surrounding them and their ship. It helps that the ghosts are rarely shown in full detail for most of the time. The Ghost of Blake is eerily played by makeup effects genius, Rob Bottin. The designs of the ship which although shown for one moment is absolutely stunning. The ghosts in The Fog(1980) are menacing and scary unlike the monstrous villains of The Ghost of Mars(2001).There are a few scary moments in The Fog(1980). One moment is the first scene where a boat is covered in heavy fog. Another moment is the death of a couple of fisherman which is atmospheric as well as mysterious. Also, the scene where the ghosts go after the main characters of the film during the climax. Finally, the moment when the fog covers the house of the radio dj's young boy.The Fog(1980) in some points of the story feels less like an American horror film and more like something from Hammer Studios. Instead of taking place in Cornwall, the story takes place somewhere in California near the Pacific Ocean. John Carpenter is one of many film makers that Hammer Studios had a profound effect in desire to make films. The obvious films from Hammer that influenced The Fog(1980) are Plague of the Zombie(1966) and maybe The Mummy's Shroud(1967). The Fog(1980) is a homage to the horror films of the Hammer Studios from the 1950s to early 1970s.Another outstanding direction under the belt of John Caprenter. A period of energetic filmmaking for John Carpenter as he did some wonderful genre films. Lately the director has lost some of the magic that made his early to mid films memorable. Low key direction with the know how in building suspenseful atmosphere. He directs The Fog(1980) as well as his masterful direction for Halloween(1978).The fog effects are put together with visual splendor. In the film the fog becomes almost another character. Probably the most atmospheric and stylislistc fog effects used in a motion picture. The fog effects are sometimes more frightening then the ghosts that are covered in. A Short but memorable appearence is made by Assault on Preceint 13 actor, Darwin Joston.The Fog(1980) is terrific at giving the audience a sense of dread before something is about to happen. Whenever the fog begins to roll in land the music starts up so the feeling of dread grows bigger. A Great horror film is one where building up the sense of dread can be more heart pounding than the horror itself. The acting in The Fog(1980) is average compared to Halloween(1978). It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis acting in a scene with her mother, Janet Leigh.Dean Cundey contributes to the excellence of the film's execution with his impressive cinematography. During this time Dean Cundey developed into a very good DoP which led to bigger budget projects. The camera nevers bores in its images of atmosphere. Many of the film's ideas have been influenced by the Blind Dead horror series made in the 1970s. The ending of The Fog(1980) seem to suggest that a sequel was not too far but alas and fortunately there never was a Fog 2(unless you Count Ghosts of Mars as a semi sequel).</fullReview>

The story concerns a shipfull of dead pirates coming back in a sinister fog to attack the residents of a seaside town. As the fog moves farther into town the scare factor increases to a ghastly climax. The eerie atmosphere and effective music score (a Carpenter trademark) helps create a truly scary viewing experience. Although not one of his GREATEST works, this is still very scary and atmospheric, and guaranteed to keep you tuned into all the gruesome happenings as the ghosts spike and impale more and more characters.

Watch the scene where Adrienne Barbeau is fighting for her life on top of the lighthouse and actually gets to use a hook on the face of one of the ghosts and they show you a close up of the gross decayed flesh of one of them.Was very scary to me . I liked the cameo by Janet Leigh and she worked well with her daughter Jamie.Poor ol Hal Holbrook, A shocking ending to say the least .I give it a 7 out of 10 with it losing points for some very bad dialogue. But overall very spooky and fun .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Carpenter! everything from the setting to music equals......creepy!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to its wispy, ghostly movements and cloaking nature fog has always been linked with the supernatural. Some ancient cultures suggested it masks the moments of earth bound devils. John Carpenter takes this simple notion, combines it with basic seafaring spookery. Adds a pinch of rustic setting. Mixes in a goodly amount of great acting, directing and writing. The end result is a minor classic.Unlike 'Halloween', 'The Fog', lacks and overpowering villianous presence of Michael Myers.Unlike 'The Thing', 'The fog', lacks the overwhelming sense of paranoia.What it is is darn creepy. It is the perfect film for those dark quiet nights when all you want is to curl up with the lights out with your popcorn and experience a good honest fright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can "Fog" be frightening? Ooooohhhh....yes, definitely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you like films like "Scream", "Halloween" or "Friday the 13th"? Then you will have to watch this one. It's simply John Carpenter at his best. In my opinion, better than any of the Halloween-Series and more frightening than every Slasher-Movie I can remember. Incredible, how a film without too much violence can produce such a scary feeling. I give this film a 9.5 out of 10 (The only better horror movies I know are "A Nightmare on Elm Street Part I, The Exorcist and Tremors). Don't hesitate, just watch it.</fullReview>

Arthur Machen was an early 20th cent writer of those stories you wish you'd never read, and so was H P Lovecraft, who set many of his tales in the fictional town of Arkham, noted for its 'peaked gambrel rooves', whatever they are. xxxxxx</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's overlooked classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's work has been revisited and re-evaluated in recent years, and given the respect it deserves. However, one of Carpenter's movies that is consistently overlooked (in favour of "Halloween" or "The Thing") is "The Fog". You can read a synopsis elsewhere on this page. To be fair, not everything about this film is top notch, but the end result is FAR greater than the sum of its parts. It is dark, atmospheric, has a fabulous score, and a superb narrative that cleverly weaves together the lives of the very human characters into a single spooky story. If you've not seen it, or just want to remember how damned good it is, go rent yourself a copy.</fullReview>

John Carpenter did an amazing job directing and a very creepy score it's some what like Halloween. i recommend this to every horror fan. it just goes to show you don't need blood to make a scary movie. The Fog i feel is Carpenter's third best movie behind Halloween and Escape From New York, i give The Fog 8/10</fullReview>

This isnt high on special effects but it creepy and Ive always liked it since I first saw it in an empty theatre in 1980. I went after school and no one was there except me. No better way to see a movie like this. It still scares me today. I just wish they would come out with a 20 year anniversary version on DVD.

		<fullReview>"The Fog" is director John Carpenter's worthy follow-up to his classic 1978 smash hit "Halloween". More ghost story than slasher flick,"The Fog" tells the tale of the spirits of a drowned leper colony who met their doom 100 years earlier in a shipwreck orchestrated by the town's six founding fathers. Sporting various weapons and hooks for hands,these ghouls seek revenge against the citizens of Antonio Bay,a California seaside community celebrating its centennial,as retribution for the "sins of their fathers". As a mysterious fog envelops the town, the denizens are attacked in various locales (beach house, fishing boat,Catholic church). The film boasts an excellent cast,led by Adrienne Barbeau (in her best role to date) as sexy disc jockey Stevie Wayne,who is isolated for most of the film in a spooky lighthouse,which serves as the town's radio station. The rest of the cast includes the mother-daughter Scream Queen team of Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis,as well as Hal Holbrook as an alcoholic priest,Tom Atkins as a local fisherman,a pre-credits cameo by John Houseman as an old sea captain, and Charles Cyphers and Nancy Loomis of "Halloween" fame. Carpenter provides the film's excellent musical score,as he did in "Halloween". In the end, the lead characters are surprisingly under-jeopardized (Barbeau and Curtis are attacked,but only Holbrook loses his head). Nevertheless,the film works primarily because of Barbeau's tour-de-force performance. My score: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's follow-up to HALLOWEEN is an unfortunately obscure horror masterpiece; he gives us not a haunted house, but a haunted town! A sleepy, seaside town is menaced by the 100 year old curse of a mysterious shipwreck. Sometimes predictable plot is offset by excellent direction and photography; memorable, creepy music by Carpenter as well. Film delivers the chilling goods, with an intriguing new detail every few minutes that makes the viewer marvel. ***1/2 out of ****; an underrated classic; get out and get your hands on a copy of it if possible, because it's out of print.P.S.--See if you can spot Carpenter; he has an unbilled bit as "Bennett", the church assistant.</fullReview>

It takes a little bit for the story to develop but once it does, it comes together nicely. Excellent effects that shroud the "pirates" in fog makes for a really creepy effect. As far as this movie goes for its genre, a rating of 9 out of 10 was given.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When The Fog Rolls In - The TERROR Begins!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to be on hand while this film was being shot in West Marin County, California. I happened to be inside The Two Ball Inn (a local bar) while they were shooting the scene in which THE FOG rolls into town. Some of the locales are the most beautiful places in Northern California. Most of the film was shot in Point Reyes and Inverness, with brief scenes in Bodega Bay and Bolinas. After waiting non-patiently for almost a year after the shoot for the film to be released - I had no idea what I was in for. This film scared the pants of me. I was young at the time, and for 1980, this film scared people all over the country. I remember a review on Good Morning America by Rona Barrett talking about how terrifying the film was. I still hold my video version of the film very near and dear to me. John Carpenter is a master at horror films, I dont know what he was thinking when he made Vampires - but everyone is entitled to make a mistake. To John Carpenter, thanks for the following films: Assault on Precint 13, Halloween, The Fog, The Thing, Eyes of Laura Mars (writing credit) and especially Prince of Darkness. On a final note, I hope there are plans to re-master The Fog for a DVD release.</fullReview>

Truly creepy music, good performances, and an interesting plot, plus a few really good murders.

		<shortDescription>Good old fashioned Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what the critics say about John Carpenter I think he has made some good entertaining motion pictures. The Fog is another fine Carpenter film. Although it has it's various scenes that are a little on the hokey side i.e. the townsfolk all carrying candles to march by the little dinky statue of the ship that was the basis of the towns founding. I don't know how many towns no matter how small they are would have such orderly citizens that would want to celebrate it's centennial in such a quiet manner. The corpse getting off the table in the morgue. Anyone would certainly hear the shoes walking on the tiled waxed floor. Father Malones father was also a priest? Making him the town's leading merchant etc. who picked the church to hide his journal in might have prevented the "Hey priests can't marry or father children either" question that everyone who sees this movie always seem to bring up. Despite these scenes this still is a good film because it's an old fashioned ghost story. The opening scene with John Houseman telling an eerie tale to a group of kids is great for an opening. The scenes of the beaches and open fields of the town just before dark when the mist starts rolling in with the sound of a fog horn in the background are creepy. One can almost feel the damp cold. The leper ghost crew are done superbly (How would you like to go to one of those Haunted Houses during the Halloween season and in one of the rooms it's filled with waist high fog and lit just enough to see a group of figures standing there like Blake and his gang?) They are only seen as shadowy figures which is what makes them all the more scarier. John Carpenter did well with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog is by far an ingenious piece of work. The storyline is solid, very creatively unique and the characters believable and well casted, even though the regulars are back. Antonio Bay has a dark history that starts to unfold. Strange occurrences abound and everyone is affected, no one can escape the horror of the past or the present. A frigate ship carries the corpses of a banned group of lepers that are back for what is rightfully theirs. Prophecy has it that six lives must be taken in their return. Jamie Lee Curtis plays a drifter who rolls into town just in time to catch the horrific festivities. Adrienne Barbeau gives a great performance as radio jockey, Stevie Wayne. Stevie slowly puts the pieces together and realizes what is truly in the fog! Who will live, who will die? When the fog rolls in, the terror begins. I highly recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 100+ year old zombie/ghosts in this film are kicking but and taking names, a good aspect of the film is that the appearance of the inhabitants of the fog is never really shown. I've always considered this one of Carpenter's spookiest movies he has ever made, it eases you in, then spits you out, but yanks you back in by the boo-boo. Barbeau (later to be "Mrs. Carpenter") is excellent, it's a big change from the TV series "Maude" in which she plays Carol. Jamie Lee is amazing as the hitchhiking Beth Solley, Cyphers is great as well. Not to mention Jamie's mom Janet Leigh, and a suprise cameo by the man himself as Father Malone's assistant. This is a great movie to hunker down by. Remember Carpenter's last movie was the slasher hit Halloween, and is a great change of plot.</fullReview>

It is an excellent ghost story about a 100 year old shipwrek and its crew coming back to haunt this quiet little coastal town on the 100 year anniversary. You'll get more drawn in when the conspiracy plot starts to unravel. It's very engrossing, very good, and very very suspenseful. With an ending that will keep glued through the credits.

		<fullReview>I am a big John Carpenter Fan, in fact, the only reason I started using this data base was to find out more about his movies. So I must warn you, my comments may not be ENTIRELY objective, but what the heck, right?This is a very cool, somewhat campy movie consisting of Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, and Adrienne Barbeau (back in the day when her and Johnny boy were hitched). The plot is sorta corny, I'll admit (ghost pirates... oooh scary!) but John Carpenter Pulls it off so well! The tension mounts as strange occurrences begin happening (a gold coin turns into a piece of driftwood, which has the word DANE on it, which later Re-letters itself to 6 MUST DIE, fog that goes against the wind, mysterious disappearances, the works).I'm telling you, this movie is just a lot of fun to watch. I saw it for the first time a few years ago on that oh so wonderful show "Monster Vision" on TNT, and I haven't been able to get over how cool this movie is. If you're a fan of horror movies, love suspense, but don't like a whole lot of gore (Carpenter rarely uses a lot of blood in his movies) or just looking for a cool movie to watch with friends and loved ones, THE FOG is your ticket, go out and rent it today... trust me, if you don't like it, I'll...

		<fullReview>I always considered this one of Carpenter's best movies. Eschewing the horror/slasher genre of Halloween, or the action-adventure of Escape From New York and The Thing, Carpenter basically tells a modern-day ghost story here. In fact, John Houseman's only reason for being in the movie is to lend his voice to the ghost story that starts the movie. There's a few unlikely plot coincidences (all three of the men on the boat happened to be descendents of the leper colony's prosecutors?!?), but Carpenter doesn't otherwise hesitate to toss out scary stuff (like the corpse in the morgue) without bothering to slow down the narrative with a tedious explanation. There is very little gore, and much is vividly left to the imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>spooky but not that scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antonio Bay, California is celebrating its centennial. Father Malone (Hal Holbrook) discovers his grandfather's journal from 1880. It reveals that the six celebrated founders of the town sank a ship called Elizabeth Dane and then stole its gold. The owner Blake had wanted to establish a leper colony. Instead the six used the money to build the town avoid having the leper colony nearby. Strange things are happening in the town. Single mom Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau) is the radio DJ in the lighthouse. Nick Castle (Tom Atkins) picks up hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley (Jamie Lee Curtis) and then all the windows in his truck shatter. A fog bank comes over a fishing boat and apparitions kill everybody. Nick and Elizabeth sleep together. An apparition comes to kill but the clock strikes 1 am and the witching hour ends. The apparition disappears. Kathy Williams (Janet Leigh) is the organizer of the centennial and she refuses to believe Father Malone and the curse.This is a rather slow horror and not that scary. It has a spooky quality to it mostly from Carpenter's music and the isolated seaside location. The story is pretty simplistic at its core. It's killer ghosts. The whole exposition with Hal Holbrook reading the diary isn't the most exciting. It's most remembered for Adrienne Barbeau as the sexy DJ. She definitely has the voice for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We get here in the first couple of minutes of the credit sequence just what is going to unfold in the rest of the film. First a campfire tale from a haunted past told to an audience in their late childhood/ early teenage years, no doubt the most suitable audience to be affected by this film. For the grownups it is just a good yarn. Even better, we see a smalltown in the after hours already throbbing by some malevolent presence it anticipates: lights flicker, car alarms go off, gas pumps pump of their own, etc. We get a couple of murders and the fog. Then it's morning again, that night postponed so that we anticipate in the coming dark that much more the whispered story.And this is all about tuning us to that space where something lurks and prepares itself to appear, the sister film to Halloween.Instead of one Myers skulking around a small town we have many. The story of explanations about evil in both cases is silly, but no matter. In both cases we have foggy minds wired together in foggy narrative space: here the radio DJ mother and her son, the meteorologist, the fisherman and the girl he picked up, the priest, etc. I like the sense of place, a wonderful small town perched on a a shelf above the ocean, that plays with openness and concealment. In Halloween we had the hazy horizons of neighborhood night with dogs faintly heard in the distance and kids running by against the sleepy confines of homes, here we have open seas pitted once more against concealed secrets and smalltown familiarity. Such lovely and memorable mood.And Carpenter is instinctively drawn to puncture this sense of normalcy with some ritualized fiction, he did this in Halloween by having movies play on TV and faintly heard across the neighborhood. Here it is a public celebration of townhood that we know is built on deceit, an artificial story and re- enactment.Overall I celebrate this because it is from a time when Carpenter still knew what great horror is purely about. Not merely showing what we imagined lurks in the shadows, but preparing the space where we imagine it is destined to appear, showing a certain embodiment of the presence. Isn't this what happens when a child alone at night stares at the foot of the bed?He ends it just as it has entered its most frantic part, leaving us with an unfinished sketch, the apparitions receding as abruptly as they came.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic that was overlooked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has some of the most incredible suspense scenes ever done! There is atmosphere to spare, a great ghost story plot and Adrienne Barbeau! It was kind of buried when first released but has since become a classic for many Horror fans. The remake was dead on arrival, but this film still packs a creepy punch to this day! The ghosts are very well done, and while there is no gore really, the film still feels like a visceral experience. A great follow up to Halloween by a true master of Horror. For some reason it never gets the respect it deserves, but I hope that everyone will give it another chance. I showed it to some friends and now they love it! I won't drop any spoilers here, and to talk about the plot too much would do that, so I will just say it has a classic Horror feel done in a modern way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter for ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I often wonder why Carpenter, in the years that followed, didn't seem very fond of The Fog, and showed more affection for other movies of his, such as The Thing or The Prince of darkness. I recently watched The Fog again(I have watched it many many times and I will probably watch it many many more since it first came out in 1980)and I was very happy to enjoy for one more time the unique way in which the director builds his narration cutting it in parallel actions that gradually come together under the watching eye of the woman-sentinel in the lighthouse.This is not just an ordinary atmospheric movie, it is cinema accomplished as the most refined of arts.The way shots match one another, the symmetry of the frames, the beauty of the photography, and the underlying spirit, tuned to the phrase of Poe that starts the picture, all contribute to a masterpiece which , in my opinion, is one of the best Carpenter films(if not his best) and one of the best movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>32 years ago, something came to our screen that helped us realise why 80's horror clichs mount classy suspense and terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note. "May contain spoilers".100 years ago, something unknown, unnatural yet evil came out of the fog. Now it has returned and has followed a cult admiration since its release in the dawn of 1980. John Carpenter's "The Fog" is one of the most beautifully shot yet thought-provoking films of its era. It's mounted with classic suspense and terror with a lot of mystery building up. John Carpenter certainly knows where to shoot his films and has this peculiar atmosphere that indicates they're his movies. The Fog does settle for a little too little but is suspenseful enough and well paced. I must say,beautiful shooting location for the fictional town village of Antonio Bay. The landscapes of the green and grassy land that overcrowd the sweeping ripples of the shore towards dusk and then the cold, misty and claustrophobic night time shots of the glowing fog circling around and concealing the disguised image of the coastal town. What makes the movie so powerful in storytelling is not just the ghastly and evil mind of the fog, but also the town itself. They hid away their cunningness exactly 100 years ago and turn their image of a once greedy yet egotistic and self-absorbed community into a sleepy, quiet yet full of pleasure and peace nature that the community brings. The town seems in fragile-like, presenting it with full of surprises and yet we're tricked into believing they wouldn't even swat a fly. As they say, looks can be deceiving. While John Carpenter's film settles more for a satisfied amount of suspense and terror, the remake has a more accurate storytelling but it went in the wrong direction. More body counts and fantasy mind games would've made the movie a bigger hit, but it only manages to sit as a minor classic, with the director agreeing to this. With a limited amount of special effects, produced on a low budget, is what sets the gradually slow and quiet pace of the film and that has been a major change with today's CGI effects in horror films. More flexibility is ensured and faster pacing and more activity is involved and just does not live up to the expectations we see in original horror films. Also a great cast and especially regulars from previous John Carpenter films. That's another part of the story I like, we see different kinds of characters dealing with their mundane issues in the different areas of the town and they eventually meet together to ensure safety from the fog. Carpenter's composed music theme for the movie is more about atmosphere creating an eerie mood. It is emotionally soothing yet intense at a few moments and it settles as an appropriate mood of the stories atmosphere. It is near Gothic, but for the shores atmosphere here, it is appropriately suited. Well done.Forget the Pirates of the Caribbean films and the Fog remake. This film is emotionally and suspensefully engaging. If there is a current Blu-ray release of the film somewhere out there, go and buy it. It is a worthy purchase, especially with most of the credit going towards the shooting locations, which are crisp and clear with loads of detail. And remember the alarming and intriguing tagline, "what you can't see, won't hurt you, it will kill you"! 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's theatrical follow-up to his first major success, "Halloween", is classic ghost story stuff. A small oceanside town named Antonio Bay is celebrating its 100th birthday; what the townspeople don't know is that the founding of their town was rooted in deception and murder. Now the victims of a long ago plot have risen from a watery grave to exact gruesome revenge.Many enjoyable ingredients make this great fun for horror fans. It's beautifully atmospheric, with excellent location shooting in Point Reyes and Inverness, and the brilliant use of a lighthouse as a key location (even if the interior of the lighthouse is a set). Carpenter's music score is one of his most chilling. Even if it hasn't reached iconic status like his notorious "Halloween" theme, it's worthy of just as much respect.The cast is phenomenal, with some old pros on hand. Carpenter's then wife Adrienne Barbeau makes a great impression in her first big film role, and looks very nice to boot. John Houseman's screen time is brief, but he makes the most of it. His opening monologue is mesmerizing. Jamie Lee Curtis, who'd made such a memorable debut in "Halloween", is sexy and amiable young hitchhiker Elizabeth, who hooks up with nice guy local Nick (the ever cool Tom Atkins, who gets to be genuinely heroic). Jamie Lee's mom Janet Leigh is wonderful as town booster Kathy Williams, and Nancy Loomis is a hoot as her assistant. Hal Holbrook does a fine job as the tormented, guilt ridden priest Father Malone. Also to be seen are character players Charles Cyphers, John Goff, George "Buck" Flower, and Jim Haynie; "Assault on Precinct 13" co-star Darwin Joston has a fantastic cameo as Dr. Phibes (!), special makeup effects expert Rob Bottin plays red eyed phantom Blake (the "worm face" gag is his work), and even Carpenter himself appears, as the character Bennett.It's to the credit of Carpenter and company that they truly make the fog in this movie a character in its own right - a stealthy, glowing fog that moves against the wind. This was a movie that Carpenter and his producer / co-writer Debra Hill would ultimately have to re-do in part as they felt it just wasn't working, punching it up a little with additional violent bits of business. It was actually good fortune that the production couldn't afford "needle drops" of then-current pop and rock hits as the soft jazz merely adds to the palpable atmosphere of "The Fog" and prevents it from being firmly dated.The end result is an engaging movie that's worthy of a fair amount of respect and holds up well on repeat viewings, and got itself a remake 25 years later.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adrienne Barbeau, Hal Holbrook, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh and Tom Atkins star in John Carpenter's 1980 horror film. A town is haunted by a mysterious fog with vengeful ghosts on it's 100th anniversary. This begins with a man, Machen (John Houseman) telling a story to a group of kids by a campfire. On April 21st, the town of Antonio Bay prepares for it's 100th anniversary and strange things begin happening. Radio host, Stevie Wayne (Barbeau) starts noticing an eerie glowing fog heading towards the town that's really inhabited by vengeful ghosts wanting revenge for their murder. Father Patrick Malone (Holbrook) finds a journal written by his grandfather revealing what happened 100 years ago and that the town is cursed. Cathy Williams (Leigh), Nick Castle (Atkins) and Elizabeth (Curtis) learn what's happening and must endure a night from hell with Wayne and Malone. This is a great ghost story with a good cast, cool effects &amp; creepy score by Carpenter. I recommend this horror classic that's one of Carpenter's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening ghost story about the men 'at the bottom of the sea' who were betrayed and led to their deaths by their own township for being lepers The Fog gets under the skin. First thumbs up goes to the location scout - the scenery in this film is like a character itself, the old lighthouse, the dimly lit town with the fog horn going off in the distance. Adrienne Barbeau is Stevie Wayne, the DJ alone in the lighthouse overlooking the sea. She is simply great in this film and usually in every other film I have seen her in. Carpenters directing sets a tone, an unsettling tone throughout the film and crescendos are reached at the correct times. The three men on the boat being the first real scare. Where most modern horrors would have them looking round the boat in the fog for 10 minutes trying to 'build' tension, Carpenter cranks it up with some sly shots of what looks like an old clipper ship and some people stood in the fog with meat hooks - and then dispatches them inside 5 minutes. Another thing about these old films is each had a recognisable soundtrack. Not mood music - themes what was the last horror film that had a genuine theme? I can't think of one Nightmare on Elm Street maybe? Carpenters music is sublime and is used at precisely the right moments. Right up until the final shock when Blake lops off the preachers head for me The Fog is perfection in a horror film, pace is right, music is great, acting is good and like I say the crescendos are executed well. For me its sheer perfection and deserves to be more recognised than it is. 10/10 from this idiot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A+ In order for one to truly embrace the horror genre, it is impossible to leave out John Carpenter. The wonders he does with a camera continue to astound me to this day. The extreme long shots of the fog creeping over Antonio Bay, the silhouette form killers in the mysterious blackness. The illusion becomes very real and quite terrifying, making it a true classic.Compounding the great cinematography is a truly awesome cast. The Adrienne Barbeau stars, delivering a very good performance. Jamie Lee Curtis of another Carpenter classic, 'Halloween", stars and the legendary Janet Leigh of the 'The Birds" is also in the movie. To have so many all-star actresses in one movie, it doesn't get any more glorious than does it? Also adding to it all is that this is one of the director's self-scored films. As any musical piece done by Carpenter, it's edgy, dark, and gives a sense of wonder to the images on screen. It may all seem like simple tricks now-a-days, but the atmosphere created by all this is extraordinary, unmatched by the vast majority of contemporary horror films that equal sh*t. Definitely catch "The Fog" on a lonely night to yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Picture but Somewhat Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prefaced with a Poe quote and a campfire ghost story told by a salty old sea dog, The Fog is a classic late 70s/early 80s stalker horror film about a supernatural fog with 100 year old zombie ghost stabbers in it that terrorizes a small California coastal town only during the middle of the night. Jamie Lee Curtis just happens to be in it, but she is by far not the main character. None of the characters are particularly fascinating. The Fog operates in a kind of magic logic universe (as opposed to slightly less fantastic premises like Halloween) where a slow rolling, eerily glowing fog brings a slow captain hook and his dead leper friends to exact justice on people who must pay for sins of a long, long, long time ago. Somehow the movie is watchable. It has a decent score, even if it is a bit like the Halloween theme on tranquilizers. And, as always, Dean Cundey did an awesome job as the DP. Worth seeing once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Carpenter Classic, Not Fully Appreciated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small town is about to be attacked by pirates one hundred years after their ship, the Dane, was run ashore in the fog and their gold was stolen. They seek revenge and call out that six must die!The film was inspired both by the fog at Stonehenge and Quentin Lawrence's "The Trollenberg Terror" (1958, also known as "The Crawling Eye"), which dealt with monsters hiding in the clouds. Carpenter further drew on the mood and feel of H. P. Lovecraft's writings, a theme he would return to in "In The Mouth of Madness". The film has an amazing cast with Hal Halbrook, Adrienne Barbeau (Carpenter's new bride, whose character was based on an archetype of actresses who had worked with Howard Hawks) and Tom Atkins, Janet Leigh, Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Loomis...Under pressure from studios to top "Halloween" and David Cronenberg's "Scanners", they went back to add plenty of mood shots, including the opening ghost story with John Houseman. Mike Mayo calls it "a fine spooky ghost story" and Howard Maxford grudgingly says it was "very competently handled". Tommy Wallace was probably just as responsible for this film's success as Carpenter himself. He was the man behind much of what was added later, and fondly recalls how the pirates were played by grips and electricians.The character names are almost all homages to people Carpenter has worked with (Nick Castle and Tommy Wallace), dated or from other films (Dr. Phibes). In the end, we get one of Carpenter's finest works, right up there with "Halloween" and "The Thing".Of note is Barry Bernardi, who was a producer on this film. Bernardi had an uncredited role in "Halloween" and this was his producing debut, before going on to produce other Carpenter films in the early 1980s. He only went up from there, going on to produce a great many Adam Sandler films. He is probably the most successful Carpenter alumnus, or is closely matched with Jamie Lee Curtis.The special edition from Scream Factory is a must-have, with multiple audio commentaries, some good interviews, and Horror's Hallowed Grounds featuring Sean Clark (with a nice cameo from Robert Rusler). The film is even better because of all that Scream added.They remade the movie years later, and kept the story very similar. Why you would remake a film that was already good is beyond me -- even if you make a good remake, you can hardly improve on the original. Some people also compare "The Fog" and "The Mist", and I say there is no comparison... this film is above and beyond the better film, and shows the strength of Carpenter's vision during his golden age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Creepy Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter is one of the most famous modern American Horror directors and "The Fog" (1980) is doubtlessly on of the man's greatest achievements. If this film is one thing it is creepy; Carpenter truly succeeds in creating a genuinely haunting atmosphere with this gem which greatly combines an inescapable setting with a menacing visual style and a brilliantly haunting score. The combination of these elements creates an enormously creepy atmosphere, which, combined with an ingenious story makes a great film that no lover of Horror can afford to miss."The Fog" is terrifically set in a small and remote coast-side fishing town; the inhabitants are planning a big celebration for the 100th anniversary of their hometown's founding, unaware that the past of the macabre history of their little backwater is soon going to descend upon them... unleashing unknown terror. In the night before the anniversary, a thick fog approaches the coast... I do not want to give away too much of the storyline, since this gem's plot is truly classic and ingenious. What I can say is that this is arguably THE film in which Carpenter succeeds best in creating a genuinely haunting mood. Is there a better, more harrowing setting for a Horror film than a tiny coast-town all covered in a mysterious fog that devours vision? I think not, and the atmosphere is even increased by a brilliant score, once again composed by none other than the multi-talented filmmaker himself. The cast is wonderful and includes the a young and beautiful Jamie Lee Curtis as well as her real-life mother Janet Leigh. Curtis had come to fame two years earlier in the role of in Carpenter's most famous film "Halloween" (1978) and Janet Leigh played one of the most famous Horror roles ever in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, so the film features two iconic actresses of the Horror genre. B-Movie cult-actor Tom Atkins plays a typically macho role. Overall, "The Fog" is a wonderfully atmospheric gem and doubtlessly one of Carpenter's finest achievements. Personally, I've seen this films many times, and it definitely belongs to the kind of films that stay just as good after repeated viewings. Any Horror fan who hasn't seen it should do so as soon as possible. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>four or five too many characters, one too few endings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You want atmosphere, we got atmosphere, from the John Houseman peekaboo pre-credits to the church refuge at the end and at all points in between. You want a classic horror premise, see title. You want an impressive ensemble playing a likable and varied bunch of smalltown folks that (mostly) don't reduce to types, look no further. You want sure footed direction, here's pacing, framing and integrated humour that testify to the man's craft. But if you want an ending my friends, you are SOL. Yes, there are so many characters that lack of development becomes an issue ? compare Nancy Loomis's eye-rolling smartass here to the very similar character she did so much more with in Halloween. But it doesn't look like they got hacked down in the editing, because people don't disappear, they just lose purpose: at the climax everyone becomes a blobby crowd in a room without much to do. These problems are script problems: Adrienne Barbeau's lighthouse-radio station, for instance, is a fantastic device that just fizzles out. Worst of all, of course, Carpenter puts Jamie Lee Curtis and Janet Leigh in the same film and then doesn't even give them a scene together. Coulda been a contender?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I watched this on television, so it is possible that it was, at least somewhat, censored. I really don't think I've seen a single film of John's that I didn't care for... I don't love each and every one, but I like them all. The man can build atmosphere so skillfully, it isn't even funny. This is no exception to that rule; from the very beginning to the very end, starting with the very first shot and object that we are shown(meanwhile, that entire scene fits so well into the rest, that its background, written in the Trivia section(for you to either read or avoid to do so) is unexpected). The plot is great, and well-told. This is interesting and engaging throughout. The acting isn't bad for any of the performers(well, maybe the kid, but... it's a kid). This is genuinely scary. The effects are well-done, not sure there really are any herein that fail to live up to that. I knew I had to view this when I heard that Rob Bottin(who went on to help make The Thing(one of my favorites, along with Halloween) the amazing piece that it is) had two separate jobs in this. I was not disappointed. Carpenter yet again gets a lot out of not that much money. There are films with considerably larger budgets that won't offer anything resembling the mood that seeps through the screen from every frame of this, or the shocks. He also makes this work remarkably well... I normally don't go for this type of horror. The story is rather good. I recommend this to fans of this kind of movie and/or John Carpenter and what we're used to him delivering. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 'proper' ghost story, cheaply-made, but expertly told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something misty this way comes to Antonio Bay, and it's brought some spirits with unfinished business along for the ride.'The Fog' was an unwelcome presence at the cinema back in 1979 when studios and public alike equated 'horror' with 'slasher', and it didn't help that the film followed in the enormous shadow left by director John Carpenter's major success, 'Halloween'. The fact that it dared to buck the trend of the gore-fest doomed it from the get-go. The fact that it as since become a cult classic is testament to the sheep-minded nature of the industry, for there's much to recommend about 'The Fog', and the fact that it dared to go for more intelligent storytelling than cheap thrills has ensured its survival, not least with people like myself, too young to view it back when it was released, and therefore free of preconceptions.Carpenter himself name-checks Lovecraft as an example of what he was aiming for with his primarily suspense-thriller set in a sleepy Californian town where a 100-year-old prophecy warning the spectral return of murdered residents keen to exact revenge on the descendants of their killers leads to a tried and tested base-under-siege tale, thanks to the fog of the title, which cuts everyone off from the outside world. Not that eschewing graphic violence in favour of a slow-but-steady development of suspense until all hell breaks loose is an exclusively Lovecraftian province. When M.R James and Washington Irving try to tell a ghost story in their own good time, rather than worrying about whether their audience will walk away if blood isn't spilled after five minutes, it's just considered good storytelling. So when a modern attempt is made to do the same, it comes under fire from short attention spans, and studio accountants who match every disembowelment with profit surges.Not only does 'The Fog' return to the days of the proper ghost story, it does so on a shoestring budget, which doesn't for one moment detract from the viewing experience. You're too busy drawn in by the slowly-unfolding tale, and reactions of the major players. Turn this on its head for a moment, and you get the cgi-fest that was the 2005 remake - a forgettable advertisement for computer game animators, and a 90 minute promotion for miscast celebrities of the day. Nothing at all to do with proper storytelling, which made the original the cult classic that it is. The one with actors just trying to give performances that match the situations they were in (ie- acting), rather than worrying about how much press it would give them. The one with moody lighting, decent pacing and a fitting soundtrack. The one that worked, because it was just trying to be a film, not a cynical money-making exercise, or a clone of its slash-o-rama contemporaries. If you haven't seen it, remember to enjoy it on its own terms. Plenty of others have, and hopefully you will too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fog could be scary. Who knew?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog came at a time when John Carpenter was really on a roll. He was just hot off the success of Halloween, a film that revolutionised the horror genre forever. And still ahead for him was Escape From New York and the underrated remake of The Thing. Into the 90s though, Carpenter has more or less disappeared from the film circuit, except for a few sporadic efforts that met with middling reception. The late 70s and early 80s represented a peak in Carpenter's career he's never been able to reclaim.And although The Fog was made around the time of Carpenter's heyday, its never achieved the cult success of Assault on Precinct 13, and certainly not the success enjoyed by Halloween.The Fog may be one of Carpenter's lesser efforts, but its still another of his good ones. There's nothing strikingly original about it, nor does it have much in the way of plot (but then neither did Halloween I suppose), but it still showcases what Carpenter always does best. It generates suspense aplenty. And you really couldn't ask for anything more than that.The Fog has, I think one of the best openings you'll ever see in a John Carpenter film. A salty seaman (played by the excellent John Houseman) regales a group of kids around a campfire with tales of terror. The town of Antonio Bay (which just so happens to be their town) is about to celebrate its centennial anniversary. And 100 years ago, a group of sailors crashed their ship into the rocks of Antonio Bay, thanks to a campfire they mistook for a lighthouse.Legend has it the spirits of the sailors will return to take revenge on the people who caused their deaths. And at midnight, eerie things start occurring that may be portents. Car alarms go off. Dogs all bark at once. Glass cracks. And there's fog. Lots and lots of fog. Carpenter shoots it all so spookily the scene throbs with an unsettling atmosphere that's hard to shake.Nothing else in the film quite matches the superb opening 10 minutes. But still, when the fog rolls into town, and the deaths start happening, prepare yourself for seat edge stuff.Fog never seemed so scary. The way it appears over the horizon suddenly and without warning is sure to make the hairs on the back of your neck creep up. Watching it make its way into town, it looks unnervingly purposeful. Almost like its a living entity. In fact the fog is so scary in of itself, the film needn't have bothered with the zombie sailors at all.When we do see the sailors emerge from the fog, they don't feel very frightening. In fact when we see one with glowing red eyes, the effect is more cheesy than scary. But any scene with fog creeping under doors or outside windows is perfectly chilling. The sailors themselves are almost an intrusion.The Fog has a much larger budget than Halloween ever did. Halloween felt very stagebound. It was confined to one street. But The Fog has allowed Carpenter to broaden his horizons a bit more. There are some gorgeous shots of the coast, especially whenever the fog is around. In fact its a film that often looks more expensive than it really is. Its all very stylish, and the lighting scheme is very effective in making the atmosphere oppressive or expansive depending on the needs of the moment.In regards to the cast, its nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis back in another of John Carpenter's films. But sadly she gets relegated to second place this time. Actually her character is given a curious lack of development by the film. She's just a drifter who happens to be passing through town when all of this is happening. There's not much more to learn about her beyond that.In a neat twist, Carpenter has Jamie's mum Janet Leigh co-starring as the host of Antonio Bay's centennial celebration. Mother and daughter who have both played Scream Queens are now both in the same movie. Nice idea. Shame they hardly share any screen time.The real star of The Fog is Adrienne Barbeau (aka, Mrs Carpenter) as Stevie Wayne, the local DJ of Antonio Bay. She gives an excellent performance of strong conviction. In fact without her, something tells me The Fog would be a considerably lesser film. She doesn't get a lot of interaction with her co-stars, but she more than holds her own. She's the one in the most danger because her radio station is at the lighthouse(!) along the coast. The first place the fog hits.Carpenter stages some breathless scenes. Aside from the opening one, there's a wonderful climax that works on two levels. Innocents barricaded in a church trying to keep the sailors out. And another where Stevie is chased up onto the roof of the lighthouse. All helped immeasurably by another of Carpenter's wonderfully thudding musical scores.The Fog doesn't always make a lot of sense though. Why for instance does the body of a dead seaman get up off an autopsy table? What does the doubloon turning into a piece of driftwood have to do with anything? Its the type of film where you're not supposed to ask questions like that. If you do, you'll only expose the film's many plot holes.Although one of John Carpenter's slighter efforts, The Fog is still reasonably effective. In some ways, I understand why classic status has always eluded the film, but its not a bad way to spend an hour and a half. Its just that of all of Carpenter's films, its the one that feels the most disposable. Could you imagine them churning out endless sequels to this like they did with Halloween? Somehow, I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there are a whole ton of things i love about this movie. first off, THE FOG has some of the most beautiful ocean scenery i've ever seen (along with Jaws 2) and also the music. there has never been a john carpenter that had no amazing music. sometimes, i just lose thought and start humming the theme to THE FOG for five straight minutes, because the music is just so creepy and enchanting to listen to. also, the story. the one thing that makes every movie an Oscar, is the plot. it has to make sense. the 2005 remake of THE FOG had the most confusing plot ever and horrible acting. the original had a good plot which made a lot of sense, likable characters, and i really admire the fact that Adrienne Barbeau (still attractive to this day) never appears with any other cats members, shes just known throughout the film as that hot attractive lady with that sexy lauren becall kind of voice sitting up there in the light house. i can see why carpenter married her. if anyone manages to find this movie, watch it. you will be amazed with what carpenter can do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog's Moving In...And That's Not Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What does a director do after he has just made the most financially successful independent film of all time, as John Carpenter did with HALLOWEEN in 1978? Well, if you're any good and not merely in this business for the money (yet), you don't necessarily go in the same knife-kill direction. And indeed, Carpenter and co-producer Debra Hill didn't. Instead, they veered into the direction of the ghost story genre, coming up with a film that was almost every bit the classic that HALLOWEEN had become. That film was THE FOG, released in 1980.The film's setting is Antonio Bay, a small town on the rocky coast of Northern California, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary. But its founding was marred by a very tragic incident. For on that night a century ago, a band of leper pirates was led to their watery deaths by an onshore campfire shining through a very dense fog bank; the ship ran aground, and all on board perished--but not without vowing that they would return. And on this night, the centennial of the founding of Antonio Bay soon becomes a disturbing and nightmarish experience for all concerned. It is a personal one in particular for the local chaplain (Hal Holbrook, another fine performance on his part), because it was his ancestors whose actions a century before led to the deaths of those pirates. Once the fog stars moving in from the Pacific, things go from merely spooky and mysterious to hellish in short order.Given that it was released at a time when the horror genre was coming to be dominated by gory slasher films (FRIDAY THE 13TH, for example) inspired by Carpenter's HALLOWEEN, the tendency on his and Hill's part with THE FOG might have been to up the violence quotient as well. But while certain characters here meet horrifying and shocking deaths, these sequences are not really seen in gory close-up, but are left to the imagination, the admittedly but unabashedly old-fashioned way of doing things. Besides everything else, THE FOG is notable for pairing the mother/daughter team of Janet Leigh (of PSYCHO fame) and Jamie Lee Curtis (HALLOWEEN) (though they are not together in the same scenes all that much), and for having a strong female character in the local radio announcer played by Adrienne Barbeau, who was then Carpenter's wife. The fog effects are really quite spooky, and Rob Bottin's ghost pirate make-up is suitably creepy without being stomach-turning.The eerie piano/synthesizer score that Carpenter composed further aides THE FOG's cause, making it a highly suspenseful, atmospheric piece, streets ahead of so many other garden-variety horror films, let alone its lackluster 2005 remake. This is a film not to be missed by those who want a good fright without having their constitutions tied in knots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mysterious fog that houses a vengeful ghostly presence. A 100 year old murderous conspiracy. A frightened disc jockey menaced at her lighthouse/radio station, mysterious strangers banging on front doors with rusty hooks in the middle of the night, a town and some ships off shore full of potential victims: what's not to like? This one's a brilliant horror classic.I've seen this several times, and the frights and brutal violence remain effective. This was a well written story, chock full of colorful characters, both human and ghostly. The back story on the invaders is unique, and, oddly enough, sensitively explained. Events occur in a logical order of gathering intensity, and the film isn't afraid to kill off people you don't expect.A couple of characters are clichd, such as the mayor and her sidekick, but most are believable. The acting is normally quite good. Look for scream queens Jamie Lee Curtis and Janet Leigh, and Hal Holbrook as the priest who uncovers an evil act worse than anything the fog's killers have done. But best of all is Adrienne Barbeau as the DJ who appeals in a panic to her radio listeners to flee for their lives.The writers may have gotten the idea for killers concealing themselves in fog from an old drive-in quickie: "The Crawling Eye." Although CE was incredibly campy, the sight of the fog itself moving upon its victims worked quite well, and in the Fog, the unseen menace hiding inside the fog is again effective. However, this time, when the creatures are revealed, they are ingeniously filmed as faceless silhouettes shrouded in the fog's light, making them both ethereal and threatening. Throw in that pounding score which accompanies the advance of the fog over the town, and this one provides all the horror scares you could ask for.Good horror flick (far better than that ridiculous trash remake made recently), which is fun to watch.</fullReview>

Well I was wrong but its still a good film though. Like every film The Fog has its moments like its chilling music which John made himself, actually I think that he makes the music for a lot of films he makes and another good scene is when you see that boat and eventually all the crew (3 men) get killed by the evil 'dead sea-men'.Like Psychos 'stair scene' and Halloweens 'hung up by one kitchen knife scene' The Fogs pathetic bit is near the beginning where 2 of the 3 boat men go out on deck to investigate the big ship on the radar and when they get attacked by the 'dead sea-men/zombies' 1 of the men gets a huge sword that goes straight through him but the sword bit that came out the other end isn't covered in blood when its just go through someone!?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After his low-budget shocker "Halloween" became an immensely popular and profitable film, director Carpenter (along with writer Hill) followed it up with this atmospheric ghost story that didn't quite please his "slasher" fans, but which has attained its own cult following nonetheless. Barbeau plays the single-mom owner/operator of a radio station situated in the small coastal town of Antonio Bay. She and weather man Cyphers have begun a sight-unseen flirtation which takes on dramatic proportions when he reports to her a major fog bank that results in the disappearance of a fishing boat containing three locals. Meanwhile, the owner of the tug (Atkins), who has just picked up and bedded a hitch-hiker (Curtis), sets out to locate the boat and the men. At the same time, Leigh and her assistant Loomis are planning a statue dedication for the town's 100th anniversary, unaware that the town was actually built on an age-old crime (larceny and murder.) One more key player is priest Holbrook, who finds an old journal documenting the crime. These disparate citizens of Antonio Bay find themselves fighting for their own lives once the heavy, mysterious fog rolls into town and is discovered to contain some nasty, deadly ghosts wielding hooks and machetes! Barbeau's velvet-voiced disc jockey persona is a bit hard to swallow, but she fares well in her scenes with her son Mitchell and when registering fear (or terror!) in the face of danger. Even then, her plaintive pleas into practically-dead airwaves become a little tiresome as she has to give a play-by-play account of the fog front and plead for people to get out of the way of it. Curtis isn't given much to do except follow Atkins around. She's mostly the center of a couple of fright gags, though she also gives texture to her non-horror scenes. Atkins (an unlikely candidate for a leading man/hero) is solid in his role. He's believable as someone who'd be seen living and working in the fishing business (even though this actor is most often seen as a cop.) Leigh comes on quite frenetically, but fortunately tones it down a notch after a while. Her brittle persona adds an occasional dot of sarcastic humor. Holbrook does a fine job as the boozy, tormented priest. Houseman makes a brief, but effective appearance before the opening credits roll. The plot is chock full of illogic and nagging questions, possibly due to some extensive, self-imposed reshooting and recutting prior to the film's release. The violence and fright aspects were ratcheted up in order to avoid disappointing the folks who made "Halloween" such a smash. Still, the film has a wonderfully creepy feel to it and there is ample use of some terrific location scenery. The setting is beautiful and interesting (chiefly the area including and surrounding the lighthouse.) It also delivers its fair share of suspenseful moments as the ghosts clomp around, knocking on the doors of the town and relentlessly shuffling forward. The overall effect of the film overcomes the senseless gaps in the story. It's all about the mood and the audience's reaction. This was remade in 2005 with tons of CGI and a Gen-X cast and was met with mostly lukewarm or negative reviews.</fullReview>

Now, the town of Antonio Bay is celebrating it's 100 year anniversary just as a thick fog rolls into town, filled with the vengeance-seeking ghosts of the murdered pirates.my thoughts: Ever since I was a kid I've loved this atmospheric horror film.It has all the ingredients to make a great chiller. Moody directing from John Carpenter, a creepy score (also by John Carpenter), a great cast, and a fun story. Any film to have Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, Tom Atkins, John Houseman, Charles Cyphers, Nancy Loomis, Hal Holbrook, and George Flower in one film has to be great.The death scenes are also very effective and set up very well. In fact, the entire film is set up well. We have a creepy, subtle build up until we get to the violent climax (in a church). I love that in a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"John Carpenter's The Fog" is one of Carpenter's finest films.**SPOILERS**It's the 100th Anniversary of the death of a horrific maritime disaster for Antonio Bay, and as night-fall approaches, a mysterious fog-bank rolls in. A fishing trawler is lost in the fog, and Nick Castle, (Tom Atkins) is assigned to go find it while the rest of the town prepares for the celebration. When he finds the trawler, he brings it back into town, which has been experiencing supernatural occurrences all day. He goes to Kathy Williams, (Janet Leigh) who finds out the truth about the town's celebration. That night, the ghosts attack the town, hiding inside of the fog-bank, leaving DL Stevie Wayne, (Adrienne Barbeau) to lead the surviving towns-members into the local church and safety from the ghosts.The Good News: As this is one of the early films made from Carpenter's early career, which was filled with classics, this one is also in that class. It's the most underrated of his classics, and features so many Carpenter-isms: the beautiful shots, the great characters, and a classic old-school feel. The shots in here are simply marvelous, and it looks quite spectacular. This is right on par with his best movies, and it really will appeal to the cinematic fans out there. The characters are so normal for these films, and as such doesn't need to be explained in here. Also, the film is just dripping with an old-school feel. There is a feel in here to try to replicate the old ghost stories with the film. The way they come back into the action is great, and it has an old-school feel to it, which is what these films should have. It's a pretty classic-horror film aura around it, and it proves that it doesn't need a bucket-full of gore to be disturbing, which is shocking considering when it came out. It speaks volumes about the power of the story and script to be like that and still be great. Of course, most of that goes to the special effects in the film, which are quite innovative and work quite well. The sights of the ghostly fog creeping around buildings, down streets, congregating in specific areas and the story about it that is spoken makes it that much more powerful a source. The opening is pretty great and spooky, and it builds loads of tension quickly.The Bad News: Sometimes, I feel as though it been a little faster. There were plenty of occasions where the story got bogged down because of the high amount of side-plots all needing their breathing space, that probably didn't need to have as much time as they did. This is merely a problem because there is a lot going on, and certain subplots had a little more weight to them than others, and so by giving precedence to one over the other, it gave the film a little bit of a slower pace and an overall convoluted atmosphere.The Final Verdict: This is one of Carpenter's best films, and it features a little bit of something for everyone. A slow pace isn't the worst thing a movie can be accused of. Carpenter fans will no doubt love this one, and all fans of the old-school horror feel should track this one down at once.Rated R: Violence and some language</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was not until recently that I finally saw this Carpenter classic all the way through, and I must say that I was not disappointed. This picture is truly terrifying and the subtlety of the scares is excellent. For the names of the characters I saw that Carpenter went into in-joke overdrive. I knew ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK Had characters called Romero and Cronenberg (presumably after the directors) but get a load of this: there are characters called Nick Castle (named after the original Michael Myers and Carpenter's writing partner on ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK), Tommy Wallace (named after this film's production designer, editor and one of the Fog Ghosts as well), Dan O'Bannon (after the sci-fi author) and a coroner named Dr. Phibes (after the Vincent Price character). But despite these corny jokes, the film works well. The tension barely lets up, and whenever the Fog rolls in, you know trouble is never far away.Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Janet Leigh and Hal Holbrook are all excellent in their roles. The same can't be said about Nancy Loomis. She was in Carpenter's earlier pic ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 and was dreadful in it. Here, her so-called acting abilities have not improved. There's also a very good cameo at the top of the movie by John Houseman as a teller of spooky stories. Carpenter's music is excellent as always. I like the way that the Fog Ghosts are shown mostly as silhouettes for most of the film. THat makes them even more spooky. Knowing Hollywood these days, the recent remake will probably show more of them, which is unnecessary. The ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 remake was pretty good, but I don't think that one of THE FOG was necessary, especially when the original is so scary and memorable.Overall, THE FOG is not to be missed. It's a Carpenter gem.</fullReview>

If you like john carpenter you will love this 25 year old movie of his. The way he portrays the characters and brings the "ghosts" to the screen is awesome. I am sure the new remake of this will be good, but it won't compare to the original. I can honestly say that if anybody out there has never seen a John Carpenter movie, this is a good beginning.

		<fullReview>Antonio Bay is celebrating it's 100 year anniversary, little knowing that the town's founding fathers were responsible for the death of many sailors on the very day the town was founded. When the fog rolls over this quiet little seaside town the ghosts of these past crimes return with vengeance in mind.John Carpenter's The Fog is one superior ghost movie. Obviously paying homage to campfire ghost tales, Carpenter excels here at every turn. Cleverly pacing the story, it gradually builds tension and atmosphere and climaxes with one hell of a battle between the vengeful ghosts and a handful of townspeople. Carpenter steers clear of gory visuals in favour of tension and succeeds brilliantly through magnificent use of camera-work (by Halloween's Dean Cundey) and his usual electrifying music score.The Fog is especially rewarding with repeated viewings, a familiar Carpenter trait. The more you think about it the more it gets under your skin. Though this film isn't completely devoid of cheap shocks (Carpenter is a master at cheap shocks), it's the gradual buildup that's most rewarding. The Fog is in my opinion the best ghost movie around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The centennial of the small town of Antonio Bay, California has finally arrived. However, the events of 100 years ago are about to come back to haunt the town, because a conspiracy of the town's founders resulted in the deaths of several lepers in a shipwreck. The conspirators had planned to lure the lepers' ship towards the rocks so that it would sink, and they could recover the cargo of gold and use it to pay for building the town. The sinister plot succeeded when a fog rolled in, blinding the crew, and forcing them to follow the false fire on shore. Now the ghosts of the Elizabeth Dane's crew are back - and so is the fog that led them to their doom. Only now, it conceals and protects the ghosts of the crew, as they seek their revenge on the residents of Antonio Bay..."John Carpenter has recently fallen into obscurity when it comes to entertaining horror movies but back in the 70's and 80's, he was the master of Horror flicks and one of his best is this classic, "The Fog". John Carpenter can usually thank his villains for helping make a good horror movie and one of the best was certainly Blake, the leading Pirate Zombie who manifests out of the fog to strike fear on all who see him. All of the main characters have a believability, no present day 2-D characters for a young JC. The fisher's brother, Jamie Lee Curtis, the priest and the woman on the radio are especially good and lot better than I originally expected. The plight that envelops the heroes are full of suspense and well worth a look. Get this movie on video/DVD (Preferably DVD), wait till late at night, get some snacks, turn off the lights, wrap yourself in the blanket and prepare for a night of horror you won't forget.

		<fullReview>Considering that this film was only his 2nd "Professional" film after his "Film school projects"; Dark Star &amp; Precinct 13, it is a masterpiece of suspenseful storytelling. I have always been a fan of ghost stories from a very early age and enjoy a good scare as much as anyone. With this one I crept down from upstairs after my bedtime as I was so desperate to see it after catching a glimpse of the front cover of the video in the video store. As a ten year old at the time, I was absolutely scared to death all the way through this film and have loved it ever since, I mean it is one of the only films that can still scare me even after having seen it so many times. One of the things I was most surprised of was that it took so long to receive a UK region 2 release (Oct 2004) after having been out in the states for such a long time. The DVD release has fascinating featurette interviews telling how complicated the process of producing the film had been, with a really good informative commentary by John Carpenter and Debra Hill (the original writers); once again proving that he is the most generous director in terms of trivial information on the film in question. Many directors actually sound apologetic during commentaries, but this is probably the best one I have heard so far (which is quite a few!).If you don't already own a copy, rectify the situation straight away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Spoilers within!!!*** Okay, I need to start out with a gripe here... After reading many other reviews for this movie, I felt compelled to not only put my own "two cents" in, but also to clarify a couple of obvious (and puzzling) misunderstandings about the synopsis. For one, the ghosts are *not* "pirates"; I don't understand why some people keep referring to them as such. In the movie, if you're paying proper attention to it, as the Priest is reading from his grandfather's diary, he points out the fact that they are, in fact, LEPERS.And for two, it was the grandfather, along with five others, who had ended up betraying the leper colony and caused the shipwreck that caused them all to drown. So, even though the six people who are killed during the movie by the ghost lepers seeking revenge are the *descendants* of the six conspirators, and hence had nothing whatsoever to do with the actual wiping-out of the colony, their murders were *not*, as some people have said, random. Again, if you actually pay attention to the movie, it's very clear to see that.Sure, there are admittedly a few plot holes and "red herrings" (the lepers do go after a couple of people whose ancestors *didn't* have anything to do with the lepers' deaths). But all in all, it STILL makes for one awesome spook story! There is no doubt that Carpenter was at his absolute horror-movie-making prime here. If you enjoy genuine, "goosebumpy" scary movies, this one (right along with JC's "Halloween" and "The Thing") ranks right up there with today's best horror movies. Remember, sometimes it's the implied and unseen in "older" horror movies which can be just as scary, if not more so, as the over-the-top, gratuitously gore-splattered films of today ("The Blair Witch Project" is the perfect contemporary example of my point: implied horror, not shown -- yet that movie scared the bejesus out of *millions* of people, myself included). A couple points of interest: special-effects make-up god Rob Bottin (pronounced "Bo-TEEN") actually plays one of his own "creations" in this movie -- Captain Blake (Bottin also worked with Carpenter on "The Thing") . And Antonio Bay is actually Point Reyes, CA.Unfortunately, over the past fifteen years or so, Carpenter has lost his "edge". His recent movies haven't contained any of that gut-wrenching, visceral horror for which he used to be so reknowned and worshipped. Movies like "Vampires" and "Ghosts of Mars" are so "beneath" him, it's not even funny. I still can't believe he actually made a sequel to "Vampires"... Talk about adding insult to injury! John, if you're reading this, I'm still "with you", dude; I've been an admirer of yours since "Halloween" premiered, and I always will be. But you can do far better than you have been lately; your fans know it, and you know it. You *can* get that "edge" back. Please keep trying; don't give up. Just don't bring back "Vampires" or "Snake" Plissken again, okay? ::grins::Bottom line, "The Fog" is a definite "MUST-SEE" movie, even if you only watch it once. Personally, I lost count a long time ago...</fullReview>

Carpenter's early works have such a great reputation that he gets a total pass on this one. There is no forward drive in the narrative - it's just a bunch of scenes that don't really feel related to each other. The scary scenes aren't all that scary and none of the characters are developed enough to care about them. There is the occasional well-crafted, well-lit scene thanks to Dean Cundey and Carpenter's unquestionable skill at framing a shot. But overall it's just an inert, meandering mess. And to quote one of the funnier and more accurate reviews on here, Jamie Lee Curtis does absolutely NOTHING in this movie. Her character is completely pointless except to put her on the poster under Carpenter's name so they could cash in on the success of their much much much much superior collaboration, "Halloween".

But while its habitants are celebrating the occasion a mysterious fog starts appearing in the town? This film is a classic, a cult movie in the horror scene, but it's too old-fashioned! The plot is too slow and has no consistency. The suspense scenes are too dated and cause almost no effect. The characters are all of them too separated from each other; the only link between them is a radio program! The typical clich scenes of the 80's horror movies are all there? some examples: Things which start doing something by their own (the buzzing cars, the gas station...etc), the woman which is trying to escape and goes to the top of the lighthouse where she has no escape!...The death of the priest right at the end when he thought he had already escaped? - It's all so typical of the 80's horror movies and it's so dated (in spite of many horror films today still having this kind of scenes?). The main idea of the plot is the only thing which remains good and, let's call it, "actualized"? To its time and genre it's not a bad movie, but to someone like me who is used to recent special effects and better plots this movie was nothing special.The Fog, directed by John Carpenter, is a cult movie, I know that, but even so, I couldn't like it so much?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to love John Carpenter, but I've been rewatching his movies recently and I'm not so sure anymore. He has interesting ideas and can do a lot with a low budget, but there's no escaping the fact that some of his movies are just plain bland... especially "The Fog." All his trademark touches are here--simplistic score and sets, interesting lighting--and all his trademark weaknesses, too--simplistic score and sets, town with a population of about five people (the crowd of extras at the "celebration" look like just that, extras, who have been paid to stand around listlessly). This time there's the the added weakness of a fog that doesn't look or act anything like fog. It should have been called "The Smoke," or maybe "The Steam." It glows, turns off boat engines (!?), and drags unconvincingly across the screen. The way it completely smothers people's houses is kind of cool, and has a claustrophobia to it that's the only scary part of the movie. The ONLY other noteworthy thing is that a key element of the movie--and this is supposed to be very scary and menacing--is a board. Yes, a board. At one point Adrienne Barbeau says something like, "I think everything that's been happening around here has something to do with the board my son found!" (OK, she calls it driftwood, but still). Other than the claustrophobic "fog" and the Board of Doom, this is a tedious movie, and people who say it's a horror classic are lying through their teeth. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly Made, Stunningly Atmospheric, Unmissable Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The small California coastal town of Antonio Bay is preparing to celebrate the centenary of its founding when Father Malone, the local priest, discovers a hidden journal which tells the true story of its history. It seems the town was founded on looted gold from a leper ship that was deliberately grounded by the townsfolk, and the ghosts of the murdered mariners are about to exact their terrible revenge ...Ever since I first saw it way back when, I have always been hopelessly in love with this fabulous movie - it's a complete one-of-a-kind. I'm the first to admit that its low budget occasionally shows and the story has some big credibility gaps, but it is simply the finest example of an atmospheric horror film I have ever come across. It's beautifully made, it's wonderfully scary, it's intriguing, dramatic, amusing, sad, exciting, and it's a perfect example of Carpenter's unique ability to effortlessly create suspense and atmosphere. It was made by the same team as Halloween (editor and designer Tommy Lee Wallace, cameraman Dean Cundey, co-writer and producer Debra Hill, and composer, co-writer and director Carpenter), but is stylistically the opposite of that movie - a literate, densely-plotted, large-scale ensemble piece, and for my money is an even better picture. There are many great ghost-story movies, but I've never come across one as moody and effective as this - the ghostly mariners are just fantastic; spooky, barely-glimpsed, evocative and terrifying. Every aspect of the production is just sensational, from the opening Edgar Allan Poe quote accompanied by Carpenter's quietly unsettling piano score to the grisly shock ending. Cundey's location photography of the lonely windswept coastline and the picture-postcard town is heartachingly beautiful. The movie was shot in Inverness in Northern California, close to where Hitchcock shot The Birds, and is eerily reminiscent of that other great horror film. The cast are all wonderful, particularly Barbeau, Holbrook and Loomis, and casting the mother-daughter duo of cult movie icons Leigh and Curtis is a terrific coup (their characters are unrelated in the story). Watch out also for a speaking-role cameo by the director as an underpaid janitor. The movie also features great special effects by Richard Albain and Rob Bottin. This is one of those truly exceptional films which combines a terrific story with an incredible atmospheric style and uses all the great cinematic techniques to produce a dizzying, chilling, thrilling, eye-popping horror movie. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

Well done follow up to Halloween is better in some ways. It slowly lets thrills build up and doesn't use cheap scare tactics or gimmicks. My only complaint is the very last frame. It totally negates the whole film and feels out of place.Rated R; Graphic Violence &amp; Profanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the traumatizing experience that was the remake of The Fog, unfortunately, I saw that first, I was even more terrified of seeing the original Fog. Just because the plot from the remake, I assumed it to be the same, just seemed too stupid and not scary. But one of my friends who shares the same love I do for horror movies said to skip the remake and watch The Fog, the original. I am glad that I gave this movie a chance.John Carpenter brings us another tale of horror that will be remembered for generations to come, despite how silly it sounds, a fog that kills people, you'll have to believe me when I say that this is not the kind of weather you would not want to get caught up in. :D We have a promising cast, including two legendary scream queens: Janet Leigh and her daughter, Jamie Lee Curtus.This has a spooky story, grizzly effects, and the plot actually works without over doing itself. Please, watch this movie, not the remake, this is a true classic that just got butchered like usual. Plus, we have to trust John, he brought us Halloween and The Thing, I'm sorry that I ever doubted this movie! 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A major letdown from John Carpenter. His follow-up to the masterwork HALLOWEEN is nowhere near as scary or stylish. Zombies come from the sea to haunt a coastal village. Jamie Lee Curtis is back from HALLOWEEN (as are a few others) and joins the likes of Hal Holbrook, John Houseman and Adrienne Barbeau (as a sexy voiced DJ). Blandness replaces suspense as the film goes from dull to really dull and then to just plain silly as Barbeau, whose radio station is situated in a lighthouse, tells the cast just where the fog is headed during the film's climax. In a real case of stunt casting, Curtis's mom and PSYCHO vet Janet Leigh is also in the cast. Carpenter would regain his footing with the likes of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING. Curiously (and needlessly)THE FOG was remade 25 years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once upon a time, a ship was lost at sea. The fog was obscuring the visibility. Then, the crew saw a light; they assumed that it was a town. They sailed in that direction...and were killed when the ship crashed into the rocks. The legend says that when the fog returns, the ship will also return and look for the light that led it to its doom.Since the movie happens on the hundredth anniversary of the shipwreck, it naturally means that the fog does return, and...well, you can probably figure out what happens. It's predictable, but fun nevertheless, as John Carpenter's movies often are. And Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis are pretty interesting on screen together (they later co-starred in "Halloween: H20"). Improbable, but neat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak follow-up?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an aspiring filmmaker, I think I gradually develop more and more of a fear of my first film being a huge hit, because it places so much attention on you immediately and creates this enormous requirement for a second film of equal magnitude. Just after Halloween, John Carpenter returns with The Fog, a weak horror film that tries vainly to recreate the subtle, relentless horror of Halloween, but instead comes off as little more than a campy ghost story. The premise is interesting enough, a ship at sea becomes lost in a thick fog and, seeing a light in the fog that appears to be from a fire, heads in that direction and ends up striking a reef and sinking, killing everyone on board. I've heard people describe them as pirates, for some reason, and there was some mention in the film of them being lepers, but their identity is really irrelevant. The point is that they were killed by a light that lured them to their watery deaths, and every hundred years, I guess, they are able to come back between midnight and 1am, the time of their shipwreck, to seek revenge against the people who caused their deaths. Kind of reminds me of that idiot film Jeepers Creepers and its equally idiotic sequel, both of which feature a monster that comes back every 23 years for 23 days to kill. The only difference is that the victims of the shipwreck have a REASON to come back and kill.So anyway, I'm pretty sure I have the basics of the plot right, but unfortunately, after the campside ghost story at the beginning of the film, the movie itself is really a series of cheap scares and ineffective cinematography, to say nothing of the fact that the movie begins with that fireside scene, a gigantic clich in itself. The animation of the fog into the film was one of the big special effects, and acknowledging that the film was made more than 20 years ago, I have to say it was less than impressive. It is endowed with the rather campy quality that it literally glows, and has all sorts of capabilities, like jamming turbine engines and other physically destructive forces.I tried to convince my roommate that it was a good movie even though it's title implied some evil, murderous fog, because it wasn't the fog that was able to kill, but the ghosts that came back to life within it. Unfortunately, the fog does take on some powers of its own. But again, this is a horror film, and one of the first 80s horror films ever made, so there are certain things that must be excused. It did help to usher in a whole sub-genre of horror films, but not really one that wasn't already introduced by its predecessor, Halloween, one of the greatest horror films ever made.(spoilers) There were a few individual scenes that really bothered me. A nighttime radio host, curiously named Stevie Wayne (played by Adrienne Barbeau) is one of the first to see the fog rolling in, with the help of the weatherman, who calls her regularly to give her reports about the weather. There's a scene late in the film where she watches helplessly as the fog engulfs her own home, where her young son is home alone. After the baffling decision of doing nothing more than yell into the radio at him, hoping that he's listening, to watch out for the fog, she later apologizes to him for not coming to help, assuming that he has fallen victim to the killer fog and there's nothing to do about it but say sorry. The reason this scene bothered me is because it is so contrived and pointless. Any thinking person (even if able to think of any other person when their own son's life was in danger), would simply scream into the microphone that there's a deadly fog rolling and so get the hell out of town, and then take off to help her son. She had a full-on radio station in that lighthouse, she might have even been able to record that and then loop it over and over for the benefit of people who are flipping through the station looking for some news about what in the world is going on with this freaky weather.But instead, she chooses to remain in the radio station, apologizing to her son for letting him die so that she can stay in the radio station and give any listeners a play-by-play of where exactly the fog is and when, like there's someone who's going to stay in town, listening to the radio so they know what parts of town to stay away from. Personally, I'd be getting on the highway away from the coast, regardless of what any radio show was saying. But hey, that's just me.My favorite thing about the film is that there are so many elements distinctive of John Carpenter's work, although that also served to constantly remind me that the movie was always in the shadow of Halloween, trying unsuccessfully to recreate the successful brand of horror seen in that movie. That being said, then, I would say that The Fog is certainly not a horror classic in any sense, but definitely a curiosity piece in regards to the work of John Carpenter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quickie Review: The Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Prince of Darkness, I was disappointed with this movie. The elements for a great horror flick are all there ? an impressive cast, a descent premise, an eerie score and a director who knows how to use shadows and camera viewpoints well. But even with the combined elements The Fog doesn't really work. It's not that scary per say and, though it grips you throughout, when the film is over you realise there wasn't much to offer. Plus, some parts are really weird ? there's one scene in a hospital or morgue where a dead guy gets up and goes for someone before landing on his face?and no one seemed to think that was out of the ordinary. Carpenter wanted this to have a PG rating, not an R rating. And I agree ? it would have made it better film because with a PG rating you watch it differently ? it becomes a horror movie for the family. Instead it remains just a "minor horror hit", as Carpenter once said. What The Fog has going for it the most it the powerfully spooky atmosphere. There is constant tension throughout and a feeling of instant dread when you see that (admittedly outdated looking) fog approaching. The photography is beautiful as is the outstanding soundtrack from Carpenter ? one of the horror genre's very best. The piano score is creepy as hell whilst remaining understated. Really marvelous stuff. Using an ensemble cast without a main character is a risky movie and, though it doesn't completely work, The Fog is far more memorable for sharing screen time between the likes of Adrienne Barbeau, Jaime Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh John Houseman and Tom Atkins. Best Scene: When the kid finds the piece of wood at the beach, the signature score kicks in as we follow him to his home. It's not a 'big' scene by any means, but the spine-chilling score elevates it to a whole new level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter plays Misty for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did like the story. Still, I found Carpenter's adaptation of it overkill. The main feature, a vindictive glowing fog carrying murderous phantoms, is displayed much too early and much too overtly. If Carpenter would have acquainted the audience with the idea of a strange and menacing fog in a more psychological way, the creepiness of the story could have been very well realized. Now, it was exaggerated instead; each time the fog appears, there's a loud and disturbing percussion score (composed by the director himself) reminiscent of a truly bad hangover.Jamie Lee Curtis plays a minor part, and is surprisingly not the Scream Queen of the movie as Carpenter chose to cast his wife (Adrienne Barbeau) in that role. There are several interesting similarities to the otherwise different Eastwood picture Play Misty For Me: (1)The main protagonist runs a small town radio station. (2)The small town is located beautifully by the sea. (3)The radio station only broadcasts lesser Basiesque instrumental jazz tunes. (4)The title of the picture involves the concept of "fog" i.e. "mist" as in Misty.Having stated this, I conclude that this picture did not measure up to Halloween and, in particular, Someone's Watching ME!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly atmospheric and impressive horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One the eve of its centennial, the small town of Antonio Bay undergoes some strange events. Father Malone (Hal Holbrook) is sat in his study when a stone falls out of the wall behind him to reveal an old journal. It belongs to Father Malone's grandfather, and tells how he and the other five founding members of the town caused a ship called Elizabeth Dane to crash, and then plundered it. They planned to open a leper colony, but all of the crew on board were killed. And now a strange fog has begins to creep upon the town, carrying with it a ghostly ship. Three fishermen are killed by sword-wielding spirits, and it soon becomes clear that the crew of the Elizabeth Dane are back to claim six lives for themselves.As mentioned by Marc in his review of John Carpenter's most recent film, The Ward (2010), Carpenter's career is a very mixed bag. Made during his early heyday, The Fog was produced on a low-budget, and contains the same kind of style and atmosphere that we saw in the excellent Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) and Halloween (1978). It's not his best film by any means, but The Fog has become an almost classic in the horror genre. To my surprise, (as other reviews I had read told me otherwise) The Fog is very good, and although isn't ground-breaking like Halloween, or as damn cool as Escape from New York (1981), or even as inspired as The Thing (1982), but it is certainly eerie, and has that 1980's feel to it that the likes of Carpenter and David Cronenberg made their own.The premise of it is certainly silly. It's the time of thing you would read in an old collection of horror stories, and see in a 1950's B- movie. But this is essentially a B-movie, but made straight-faced by Carpenter with his golden touch that rules out any possibility that the film might come across as silly. This is pure popcorn horror, made by an old master. Especially memorable is the scene where we first glimpse the ship's crew, huddled in a church with the fog swirling around them. Their leader slowly draws his sword; his red eyes glowing, while Carpenter's self-penned atmospheric synth-score plays over. Again, silly-sounding. But it's not, it's actually beautiful and extremely cool. A very pleasant surprise, and another reminder of just how good Carpenter was before his decline. You'll have to hold a knife to my throat to watch the sequel though.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

Overall I left this movie saying that it is NOWHERE near as good as Escape From New York Or Halloween (in my opinion Carpenter's 2 best pieces of work) but it isn't a movie where the audience is treated like retards (in lets say The Halloween remake or Halloween 3).This is an entertaining movie, One that is good and relies more on the story than actual horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great example of the (then nascent) slash horrors which became ubiquitous in the years following this film's release. I have seen it three times now, and have always been impressed by its atmosphere and its virtually unique way of providing the shocks, seemingly knitting them from the film's sometime meandering pace. The acting isn't exactly earth-shattering, but neither is it dreadful. Enough chemistry seems to exist to bear the film along to its fraught, violent climax, which is as tense and chilling as the film's bulk. The film's low budget is not at all obvious - the lighthouse illuminating the distant fog is a simple, cheap and yet beautiful shot, and the film makes the most of its location with similar great shooting throughout. Visually it may have aged, but the story has not. Good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by John Carpenter and structured as a spooky tale told to kids around a campfire, this is an underrated ghost story in which a quiet coastal town is menaced by a mysterious fog.Yes, the plot is silly, but this film contains some of the best atmosphere in Carpenter's filmography. Carpenter's visuals here are interesting at times, his use of silence and sound impressive and his set-pieces appropriately tense.Unfortunately the film was meddled by producers, who ordered Carpenter to insert more gore. A gentle horror film which relied primarily on eerie atmosphere, slow visuals and quiet tension, thus got corrupted by moments of unnecessary gore and graphic violence.7.5/10 ?

		<fullReview>That sentence by Edgar Allan Poe is the first thing that appears on the screen when you're watching The Fog. It leaves you hoping for something more intelligent than you're about to get. After this we see an old man telling a ghost story to a group of children, which fits to the film a lot better. The story introduces the background of The Fog and Carpenter nicely reflects the children to the audience.Antonio Bay a city in California is celebrating its 100th birthday on the 21st of April. At the same night ghost-zombies come to the town seeking for revenge. In The Fog we see real life mother-daughter actresses Janet Leight (Psycho) and Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween). Also the cast includes Hal Holbrook as the town's priest and Carpenter's usual actress, Adrienne Barbeau as a sympathetic single-mom radio station owner.From the very beginning John Carpenter tries to build a complex story. He starts creating many different stories, which are supposed to come together. Unfortunately this is not one of his strengths. The clich situations Carpenter puts his characters are sometimes very silly and predictable. But I think he managed to keep the story together with good characters.Very often directors want to make another film after their first breakthrough. A film with the same themes and elements, but usually these second films never can compete with the first ones. Carpenter tried to create as successful horror film as Halloween, but failed. Even that I personally think that Halloween isn't that great and it's pretty much on the same level with this.Even that The Fog has its flaws (sometimes it seems that Carpenter thinks his audience as the stupidest people on earth) it also has its great moments. First of all the great cameraman Dean Cundeyn (Halloween, Without Warning, The Thing) gives a great kick to this film. His creepy shots of streets filled with fog are amazing. The way he uses light and shadows is brilliant, he adds a little film-noir to The Fog. Another great thing about The Fog is the music and the whole sound scape. Actually, John Carpenter composed the music for this (You can sense the similarity between The Fog's and Halloween's music). The sound scape is probably one of the creepiest people had heard in 1980. The visuality of The Fog worked brilliantly with the sound and that combination is one of the best things of the film.The Fog has many unbelievable parts, which I won't tell you, but you will see them. The story makes you believe in something, but then later it cracks it up. But I think John Carpenter intended to do a nice, enjoyable horror-film and in that he succeed. The Fog still doesn't have many "splatter-stylish" gross pictures (With one wormy exception). If I had made The Fog, I would've kept the mysticism of The Fog till the very end. I think that is a major flaw Carpenter did. He spoiled the mystery with creepy effects and clich twists.In the end an enjoyable horror film. I saw it on the big screen and I must say that is the place where John Carpenter is at his best. His films don't work that well on TV. The Fog is a great choice for a chilly-foggy-summer night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quick plot line, A strange fog is heading for a small town and weird things begin to happen like people are found dead just in time for the town 100th anniversary. As the local priest, Father Malone, finds an old, hidden diary he discovers that the people who lived in the town 100 years ago were responsible for killing and stealing from a ship, and now it seems like the ship's crew has returned for revenge...This was John Carpenter's follow up to the successful Halloween, although not in the same league as Halloween "The Fog" is still a worthy follow up with the same kind of mood with this creep ghost story and Carpenter doesn't waste time and early on gives us some small scares, creating a feeling that something is wrong and something scary is about to happen.The premise is in my opinion is good and the way Carpenter delivers suspense is great and it works.There's an array of great stars in this movie as well, such as 80's horror stars Adrienne Barbeau (The Swamp Thing and Creepshow) playing a radio DJ surrounded by "The Fog" and trapped in the Lighthouse, Hal Halbrook another 80's horror star (Creepshow and Girls Nite Out) as Father Malone, Janet Leigh (Psycho) as a woman in charge of the anniversary party and Halloween stars Nancy Loomis playing Janet Leigh's daughter, Charles Cypers and none other than the main Scream Queen herself Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh's real life daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis has a blast playing the fun sexy hitchhiker, in only her 2nd movie.The film's great scene-stealers though are Barbeau and Leigh. Barbeau is a great, sympathetic heroine, the sort who's a single mom and working the night shift alone at her own radio station. She's also the main character of the entire film, watching the horror closing in on the town and can only warn people through her radio channel. Leigh (Curtis' real-life mom and also the famous shower victim in Psycho) seems to have a good time returning to the horror genre and is rather amusing as a neurotic old lady.All in all not for gore fans or slasher movie fans but for anyone whose into a really creepy ghost story, but this is definitely for Jamie Lee Curtis fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The New and Improved(?) Fog, 2005 WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not sure if you've seen it yet, but there's another "Fog" on the way. October 14, 2005, to be exact. I've looked at the names and the general summary, and it looks like, yep, it's a remake. (Of course, I'm probably telling you IMDb movie-genius-folks stuff you already know! =0D ) I have two questions, and they may well be spoilers for someone who never saw this original Fog, so....be warned, 'CAUSE HERE I GO!First: back in the recesses of my dim little brain (hey, it's been busy for 40+ years, the warranty's up!), I recall reading a nifty little horror story called "The Fog". It was a novel, though frankly it could have been edited to a novelette or short story. Basic outline: pirates were lured to crash on the rocks of an island, they died (undied?), the bad guys got their gold, now the fog Shrouds Them In Mystery as they Take Their Vengenace on the descendants. I could have SWORN it was by Frank Herbert, but his bibliography had nada...but I've come across a "The Fog" by JAMES Herbert. It's been a long time...anyone know if I've got the right book? Second: re: The Last Frame, as someone pointed out in an earlier thread. If we're thinking of the same flick, it's after the Icky Undead Types have left the place (no, I don't remember why), and everyone thinks everything's just fine. Then a single man (I keep thinking he's a priest) is standing in his house and WHAM! a thick fog rolls in through the window (talk about your localized front!). He turns, sees the figure of an Icky Undead Guy, and is then promptly decapitated with a swing of Undead Guy's sword. Th'end.Am I right about that scene being the odd one out? Because if so, I have to agree with you: it seemed like it was tacked on from another movie, and largely spoiled the overall effect.Wonder how the next one will be.Cheers, all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter does a fairly good job in directing the material here, with some effective horror moments, even if they are too few, and an interesting visual and audio style. Otherwise, this is not good stuff. Fog as a horror monster is not really scary, the characters and events are run-of-the-mill, and the dialogue is lame, bridging on bad, with Adrienne Barbeau going through some very poorly written monologues. The special effects are okay, but hardly brilliant, and both the acting and writing in general is below par. Carpenter shows some skill in the film, but only as a director and not as a screenwriter. Overall this is still as forgettable as the average horror film out there, despite a few neat bits thanks to Carpenter being in the director's chair</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A step back for John Carpenter...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>but it would be a step up for pretty much any other low-budget horror director (I'm looking at you, Snchez and Myrick). The Fog is, much like its immediate predecessor, a tale built around common urban myth and fear. Also continued from Halloween is the masterful use of the 2.35:1 frame, and some cast members who would, or have had, figured prominently in Carpenter features. Tubby Tom Atkins would feature very prominently in Escape From New York and future Halloween sequels, giving Carpenter a sort of mini-Kevin Bacon status. Of course, it is typical of a good director to want to work with the same staff repeatedly. However, the qualities that make Carpenter want to work with Atkins more than once remain a mystery, even after multiple viewings of Escape From New York.What The Fog lacks, in essence, is depth. One can look at the running time and see that the film is too short to give any of its characters anything resembling a second dimension. One winds up remembering characters by their profession rather than any unique characteristics of their personality. Another problem is that the rules regarding what the titular fog can or cannot do seem to flex with the wants of their situation. When they want to stop the town's residents from communicating, they simply cut power wires. No explanation of how they are able to do this is forthcoming.Where the film's strength lies is in the practical realisation of its storytelling elements. In some long shots, the titular fog looks as if it has been crudely painted onto the negative. In closer shots, such as on one landing, the use of a few smoke machines quite obviously had great effect. It would have been perfect if they had not shown cars suddenly failing to start in the middle of this fog. Honestly, cars will only be as unreliable as depicted in film if Microsoft get their way and start putting their software into cars. Had this element only been used once, it probably would have hurt credibility a lot less.Again, Carpenter proves there is a reason why he exclusively uses the Panavision anamorphic process. Every frame is used to full effect, with either a nice populace spread throughout, or moving from one end to the other. DVD-Video was made for films like The Fog. Carpenter also proves his musical prowess once more with a very driving, punchy score that adds dramatic tension to shots that would otherwise be meaningless transition. Indeed, that Carpenter's scores are not widely available on compact disc is yet more evidence of the RIAA's short-sightedness.In the end, the simplistic ghost story, which seems to have been yanked from the pages of Ripley's Believe It Or Not, sustains the 89-minute film to the extent of leaving the viewer wanting more. In this day where films seem to make a habit of overstaying their welcome, even if they run for less than this rather small length, going back to a time when films didn't outlast their welcome is always refreshing. If nothing else, The Fog shows that either the supernatural can be greedy, too, or that a Dwarf can have a ghost. Whatever conclusion you reach, the weakness of the characters is more than made up by the back-story. It isn't frightening, it isn't exciting, and it certainly doesn't have any interesting people in it. In spite of all those things, it builds a good atmosphere, and is worth watching once. The ending seems a little redundant to me, but what the hell.I gave The Fog a seven out of ten. It does have more than its fair share of flaws, but it is also entertaining as one of those typical ghost stories. It is certainly worth a rental to see what B-level horror films were like before Hollywood became the one-segment, one-format cookie-cutter it tends to be today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great mother fogging movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listen up you mother foggers, if you like horror movies and you haven't seen this yet, do yourself a favor and go buy the DVD. I think it runs pretty cheap on Amazon or wherever else you do your DVD shopping. Anyway, the movie sums up pretty simply as a bunch of ghost pirates slicing and dicing up the locals of a coastal town. Because they're understandably upset about some business with the town's ancestors from a hundred years back. Either way, the movie is really creepy at times. There's a great scene near the beginning where the passengers on a fishing boat get righteously hacked up. It's nice to see a film where people get savagely executed by way of sickle and sword. I love stuff like this, don't you? I think this is one of Carpenter's better films and it has a great cast with Tom Atkins, John Houseman, Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau, and Jamie Lee Curtis with mom Janet Leigh! The ghost pirates are much scarier than the ones from Pirates of the Caribbean. What else can I say about this movie other than it's always funny when you have butchering murderers polite enough to knock on your door before running you through with a dull blade? Yar, mateys! This ship runs its course well it does! Yar! RATING: ***1/2 out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulously cheesy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favourite horror films, this has John Carpenter's stamp all over it. Plenty of what's-round-that-corner moments, a generous slice of ham acting (courtesy of Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Charles Cyphers and Nancy Loomis among the usual Carpenter film actors) and a fabulously moody score.Of course there are holes in the plot -- big ones. But then, it's not supposed to be realistic. It's a horror film, with zombies. Realism is not paramount for such a flick. A film should be judged on its entertainment value in my opinion, not on how well it holds up to nit-picking, and this is entertaining, atmospheric and downright creepy from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog tells a ghost story of revenge and inevitability. 100 years ago, a ship was wrecked in a ghostly fog. In the present day - this fog reappears as Antonio Bay (a north-western coastal village) gears up for its 100 year anniversary.The Fog is a creepish, old school style horror / ghost movie with plenty of things that go bump in the fog. This movie is created by those that brought Halloween (John Carpenter, et al) - and it reassembles some of Halloween's cast (including Jamie Lee Curtis). The Fog is a slow-burner of a film - creating an "old school" atmosphere. Adrienne Barbeau's DJ character is brilliant - I love that smooth radio voice - it gives the town of Antonio Bay such depth.This is well worth checking out if you like an "old style" horror / thriller with a few scares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film about 20 years ago on television. I love Hal Holbrook and John Houseman, not to mention Jamie Lee Curtis. I also like sea stories. And when I saw that it was a John Carpenter film, WELL... I had to see it! What I remembering being the scariest was the dead sailors... black silhouetted beings with glowing eyes... and of course, THE FOG itself. Adriene Barbeau was great, too, and I recall a very suspenseful ending. I remember at least one part where I was yelling at someone on the screen, "No! No! Don't go in there!" I watched this film alone in my apartment, with all the lights out. By the end, I was so creeped out, I had to call a friend for comfort!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this movie is rather reminiscent of Play Misty for Me (with the coastal location of the radio broadcasting station), Night of the Living Dead (with the movements and design of the walking dead men), and Halloween (in that it is a small town ravaged by an unbelievable horror), this is still a quality production.Jamie Lee Curtis and Janet Lee together in this darkly sinister tale woven by Carpenter and Hill, and beautifully executed on film. While this is not Carpenter's best work, it is superior to most done at this time. In this critic's opinion, Carpenter's worst still tops most others' best.This story is a good premise in that it embodies fright, a good story, and strong performances within a great darkling atmosphere. This production, while terribly dated and sometimes slow, does bear that intensity and suspenseful chill most fans have come to expect from Carpenter's work.STORYLINE: (From the box)"Exactly 100 years ago, the treasure ship 'Elizabeth Dane' was horribly wrecked in a thick, eerie fog under mysterious circumstances. Now, shrouded in mist, the long-dead mariners have returned from their watery grave to exact a bloody revenge. Can this waking nightmare be stopped, or will the fog keep rolling in...to kill and kill again?"The movie also stars Adrienne Barbeau and John Houseman.SPOILERS HERE!!!Contained within this sinister production are some extremely creative elements: the gold coin which turns into the watery, flaming ship sign; the spooky priest who jumps out at you from the shadows; the darkling use of the "Witching Hour;" the use of creative lighting behind the fog to make it appear to be glowing and ethereal; the fact that the fog itself is alive and not just the things in the fog; the use of a character known as Dr. Phibes; and many, many more.END SPOILERS!!!All in all, we were thoroughly spooked by this production, and I look forward to the future remake (10/2005)..It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's something in "The Fog"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small seaside town is visited by the vengeful ghosts of men who were betrayed and murdered 100 years ago. This is one of Carpenter's best, one of the essential films that cemented his reputation as a director. "The Fog" is filled with intriguing visuals, most of which involve...what else?...fog that creeps around the strangest places. The characters are likable, and a few of the set pieces are truly effective, such as scenes of Barbeau in peril at a remote lighthouse. If the script had been a little stronger, the movie could have been a little better. The story is thin, and more than a little silly. We never really understand what is going on with the ghosts, or why. If they are spirits, how can they be touched, and how can they touch others? The climax is unsatisfying, and it unfolds with the characters figuring out a set of "rules" far too quickly. Fortunately there are some great scenes to offset the stuff that doesn't work, like a great climactic confrontation at the lighthouse between Adrienne Barbeau and one of the ghosts. "The Fog" is also an affectionate homage to "Halloween" in many ways, reuniting many of the cast members and giving a few sly nods through the names of some of the characters. Notably, the always-appealing Nancy Loomis/Kyes turns in what would amount to her last significant film role. I would have loved to have seen Nancy in more films. Jamie Lee Curtis is also in full scream-queen mode here, demonstrating why she held that title for several years before (fortunately) making the leap to film roles that cemented her reputation as a more versatile actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Fog when I saw about 12 or 13 (16 now) and it really creeped me out. John Carpenter used the same scare techniques he used for Halloween, rarely showing the ghosts, and using little violence, as well as building the sense of dread with the score. I wouldn't call The Fog a slasher flick. Instead I would call this an interesting ghost story with full of twists and turns, complete with a shock ending! It's great to see two scream queens (Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis) in this film, They both deliver brilliant performances, but the film is quietly stolen by Hal Holbrook, who discovers the terrifying truths of Antonia Bay and realises that it is too late to run.John Carpenter's The Fog is a haunting masterpiece, and is a better film than Halloween in my opinion, although Halloween is one of my favourite films. 26 years on, it still has the power to terrify.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smoke machine + Sleepy coastal town + Adrienne Barbeau = "THE FOG"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This ridiculous yet hilarious 'horror' film makes the most out of its thread-bare plot by casting stereotype characters against an evil presence that arises out of a mysterious fog that en-shrouds a coastal town which becomes the subject of the above-mentioned horror, "THE FOG".The evil here isn't actually 'the fog' itself, but what comes out of 'the fog' that supposedly represents the true terror.John Carpenter's protege, Jamie Lee Curtis, shares the head title for this garbage with none other than ex-'MAUDE' wash-up, Adrienne Barbeau who begins her career into schlock horror territory with this tripe. Also thrown into this horrific melange is silver-screen veteran, Janet Leigh, sporting a ludicrous poodle-haircut that serves her no justice, B-Grade actors John Houseman, Tom Atkins and Hal Holbrook as a Minister with several dark secrets hidden beneath his cloth.Adrienne Barbeau portrays a radio DJ(!!) aptly named Stevie Wayne who broadcasts her program live from a lighthouse situated out in the middle of nowhere. She is the first character to notice the strange happenings accompanied with 'the fog' that begin to occur during the town's centenary celebrations. From her lighthouse, she can track the exact route 'the fog' takes as it spreads across town with a personal mission of its own.You see, 100 years ago, apparently a leprosy-infested crew of a ship filled with gold were tricked into docking outside the town's harbor where they were butchered during the night by the greedy townsfolk who plundered the gold for themselves and left the poor victims for dead. Of course, little did they know that their actions would have sinister consequences and that on this particular night 100 years later, a fog sweeping across town would bring with it zombies who represent the slain crew members of the ill-fated ship, seeking the gold that was once taken from them. Not to mention, the victims of this supernatural rebellion all happen to be the unfortunate descendants of the very people who plundered the gold 100 years ago.The zombies are basically men wearing wet rotting clothes with no apparent facial features who walk out of the fog rapping on various people's doors to kill residents of the town in bizarre fashions. This would have to be one of the first horror films to feature zombies who are actually courteous enough to knock on their victim's door first before doing away with them! Some of the victims include a boat load of gin-soaked fishermen and complete loons who answer the 'strange knocking on their doors', even if it does happen to be 1:00am in the morning!The survivors of the pack are of course the big names of the cast - Barbeau, Lee-Curtis, Leigh, Atkins and Holbrook who manage to hold off the vengeful zombies in a church who spend the last 15 or so 'suspenseful' minutes of the film enforcing pews and cupboards against the windows as the zombies outside shatter the pains with their rotting hands as they try anything to get in.The five final minutes of "THE FOG" are nothing but total inappropriate hilarity. It involves Hal Holbrook, his nasty little secret and a glowing golden crucifix.There are very few scares in this film and I was quite stunned to discover that John Carpenter had dreamed this garbage up and also managed to haul in Alfred Hitchcock's darling, Janet Leigh ("PSYCHO") to portray a festivity organizer who almost becomes zombie food. I did however get a good laugh out of the preposterous nature of "THE FOG". It would definitely be one of his worst films, but it is quite an enjoyable film if you're drunk on a Saturday night.3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's fine craft....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing for John Carpenter, he knows what's scary.And "The Fog", his first big movie after the runaway success of "Halloween", shows his strengths and weaknesses in one neat little package.His strengths are obvious: atmosphere, light and shadow placement, story setup (Houseman's intro is the work of genius) and, of course, the fear of what you can't see.And what's more mysterious than a good, thick fog? This fog is supposed to herald the souls of murdered pirates that a seaside town killed for their gold. Now the ghosts have returned for revenge. But on the weak side, there is no set rationale to the ghosts' murders: they lash out at everyone, young and old alike, involved with the townsfolk or not. Maybe that's part of the message; vengeance is blind. I dunno. Also, characters were never Carpenter's strong point; he's best at getting your blood pumping and making you jump out of your seat. The people here are either passive or hysterical, no middle ground. But as far as scares go, "The Fog" delivers, beginning to end. Carpenter always was a good visualist. And there are moments here that will, indeed, make you jump. Watch for them.TIDBIT - Notice, too, the names of the characters in this film: Nick Castle, Dan O'Bannon, Tommy Wallace - all co-workers and friends of Carpenter's. Very Hitchcockian.Eight stars. In this "Fog", keep your lights off; it's better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched the excellent his "PoD" recently, i was just highly disappointed by the beginning of this movie: the photography is pretty awful, the old sailor reveals everything and the priest scene was just like "PoD" but thousand time powerless. As i was about to stop it, Jamie Lee credit appeared, then her mother (for those who don't know, Janet Leigh) and i gave a try. Unfortunately, things didn't get better and i was particularly annoyed by the sound editing: either it was the radio playing, either it was a ringing soundtrack! The natural location are pretty beautiful but those ghost pirates in the fog was just ridiculous! If the movie escape "1" for my rating, it's just because the movie is a precursor. Released in 1980, i'm sure it was innovative in a lot of ways: the slasher movie, the creepy movie. So, it has everything that is actually well known as well for Carpenter himself than for others (see the King's "mist", for example). But, if the style is here, the movie is however not a recommendation and has the value of an old scrapbook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the centennial of a horrific incident, the rocky coastal town of Antonio Bay, CA is threatened by a deadly fog. Top-billed Adrienne Barbeau (as Stevie Wayne) plays a sexy DJ with a vulnerable son at home. She advises listeners, "Stay away from the fog!" and directs them to an old church on Beacon Hill, for safety. Only a few of the film's many characters make it there, where they join priestly alcoholic Hal Holbrook (as Father Malone). Hero and heroine roles are assumed by truck driver Tom Atkins (as Nick Castle) and his pick-up Jamie Lee Curtis (as Elizabeth Solley). "Are you weird?" she asks...Horror suspense veteran (of "Psycho), and real-life mother of Ms. Curtis (with Tony), Janet Leigh (as Kathy Williams) makes a notable appearance. Sounding like John McGiver with a touch of Charles Laughton's phrasing, actor John Houseman introduces the film, and then he disappears below your screen. This story is not based on James Herbert's "The Fog" (a 1975 novel popular at the time), unfortunately. John Carpenter's "The Fog" features good direction and great location photography from Dean Cundey. This one's story and characters keep too much distance from the viewer and each other.***** The Fog (2/1/80) John Carpenter ~ Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Hal Holbrook, Janet Leigh</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the coastal town of Antonio Bay prepares to celebrate its centenary, a mysterious bank of fog rolls in from the sea, bringing with it the vengeful ghosts of a leper colony murdered by the townsfolk's ancestors precisely one hundred years before.The first film from director John Carpenter following his mega-success with Halloween, The Fog is a slick, highly atmospheric supernatural tale loaded with expertly timed scares; but even though he delivers the requisite thrills and chills, Carpenter fails to match the level of perfection that he achieved with his seminal '78 slasher, with a script that raises one or two awkward questions and some great performers wasted in unmemorable roles (Jamie Lee does virtually nothing and Adrienne Barbeau's lack of interaction with the other cast members makes it feel like there are two separate films running alongside each other).Carpenter's regular DoP, Dean Cundey, provides the film with some decent visuals (his shots of the remote windswept coastline add immensely to the film's overall eeriness), the brooding synth score works well with the movie's measured pacing, and there are some fun references to other horror classics, but after the sheer brilliance of JC's previous work, one can't help but feel just a tad disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog begins with its most compelling scene. An old sailor is telling a ghost story to a bunch of youngsters around a campfire. While listening, I felt like one of the kids, being equally intrigued myself (as intended by Carpenter of course). Unfortunately, that scene is the only part of the film which is well told or presented.A coastal California town is about to celebrate the day of its hundredth anniversary. One hundred years ago, a clipper ship with gold aboard, was entering the bay when a fog came in, The ship hit the rocks and sand because the settlers on lands faked a lighthouse light. The gold was stolen, and used to build the town. Tonight, on the hundredth anniversary, the town is about to take a trip down memory lane, and the only one who is aware of what is in store is the preacher. Perhaps it was impressive at the time, (as was Halloween) but The Fog struck me as a lacking motion picture. The problem lies not so much in the size and shape of the picture which are fine as are the special effects. The problem is the writing. The story is a good one but the execution is poor. The Fog becomes a shallow, superficial flick with a large handful of nobody characters. The only one who delivers a performance that you actually remember is Donald Pleasance. Like Halloween it isn't terribly suspenseful either. At times it felt so stagnant and dull that I almost lost interest. John Carpenter is a skilled horror filmmaker, and although I consider myself a fan, I think he has an equal number of treasure films and trash ones. This one is certainly not trash, but it in today's realm of horror, it is far from satisfactory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with most movies today is that they just don't know when to end. That's why each of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movies are such ordeals to sit through - they are practically 3 hour each! THE FOG has the opposite problem - it's at least 10 minutes too short! Structurally the film is very sound and the acting is good. Carpenter's direction is straight-forward and builds up a dark, tense atmosphere, aided immeasurably by Dean Cundey's photography and Carptenter's soundtrack. The villains of the piece, the silhouetted zombie ghost sailors, are quite effective and scary in their all-but-too-few-and-far-between appearances. I also have to give a shout out to the fog effects themselves, which mostly seem to be optically added to the film in post production but are overall quite convincing and impressive. If there was more of it, this would be a great film.The problem is that the film is too lean. Carpenter trimmed a lot of the fat off his previous projects HALLOWEEN and ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 and was left with solid films with just enough action and suspense to make them great (if a little short). Here he goes a little too far and things are simplified down to the point where the horror of the film really suffers.*SPOILERS* For instance - the zombies kill half their victims in one really quick scene toward the beginning (3 hapless deck hands on a boat). It's then revealed pretty soon after that "6 SHALL DIE", but anyone with any grade school math education will pretty quickly realize "wait a minute, that means we're only going to get 3 more murders this film! That's it??!? The remaining murders are all pretty random, gore-free, and silly - with the zombies requiring the victims to cooperate by opening the door the zombies are knocking on in order to be murdered. It's effective, but at the same time pretty stupid.The climactic finale in the church is especially disappointing. The zombies start besieging the place Night of the Living Dead style but Carpenter just seems to be out of steam and not know how to stage it realistically. So instead of focusing on the conflict, he just centers the attention on the priest as he digs up a gold crucifix, goes in another room, and suddenly all the zombies are magically there! What a disappointment. The final "sting" right before the credits is more comical than scary. There's just no build-up or reason.Just randomness passing itself off as horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classy, spooky ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1978 horror film 'Halloween' was an unexpected success. It did so well that it was known as the most profitable indie film at the time, and rightfully so. Had it not been for it's great success, we might not have this follow-up that, although not as strong as John Carpenter and Debra Hill's first collaboration, is a great film in it's own right.Pros: The campfire story opening scene really sets the mood. Breathtaking cinematography and coastal locations. John Carpenter composes another chilling, electrifying score. Excellent performances from the ensemble cast. Instead of really overdoing it with flashy effects, the makes of the film put the emphasis on mood and subtlety when it comes to the terror. Some good chills. The bad guys make the Boogey Man look about as scary as an old sock.Cons: It's not made clear who the protagonist is because we go back and forth with the characters. The characters seem to accept what's going on a little too easily. The cliffhanger is cheap, but on the bright side it does leave the door open for a sequel that I'd personally like to see.Final thoughts: I remember seeing this movie when I was younger and not liking it all that much. Several years later I saw it, this time on widescreen DVD, and realized what a treat it really is. It's not the masterpiece that 'Halloween' is, but it deserves a place in the horror hall of fame none-the-less.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>quite the *atmospheric* horror movie Carpenter has here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog reminded me of the old Nickelodeon show that was on when I was younger, Are You Afraid of the Dark, as the show's main conceit was that every single episode was devoted to telling a single story of the supernatural and bizarre, all around a campfire. John Carpenter's film starts off just the same way, as Donald Pleasance tells the story of a fog that rolls into a seaside village that also brings with it vengeful un-dead who kill anyone in their path. But aside from Carpenter's subtle ingenuity with the old campfire-story trick (Andy, the child character, hears this ghost story and then gets to actually live it), his film is one of his most accomplished with the very powerful usage of atmospheric cinema. Cause, really, what would fog be otherwise but just pure atmosphere? Yet he exploits the horror not in a very violent way like in the Thing, but in a manner meant to bring the chill factor very high by tricks that SHOULD be easier to see. Not in a Carpenter film though, at least not in his prime, as a further subversion of stuff compiled from old 50s B horror and sci-fi flicks, and, speaking of old Nick shows, TV serials.It's not just the fog itself, which is of course the given component to making this story work (there is enough to have tingles running down your spine anytime it starts coming round a bend), that marks Carpenter's film as unique technical-wise. He also makes it such a rich film in composition terms, with his and Dean Cundey's knack for attaining such visuals a mark of quality that a lesser director wouldn't of gone for (such as the shots of the sea itself, or in matching the presence of the fog itself by where the camera is in relation to the action in a scene, really using a widescreen lens to the maximum). As usual, too, Carpenter adds on the music as an essential element to the mix, where the thumping on the doors by the un-dead ghosts seem to mark right in time with the musical cues. The Fog actually comes out as one of Carpenter's best directed films- one of the best directed of 1980 in fact (which is saying something), and where everything gets timed so well for moments of dread and mood (a body may fall out of somewhere, though after a previous "gasp" moment, or for a goof Halbrook appearing out of thin air in the church) and , and it always seems pretty seamless.If maybe it's not a great supernatural movie, it's probably because Carpenter has a much more dedicated interest as director and storyteller as opposed to the story and characters themselves. There's nothing ever too moronic about the characters- aside from the usual little "I could see that coming" moments where logic is purposefully put to the wayside- or the story even, but like other horror films of the period (or of course today) things seem to happen kind of suddenly, like how Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins's characters get together following a hitchhiking pick-up late at night. Or even the whole basis for Father Robert Malone (Halbrook), who could've actually been cast just a little better with maybe a more nuttier performance, albeit with good dead-pan expressions by Halbrook, and with the circumstances surrounding the 1880 betrayal and whole lineage of Blake only just slightly enough to make due for what the story requires (which are, to be sure, easy contrivances and MacGuffins).But it is a story worth telling, and the principal leading lady of the film, played by Adrienne Barbeau, is a worthy role to have as someone who actually has a character arc- involving the radio. And I'm sure that years from now, the Fog will come on TV late one night, and I'll watch even more attentively, and feel the same jumping feelings that one gets during an appropriately manipulative horror movie- or ghost story rather- that one feels even heavier as a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this movie has a good idea, it's very predictable. Don't watch if you're looking for a suspense movie, only if you're looking for an average horror movie. It's also a bit repetitive. The same thing over and over until the end. In someone else's hands this could've been a great movie, unfortunately it wasn't.The special effects were pretty good, I have to admit. This movie CAN scare someone who scares easily, most most likely it'll just creep you out.It's definitely not on my favorite movies list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All horror films are, at some level, necessarily daft; but often, they include wholly unnecessary silliness, and this film is no exception: it turns on the discovery, in a local church, of a previously unnoticed solid gold cross about two feet across! But director John Carpenter is a master of making surprisingly gripping tales from limited ingredients, as he showed most notably in 'Assault on Precint 13', and it's amazing how much spookiness he can find in a little bit of fog. Yet the film is unbalanced, the beginning is character-led, the middle quite menacing, the ending both ridiculous and tame. Very watchable, but maybe not wholly deserving of its cult status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ehhh. Decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long time since I've seen this movie, so I won't comment on it too specifically, but I feel I've gotta say something now that it's being discussed a bit more. Simply put, this movie is passable, and certainly not one of Carpenter's better efforts. In their eternal rage over the recent popularity of remakes, some people like to imagine that whatever original is a classic. This one isn't. It wants to be atmospheric, but it's mostly just uneventful, and endless shots of fog banks aren't especially fascinating, and the bland characters yakking it up aren't terribly remarkable either. The ghost-sailor-zombies are pretty neat, but they don't actually do all that much that we get to see. I don't remember much of anything about the characters at this point, so they must not have been very fascinating, though I do recall being irritated by Jamie Lee Curtis, as per usual. Again, this film is passably interesting, but Carpenter just can't quite generate enough atmosphere to make up for the fact that nothing is actually going on. And though the fog looks pretty nice most of the time, the cinematography is generally pretty bland. (There is one major exception in the form of an excellent shot of a number of ghosts standing in the church, but that's about it.) And, the opening attack on the ship at the beginning is pretty well done, nicely transferring Carpenter's slasher skills to a new genre. But, the film is a whole is just kinda blah. Not quite boring, but far from engrossing, and it has a fairly anti-climactic ending.Frankly, this movie is a perfect candidate for remake. Good concept, passable execution. I find it utterly hilarious that people are whining about how this material was 'watered down' for the remake. Hah! This movie isn't gory at all, as in it doesn't have ANY gore in it. We see a few blades and hooks poke at a shirt. That's about it. The remake is actually substantially more graphic than the original, and there is no way in hell that this version would be rated R is it had been released this year. (Well, I won't go quite that far. The MPAA might give anything any rating at any time, but they'd have to be far more confused than usual to place an R on this again.) Apparently some people failed to notice that modern rating standards are a helluva lot more lax than they used to be. Hell, 'The Fog' was less graphic than some PG movies even at the time. 'Jaws', for example, is far more graphic than this, and that came out like 7 years before this. I think they use the, ahem, f-word like once in this movie, which may well be the real reason for the R.Most people are gonna tell you, 'Don't see that crappy remake, see this amazing, innovative original!!!' Well, I dunno if you really need to see either of them, particularly if you're not a huge horror fan. Just go watch 'The Thing' again, or perhaps check out Carpenter's under-appreciated 'In the Mouth of Madness'. BUT If you're a non-discriminating horror junkie like me, you might as well see them both. Though, you definitely shouldn't see the remake until you've seen the original. It just isn't proper...</fullReview>

'Jaws', for example, is far more graphic than this, and that came out like 7 years before this. I think they use the, ahem, f-word like once in this movie, which may well be the real reason for the R.On paper this should not have happened. Besides Carpenter, who was coming off well-received efforts like "Assault on Precinct 13" and "Halloween" there is an impressive cast of actors which actually reunites a good bit of the original "Halloween" crew. Besides Carptenter and Jamie Lee Curtis, there is also the girl who played Annie (Michael's first on screen victim), as well as the guy who played the Sheriff in both H and H-2. Replacing the ubiquitous Donald Pleasance is Hal Halbrook, and the venerable John Houseman makes an appearance in the film's opening as a creepy, storytellin' sea captain. Even Janet Leigh is involved, as the bitchy yet rather likable wife of a Fog victim. Ironically, tis is part of the film's problem, and it has many.First off, there are far too many characters. The film is cluttered with them and for some reason Carpenter disobeyed the standard horror movie order of whittling them down as the film progresses. Most of the victims are throwaways in no way integral to the plot, and nearly everybody introduced at the beginning is still walking around at the end. We needed more killings, not less.Second, the performances. This movie has good actors, but the dialogue is at best inconsistent and at worst embarrassingly stupid. The worst of it is ladeled onto Adrienne Barbeau, who gets to repeat idiocies like, "My son is trapped! Trapped by the fog!" and "Look out, into the darkness....and beware of the fog!" Third, the villain(s). Carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere at the beginning of the film, but he never delivers on it: there is no real payoff. This is because he couldn't seem to decide whether it was the fog itself or what was IN the fog was the actual "baddie" of the film. The result is that no one antagonist ever really emerges. "The Fog" might as well be a run o' the mill flood - faceless and impersonal.The movie does have its moments -- the creepy opening, the moments of atmospheric horror at sea, and the excellent cinematography, which is used to particular effect on the creepy fog-dwellers. But in the end these fail to outweigh the movie's many flaws.As of today, I still regard Carptenter as the most wildly inconsistent director out there. On the one hand he gave us P-13, Halloween, Escape from New York, and The Thing, all classics (cult or otherwise). On the other hand he also gave us crap like Prince of Darkness and the unwatchable Ghosts of Mars. In between there are the fun but flawed outings like They Live and In the Mouth of Madness. I would like to say that The Fog falls in this last category.</fullReview>

I'd say this movie is just a notch above fair. What we have is a interesting story in an interesting setting. I was sold until the murders started to occur. And then the ending... Not too much good can be said about the closing of this movie. **Spoilers**Why is it Carpenter chose to not show any murders? Why is it the "evil" in The Fog is only there to get stupid gold? It is disappointing when I watch a horror movie and it turns out to be very much like one of my child's Disney fairy tales.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointing effort from John Carpenter. Many of the expected trademarks are there--creeping Steadicam, delicious lighting, jittery score, and an ensemble of familiar Carpenter players--but it all remains curiously unfocused; we keep waiting for things to come together, but they never really do. Part of the problem might be the supernatural subject matter; in `Halloween' and `The Thing' Carpenter inserted a serial killer and an alien, respectively, into a haunted-house equation, but when he's dealing with actual ghosts he doesn't seem to know how to make them scary. Oh, sure, there are effective moments (the sudden car alarms, the `Rime of the Ancient Mariner' scene), but even these are a bit creaky, and more important they seem oddly removed from the big picture. Actually, there isn't much of a big picture to begin with--what do these dead sailors come back for, exactly? They seem to choose their victims more or less at random, and the `surprise' ending is more of a head-scratcher than anything else. The cast members all go at it pretty gamely, with Janet Leigh standing out as the kind of imperious councilwoman anybody from a small town will recognize. But the Carpenter/Hill script is unformed at best, and frequently irritating. The whole production (for once) suffers from its cheapness, too--for heaven's sake, where are all the people at the town `celebration'? Why does Adrienne Barbeau's supposedly popular radio station only play Muzak? Well, because they couldn't afford to do it any other way, of course. Perhaps the strangest thing about `The Fog' is that it remains watchable, even with all its shortcomings; horror fans are likely to appreciate it well enough, but it's far from classic, and anybody else should probably skip it. 5.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done from Carpenter. With it's spooky setting and hidden fear!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter is a master of fear and terror he always loved to cause fear and fright by the creepy shadows and strange music of his films. And that's exactly what he does here with this 1980 classic "The Fog" proving it's what you often don't see that's the scariest. Set in an oceanside California island type town on the Pacific coast the tale has history as exactly 100 years earlier a ship had wrecked at sea and as had been passed down thru generation tales it is believed that the sea is haunted with their dead like ghost corpses. All thru out the film it's carried along greatly by the local radio DJ Stevie Wayne(Adrienne Barbeau)as the whole film is carried thru the night as the mist, terror, and deadly fog ghost corpses start to roll to land and away from sea. The film provides fun and frightful scenes of suspense and unease as always Carpenter knows how to time fear so well combined with the creepy theme music. It's also rounded out well with the cast not just Barbeau but top notch character actors and actresses here include Jamie Lee Curtis and her legendary mother Janet Leigh, Tom Atkins, and Hal Holbrook and John even has a small cameo himself. Really a well done spooky atmosphere horror film that works well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still mediocre after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters in John Carpenter's post-"Halloween" outing, "The Fog," defy the bounds of logic and common sense with such disturbing regularity that one can't help but guffaw at their eventual fates. I say, if you're dumb enough to answer the door when when a spooky, glowing, supernatural-looking fog surrounds you on all sides, you DESERVE that impalement. While the Poe-inspired story of "The Fog" is intriguing, and there are some atmospheric jump-scares, the excellent cast (including Carpenter familiars Nancy Loomis, Charles Cyphers, Tom Atkins, Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis; plus screen veterans Hal Holbrook, John Houseman, and Janet Leigh) is in service to some of the most blandly-written stock characters in film history; this would be less of a problem if Carpenter made us jump with more regularity, but he doesn't. The director's craft for building suspense (as evidenced in the overrated "Halloween") is curiously absent here--I kept thinking all the elements were in place for a scary good time, but not once did I feel a sense of consequential, tangible fear. Like the titular phenomenon, "The Fog" should have been a swallow-you-whole terror ride instead of the flat, indifferent production it wound up being. (Seasoned horror vets will notice references to Howard Hawks' "The Thing," plus several genre character-name homages during the closing credits.)</fullReview>

It mostly relies on scares you can't see.rather than visuals. I never really sensed any fear from the leads and no one seemed to even really question the possibility of what was even happening. It just was busy as usual to them. LOL As I mentioned the three main female leads seemed like they were all sedated most of the film and if that wasn't bad enough they pranced around dressed like lumberjacks. For me this was one of the more forgettable John Carpenter films. His film The Thing made two years later more than made up for it though. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audiences Are Getting More and More Stupid By the Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A detective investigates a series of murders by drowning, while at the same time questioning his own possible involvement. Like his last movie ("Creepshow"), John Carpenter focuses mostly on the concept of memory. This time, however, the consequences that lie behind the motive for the killings reach far beyond the primary characters. The horror sequences themselves are nicely done and incorporate a variety of techniques. The pacing is glacial but there's more than enough here to satisfy.Reading some of the negative reviews here only confirms that audiences are getting more and more stupid by the day. No doubt this is due to the endless flooding of Hollywood movies (if you really want to call them "movies") that are made for brainless halfwits who have completely abandoned their cerebral skills in favor of special effects and potty humor. That said, one can only shrug their shoulders at the mass of confusion expressed by some of the reviewers here who claim that this film "doesn't make a lick of sense." Allow me to explain.START OF SPOILERS The woman in red is behind every killing that occurs. The murders that the detective is investigating were committed by people, but the woman in red influenced them to kill because they experienced the same rejection that she experienced ? they are not an integral part of the future of their loved ones. The detective is the only one who is forgiven, but the rest of the world must die, because she was abandoned by all. Therefore, her influence over the human murderers was simply a foreshadowing of the apocalyptic fog that would later befall the entirety of humanity.END OF SPOILERS There are more specifics to the story, of course, but the synopsis above is rather simplistic and shouldn't be all that difficult to understand. Then again, if someone feeds their brain with dim-witted tripe like "Friday the 13th" and "Hostel" all the time, it's possible that their movie IQ has degraded to such an extent that even the slightest bit of indirect communication by a filmmaker will go unnoticed. For those of us who don't need (or simply don't want) everything spelled out in BIG RED LETTERS, "The Fog" offers a bit of interest.The rest of you Hollywood fanboys may as well not even bother with stuff like this. Just go and watch "Freddy vs. Jason" or "Alien vs. Predator" a few hundred more times until your brain turns into a quivering mound of jello.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John forgot to do was inject a story of some semblance and weight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, The movie begins with John Houseman telling a campfire story to a group of kids. His tale is of a ship known as the Elizabeth Dane that shipwrecked in the town of Antonio Bay 100 years earlier. Apparently, there were lepers aboard and they were lured away by the townsfolk, causing them to crash the ship among some rocks. This was not enough for the townsfolk - they stole all the gold on board. Now it is 100 years later and something wicked this way comes. An illuminated fog bank moves in to the town that causes glass breakage, car alarms to go off, gas stations to malfunction, TV sets to turn on by themselves - in short, hysteria has moved in to the town. Nothing is explained and the next day, life moves on. Only the night before, the local priest (Hal Holbrook) finds his grandfather's journal behind a broken rock formation in his church! A local worker (Tom Atkins) picks up a wandering girl (Jamie Lee Curtis) and suddenly their car windows break! And the local deejay (Adrienne Barbeau), who works at a radio station in the lighthouse, stars seeing a fog bank settling in and then disappearing! Her son finds a coin that turns into a wooden block with a written warning! I was definitely compelled by the first half-hour of "The Fog." But then it is all much ado about nothing. We discover there are ghosts that travel by fog and they were the lepers that were killed a century earlier. Their purpose is to kill the descendants of the town's founding fathers, the ones who stole the gold, yet they randomly kill unrelated citizens of Antonio Bay. And most of the movie centers on that endlessly glowing, rolling fog bank, and watching people prepare for the inevitable. And we get to hear Jamie Lee Curtis scream once, thanks to one of the oldest clichs in the book - a corpse toppling over from nowhere! There are the customary unseen loud knocks on wooden doors! And we get endless scenes of Adrienne Barbeau staring out into the horizon from her lighthouse, watching the fog getting closer and closer. Boo! And Janet Leigh is on hand as the mayor of the town, along with cast members from Carpenter's "Halloween" such as Nancy Loomis as Leigh's secretary/aide and Charles Cyphers as a lonely meteorologist. These actors flow in and out of the narrative without a registering an ounce of personality. Looks to me like everyone is in a foggy state of mind.Following the coattails of "Halloween," writer-director John Carpenter delivered an atmospheric ghost story called "The Fog." What he forgot to do was inject a story of some semblance and weight. It is a ghost story all right, largely transparent."The Fog" has all the hallmarks for a frightening ghost story, but none of the soul or the spirit. I barely cared about any of the paper-thin characters, and when Jamie Lee Curtis can't even keep me awake in a John Carpenter film, you know you're in trouble.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you kidding me? This movie was so bad I couldn't even make fun of how bad it was, and I'm like a professional when it comes to making fun of bad movies. It is not suspenseful nor is it scary. We figured out within the first 15 minutes of the movie who was going to live and who was going to die. Here's the basic plot: Pirate Ghost Zombie guys knock on people's doors (just because they're evil pirate ghombies doesn't mean they're rude enough to break down a door), wait for someone to answer, and then kill them with a hook (because all pirates have hooks instead of hands). You never really got to see the Ghombies up close, except for a split second here and there. And the times I did get to see what they looked like, it looked like they were wearing Halloween costumes. It was like some people sat around and decided to come up with the absolute worst horror movie idea, got the worst script writer, director, etc. and then made what I can honestly say is so bad that I actually apologized to my husband for renting it.One particular scene worth mentioning is when an old woman babysitting a radio DJ's son gets a knock on the door. She senses something evil is outside the door (I think because she hears the Dj screaming they're in danger over the radio), so she yells for the boy to run upstairs. Then she flings the door wide open and for some reason, turns around so her back is toward the open door, and just stands there for a few moments. Because what could possibly happen? I mean if I feared some evil creature was outside and then heard a knock on the door, the first thing I'd do is go open it and then turn my back. The ghombie was probably thinking, "Hey, could you at least make this a little bit of a challenge? You know, like try to run away and let us chase you...something?" For fans of this movie, it's okay if you personally liked it, but at least have the decency to NOT recommend it to others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching The Fog (I fall asleep at least 3 times during the movie so I had to re-watch) and it's bad!!! Well, it's not as bad as some other B movies but still, the movie is pretty damn bad! I rant the DVD and 1st, the sound is awful, so it don't help the movie. The cast, not bad but the direction of their characters is weak, there's not much character developpment which make this movie horrible. Plus, the fog, it's so weak, when it comes, its like a bad horror movie, you are not scared and they look like a serial killer... It's not just bad, i can tell you that the score is good and also the visual &amp; special effects, I won't say it's all bad because it's not! I'm not impressing by this Carpenter at all!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to know you're in for a bad movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1) the name above the title: Carpenter made one legit, scary hit and then his name moved above the title as an ego-stroking, marketing ploy. It turned out that he was on a downward trend from Halloween and the value of his name in a movies title became negligible. He has been happy to be a fanboy trafficking in familiar horror imagery and scenarios without adding much, committed to motifs that date his movies before they are even out.2) has-beens: Hal Holbrook plays the fallen priest we had all come to know from the Exorcist etc. Janet Leigh (!)and Houseman are slumming here.3) designed horror: Perhaps more time was spent on designing the high-concept glowing red eyes of the pirates (which can only elicit the reaction "neat!") than producing an actual scare in this movie.4) dumb psychology: How can a child be so dumb that he doesn't realize the person tearing his bedroom door to pieces with a meat hook is not his elderly baby sitter? etc.5) horror clichs - the car that won't start - the child in peril - the wronged spirit that can't rest... All sense is abandoned getting these elements into a movie.6) The horror movie is a limp, dead genre. It has subdivided into "scary movies," and "thrillers." No one talks of "horror" movies anymore, because we haven't been horrified by a monster in decades. (only "Alien" comes to mind).This movie is a limp artifact ready for dispatch in a time capsule.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give it a two only because it made me laugh a bit. Especially when the priest got whacked by the demon people, but that's not the point. This movie was as good as rotten beef. It's about stupid looking lepers who sink in the 1800s and come back for revenge and gold, making the assumption that dead people care about shiny metal. It's carried out so badly that you can't possibly take it seriously, but, if you get drunk and sit down with a bag of pot you might be able to find some humor in it but other than that, don't waste your time, unless it's free. It only gets the two because it's humorous while it failed to do what it was supposed to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't believe it....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe they did a remake of this turkey. It was one of the few movies I ever walked out on. It was so bad that a teenager couldn't even be distracted by making out with his date in the back row through it.Totally awful plot. How can you suspend disbelief when you can't get a clue about what is going on until you want to scream at the stupidity of the plot.Not worth seeing, that is for sure.Now, why are ten lines required to say a movie is a turkey? It can be said in three lines. No plot Hokey SFX Wooden acting</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm your DJ, Stevie Wayne, and the fog is rolling in..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wide-eyed nonsense about a mass of murderous fog that rolls into seaside town to extract revenge on an ages-old comeuppance. Tired and juvenile antics failed to add new dimensions to the slasher-flick cycle in the early 1980's. Performances range from tolerable(Jamie Lee Curtis), to quizzical(Jamie Lee's real-life mother, Janet Leigh)to downright awful(Adrienne Barbeau as "your DJ, Stevie Wayne..."). Indifferently-made, slowly-paced, often laughable and witless, not to mention unscary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Clunky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another example of one of those low-budget horror films made by a generation of directors who started in the late '60s and early '70s (John Carpenter here, but also Tobe Hooper, George Romero, Wes Craven, Dario Argento, among the more popular) who make wonderfully atmospheric and spooky movies without the slightest bit of ability to construct a believable sequence of events. Dialogue and acting are also of a very low caliber (even Janet Leigh in this case does poorly).The "jump" moments seemed artificially tacked on and stand out too clunkily without adequate attempt to weave them into the actual story (a recurring problem with this genre). Still, the film is what it is and it's passable entertainment if you're looking for this kind of thing. I for one like Carpenter's film scores, as simple as they are; they're effective for low-budget horror. Numerous shots stand out for their evocative compositions.The fog to me seems to be a nice metaphor for the Reagan years sweeping in at the beginning of the 1980s (this film was released theatrically in Feb. 1980, no doubt right about when the election season was kicking off). Of course I have no idea of Carpenter's politics and he couldn't have known that Conservatism would destroy America over the next 32 years, but hindsight works its wonders. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From composer, writer and directer John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York, The Thing, Starman), I recognised this film for the concept, and the fact it was remade unsuccessfully, I had to see how the original faired. Basically Antonio Bay, a small Californian town, is having events from 100 years ago returning, involving a shipwreck and the deaths of several lepers. The crew of the ship, the Elizabeth Dane, disappeared when a blinding fog rolled in, and they obviously dyed going the wrong direction, and their ghosts are back. Father Robert Malone (Hal Holbrook) finds the journal that reveals all these past events, and soon enough the fog closes in on the town, and all inhabitants and visitors, including Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau), Elizabeth Solley (Jamie Lee Curtis), Kathy Williams (Janet Leigh, Jamie Lee's mother), Nick Castle (Tom Atkins) and Sandy Fadel (Halloween's Nancy Kyes/Loomis), must try and survive their fate from the ghost pirate's/fog's revenge. Also starring John Houseman as Mr. Machen, Charles Cyphers as Dan O'Bannon, John F. Goff as Al Williams, Ty Mitchell as Andy, George 'Buck' Flower as Tommy Wallace, Jim Jacobus as Mayor, John Vick as Sheriff Simms and Darwin Joston as Dr. Phibes. I should say the most thrills occur in what is the second half of the film, the first is really chatty and not too interesting. As soon as the fog closes on the town, expect some moderate thrills, a little blood and subtle suspense, so while it isn't very scary, it isn't a terrible horror film. Worth watching!</fullReview>
